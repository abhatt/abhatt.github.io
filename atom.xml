<b>The quest towards quantum computational supremacy</b><br/>
<br/>
September saw some huge news in the area of quantum computing, with rumours that the Google AI Lab has achieved a milestone known as 'quantum computational supremacy', also termed 'quantum supremacy' or 'quantum advantage' by some authors. Today, we examine what this term means, the most promising approach towards achieving this milestone, and the best complexity-theoretic evidence we have so far against classical simulability of quantum mechanics. We will not be commenting on details of the purported paper since there is no official announcement or claim from the authors so far.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What it means</b><br/>
<br/>
First off, the field of quantum computational supremacy arose from trying to formally understand the differences in the power of classical and quantum computers. A complexity theorist would view this goal as trying to give evidence to separate the complexity classes BPP and BQP. However, it turns out that one can gain more traction from considering the sampling analogues of these classes, SampBPP and SampBQP.  These are classes of distributions that can be efficiently sampled on classical and quantum computers, respectively. Given a quantum circuit U on n qubits, one may define an associated probability distribution over 2^n outcomes as follows: apply U to the fiducial initial state |000...0&gt; and measure the resulting state in the computational basis. This produces a distribution D_U.<br/>
<br/>
A suitable way to define the task of simulating the quantum circuit is as follows<b style="font-style: italic;">:</b><br/>
<br/>
Input: Description of a quantum circuit U acting on n qubits.<br/>
<br/>
Output: A sample from the probability distribution D_U obtained by measuring U|000...0&gt; in the computational basis.<br/>
<br/>
One of the early works in this field was that of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205133">Terhal and DiVincenzo</a>, which first considered the complexity of sampling from a distribution (weak simulation) as opposed to that of calculating the exact probability of a certain outcome (strong simulation). Weak simulation is arguably the more natural notion of simulating a quantum system, since in general, we cannot feasibly compute the probability of a certain outcome even if we can simulate the quantum circuit. Subsequent works by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">Aaronson and Arkhipov</a>, and by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1407">Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd</a> established that if there is a classically efficient weak simulator for different classes of quantum circuits, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So far, we have only considered the question of exactly sampling from the distribution D_U. However, any realistic experiment is necessarily noisy, and a more natural problem is to sample from a distribution that is not exactly D_U but from any distribution D_O that is ε-close in a suitable distance measure, say the variation distance.<br/>
<br/>
The aforementioned work by Aaronson and Arkhipov was the first to consider this problem, and they made progress towards showing that a special class of quantum circuits (linear optical circuits) is classically hard to approximately simulate in the sense above. The task of sampling from the output of linear optical circuits is known as boson sampling. At the   time, it was the best available way to show that quantum computers  may solve some problems that are far beyond the reach of classical computers.<br/>
<br/>
Even granting that the PH doesn't collapse, one still needs to make an additional conjecture to establish that boson sampling is not classically simulable.  The conjecture is that additively approximating the output probabilities of a random linear optical quantum circuit is #P-hard.  The reason this may be true is that output probabilities of random linear optical quantum circuits are Permanents of a Gaussian random matrix, and the Permanent is as hard to compute on a random matrix as it is on a worst-case matrix. Therefore, the only missing link is to go from average-case hardness of exact computation to average-case hardness of an additive estimation. In addition, if we make a second conjecture known as the "anti-concentration" conjecture, we can show that this additive estimation is non-trivial: it suffices to give us a good multiplicative estimation with high probability.<br/>
<br/>
So that's what quantum computational supremacy is about: we have a computational task that is efficiently solvable with quantum computers, but which would collapse the polynomial hierarchy if done by a classical computer (assuming certain other conjectures are true). One may substitute "collapse of the polynomial hierarchy" with stronger conjectures and incur a corresponding tradeoff in the likelihood of the conjecture being true.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Random circuit sampling</b><br/>
<br/>
In 2016,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00263"> Boixo et al</a>. proposed to replace the class of quantum circuits for which some hardness results were known (commuting circuits and boson sampling) by random circuits of sufficient depth on a 2D grid of qubits having nearest-neighbour interactions. Concretely, the proposed experiment would be to apply random unitaries from a specified set on n qubits arranged on a 2D grid for sufficient depth, and then sample from the resulting distribution. The two-qubit unitaries in the set are restricted to act between nearest neighbours, respecting the geometric This task is called random circuit sampling (RCS).<br/>
<br/>
At the time, the level of evidence for the hardness of this scheme was not yet the same as the linear optical scheme. However, given the theoretical and experimental interest in the idea of demonstrating a quantum speedup over classical computers, subsequent works by<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04402"> Bouland, Fefferman, Nirkhe and Vazirani</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06957">Harrow and Mehraban</a> bridged this gap (the relevant work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Aaronson and Chen</a> will be discussed in the following section). Harrow and Mehraban proved anticoncentration for random circuits. In particular, they showed that a 2-dimensional grid of n qubits achieve anticoncentration in depth O(\sqrt{n}), improving upon earlier results with higher depth due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0692">Brandao, Harrow and Horodeck</a>i. Bouland et al. proved the same supporting evidence for RCS as that for boson sampling, namely a worst-to-average-case reduction for exactly computing most output probabilities, even without the permanent structure possessed by linear optical quantum circuits.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Verification</b><br/>
<br/>
So far, we have not discussed the elephant in the room: of verifying that the output distribution supported on 2^n outcomes. It turns out that there are concrete lower bounds such as those due to Valiant and Valiant, showing that verifying whether an empirical distribution is close to a target distribution is impossible if one has few samples.<br/>
<br/>
Boixo et al. proposed a way of certifying the fidelity of the purported simulation. Their key observation was to note that if their experimental system is well modelled by a noise model called global depolarising noise, estimating the output fidelity is possible with relatively few outcomes. Under global depolarising noise with fidelity f, the noisy distribution takes the form D_N = f D_U + (1-f) I, where I is the uniform distribution over the 2^n outcomes. Together with another empirical observation about the statistics of output probabilities of the ideal distribution D_U, they argued that computing the following cross-entropy score would serve as a good estimator of the fidelity:<br/>
<br/>
f ~ H(I, D_U) - H(D_exp, D_U), where H(D_A,D_B) is the cross-entropy between the two distributions: H(D_A, D_B) = -\sum_i p_A log (p_B).<br/>
<br/>
The proposal here was to experimentally collect several samples from D_exp, classically compute using brute-force the probabilities of these outcomes in the distribution D_U, and estimate the cross-entropy using this information. If the test outputs a high score for a computation on sufficiently many qubits and depth, the claim is that quantum supremacy has been achieved.<br/>
<br/>
Aaronson and Chen gave alternative form of evidence for the hardness of scoring well on a test that aims to certify quantum supremacy similar to the manner above. This sidesteps the issue of whether a test similar to the one above does indeed certify the fidelity. The specific problem considered was "Heavy Output Generation" (HOG), the problem of outputting strings that have higher than median probability in the output distribution. Aaronson and Chen linked the hardness of HOG to a closely related problem called "QUATH", and conjectured that QUATH is hard for classical computers.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Open questions</b><br/>
<br/>
Assuming the Google team has performed the impressive feat of both running the experiment outlined before and classically computing the probabilities of the relevant outcomes to see a high score on their cross-entropy test, I discuss the remaining positions a skeptic might take regarding the claim about quantum supremacy.<br/>
<br/>
"The current evidence of classical hardness of random circuit sampling is not sufficient to conclude that the task is hard". Assuming that the skeptic believes that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse, a remaining possibility is that there is no worst-to-average-case reduction for the problem of *approximating* most output probabilities, which kills the proof technique of Aaronson and Arkhipov to show hardness of approximate sampling.<br/>
<br/>
"The cross-entropy proposal does not certify the fidelity." Boixo et al. gave numerical evidence and other arguments for this statement, based on the observation that the noise is of the global depolarising form. A skeptic may argue that the assumption of global depolarising noise is a strong one.<br/>
<br/>
"The QUATH problem is not classically hard." In order to give evidence for the hardness of QUATH, Aaronson and Chen examined the best existing algorithms for this problem and also gave a new algorithm that nevertheless do not solve QUATH with the required parameters.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if the community could work towards strengthening the evidence we already have for this task to be hard, either phrased as a sampling experiment or together with the verification test.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I think this is an exciting time for quantum computing and to witness this landmark event. It may not be the first probe of an experiment that is "hard" to classically simulate, since there are many quantum experiments that are beyond the reach of current classical simulations, but the inherent programmability and control present in the experimental system is what enables the tools of complexity theory to be applied to the problem. A thought that fascinates me is the idea that we may be exploring quantum mechanics in a regime never probed this carefully before, the "high complexity regime" of quantum mechanics. One imagines there are important lessons in physics here.<br/>

<p>Consider an experiment aimed for establishing quantum supremacy: your quantum computer produced a sample <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_i"/> which is a 0-1 string of length <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> from a certain distribution <img alt="D_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_i"/>. The research assumption is that <img alt="D_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_i"/>  is close enough to a fixed distribution <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/> (<img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/> accounts for the computing process and the noise) which is very hard to be demonstrated on a classical computer. By looking at a large number of samples you can perform a statistical test on the samples to verify that they were (approximately) sampled from <img alt="D" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D"/>, or at least that they were sampled from a probability distribution that is very hard to be computed on a classical computer!</p>
<p>But, is it possible that all the distributions <img alt="D_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_i"/>‘s are very different? Namely that each sample is taken from a completely different distribution? More formally, is it possible  that under a correct modeling of the device for two different samples <img alt="x_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_i"/> and <img alt="x_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x_j"/>, <img alt="D_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_i"/> has a very small correlation with <img alt="D_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="D_j"/>? In this case we say that the experiment outcomes are <strong>not robust</strong> and that the situation is <strong>chaotic</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of questions that I propose to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we test robustness?</li>
<li>Do the supremacy experiments require that the experiment is robust?</li>
<li>If, after many samples, you reach a probability distribution that require exponential time on a classical computer should you worry about the question whether the experiment is robust?</li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do the 10,000,000 samples for the Google 53-qubit experiment represent a robust sampling experiment?</span></li>
</ul>

    <title>Ultra-Wide Deep Nets and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>(Crossposted <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2019/10/03/ultra-wide-deep-nets-and-the-neural-tangent-kernel-ntk/">at CMU ML</a>.)</p>

<p>Traditional wisdom in machine learning holds that there is a careful trade-off between training error and generalization gap. There is a “sweet spot” for the model complexity such that the model (i) is big enough to achieve reasonably good training error, and (ii) is small enough so that the generalization gap - the difference between test error and training error - can be controlled. A smaller model would give a larger training error, while making the model bigger would result in a larger generalization gap, both leading to larger test errors. This is described by the classical U-shaped curve for the test error when the model complexity varies (see Figure 1(a)).</p>

<p>However, it is common nowadays to use highly complex over-parameterized models like deep neural networks. These models are usually trained to achieve near zero error on the training data, and yet they still have remarkable performance on test data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin et al. (2018)</a> characterized this phenomenon by a “double descent” curve which extends the classical U-shaped curve. It was observed that, as one increases the model complexity past the point where it can perfectly fits the training data (i.e., <em>interpolation</em> regime is reached), test error continues to drop! Interestingly, the best test error is often achieved by the largest model, which goes against the classical intuition about the “sweet spot.” The following figure from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin et al. (2018)</a> illustrates this phenomenon.</p>

</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Consequently one suspects that the training algorithms used in deep learning - (stochastic) gradient descent and its variants - somehow implicitly constrain the complexity of trained networks (i.e., “true number” of parameters), thus leading to a small generalization gap.</p>

<p>Since larger models often give better performance in practice, one may naturally wonder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does an infinitely wide net perform?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to this question corresponds to the right end of Figure 1(b). This blog post is about a model that has attracted a lot of attention in the past year:  deep learning in the regime where the width - namely, the number of channels in convolutional filters, or the number of neurons in fully-connected internal layers - goes to infinity. At first glance this approach may seem hopeless for both practitioners and theorists: all the computing power in the world is insufficient to train an infinite network, and theorists already have their hands full trying to figure out finite ones. But in math/physics there is a tradition of deriving insights into questions by studying them in the infinite limit, and indeed here too the infinite limit becomes easier for theory.</p>

<p>Experts may recall the connection between infinitely wide neural networks and kernel methods from 25 years ago by <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/pin.abstract.html">Neal (1994)</a> as well as the recent extensions by <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1EA-M-0Z">Lee et al. (2018)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11271">Matthews et al. (2018)</a>. These kernels correspond to infinitely wide deep networks whose all parameters are chosen randomly, and <em>only the top (classification) layer is trained</em> by gradient descent. Specifically, if $f(\theta,x)$ denotes the output of the network on input $x$ where $\theta$ denotes the parameters in the network, and $\mathcal{W}$ is an initialization distribution over $\theta$ (usually Gaussian with proper scaling), then the corresponding kernel is

where $x,x’$ are two inputs.</p>

<p>What about the more usual scenario when <em>all layers are trained</em>? Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07572.pdf">Jacot et al. (2018)</a> first observed that this is also related to a kernel named <em>neural tangent kernel (NTK)</em>, which has the form
</p>

<p>The key difference between the NTK and previously proposed kernels is that the NTK is defined through the inner product between the gradients of the network outputs with respect to the network parameters. This gradient arises from the use of the gradient descent algorithm. Roughly speaking, the following conclusion can be made for a sufficiently wide deep neural network trained by gradient descent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A properly randomly initialized <strong>sufficiently wide</strong> deep neural network <strong>trained by gradient descent</strong> with infinitesimal step size (a.k.a. gradient flow) is <strong>equivalent to a kernel regression predictor</strong> with a <strong>deterministic</strong> kernel called <em>neural tangent kernel (NTK)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was more or less established in the original paper of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07572.pdf">Jacot et al. (2018)</a>, but they required the width of every layer to go to infinity in a sequential order. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">our recent paper</a> with Sanjeev Arora, Zhiyuan Li, Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Ruosong Wang, we improve this result to the non-asymptotic setting where the width of every layer only needs to be greater than a certain finite threshold.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post we will first explain how NTK arises and the idea behind the proof of the equivalence between wide neural networks and NTKs. Then we will present experimental results showing how well infinitely wide neural networks perform in practice.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-neural-tangent-kernel-arise">How Does Neural Tangent Kernel Arise?</h2>

<p>Now we describe how training an ultra-wide fully-connected neural network leads to kernel regression with respect to the NTK. A more detailed treatment is given in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">our paper</a>. We first specify our setup. We consider the standard supervised learning setting, in which we are given $n$ training data points ${(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$ drawn from some underlying distribution and wish to find a function that given the input $x$ predicts the label $y$ well on the data distribution. We consider a fully-connected neural network defined by $f(\theta, x)$, where $\theta$ is the collection of all the parameters in the network and $x$ is the input. For simplicity we only consider neural network with a single output, i.e., $f(\theta, x) \in \mathbb{R}$, but the generalization to multiple outputs is straightforward.</p>

<p>We consider training the neural network by minimizing the quadratic loss over training data:

Gradient descent with infinitesimally small learning rate (a.k.a. gradient flow) is applied on this loss function $\ell(\theta)$:                                                                               
where $\theta(t)$ denotes the parameters at time $t$.</p>

<p>Let us define some useful notation. Denote $u_i = f(\theta, x_i)$, which is the network’s output on $x_i$. We let $u=(u_1, \ldots, u_n)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the collection of the network outputs on all training inputs. We use the time index $t$ for all variables that depend on time, e.g. $u_i(t), u(t)$, etc. With this notation the training objective can be conveniently written as $\ell(\theta) = \frac12 |u-y|_2^2$.</p>

<p>Using simple differentiation, one can obtain the dynamics of $u(t)$ as follows: (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">our paper</a> for a proof)​

where $H(t)$ is an $n\times n$ positive semidefinite matrix whose $(i, j)$-th entry is $\left\langle \frac{\partial f(\theta(t), x_i)}{\partial\theta}, \frac{\partial f(\theta(t), x_j)}{\partial\theta} \right\rangle$.</p>

<p>Note that $H(t)$ is the <em>kernel matrix</em> of the following (time-varying) kernel $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ evaluated on the training data:

In this kernel an input $x$ is mapped to a feature vector $\phi_t(x) = \frac{\partial f(\theta(t), x)}{\partial\theta}$ defined through the gradient of the network output with respect to the parameters at time $t$.</p>

<p>###The Large Width Limit</p>

<p>Up to this point we haven’t used the property that the neural network is very wide. The formula for the evolution of $u(t)$ is valid in general. In the large width limit, it turns out that the time-varying kernel $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is (with high probability) always close to a <em>deterministic</em> fixed kernel $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(\cdot,\cdot)$, which is the <strong>neural tangent kernel (NTK)</strong>. This property is proved in two steps, both requiring the large width assumption:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Convergence to the NTK at random initialization.</strong> Suppose that the network parameters at initialization ($t=0$), $\theta(0)$, are i.i.d. Gaussian. Then under proper scaling, for any pair of inputs $x, x’$, it can be shown that the random variable $ker_0(x,x’)$, which depends on the random initialization $\theta(0)$, converges in probability to the deterministic value $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x,x’)$, in the large width limit.</p>

    <p>(Technically speaking, there is a subtlety about how to define the large width limit. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07572.pdf">Jacot et al. (2018)</a> gave a proof for the sequential limit where the width of every layer goes to infinity one by one. Later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04760">Yang (2019)</a> considered a setting where all widths go to infinity at the same rate. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">Our paper</a> improves them to the non-asymptotic setting, where we only require all layer widths to be larger than a finite threshold, which is the weakest notion of limit.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Stability of the kernel during training.</strong> Furthermore, the kernel <em>barely changes</em> during training, i.e., $ker_t(x,x’) \approx ker_0(x,x’)$ for all $t$. The reason behind this is that the weights do not move much during training, namely $\frac{|\theta(t) - \theta(0)|}{|\theta(0)|} \to 0$ as width $\to\infty$. Intuitively, when the network is sufficiently wide, each individual weight only needs to move a tiny amount in order to have a non-negligible change in the network output. This turns out to be true when the network is trained by gradient descent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Combining the above two steps, we conclude that for any two inputs $x, x’$, with high probability we have

As we have seen, the dynamics of gradient descent is closely related to the time-varying kernel $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$. Now that we know that $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is essentially the same as the NTK, with a few more steps, we can eventually establish the equivalence between trained neural network and NTK: the final learned neural network at time $t=\infty$, denoted by $f_{\mathsf{NN}}(x) = f(\theta(\infty), x)$, is equivalent to the <em>kernel regression</em> solution with respect to the NTK. Namely, for any input $x$ we have

where $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x, X) = (ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x, x_1), \ldots, ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x, x_n))^\top \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(X, X) $ is an $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i, j)$-th entry is $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x_i, x_j)$.</p>

<p>(In order to not have a bias term in the kernel regression solution we also assume that the network output at initialization is small: $f(\theta(0), x)\approx0$; this can be ensured by e.g. scaling down the initialization magnitude by a large constant, or replicating a network with opposite signs on the top layer at initialization.)</p>

<h2 id="how-well-do-infinitely-wide-neural-networks-perform-in-practice">How Well Do Infinitely Wide Neural Networks Perform in Practice?</h2>

<p>Having established this equivalence, we can now address the question of how well infinitely wide neural networks perform in practice — we can just evaluate the kernel regression predictors using the NTKs! We test NTKs on a standard image classification dataset, CIFAR-10. Note that for image datasets, one needs to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve good performance. Therefore, we derive an extension of NTK, <em>convolutional neural tangent kernels (CNTKs)</em> and test their performance on CIFAR-10. In the table below, we report the classification accuracies of different CNNs and CNTKs:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/cntk_acc.jpeg" style="width: 700px;"/>
<br/>
</div>

<p>Here CNN-Vs are vanilla practically-wide CNNs (without pooling), and CNTK-Vs are their NTK counterparts. We also test CNNs with global average pooling (GAP), denotes above as CNN-GAPs, and their NTK counterparts, CNTK-GAPs. For all experiments, we turn off batch normalization, data augmentation, etc., and only use SGD to train CNNs (for CNTKs, we use the closed-form formula of kernel regression).</p>

<p>We find that CNTKs are actually very power kernels. The best kernel we find, 11-layer CNTK with GAP, achieves 77.43% classification accuracy on CIFAR-10. This results in a significant new benchmark for performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being 10% higher than methods reported by <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1g30j0qF7">Novak et al. (2019)</a>. The CNTKs also perform similarly to their CNN counterparts. This means that ultra-wide CNNs can achieve reasonable test performance on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to see that the global average pooling operation can significantly increase the classification accuracy for both CNNs and CNTKs. From this observation, we suspect that many techniques that improve the performance of neural networks are in some sense universal, i.e., these techniques might benefit kernel methods as well.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>

<p>Understanding the surprisingly good performance of over-parameterized deep neural networks is definitely a challenging theoretical question. Now, at least we have a better understanding of a class of ultra-wide neural networks: they are captured by neural tangent kernels! A hurdle that remains is that the classic generalization theory for kernels is still incapable of giving realistic bounds for generalization. But at least we now know that better understanding of kernels can lead to better understanding of deep nets.</p>

<p>Another fruitful direction is to “translate” different architectures/tricks of neural networks to kernels and to check their practical performance. We have found that global average pooling can significantly boost the performance of kernels, so we hope other tricks like batch normalization, dropout, max-pooling, etc. can also benefit kernels. Similarly, one can try to translate other architectures like recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, to kernels as well.</p>

<p>Our study also shows that there is a performance gap between infinitely wide networks and finite ones. How to explain this gap is an important theoretical question.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As someone who reads a significant number of court documents and decisions (I still do expert witness work), I can recommend for your reading pleasure the <a href="https://admissionscase.harvard.edu/files/adm-case/files/2019-10-30_dkt_672_findings_of_fact_and_conclusions_of_law.pdf">very recent decision on the Harvard admissions case</a>.  For those who want a sense of how Harvard admissions works, you will get a good summary of the information that came out during the trial.  For those who want to see a well-written court decision, in my opinion, this is a good example.  (Whether you agree with the decision or not, you should find the decision well written;  it lays out the issues and challenges in determining the decision clearly, and similarly explains the reasons for the ultimate conclusion clearly.)  And for those who care about the actual underlying issues of discrimination and affirmative action, I think the document provides a lot of food for thought, with a depth beyond what you'll see in the  news coverage. </div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Maybe I should hope that people <em>never</em> learn to distinguish for themselves which claimed breakthroughs in building new forms of computation are obviously serious, and which ones are obviously silly.  For as long as they don’t, this blog will always serve at least one purpose.  People will cite it, tweet it, invoke its “authority,” even while from my point of view, I’m offering nothing more intellectually special than my toddler does when he calls out “moo-moo cow! baa-baa sheep!” as we pass them on the road.</p>



<p>But that’s too pessimistic.  Sure, most readers <em>must</em> more-or-less already know what I’ll say about each thing: that <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Google’s quantum supremacy claim</a> is serious, that <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2212">memcomputing to solve NP-complete problems</a> is not, etc.  Even so, I’ve heard from many readers that this blog was at least helpful for double-checking their initial impressions, and for making <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">common knowledge</a> what before had merely been known to many.  I’m fine for it to continue serving those roles.</p>



<p>Last week, even as I dealt with fallout from Google’s quantum supremacy leak, I also got several people asking me to comment on a <em>Nature</em> paper entitled <a href="https://www-nature-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/articles/s41586-019-1557-9">Integer factorization using stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions</a> (warning: paywalled).  See also <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/poor-mans-qubit-can-solve-quantum-problems-without-going-quantum.html">here</a> for a university press release.</p>



<p>The authors report building a new kind of computer based on asynchronously updated “p-bits” (probabilistic bits).  A p-bit is “a robust, classical entity fluctuating in time between 0 and 1, which interacts with other p-bits … using principles inspired by neural networks.”  They build a device with 8 p-bits, and use it to factor integers up to 945.  They present this as another “unconventional computation scheme” alongside quantum computing, and as a “potentially scalable hardware approach to the difficult problems of optimization and sampling.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02742-x">commentary accompanying the </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02742-x">Nature</a></em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02742-x"> paper</a> goes much further still—claiming that the new factoring approach, “if improved, could threaten data encryption,” and that resources should now be diverted from quantum computing to this promising new idea, one with the advantages of requiring no refrigeration or maintenance of delicate entangled states.  (It should’ve added: and how big a number has Shor’s algorithm factored anyway, 21?  Compared to 945, that’s peanuts!)</p>



<p>Since I couldn’t figure out a gentler way to say this, here goes: it’s <strong>astounding</strong> that this paper and commentary made it into <em>Nature</em> in the form that they did.  Juxtaposing Google’s sampling achievement with p-bits, as several of my Facebook friends did last week, is juxtaposing the Wright brothers with some guy bouncing around on a pogo stick.</p>



<p>If you were looking forward to watching me dismantle the p-bit claims, I’m afraid you might be disappointed: the task is over almost the moment it begins.  <strong>“p-bit” devices can’t scalably outperform classical computers, for the simple reason that they <font color="red">are</font> classical computers.</strong>  A little unusual in their architecture, but still well-covered by the classical <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/bernays2.ppt">Extended Church-Turing Thesis</a>.  Just like with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation">quantum adiabatic algorithm</a>, an energy penalty is applied to coax the p-bits into running a local optimization algorithm: that is, making random local moves that preferentially decrease the number of violated constraints.  Except here, because the whole evolution is classical, there doesn’t seem to be even the <em>pretense</em> that anything is happening that a laptop with a random-number generator couldn’t straightforwardly simulate.  In terms of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/impeachment-trump-nixon.html">this editorial</a>, if adiabatic quantum computing is Richard Nixon—hiding its lack of observed speedups behind subtle arguments about tunneling and spectral gaps—then p-bit computing is Trump.</p>



<p>Even so, I wouldn’t be writing this post if you opened the paper and it immediately said, in effect, “look, <em>we know</em>.  You’re thinking that this is just yet another stochastic local optimization method, which could clearly be simulated efficiently on a conventional computer, thereby putting it into a different conceptual universe from quantum computing.  You’re thinking that factoring an n-bit integer will self-evidently take exp(n) time by this method, as compared to exp(n<sup>1/3</sup>) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve">Number Field Sieve</a>, and that no crypto is in even remote danger from this.  But here’s why you should still be interested in our p-bit model: because of other advantages X, Y, and Z.”  Alas, in vain one searches the whole paper, <em>and</em> the lengthy supplementary material, <em>and</em> the commentary, for any acknowledgment of the pachyderm in the pagoda.  Not an asymptotic runtime scaling in sight.  Quantum computing is there, but stripped of the theoretical framework that gives it its purpose.</p>



<p>That silence, in the pages of <em>Nature</em>—<em>that’s</em> the part that convinced me that, while on the negative side this blog seems to have accomplished nothing for the world in 14 years of existence, on the positive side it will likely have a role for decades to come.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> See a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342#comment-1820670">response in the comments</a>, which I appreciated, from Kerem Cansari (one of the authors of the paper), and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342#comment-1820674">my response to the response</a>.</p>



<p><strong>(Partly) Unrelated Announcement #1:</strong> My new postdoc, <a href="https://andrearocchetto.github.io/">Andrea Rocchetto</a>, had the neat idea of compiling a <a href="https://quantumfactsheet.github.io/">Quantum Computing Fact Sheet</a>: a quick “Cliffs Notes” for journalists, policymakers, and others looking to get the basics right.  The fact sheet might grow in the future, but in the meantime, check it out!  Or at a more popular level, try the <a href="https://quantumatlas.umd.edu/">Quantum Atlas</a> made by folks at the University of Maryland.</p>



<p><strong>Unrelated Announcement #2:</strong> Daniel Wichs asked me to give a shout-out to a new <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/">Conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography</a>, to be held June 17-19 in Boston.</p>

properties of edge-coloured graphs. A homomorphism from an edge-coloured graph
$G$ to an edge-coloured graph $H$ is a vertex-mapping from $G$ to $H$ that
preserves adjacencies and edge-colours. We consider the property of having a
homomorphism to a fixed edge-coloured graph $H$. Given an edge-coloured graph
$G$, can we perform $k$ graph operations so that the resulting graph has a
homomorphism to $H$? The operations we consider are vertex-deletion,
edge-deletion and switching (an operation that permutes the colours of the
edges incident to a given vertex). Switching plays an important role in the
theory of signed graphs, that are $2$-edge-coloured graphs whose colours are
$+$ and $-$. We denote the corresponding problems (parameterized by $k$) by
VERTEX DELETION $H$-COLOURING, EDGE DELETION $H$-COLOURING and SWITCHING
$H$-COLOURING. These generalise $H$-COLOURING (where one has to decide if an
input graph admits a homomorphism to $H$). Our main focus is when $H$ has order
at most $2$, a case that includes standard problems such as VERTEX COVER, ODD
CYCLE TRANSVERSAL and EDGE BIPARTIZATION. For such a graph $H$, we give a
P/NP-complete complexity dichotomy for all three studied problems. Then, we
address their parameterized complexity. We show that all VERTEX DELETION
$H$-COLOURING and EDGE DELETION $H$-COLOURING problems for such $H$ are FPT.
This is in contrast with the fact that already for some $H$ of order~$3$,
unless P=NP, none of the three considered problems is in XP. We show that the
situation is different for SWITCHING $H$-COLOURING: there are three
$2$-edge-coloured graphs $H$ of order $2$ for which this is W-hard, and
assuming the ETH, admits no algorithm in time $f(k)n^{o(k)}$ for inputs of size
$n$. For the other cases, SWITCHING $H$-COLOURING is FPT.

independently and uniformly at random. On arrival of a point, the problem is to
immediately and irrevocably color it in $\{+1,-1\}$ while ensuring that every
interval $[a,b] \subseteq [0,1]$ is nearly-balanced. We define
\emph{discrepancy} as the largest imbalance of any interval during the entire
process. If all the arriving points were known upfront then we can color them
alternately to achieve a discrepancy of $1$. What is the minimum possible
expected discrepancy when we color the points online?
</p>
<p>We show that the discrepancy of the above problem is sub-polynomial in $n$
and that no algorithm can achieve a constant discrepancy. This is a substantial
improvement over the trivial random coloring that only gets an
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt n)$ discrepancy. We then obtain similar results for a
natural generalization of this problem to $2$-dimensions where the points
arrive uniformly at random in a unit square. This generalization allows us to
improve recent results of Benade et al.\cite{BenadeKPP-EC18} for the online
envy minimization problem when the arrivals are stochastic.

i.e., bonds are cut-sets that determine cuts $[S,V\setminus S]$ of $G$ such
that $G[S]$ and $G[V\setminus S]$ are both connected. Given $s,t\in V(G)$, an
$st$-bond of $G$ is a bond whose removal disconnects $s$ and $t$. Contrasting
with the large number of studies related to maximum cuts, there are very few
results regarding the largest bond of general graphs. In this paper, we aim to
reduce this gap on the complexity of computing the largest bond and the largest
$st$-bond of a graph. Although cuts and bonds are similar, we remark that
computing the largest bond of a graph tends to be harder than computing its
maximum cut. We show that {\sc Largest Bond} remains NP-hard even for planar
bipartite graphs, and it does not admit a constant-factor approximation
algorithm, unless $P = NP$. We also show that {\sc Largest Bond} and {\sc
Largest $st$-Bond} on graphs of clique-width $w$ cannot be solved in time
$f(w)\times n^{o(w)}$ unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails, but they
can be solved in time $f(w)\times n^{O(w)}$. In addition, we show that both
problems are fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the size of the
solution, but they do not admit polynomial kernels unless NP $\subseteq$
coNP/poly.

(QBF) is a vivid research area in both theory and practice. In the field of
parameterized algorithmics, the well-studied graph measure treewidth turned out
to be a successful parameter. A well-known result by Chen in parameterized
complexity is that QSAT when parameterized by the treewidth of the primal graph
of the input formula together with the quantifier depth of the formula is
fixed-parameter tractable. More precisely, the runtime of such an algorithm is
polynomial in the formula size and exponential in the treewidth, where the
exponential function in the treewidth is a tower, whose height is the
quantifier depth. A natural question is whether one can significantly improve
these results and decrease the tower while assuming the Exponential Time
Hypothesis (ETH). In the last years, there has been a growing interest in the
quest of establishing lower bounds under ETH, showing mostly problem-specific
lower bounds up to the third level of the polynomial hierarchy. Still, an
important question is to settle this as general as possible and to cover the
whole polynomial hierarchy. In this work, we show lower bounds based on the ETH
for arbitrary QBFs parameterized by treewidth (and quantifier depth). More
formally, we establish lower bounds for QSAT and treewidth, namely, that under
ETH there cannot be an algorithm that solves QSAT of quantifier depth i in
runtime significantly better than i-fold exponential in the treewidth and
polynomial in the input size. In doing so, we provide a versatile reduction
technique to compress treewidth that encodes the essence of dynamic programming
on arbitrary tree decompositions. Further, we describe a general methodology
for a more fine-grained analysis of problems parameterized by treewidth that
are at higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy.

interactive proofs for search problems where a powerful prover can convince a
probabilistic polynomial time verifier that a solution to a search problem is
canonical. They studied search problems for which polynomial time algorithms
are not known and for which many solutions are possible. They showed that
whereas there exists a constant round pseudo deterministic proof for graph
isomorphism where the canonical solution is the lexicographically smallest
isomorphism, the existence of pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for
NP-hard problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we turn our attention to studying doubly-efficient
pseudo-deterministic proofs for polynomial time search problems:
pseudo-deterministic proofs with the extra requirement that the prover runtime
is polynomial and the verifier runtime to verify that a solution is canonical
is significantly lower than the complexity of finding any solution, canonical
or otherwise. Naturally this question is particularly interesting for search
problems for which a lower bound on its worst case complexity is known or has
been widely conjectured.
</p>
<p>We show doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic algorithms for a host of
natural problems whose complexity has long been conjectured. In particular:
</p>
<p>We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for linear programming
where the canonical solution which the prover will provide is the
lexicographically greatest optimal solution for the LP.

persistence barcodes. Inspired by the theory of diffeological spaces, the
proposed framework uses lifts to the space of ordered barcodes, from which
derivatives can be computed. The two derived notions of differentiability
(respectively from and to the space of barcodes) combine together naturally to
produce a chain rule that enables the use of gradient descent for objective
functions factoring through the space of barcodes. We illustrate the
versatility of this framework by showing how it can be used to analyze the
smoothness of various parametrized families of filtrations arising in
topological data analysis.

    <title>Sublinear Algorithms for Gap Edit Distance</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1570060800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Goldenberg:Elazar.html">Elazar Goldenberg</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Krauthgamer:Robert.html">Robert Krauthgamer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Saha:Barna.html">Barna Saha</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00901">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The edit distance is a way of quantifying how similar two strings are to one
another by counting the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and
substitutions required to transform one string into the other. A simple dynamic
programming computes the edit distance between two strings of length $n$ in
$O(n^2)$ time, and a more sophisticated algorithm runs in time $O(n+t^2)$ when
the edit distance is $t$ [Landau, Myers and Schmidt, SICOMP 1998]. In pursuit
of obtaining faster running time, the last couple of decades have seen a flurry
of research on approximating edit distance, including polylogarithmic
approximation in near-linear time [Andoni, Krauthgamer and Onak, FOCS 2010],
and a constant-factor approximation in subquadratic time [Chakrabarty, Das,
Goldenberg, Kouck\'y and Saks, FOCS 2018].
</p>
<p>We study sublinear-time algorithms for small edit distance, which was
investigated extensively because of its numerous applications. Our main result
is an algorithm for distinguishing whether the edit distance is at most $t$ or
at least $t^2$ (the quadratic gap problem) in time
$\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{t}+t^3)$. This time bound is sublinear roughly for all $t$
in $[\omega(1), o(n^{1/3})]$, which was not known before. The best previous
algorithms solve this problem in sublinear time only for $t=\omega(n^{1/3})$
[Andoni and Onak, STOC 2009].
</p>
<p>Our algorithm is based on a new approach that adaptively switches between
uniform sampling and reading contiguous blocks of the input strings. In
contrast, all previous algorithms choose which coordinates to query
non-adaptively. Moreover, it can be extended to solve the $t$ vs
$t^{2-\epsilon}$ gap problem in time $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{t^{1-\epsilon}}+t^3)$.

Vertex Set (SFVS) both ask for a vertex set of minimum total weight, that for
NMC disconnects a given set of terminals, and for SFVS intersects all cycles
containing a vertex of a given set. We design a meta-algorithm that will allow
to solve both problems in time $2^{O(rw^3)}\cdot n^{4}$,
$2^{O(q^2\log(q))}\cdot n^{4}$, and $n^{O(k^2)}$ where $rw$ is the rank-width,
$q$ the $\mathbb{Q}$-rank-width, and $k$ the mim-width of a given
decomposition. This answers in the affirmative an open question raised by
Jaffke et al. (Algorithmica, 2019) concerning an XP algorithm for SFVS
parameterized by mim-width.
</p>
<p>By a unified algorithm, this solves both problems in polynomial-time on the
following graph classes: Interval, Permutation, and Bi-Interval graphs,
Circular Arc and Circular Permutation graphs, Convex graphs, $k$-Trapezoid,
Circular $k$-Trapezoid, $k$-Polygon, Dilworth-$k$ and Co-$k$-Degenerate graphs
for fixed $k$, and on arbitrary powers of graphs in any of these classes. Prior
to our results, only SFVS was known to be tractable restricted only on Interval
and Permutation graphs, whereas all other results are new.

"greedy-like" algorithms. Motivated, in part, by the success of advice
complexity in the area of online algorithm, recently Borodin et al. have
extended the fixed priority model to include an advice tape oracle. They also
developed a reduction-based framework for proving lower bounds against this
rather powerful model. In this paper, we extend the advice tape model further
to the arguably more useful adaptive priority algorithms. We show how to modify
the reduction-based framework in order for it to apply against the more
powerful adaptive priority algorithms. In the process, we manage to simplify
the proof that the framework works, and we strengthen all the lower bounds by a
factor of 2. As a motivation of an adaptive priority model with advice, we
present a purely combinatorial adaptive priority algorithm with advice for the
minimum vertex cover problem on graphs of maximum degree 3. Our algorithm
achieves optimality and uses at most 15n/46 bits of advice. This advice is
provably shorter than what can be achieved by online algorithms with advice.

    <title>On the Hardness of Set Disjointness and Set Intersection with Bounded Universe</title>

from some universe $U$ is preprocessed in order to answer queries on the
emptiness of the intersection of some two query sets from the collection. In
the SetIntersection variant, all the elements in the intersection of the query
sets are required to be reported. These are two fundamental problems that were
considered in several papers from both the upper bound and lower bound
perspective.
</p>
<p>Several conditional lower bounds for these problems were proven for the
tradeoff between preprocessing and query time or the tradeoff between space and
query time. Moreover, there are several unconditional hardness results for
these problems in some specific computational models. The fundamental nature of
the SetDisjointness and SetIntersection problems makes them useful for proving
the conditional hardness of other problems from various areas. However, the
universe of the elements in the sets may be very large, which may cause the
reduction to some other problems to be inefficient and therefore it is not
useful for proving their conditional hardness.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove the conditional hardness of SetDisjointness and
SetIntersection with bounded universe. This conditional hardness is shown for
both the interplay between preprocessing and query time and the interplay
between space and query time. Moreover, we present several applications of
these new conditional lower bounds. These applications demonstrates the
strength of our new conditional lower bounds as they exploit the limited
universe size. We believe that this new framework of conditional lower bounds
with bounded universe can be useful for further significant applications.

problems in computer science with plenty of applications in data mining,
information retrieval and machine learning. Due to the necessity of clustering
of large datasets, several streaming algorithms have been developed for
different variants of clustering problems such as $k$-median and $k$-means
problems. However, despite the importance of the context, the current
understanding of balanced clustering (or more generally capacitated clustering)
in the streaming setting is very limited. The only previously known streaming
approximation algorithm for capacitated clustering requires three passes and
only handles insertions.
</p>
<p>In this work, we develop \emph{the first single pass streaming algorithm} for
a general class of clustering problems that includes capacitated $k$-median and
capacitated $k$-means in Euclidean space, using only poly$( k d \log \Delta)$
space, where $k$ is the number of clusters, $d$ is the dimension and $\Delta$
is the maximum relative range of a coordinate. (Note that $d\log \Delta$ is the
space required to represent one point.) This algorithm only violates the
capacity constraint by a $1+\epsilon$ factor. Interestingly, unlike the
previous algorithm, our algorithm handles both insertions and deletions of
points. To provide this result we define a decomposition of the space via some
curved half-spaces. We used this decomposition to design a strong coreset of
size poly$( k d \log \Delta)$ for balanced clustering. Then, we show that this
coreset is implementable in the streaming and distributed settings.

1930's and were first constructed from various forms of logic gates. Based on
the prime numbers, we introduce prime clocks and prime clock sums, where the
clocks utilize time and act as computational primitives instead of gates. The
prime clocks generate an infinite abelian group, where for each n, there is a
finite subgroup S such that for each Boolean function f : {0, 1}^n --&gt; {0, 1},
there exists a finite prime clock sum in S that can represent and compute f. A
parallelizable algorithm, implemented with a finite prime clock sum, is
provided that computes f. In contrast, the negation, conjunction, and
disjunction operations generate a Boolean algebra. In terms of computation,
Boolean circuits computed with logic gates NOT, AND, OR have a depth. This
means that a completely parallel computation of Boolean functions is not
possible with these gates. Overall, some new connections between number theory,
Boolean functions and computation are established.

randomized (O(n\log^2n)) time (O(\sqrt n))-approximation algorithm. Then, we
generalize our result to give a randomized $\alpha$-approximation algorithm for
any $\alpha\in [1, \sqrt{n}]$, running in time $\tilde{O}(n^2/\alpha^2)$. Both
algorithms are Monte Carlo and return approximately optimal solutions with high

deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in limited-resource
devices. Recent CNN architectures have proposed reduced complexity versions
(e.g. SuffleNet and MobileNet) but at the cost of modest decreases inaccuracy.
This paper proposes pSConv, a pre-defined sparse 2D kernel-based convolution,
which promises significant improvements in the trade-off between complexity and
accuracy for both CNN training and inference. To explore the potential of this
approach, we have experimented with two widely accepted datasets, CIFAR-10 and
Tiny ImageNet, in sparse variants of both the ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures.
Our approach shows a parameter count reduction of up to 4.24x with modest
degradation in classification accuracy relative to that of standard CNNs. Our
approach outperforms a popular variant of ShuffleNet using a variant of
ResNet18 with pSConv having 3x3 kernels with only four of nine elements not
fixed at zero. In particular, the parameter count is reduced by 1.7x for
CIFAR-10 and 2.29x for Tiny ImageNet with an increased accuracy of ~4%.

    <title>Retrieving Top Weighted Triangles in Graphs</title>

analysis tasks, and a number of methods have been developed for scaling
subgraph counting to large graphs. Many real-world networks carry a natural
notion of strength of connection between nodes, which are often modeled by a
weighted graph, but existing scalable graph algorithms for pattern mining are
designed for unweighted graphs. Here, we develop a suite of deterministic and
random sampling algorithms that enable the fast discovery of the 3-cliques
(triangles) with the largest weight in a graph, where weight is measured by a
generalized mean of a triangle's edges. For example, one of our proposed
algorithms can find the top-1000 weighted triangles of a weighted graph with
billions of edges in thirty seconds on a commodity server, which is orders of
magnitude faster than existing "fast" enumeration schemes. Our methods thus
open the door towards scalable pattern mining in weighted graphs.

input is an instance of $\mathcal{Q}$ and two feasible solutions $S$ and $T$.
The objective is to determine whether there exists a step-by-step
transformation between $S$ and $T$ such that all intermediate steps also
constitute feasible solutions. In this work, we study the parameterized
complexity of the \textsc{Connected Dominating Set Reconfiguration} problem
(\textsc{CDS-R)}. It was shown in previous work that the \textsc{Dominating Set
Reconfiguration} problem (\textsc{DS-R}) parameterized by $k$, the maximum
allowed size of a dominating set in a reconfiguration sequence, is
fixed-parameter tractable on all graphs that exclude a biclique $K_{d,d}$ as a
subgraph, for some constant $d \geq 1$. We show that the additional
connectivity constraint makes the problem much harder, namely, that
\textsc{CDS-R} is \textsf{W}$[1]$-hard parameterized by $k+\ell$, the maximum
allowed size of a dominating set plus the length of the reconfiguration
sequence, already on $5$-degenerate graphs. On the positive side, we show that
\textsc{CDS-R} parameterized by $k$ is fixed-parameter tractable, and in fact
admits a polynomial kernel on planar graphs.

    <title>TR19-133 |  More on $AC^0[\oplus]$ and Variants of the Majority Function | 

	Utkarsh Tripathi, 

	Nutan Limaye, 

	Srikanth Srinivasan</title>
    <summary>In this paper we prove two results about $AC^0[\oplus]$ circuits. 

We show that for $d(N) = o(\sqrt{\log N/\log \log N})$ and $N \leq s(N) \leq 2^{dN^{1/d^2}}$ there is an explicit family of functions $\{f_N:\{0,1\}^N\rightarrow \{0,1\}\}$ such that 
$f_N$ has uniform $AC^0$ formulas of depth $d$ and size at most $s$; 
$f_N$ does not have $AC^0[\oplus]$ formulas of depth $d$ and size $s^{\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a fixed absolute constant. 

This gives a quantitative improvement on the recent result of Limaye, Srinivasan, Sreenivasaiah, Tripathi, and Venkitesh, (STOC, 2019), which proved a similar Fixed-Depth Size-Hierarchy theorem but for $d \ll \log \log N$ and $s \ll \exp(N^{1/2^{\Omega(d)}})$. 

As in the previous result, we use the Coin Problem to prove our hierarchy theorem. Our main technical result is the construction of uniform size-optimal formulas for solving the coin problem with improved sample complexity $(1/\delta)^{d+4}$ (down from $(1/\delta)^{2^{O(d)}}$ in the previous result).

In our second result, we show that randomness buys depth in the $AC^0[\oplus]$ setting. Formally, we show that for any fixed constant $d\geq 2$, there is a family of Boolean functions that has polynomial-sized randomized uniform $AC^0$ circuits of depth $d$ but no polynomial-sized (deterministic) $AC^0[\oplus]$ circuits of depth $d$.

Previously Viola (Computational Complexity, 2014) showed that an increase in depth (by at least $2$) is essential to avoid superpolynomial blow-up while derandomizing randomized $AC^0$ circuits. We show that an increase in depth (by at least $1$) is essential even for $AC^0[\oplus]$. 

As in Viola's result, the separating examples are promise variants of the Majority function on $N$ inputs that accept inputs of weight at least $N/2 + N/(\log N)^{d-1}$ and reject inputs of weight at most $N/2 - N/(\log N)^{d-1}$.</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Divergent Evolution: The formation of new species when populations experience different selective pressures.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>While the canonical example is Darwin’s finches, it could apply as well to matching theorists! A notable feature of the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/market2019-1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/market2019-2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">second</a> workshops at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/market2019" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Simons Institute program on Matching Markets</a> was how researchers in Economics, Operations Research and TCS all share common antecedents (Fulkerson, Gale, Scarf, Shapley, Walras — to name but a few giants invoked regularly), and yet have taken the theory in  diverse directions. The workshops helped create a healthy dialogue between the communities, as everyone tries to understand each other’s objectives and techniques. </p>



<p>A more notable aspect of matching theory in recent years has been its  impact on the design of real-world marketplaces. Over the two workshops,  a mix of speakers from academia and industry covered a host of markets,  including <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-121" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">payment routing</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-127" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">online advertising</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-124" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">kidney exchange</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-128" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">real-estate</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-131" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">public housing</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/ridesharing-panel" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ride-sharing</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/driving-efficiencies-freight-industry" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">long-haul trucking</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/ratings-design-and-barriers-entry" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">restaurant reviews</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-129" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">school choice</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/unreasonable-effectiveness-artificial-currencies" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">food-banks</a> and many many others. A common theme that emerged was that online marketplaces, with the support of good algorithm and mechanism designers, are slowly taking over the economy.</p>



<p>And talking of giants of matching theory, another event held in parallel with the program was a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/richard-m-karp-distinguished-lecture-inaugural-lecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">celebration</a> of the achievements and contributions of Dick Karp, with Vijay Vazirani giving the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/rmklectures2019-fall-1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">inaugural lecture</a> of the Simons Institute Richard M. Karp Distinguished Lecture Series. Vijay’s talk touched on both the above themes, with a sweeping overview of three great threads in matching theory (stable matching, market equilibria, and online matching). He highlighted the critical role of algorithmic thinking in their development, and concluded with a tantalizing 40-year-old open problem connected to finding a polynomial-time algorithm for the Hylland-Zeckhauser market equilibrium. It is an excellent starting point for those interested in the program, or matching markets in general!</p></div>

    <title>Richard Guy is 103 years old today</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richard Guy is a mathematician. He co-authored the classic book <i>Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays </i> with Elywn Berlekamp and John Conway.<br/>
<br/>
On Sept 30 (today) he turned 102. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_centenarians_(scientists_and_mathematicians)">this list </a> he is the oldest living mathematician, and he would need to live to 110 to be the oldest mathematician ever. <br/>
<br/>
I have met him twice. He was at the Gathering for Gardner Conference as a young 98-year old. I told him that his book Winning Ways had a great influence on me. He asked it if was positive or negative. I later saw him at a Math conference where he went to my talk on The Muffin Problem. So he is still active.<br/>
<br/>
His Wikipedia site says that he says he regards himself as an Amateur Mathematician. While it is awkward to disagree with how someone sees himself, I'll point out that he is an author or co-author of 11 books, has many papers, and has solved Erdos Problems. He has taught some but I couldn't really find out what his source of income is or was. This takes us back to the word `amateur' which has several meanings:<br/>
<br/>
Amateur: Someone who does X for the love of X (Amor is Love in Spanish), and not for money. This could be true of Richard Guy. This notion of amateur may be lost on my younger readers since this it used to be a thing to NOT take money since it somehow soils what you do. In those days Olympic athletes could not have played professionally beforehand.  We can't imagine that now.<br/>
<br/>
Amateur: Someone who dabbles in something but is not really that good. This could NOT be true of Richard Guy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aside from games he has also worked in Number Theory. His book <i>Unsolved Problems in Number Theory </i> has inspired many (including me). <br/>
<br/>
So happy birthday Richard Guy!<br/>
<br/>
He is the also the oldest living person we have honored on this blog. Second oldest was Katherine Johnson, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/08/katherine-johnson-1918.html"/> who is still alive.</div>

    <title>TR19-132 |  Radio Network Coding Requires Logarithmic Overhead | 

	Raghuvansh Saxena, 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol</title>
    <summary>We consider the celebrated radio network model for abstracting communication in wireless networks. In this model, in any round, each node in the network may broadcast a message to all its neighbors. However, a node is able to hear a message broadcast by a neighbor only if no collision occurred, meaning that it was the only neighbor broadcasting. 


While the (noiseless) radio network model received a lot of attention over the last few decades, the effect of noise on radio networks is still not well understood. In this paper, we take a step forward and show that making radio network protocols resilient to noise may require a substantial performance overhead. Specifically, we  construct a multi-hop network and a communication protocol over this network that works in $T$ rounds when there is no noise. We prove that any scheme that simulates our protocol and is resilient to stochastic noise, requires $\Omega(T \log n)$ rounds. 

This stands in contrast to our previous result (STOC, 2018), showing that protocols over the single-hop (clique) network can be made noise resilient with only a constant overhead. Our result also settles a recent conjecture by Censor{-}Hillel, Haeupler, Hershkowitz, Zuzic (2018).

We complement the above result by giving a scheme to simulate any protocol with a fixed order of transmissions with only an $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ overhead.</summary>

<p>
Andrew Booker is a mathematician at the University of Bristol, who works in analytic number theory. For example he has a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00603.pdf">paper</a> extending a result of Alan Turing on the Riemann zeta function. Yes our Turing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I will talk about his successful search for a solution to a 64 year old problem.</p>
<p>
He was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wymmCdLdPvM&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> on the search problem authored by Tim Browning and Brady Haran. The question was to find a solution to 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  33 = x^{3} + y^{3} + z^{3}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+x%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+y%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+z%5E%7B3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  33 = x^{3} + y^{3} + z^{3}. "/></p>
<p>Booker <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04284.pdf">found</a> 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  33 = (8 866 128 975 287 528)^{3} - (8 778 405 442 862 239)^{3} - (2 736 111 468 807 040)^{3}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+%288+866+128+975+287+528%29%5E%7B3%7D+-+%288+778+405+442+862+239%29%5E%7B3%7D+-+%282+736+111+468+807+040%29%5E%7B3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  33 = (8 866 128 975 287 528)^{3} - (8 778 405 442 862 239)^{3} - (2 736 111 468 807 040)^{3}. "/></p>
<p>The search was for all possible solutions with <img alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y,z}"/> bounded by <img alt="{10^{16}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%5E%7B16%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{10^{16}}"/>. Note that this is expensive, and is not even close to polynomial time in the number of bits. But it is feasible today thanks to modern technology: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The total computation used was approximately <img alt="{23}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B23%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{23}"/> core-years over one month of real time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Before we turn to our discussion, note that Booker’s paper on extending Turing is really a result on proof checking. Turing had great intuition, terrible that we lost him so early. He, Turing, essentially proved the first result ever on how to efficiently check a computation. Booker says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Turing introduced a method for certifying the completeness of a purported list of zeros of <img alt="{Z(t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Z(t)}"/> that is guaranteed to work (when the list is in fact complete).

Booker and Sutherland also <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2216941-mathematicians-find-a-completely-new-way-to-write-the-number-3/">discovered</a> that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  569936821221962380720^3 - 569936821113563493509^3 - 472715493453327032^3 = 3.

"/></p>
<p>This is the next-largest solution after <img alt="{3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%3D+1%5E3+%2B+1%5E3+%2B+1%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3}"/> and <img alt="{3 = 4^3 + 4^3 + (-5)^3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%3D+4%5E3+%2B+4%5E3+%2B+%28-5%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3 = 4^3 + 4^3 + (-5)^3}"/>. Weird. And the first solution not to duplicate a number. And it uses two numbers that agree to markedly more decimal places than those in the above solutions for <img alt="{33}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{33}"/> and <img alt="{42}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{42}"/>. Weirder.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Smart Search </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Booker wanted to search for a solution to 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  k = x^{3} + y^{3} + z^{3}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++k+%3D+x%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+y%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+z%5E%7B3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  k = x^{3} + y^{3} + z^{3}. "/></p>
<p>Actually his main interest was in <img alt="{k=33}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k=33}"/>, but his method is general. How does one do this for <img alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y,z}"/> bounded by <img alt="{B = 10^{16}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB+%3D+10%5E%7B16%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B = 10^{16}}"/>. The obvious method is: Try all numbers below <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. </p>
<p>
This is too expensive and requires <img alt="{\widetilde{O}(B^{3})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28B%5E%7B3%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\widetilde{O}(B^{3})}"/> time. Too much, even with a cluster of fast processors.</p>
<p>
An improvement is to try all <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/> in the range and then check that <img alt="{k-x^{3}-y^{3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-x%5E%7B3%7D-y%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k-x^{3}-y^{3}}"/> is cube. This runs in <img alt="{\widetilde{O}(B^{2})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28B%5E%7B2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\widetilde{O}(B^{2})}"/> time. Still too much.</p>
<p>
A key insight is to re-write the equation as 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  k -z^{3} = x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++k+-z%5E%7B3%7D+%3D+x%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+y%5E%7B3%7D+%3D+%28x+%2B+y%29%28x%5E%7B2%7D+-+xy+%2B+y%5E%7B2%7D%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  k -z^{3} = x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}). "/></p>
<p>Then we note that <img alt="{x+y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x+y}"/> must be a divisor of <img alt="{k-z^{3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-z%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k-z^{3}}"/>. Since there are few such divisors, we can improve the time greatly. For the divisors <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> of <img alt="{k-z^{3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-z%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k-z^{3}}"/> some simple algebra and the quadratic formula shows that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x = \frac{d}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{4|k-z^{3}| - d^{3}}{6d}}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B4%7Ck-z%5E%7B3%7D%7C+-+d%5E%7B3%7D%7D%7B6d%7D%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  x = \frac{d}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{4|k-z^{3}| - d^{3}}{6d}}, "/></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y = \frac{d}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{4|k-z^{3}| - d^{3}}{3d}}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bd%7D%7B2%7D+-+%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7B4%7Ck-z%5E%7B3%7D%7C+-+d%5E%7B3%7D%7D%7B3d%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  y = \frac{d}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{4|k-z^{3}| - d^{3}}{3d}}. "/></p>
<p>This shows that the search is now reduced to <img alt="{\widetilde{O}(B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\widetilde{O}(B)}"/>. Still too much, but close to doable. The next trick is to avoid the factoring step. See Booker’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04284.pdf">paper</a> for the rest of the search description. </p>

    <title>TR19-131 |  A Simple Proof of Vyalyi&amp;#39;s Theorem and some Generalizations | 

	Lieuwe Vinkhuijzen, 

	André Deutz</title>
    <summary>In quantum computational complexity theory, the class QMA models the set of problems efficiently verifiable by a quantum computer the same way that NP models this for classical computation. Vyalyi proved that if $\text{QMA}=\text{PP}$ then $\text{PH}\subseteq \text{QMA}$. In this note, we give a simple, self-contained proof of the theorem, using only the closure properties of the complexity classes in the theorem statement. We then extend the theorem in two directions: (i) we strengthen the consequent, proving that if $\text{QMA}=\text{PP}$ then $\text{QMA}=\text{PH}^{\text{PP}}$, and (ii) we weaken the hypothesis, proving that if $\text{QMA}=\text{coQMA}$ then $\text{PH}\subseteq \text{QMA}$. Lastly, we show that all the above results hold, without loss of generality, for the class QAM instead of QMA. We also formulate a ``Quantum Toda's Conjecture''.</summary>

    <title>TR19-130 |  A moment ratio bound for polynomials and some extremal properties of Krawchouk polynomials and Hamming spheres | 

	Alex Samorodnitsky, 

	Naomi Kirshner</title>
    <summary>Let $p \ge 2$. We improve the bound $\frac{\|f\|_p}{\|f\|_2} \le (p-1)^{s/2}$ for a polynomial $f$ of degree $s$ on the boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$, which comes from hypercontractivity, replacing the right hand side of this inequality by an explicit bivariate function of $p$ and $s$, which is smaller than $(p-1)^{s/2}$ for any $p &gt; 2$ and $s &gt; 0$. We show the new bound to be tight, within a smaller order factor, for the Krawchouk polynomial of degree $s$.

This implies several nearly-extremal properties of Krawchouk polynomials and Hamming spheres (equivalently, Hamming balls). In particular, Krawchouk polynomials have (almost) the heaviest tails among all polynomials of the same degree and $\ell_2$ norm (this has to be interpreted with some care). The Hamming spheres have the following approximate edge-isoperimetric property: For all $1 \le s \le \frac{n}{2}$, and for all even distances $0 \le i \le \frac{2s(n-s)}{n}$, the Hamming sphere of radius $s$ contains, up to a multiplicative factor of $O(i)$, as many pairs of points at distance $i$ as possible, among sets of the same size (there is a similar, but slightly weaker and somewhat more complicated claim for general distances). This also implies that Hamming spheres are (almost) stablest with respect to noise among sets of the same size. In coding theory terms this means that a Hamming sphere (equivalently a Hamming ball) has the maximal probability of undetected error, among all binary codes of the same rate.

We also describe a family of hypercontractive inequalities for functions on $\{0,1\}^n$, which improve on the `usual' ``$q \rightarrow 2$" inequality by taking into account the concentration of a function (expressed as the ratio between its $\ell_r$ norms), and which are nearly tight for characteristic functions of Hamming spheres.</summary>

    <title>TR19-129 |  Fourier and Circulant Matrices are Not Rigid | 

	Zeev Dvir, 

	Allen Liu</title>
    <summary>The concept of matrix rigidity was first introduced by Valiant in [Val77].  Roughly speaking, a matrix is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly by changing a small number of entries.  There has been extensive interest in rigid matrices as Valiant showed  that rigidity can be used to prove arithmetic circuit lower bounds.  

In a surprising result, Alman and Williams showed that the (real valued) Hadamard matrix, which was conjectured  to be rigid, is actually not very rigid. This line of work was extended by [DE17] to a family of matrices related to the Hadamard matrix, but over finite fields.  In our work, we take another step in this direction and show that for any abelian group $G$ and function $f:G \rightarrow \mathbb C$, the matrix given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y \in G$ is not rigid.  In particular, we get that complex valued Fourier matrices, circulant matrices, and Toeplitz matrices are all not rigid and cannot be used to carry out Valiant's approach to proving circuit lower bounds. This complements a recent result of Goldreich and Tal  who showed that Toeplitz matrices are nontrivially rigid (but not enough for Valiant's method).  Our work differs  from previous non-rigidity results in that those works considered matrices whose underlying group of symmetries was of the form ${\mathbb F}_p^n$ with $p$ fixed and $n$ tending to infinity, while in the families  of matrices we study, the underlying group of symmetries can be any abelian group and, in particular,  the cyclic group ${\mathbb Z}_N$, which has very different structure. Our results also suggest natural new candidates for rigidity in the form of matrices whose symmetry groups are highly non-abelian. We are also able to extend these results to matrices with entries in a finite field, assuming sufficiently large dimension.

Our proof has four parts. The first extends the results of [AW16,DE17]  to generalized Hadamard matrices over the complex numbers via a new proof technique. The second part handles the $N \times N$ Fourier matrix when $N$ has a particularly nice factorization that allows us to embed smaller copies of (generalized) Hadamard matrices inside of it. The third part uses results from number theory to bootstrap the non-rigidity for these special values of $N$ and extend to all sufficiently large $N$.  The fourth and final part involves using the non-rigidity of the Fourier matrix to show that the group algebra matrix, given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y \in G$, is not rigid for any function $f$ and abelian group $G$.</summary>
