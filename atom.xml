    <title>TR22-031 |  Transparency Beyond VNP in the Monotone Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee, 

	Kshitij Gajjar, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Recently Hrubes and Yehudayoff (2021) showed a connection between the monotone algebraic circuit complexity of \emph{transparent} polynomials and a geometric complexity measure of their Newton polytope. They then used this connection to prove lower bounds against monotone VP (mVP). We extend their work by showing that their technique can be used to prove lower bounds against classes that are seemingly more powerful than monotone VNP (mVNP).
	
In the process, we define a natural monotone analogue of VPSPACE --- a well-studied class in the non-monotone setting (Poizat (2008), Koiran Perifel (2009), Malod (2011), Mahajan Rao (2013) --- and prove an exponential separation between the computational powers of this class and mVNP. 
	
To show this separation, we define a new polynomial family with an interesting combinatorial structure which we use heavily in our lower bound. Both the polynomial and the combinatorial nature of our proof might be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR22-029 |  Quantum Tanner codes | 

	Anthony Leverrier, 

	Gilles Zémor</title>
    <summary>Tanner codes are long error correcting codes obtained from short codes and a graph, with bits on the edges and parity-check constraints from the short codes enforced at the vertices of the graph. Combining good short codes together with a spectral expander graph yields the celebrated expander codes of Sipser and Spielman, which are asymptotically good classical LDPC codes.

In this work we apply this prescription to the left-right Cayley complex that lies at the heart of the recent construction of a $c^3$ locally testable code by Dinur et al. Specifically, we view this complex as two graphs that share the same set of edges. By defining a Tanner code on each of those graphs we obtain two classical codes that together define a quantum code. This construction can be seen as a simplified variant of the Panteleev and Kalachev asymptotically good quantum LDPC code, with improved estimates for its minimum distance. This quantum code is closely related to the Dinur et al. code in more than one sense: indeed, we prove a theorem that simultaneously gives a linearly growing minimum distance for the quantum code and recovers the local testability of the Dinur et al. code.</summary>

splits required to turn $G$ into a planar graph, where a vertex split removes a
vertex $v \in V$, introduces two new vertices $v_1, v_2$, and distributes the
edges formerly incident to $v$ among its two split copies $v_1, v_2$. The
splitting number problem is known to be NP-complete. In this paper we shift
focus to the splitting number of graph drawings in $\mathbb R^2$, where the new
vertices resulting from vertex splits can be re-embedded into the existing
drawing of the remaining graph. We first provide a non-uniform fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) algorithm for the splitting number problem (without drawings).
Then we show the NP-completeness of the splitting number problem for graph
drawings, even for its two subproblems of (1) selecting a minimum subset of
vertices to split and (2) for re-embedding a minimum number of copies of a
given set of vertices. For the latter problem we present an FPT algorithm
parameterized by the number of vertex splits. This algorithm reduces to a
bounded outerplanarity case and uses an intricate dynamic program on a
sphere-cut decomposition.

randomly-chosen large prime. In some cases, the quasi-cubic complexity of
selecting a random prime can dominate the total running time. We propose a new
variant of the classic D5 algorithm for "dynamic evaluation", applied to a
randomly-chosen (composite) integer. Unlike the D5 principle which has been
used in the past to compute over a direct product of fields, our method is
simpler as it only requires following a single path after any modulus splits.
The transformation we propose can apply to any algorithm in the algebraic RAM
model, even allowing randomization. The resulting transformed algorithm avoids
any primality tests and will, with constant positive probability, have the same
result as the original computation modulo a randomly-chosen prime. As an
application, we demonstrate how to compute the exact number of nonzero terms in
an unknown integer polynomial in quasi-linear time. We also show how the same
algorithmic transformation technique can be used for computing modulo random
irreducible polynomials over a finite field.

that quantifies how many optimal paths between pairs of other vertices visit v.
Computing betweenness centrality in a temporal graph, in which the edge set may
change over discrete timesteps, requires us to count temporal paths that are
optimal with respect to some criterion. For several natural notions of
optimality, including foremost or fastest temporal paths, this counting problem
reduces to #Temporal Path, the problem of counting all temporal paths between a
fixed pair of vertices; like the problems of counting foremost and fastest
temporal paths, #Temporal Path is #P-hard in general. Motivated by the many
applications of this intractable problem, we initiate a systematic study of the
prameterised and approximation complexity of #Temporal Path. We show that the
problem presumably does not admit an FPT-algorithm for the feedback vertex
number of the static underlying graph, and that it is hard to approximate in
general. On the positive side, we proved several exact and approximate
FPT-algorithms for special cases.

exists a partition of the edge set of $G$ into $q$ parts $E_1,E_2,E_3,\cdots,
E_q$ such that for all $i\in[1,q]$, $|E_i|=n_i$ and the graph induced on the
edge set $E_i$ is connected. Here we study both the problems for $q=2$ and
prove that $BCP_q$ for $q\geq 2$ is $W[1]$-hard. We also show that $BCP_2$ is
unlikely to have a polynomial kernel on the class of planar graphs. Coming to
the positive results, we show that $BCP_2$ is fixed parameter tractable (FPT)
parameterized by treewidth of the graph, which generalizes to FPT algorithm for
planar graphs. We design another FPT algorithm and a polynomial kernel on the
class of unit disk graphs parameterized by $\min(n_1,n_2)$. Finally, we prove
that unlike $BCP_2$, $BCEP_2$ is FPT parameterized by $\min(n_1,n_2)$.

    <title>Exact Matching in Graphs of Bounded Independence Number</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1645920000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Maalouly:Nicolas_El.html">Nicolas El Maalouly</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Steiner:Raphael.html">Raphael Steiner</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11988">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the \emph{Exact Matching Problem} (EM), we are given a graph equipped with
a fixed coloring of its edges with two colors (red and blue), as well as a
positive integer $k$. The task is then to decide whether the given graph
contains a perfect matching exactly $k$ of whose edges have color red. EM
generalizes several important algorithmic problems such as \emph{perfect
matching} and restricted minimum weight spanning tree problems.
</p>
<p>When introducing the problem in 1982, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis
conjectured EM to be \textbf{NP}-complete. Later however, Mulmuley et
al.~presented a randomized polynomial time algorithm for EM, which puts EM in
\textbf{RP}. Given that to decide whether or not \textbf{RP}$=$\textbf{P}
represents a big open challenge in complexity theory, this makes it unlikely
for EM to be \textbf{NP}-complete, and in fact indicates the possibility of a
\emph{deterministic} polynomial time algorithm. EM remains one of the few
natural combinatorial problems in \textbf{RP} which are not known to be
contained in \textbf{P}, making it an interesting instance for testing the
hypothesis \textbf{RP}$=$\textbf{P}.
</p>
<p>Despite EM being quite well-known, attempts to devise deterministic
polynomial algorithms have remained illusive during the last 40 years and
progress has been lacking even for very restrictive classes of input graphs. In
this paper we finally push the frontier of positive results forward by proving
that EM can be solved in deterministic polynomial time for input graphs of
bounded independence number, and for bipartite input graphs of bounded
bipartite independence number. This generalizes previous positive results for
complete (bipartite) graphs which were the only known results for EM on dense
graphs.

Tracking Shortest Paths requires deciding whether there exists a set of $k$
vertices $T\subseteq V$ such that for any two distinct shortest paths between
$s$ and $t$, say $P_1$ and $P_2$, we have $T\cap V(P_1)\neq T\cap V(P_2)$. In
this paper, we give the first polynomial size kernel for the problem.
Specifically we show the existence of a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ vertices
and edges in general graphs and a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k)$ vertices and
edges in planar graphs for the Tracking Paths in DAG problem. This problem
admits a polynomial parameter transformation to Tracking Shortest Paths, and
this implies a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^4)$ vertices and edges for Tracking
Shortest Paths in general graphs and a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^2)$ vertices
and edges in planar graphs. Based on the above we also give a single
exponential algorithm for Tracking Shortest Paths in planar graphs.

    <title>A PTAS for Packing Hypercubes into a Knapsack</title>

V. N. Sreenivas</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11902">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the d-dimensional hypercube knapsack problem where we are given a
set of d-dimensional hypercubes with associated profits, and a knapsack which
is a unit d-dimensional hypercube. The goal is to find an axis-aligned
non-overlapping packing of a subset of hypercubes such that the profit of the
packed hypercubes is maximized. For this problem, Harren (ICALP'06) gave an
algorithm with an approximation ratio of (1+1/2^d+epsilon). For d=2, Jansen and
Solis-Oba (IPCO'08) showed that the problem admits a polynomial-time
approximation scheme (PTAS); Heydrich and Wiese (SODA'17) further improved the
running time and gave an efficient polynomial-time approximation scheme
(EPTAS). Both the results use structural properties of 2-D packing, which do
not generalize to higher dimensions. For d&gt;2, it remains open to obtain a PTAS,
and in fact, there has been no improvement since Harren's result.
</p>
<p>We settle the problem by providing a PTAS. Our main technical contribution is
a structural lemma which shows that any packing of hypercubes can be converted
into another structured packing such that a high profitable subset of
hypercubes is packed into a constant number of special hypercuboids, called
V-Boxes and N-Boxes. As a side result, we give an almost optimal algorithm for
a variant of the strip packing problem in higher dimensions. This might have
applications for other multidimensional geometric packing problems.

given set of terminal vertices in a given graph, is a classic problem arising
in numerous practical applications. Many algorithms about this problem emerged
in the past decade, especially presented in the 11th DIMACS Challenge in 2014
and the 3rd PACE Competition in 2018. In this paper, we present a novel
partition-and-merge algorithm for effectively solving this NP-hard problem in
large graphs. The algorithm first breaks the input graph into small fragments
and then gradually builds up the graph in a level-by-level manner. Intuitively,
the method aggregates information that is found by local search at each level
into the final graph. We assess the algorithm on a wide range of benchmark
instances, showing that the algorithm outperforms the winners of DIMACS and
PACE challenges on large instances and competes favorably with them on small or
middle-sized instances.

colinear, (ii) given a matching, a flip sequence of length at most n(n-1)/2
always exists and (iii) the number of flips in any sequence never exceeds
(n(n-1)/2) (n+4)/6. Finally, we present (iv) a lower bounding flip sequence
with roughly 1.5 n(n-1)/2 flips, which disproves the conjecture that n(n-1)/2,

<p>
</p><p><b> 75 Years </b></p>
<p/><p>
I am 75 years old too. I do not have a committee for special events—maybe I should. I do recall what computers were in the beginning and what they have become now. I can only imagine what they might become in the next 75 years. I am thus quite interested in what the committee will do and how it might help celebrate the 75th anniversary. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
I started doing some research into the history of computers. I had the idea to look at old magazines that were monthly publications on all aspects of computers. Especially ones that were important in the early days: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datamation">Datamation</a> is one and another was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)">Byte</a>. The later opened in 1975 and closed in 2013. </p>

<p>
As of 2022, the domain for Byte redirects to an unrelated website selling <a href="https://www.byteme.com/pages/why-byte">teeth aligners</a>. That says something, no?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I just spent an hour giving Lily, my 9-year-old, a crash course on geopolitics, including WWII, the Cold War, the formation of NATO, Article 5, nuclear deterrence, economic sanctions, the breakup of the USSR, Ukraine, the Baltic Republics, and the prospects now for WWIII. Her comment at the end was that from now on she’s going to refer to Putin as “Poopin,” in the hope that that shames him into changing course.</p></div>

    <title>I will be on instagram/If you have two reals in a box- Answer (Guest Post by David Marcus)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I will be on instragram:</p><p>We,  Prof. Mohammad Hajiaghayi and Prof. William Gasarch plan to have an Instagram Live at @mhajiaghayi this SAT FEB 26, 1:30PM EDT (in English).</p><p> We talk about our lives as well as blogging, research, and how to inspire young minds. Please join if you can.</p><p>#PvsNP #blogging #youngminds #instagram</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------</p><p>This is the answer to the problem posted in the last post which was a guest post by David Marcus. This post is also a guest post by him. </p><p>We restate the problem:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>PICK THE LARGEST NUMBER:</p><p>There are two distinct reals in a box (how do they fit! aren't reals infinite!). They are called the first and second number. </p><p>You want to pick the larger one. You can pick one of the numbers at random and look at it</p><p>before deciding which one you want. </p><p>Is there a strategy that will win with probability &gt; 1/2.</p><p>CLARIFICATIONS:</p><p>1) We do not want a strategy that does well on average or in the long run. Even if the games is played just once, we want the probability of winning to be &gt; 1/2.</p><p>2) It must have prob of winning &gt; 1/2 for EVERY pair of reals.</p><p>3) Here is an example of a strategy that does NOT work: Pick the first number with prob 1/2. If its positive then keep it, else dump it. If the numbers are{1,2} this only works half the time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>There is a strategy. In fact, we give two.</p><p><br/></p><p>STRATEGY ONE</p><p>Before looking at any number, pick a number x on your own from the reals according to a distribution with full support (every open interval has prob greater than 0). Then pick a number from the box (prob 1/2-1/2), which we call y. If x&lt;y then keep y. If y\le x then take the other number.</p><p>If x is between the two numbers, then the strategy works. If not then the strategy does not hurt, so the prob in that case is 1/2. Hence you do better than 1/2. </p><p>STRATEGY TWO</p><p>Let f: R--&gt; (0,1) be strictly increasing. Pick a number from the box, call it y. Keep it with prob f(y).</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR22-028 |  The plane test is a local tester for  Multiplicity Codes | 

	Dan Karliner, 

	Amnon Ta-Shma, 

	Roie Salama</title>
    <summary>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of RS and RM codes where for each evaluation point we output the evaluation of a low-degree polynomial  and all of its directional derivatives up  to order $s$. Multi-variate multiplicity codes are locally decodable with the natural local decoding algorithm that reads values on a random line and corrects to the closest uni-variate multiplicity code. However, it was not known whether multiplicity codes are locally testable, and this question has been posed since the introduction of these codes with no progress up to date. In fact, it has been also open whether multiplicity codes can be characterized by local constraints, i.e., if there exists a subset $B$ such that $c$ is in the code iff $c \cdot z=0$ for any $z\in B$, and,
every $z \in B$ has small Hamming weight, i.e., few non-zero symbols.

We begin by giving a simple example showing the line test does not give local characterization when $d&gt;q$. Surprisingly, 
we then show the plane test is a local characterization when $s&lt;q$ and $d&lt;qs-1$ for prime $q$. 
In addition, we show the $k$-dimensional test is a local tester for multiplicity codes, when $s &lt; q$ and $k$ is at least $\lceil \frac{d+1}{q-1} \rceil$.
Combining the two results, we show that the plane test is a local tester for multiplicity codes, with constant rejection probability for constant $s$.

Our technique is new. We represent the given input as a possibly very high-degree polynomial,  and we show that for some choice of plane,  the restriction of the polynomial to the plane is a high-degree bi-variate polynomial. The argument has to work modulo the appropriate kernels, and for that we use Grobner theory, the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz theorem and its generalization to multiplicities. Even given that, the argument is delicate and requires choosing a non-standard monomial order for the argument to work.</summary>

    <title>TR22-027 |  New Near-Linear Time Decodable Codes Closer to the GV Bound | 

	Dean Doron, 

	Guy Blanc</title>
    <summary>We construct a family of binary codes of relative distance $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ and rate $\varepsilon^{2} \cdot 2^{-\log^{\alpha}(1/\varepsilon)}$ for $\alpha \approx \frac{1}{2}$ that are decodable, probabilistically, in near linear time. This improves upon the rate of the state-of-the-art near-linear time decoding near the GV bound due to Jeronimo, Srivastava, and Tulsiani, who gave a randomized decoding of Ta-Shma codes with $\alpha \approx \frac{5}{6}$ [T17,JST21].
Each code in our family can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time, or deterministic polynomial time given sufficiently good explicit $3$-uniform hypergraphs. 
     
Our construction is based on a new graph-based bias amplification method. While previous works start with some base code of relative distance $\frac{1}{2} \varepsilon_0$ for $\varepsilon_0 \gg \varepsilon$ and amplify the distance to $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$ by walking on an expander, or on a carefully tailored product of expanders, we walk over very sparse, highly mixing, hypergraphs. 
Study of such hypergraphs further offers an avenue toward achieving rate $\widetilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^2)$.
For our unique- and list-decoding algorithms, we employ the framework developed in [JST21].</summary>

    <link href="http://benjamin-recht.github.io/2022/02/23/standard-errors/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Let us never speak of these values again.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1493428796539772937">Twitter quiz</a> asked “what is a powerful concept from your field that, if more people understood it, their lives would be better?” Unambiguously, the answer from my field is statistical significance. Significance testing is a confusing, obscure statistical practice. It is hard to explain and usually impossible to justify. But papers can only be published if they are “statistically significant.” Here, I’ll explain in as plain terms as I can what statistical significance means in almost every published scientific study. I’ll do this without ever defining a p-value, as p-values have nothing to do with the way significance testing is used. Instead, significance testing amounts to hand wavy arguments about precision and variability. Laying it out this way shows why the authority granted to significance testing is so suspect and unearned.</p>

<p>Let’s suppose we’re trying to evaluate the benefit of some intervention. We test the intervention on a bunch of individuals and compute the average benefit which we call the effect size. The effect size could be the number of years of life a person gains with some cancer treatment or the amount of money gained with an investment strategy.</p>

<p>Since the effect size is the <em>average</em> of all the individuals in a study some individuals will have received less benefit than average and some more than average. Combining this varied benefit with the reality that experiments are always noisy and complicated, it may very well be that even if we measure a positive benefit on average, the intervention may actually be mostly harmful to the general population.</p>

<p>Think about the hypothetical situation where on half the population the benefit is equal to 1 and on the other half it’s negative 1. In this case, the average benefit is zero. If we collected a random set of people and computed the average effect size, we’d see a positive effect size about half of the time. In other words, if your experiment was “flip a coin ten times,” you’ll see 5 or more heads about half of the times you run this experiment.</p>

<p>The experimenter’s goal is to distinguish whether the benefit is large, small, or if the intervention is actually harmful. What the paradigm of statistical significance aims to do is to find a way to determine if an intervention is “mostly good.” It goes forth like this: using statistics, you estimate the standard error (SE) of the measured effect size. Roughly speaking, the standard error measures how spread out the effect size is over a population. When the standard error is small, everyone in the population experiences the same effect from a treatment. When the standard error is large, even if the effect size is positive, some may experience negative effects and some positive.</p>

<p>If the measured effect size is greater than twice the standard error, you declare that you have discovered your intervention is statistically significant at the “p&lt;0.05” level. If the effect size is bigger than 2.6 times the standard error you declare statistical significance at the
“p&lt;0.01” level. If effect size is even bigger than three times the standard error you declare statistical significance at the “p&lt;0.003” level! Wow! There’s a Nobel Prize in your future. But if the effect size is only 1.9 times bigger than the standard error, you unfortunately have not found a statistically significant result and have to throw all your work in the trash. Unless, of course, you are an economist. In this case, you are allowed the special “p&lt;0.1” level, which occurs when the effect size is 1.7 times the standard error.</p>

<p>The following figure, adapted from a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/TAH_Sci/status/1490701257769734145">Thomas House</a>, nicely illustrates the situation:</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="Only one of these droids is signficant" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/significant.png" width="100%"/></p>

<p>Here, there are four hypothetical distributions of benefit. All but (a) are “statistically significant.” The interventions we are always striving for are ones with clear benefit, like (d) in the bottom right. Interventions like this do exist: In the Pfizer trial, the effect size was 12 times larger than the standard error. Vaccines work! But most interventions are not vaccines (or parachutes for that matter).</p>

<p>The other panels show why statistical significance alone is so problematic. Figures (a) and (b) are nearly indistinguishable plots, but one is significant and the other is not. Moreover, statistical significance also misses the forest for the trees. You can have a miniscule effect size and still have a significant effect. Do we always prefer the (c) to the (a)? Is a meager, but mostly positive benefit necessarily better than a treatment potentially of large benefit to some but harmful to others necessarily? Wouldn’t it be in our interest to understand this spread of outcomes so we could isolate the group of individuals who benefit from the treatment?</p>

<p>The fact that a mere factor of 1.5 separates the difference between “not publishable” and “undoubtedly real” is deeply concerning. And every statistician knows how estimates of standard error can be <em>very</em> sensitive. Simple approximations can make the standard error appear 1.4 times smaller, which is enough to transform an insignificant result into a significant one. This is what is commonly known as “data dredging” or “p-hacking”: trying to find the appropriate set of assumptions under which your experiment has small standard error and is hence statistically significant.</p>

<p>The precise definitions of standard error and p-value don’t illuminate the situation. Since p-values lead you to pedantry and quibbling about tiny effects, their actual definition, which is complicated and hard to even explain to other statisticians, just confuses people and doesn’t fix science. Most practicing scientists would be better off not knowing what a p-value is.</p>

<p>And a lot of the other fixes also don’t help. For example, the <a href="https://clincalc.com/Stats/FragilityIndex.aspx">fragility index</a> is often used in medicine to describe how many “non-events” have to become events for the significance to vanish. But this is just a way to conflate sample size and p-values, and isn’t getting away from the core problem that statistical significance testing is a mass waste of time.</p>

<p>I am by no means the first person to complain about the absurdity of significance testing. Some examples from the last 50 years include <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.200.7648&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Meehl</a> (1978), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1803924">Leamer</a> (1983), <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/270939">Freedman</a> (1991), <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/308/6924/283">Altman</a> (1994), <a href="http://www.principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/writing/kennedy.pdf">Kennedy</a> (2002), <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">Ioannidis</a> (2005), <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/Instruments_of_Development.pdf">Deaton</a> (2009), <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/186351/cult_of_statistical_significance">Ziliak and McCloskey</a> (2008), and <a href="https://stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/asa_pvalues.pdf">Gelman</a> (2016). The significance testing framework is barely 100 years old. And people have been rightfully attacking it for nearly as long. Why do we remain so stuck?</p>

<p>The aforementioned list of grumpy people have a deeper criticism of contemporary science beyond significance testing, and this critique is one I hope to take up in future blogs. When can we trust scientific consensus and what structures and methods are necessary to build such consensus? One of the core questions is that of experimental validity. Statistical validity is a small part of the big picture that establishes the trustworthiness of a study. The study must be <em>construct valid</em>, measuring the right quantities. It must be <em>internally valid</em>, avoiding bias and confounding. And it must be <em>externally valid</em>, generalizable to other contexts. The next few blogs will try to unpack some thoughts on validity, and why validity and design remain the most pressing challenges in contemporary scientific inquiry.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-026 |  Trading Time and Space in Catalytic Branching Programs | 

	Ian Mertz, 

	James  Cook</title>
    <summary>An $m$-catalytic branching program (Girard, Koucky, McKenzie 2015) is a set of $m$ distinct branching programs for $f$ which are permitted to share internal (i.e. non-source non-sink) nodes. While originally introduced as a non-uniform analogue to catalytic space, this also gives a natural notion of amortized non-uniform space complexity for $f$, namely the smallest value $|G|/m$ for an $m$-catalytic branching program $G$ for $f$ (Potechin 2017).

Potechin (2017) showed that every function $f$ has amortized size $O(n)$, witnessed by an $m$-catalytic branching program where $m = 2^{2^n-1}$. We recreate this result by defining a catalytic algorithm for evaluating polynomials using a large amount of space but $O(n)$ time. This allows us to balance this with previously known algorithms which are efficient with respect to space at the cost of time (Cook, Mertz 2020, 2021). We show that for any $\epsilon \geq 2n^{-1}$, every function $f$ has an $m$-catalytic branching program of size $O_\epsilon(mn)$, where $m = 2^{2^{\epsilon n}}$. We similarly recreate an improved result due to Robere and Zuiddam (2021), and show that for $d \leq n$ and $\epsilon \geq 2d^{-1}$, the same result holds for $m = 2^{n \choose \leq \epsilon d}$ as long as $f$ is a degree-$d$ polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$. We also show that for certain classes of functions, $m$ can be reduced to $2^{poly(n)}$ while still maintaining linear or quasi-linear amortized size.

In the other direction, we bound the necessary length, and by extension the amortized size, of any permutation branching program for an arbitrary function between $3n$ and $4n-4$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-025 |  Efficient Low-Space Simulations From the Failure of the Weak Pigeonhole Principle | 

	Oliver Korten</title>
    <summary>A recurring challenge in the theory of pseudorandomness and circuit complexity is the explicit construction of ``incompressible strings,'' i.e. finite objects which lack a specific type of structure or simplicity. In most cases, there is an associated NP search problem which we call the ``compression problem,'' where we are given a candidate object and must either find a compressed/structured representation of it or determine that none exist. For a particular notion of compressibility, a natural question is whether an efficient algorithm for the compression problem would aide us in the construction of incompressible objects. Consider the following two instances of this question:

(1) Does an efficient algorithm for circuit minimization imply efficient constructions of hard truth tables?

(2) Does an efficient algorithm for factoring integers imply efficient constructions of large prime numbers?
 
In this work, we connect these kinds of questions to the long-standing challenge of proving space/time tradeoffs for Turing machines, and proving stronger separations between the RAM and 1-tape computation models. In particular, one of our main theorems shows that modest space/time tradeoffs for deterministic exponential time, or separations between basic Turing machine memory models, would imply a positive answer to both (1) and (2). 
These results apply to a more general class of explicit construction problems, where we have some efficient compression scheme that encodes $n$-bit strings using $&lt;n$ bits, and we aim to construct an $n$-bit string which cannot be recovered from its encoding.</summary>

    <title>TR22-024 |  Pseudorandomness of Expander Random Walks for Symmetric Functions and Permutation Branching Programs | 

	Louis Golowich, 

	Salil Vadhan</title>
    <summary>We study the pseudorandomness of random walks on expander graphs against tests computed by symmetric functions and permutation branching programs. These questions are motivated by applications of expander walks in the coding theory and derandomization literatures. We show that expander walks fool symmetric functions up to a $O(\lambda)$ error in total variation distance. This bound improves upon a line of prior work, which gave bounds that were weaker or applied only in more restricted cases. We extend our analysis to unify it with and strengthen the expander walk Chernoff bound. We then show that expander walks fool permutation branching programs up to a $O(\lambda)$ error in $\ell_2$-distance, and we prove that much tighter bounds hold for programs with a certain structure. We also prove lower bounds to show that our results are tight. To prove our results for symmetric functions, we analyze the Fourier coefficients of the relevant distributions using linear-algebraic techniques. Our analysis for permutation branching programs is likewise linear-algebraic in nature, but also makes use of the recently introduced singular-value approximation notion for matrices (Ahmadinejad et al. 2021).</summary>

    <title>TR22-023 |  Nisan--Wigderson generators in Proof Complexity: New lower bounds | 

	Erfan Khaniki</title>
    <summary>A map $g:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$ ($m&gt;n$) is a hard proof complexity generator for a proof system $P$ iff for every string $b\in\{0,1\}^m\setminus Rng(g)$, formula $\tau_b(g)$ naturally expressing $b\not\in Rng(g)$ requires superpolynomial size $P$-proofs. One of the well-studied maps in the theory of proof complexity generators is Nisan--Wigderson generator. Razborov (Annals of Mathematics 2015) conjectured that if $A$ is a suitable matrix and $f$ is a $NP\cap CoNP$ function hard-on-average for $P/poly$, then $NW_{f, A}$ is a hard proof complexity generator for Extended Frege.
 In this paper, we prove a form of Razborov's conjecture for $AC^0$-Frege. We show that for any symmetric $NP\cap CoNP$ function $f$ that is exponentially hard for depth two $AC^0$ circuits, $NW_{f,A}$ is a hard proof complexity generator for $AC^0$-Frege in a natural setting. As direct applications of this theorem, we show that:

1. For any $f$ with the specified properties, $\tau_b(NW_{f,A})$ based on a random $b$ and a random matrix $A$ with probability $1-o(1)$ is a tautology and requires superpolynomial (or even exponential) $AC^0$-Frege proofs.

2. Certain formalizations of the principle $f_n\not\in(NP\cap CoNP)/poly$ requires superpolynomial $AC^0$-Frege proofs.
        
These applications relate to two questions that were asked by Krajícek (Cambridge University Press 2019).</summary>

    <title>TR22-022 |  On Efficient Noncommutative Polynomial Factorization via Higman Linearization | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Pushkar Joglekar</title>
    <summary>In this paper we study the problem of efficiently factorizing polynomials in the free noncommutative ring F  of polynomials in noncommuting variables x_1,x_2,…,x_n over the field F. We obtain the following result:

Given a noncommutative arithmetic formula of   size s computing a noncommutative polynomial f in F as input, where F=F_q is a finite field, we give a randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in s, n and log q that computes a factorization of the polynomial f as a product f=f_1f_2… f_r, where each f_i is an irreducible polynomial that is output as a noncommutative algebraic branching program. 

The algorithm works by first transforming f into a linear matrix L using Higman's linearization of polynomials. We then factorize the linear matrix L and recover the factorization of the polynomial f. We use basic elements from Cohn's theory of free ideals rings combined with Ronyai's randomized polynomial-time algorithm for computing invariant subspaces of a collection of matrices over finite fields.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In a series of a few blog posts, I will present classical and non-classical results on symmetric positive definite matrices. Beyond being mathematically exciting, they arise naturally a lot in machine learning and optimization, as Hessians of twice continuously differentiable convex functions and through kernel methods. In this post, I will focus on the benefits and perils of using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loewner_order">Löwner order</a> between symmetric matrices as a tool for proving inequalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text">I will consider symmetric matrices \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) of size \(d \times d\), denoting by \(\mathcal{S}_d\) the set all such matrices. There are many characterizations of symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices: (a) non-negative eigenvalues, (b) \(x^\top A x \geqslant 0\) for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\), or (c) expression as a square as \(A = BB^\top\). Let’s denote this set by \(\mathcal{S}_d^+\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">A very useful tool in matrix analysis is the use of the Löwner order. It is defined as follows on \(\mathcal{S}_d\): $$ A \preccurlyeq B \Leftrightarrow B-A \in \mathcal{S}_d^+.$$ In other words, \(A\) is smaller than \(B\) if and only if \(B\, – A\) is positive semi-definite (PSD). The notation \(B \succcurlyeq A\) is defined as equivalent to \(A \preccurlyeq B\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This defines a classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_theory">order relation</a> which is reflexive (\(A \preccurlyeq A\) for all \(A\)), antisymmetric (for all \(A, B \in \mathcal{S}_d\), \(A \preccurlyeq B\) and \(B \preccurlyeq A\) imply \(A=B\)), and transitive (\(A \preccurlyeq B\) and \(B \preccurlyeq C\) imply \(A \preccurlyeq C\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Using operations on the Löwner order can make proofs much simpler, but it can also lead to atrocious mistakes. The main reason ends up being the lack of commutativity of the matrix product, that is, <em>in general </em>\(AB \neq BA\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Representing positive matrices through ellipsoids.</strong> Any strictly PSD matrix \(A\) defines an ellipsoid $$ \mathcal{E}_A = \big\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ x^\top A^{-1} x \leqslant 1 \big\}$$ centered at zero. The eigenvectors are the traditional principal axes of the ellipsoid and the eigenvalues the lengths of these axes. See an illustration below with \(d = 2\), and the two eigenvectors \(u_1\) and \(u_2\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6580" height="151" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ellipsoid-1.png" width="246"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The key property here is that \(\mathcal{E}_A \subset \mathcal{E}_B\) if and only if \(A \preccurlyeq B\). This representation immediately highlights that the order is partial. See examples below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6581" height="280" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/ellipsoids_notaligned-1024x571.png" width="503"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, if two matrices commute, then they are jointly diagonalizable, that is, the principal axes are aligned, and once expressed in the common eigenbasis, we obtain diagonal matrices, and we then have \({\rm Diag}(\lambda)  \preccurlyeq {\rm Diag}(\mu)\) if and only if for all \(i\), \(\lambda_i \leqslant \mu_i\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Several good books are available and reading them is both enjoyable and fruitful [1, 4, 10]. Let’s now look at some properties of this Löwner order.</p>



<h2 id="fun-and-useful-facts-and-common-mistakes">Fun (and useful) facts and common mistakes</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Here I list classical properties that are constantly used in proofs using positive matrices. This is crucially used in the analysis of gradient methods for least-squares [<a href="http://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2013/file/7fe1f8abaad094e0b5cb1b01d712f708-Paper.pdf">6</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-335/16-335.pdf">7</a>], as well as in analyzing linear dynamical systems, with control or not [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/lmibook/lmibook.pdf">8</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Direct consequence of the definition.</strong> For any \(d \times n\) matrix \(X\), and \(A,B \in \mathcal{S}_d\) such that \( A \preccurlyeq B\), $$ X^\top A X \preccurlyeq X^\top B X, $$ with the simple proof \(y^\top X^\top A X y = ( X y)^\top A ( X y) \leqslant ( X y)^\top B ( X y)  =  y^\top X^\top B X y \) for all \(y \in \mathbb{R}^n\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Another similar formulation is $$ A \preccurlyeq B \Rightarrow {\rm tr}(AM) \leqslant {\rm tr} (BM) \mbox{ for all } M \succcurlyeq 0.$$ However this <em>not</em> true if \(M\) is <em>not</em> PSD. In particular, if \(A \preccurlyeq B\) we do <em>not</em> have in general for all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(x^\top A y \leqslant x^\top B y \), which is a common mistake.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Another consequence, with \(X = B^{\, -1/2}\) the inverse of the square root of \(B\) (assuming that \(B\) is invertible), is \(A \preccurlyeq B \Rightarrow B^{\, -1/2} A B^{\, -1/2} \preccurlyeq I\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Schur complements.</strong> A very useful identity is, for any rectangular matrix \(C\): $$ CC^\top \preccurlyeq I \Leftrightarrow  C^\top C \preccurlyeq I.$$ This can be extended to (with matrices of proper sizes): $$ C B^{\, -1} C^\top \preccurlyeq A \Leftrightarrow  C^\top A^{-1} C \preccurlyeq B$$ for PSD invertible matrices \(A, B\), both properties being equivalent to $$ \bigg( \begin{array}{cc} A &amp; C \\ C^\top &amp; B \end{array} \bigg) \succcurlyeq 0.$$ This is the usual characterization of positive-definiteness of block matrices through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement">Schur complements</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Trace inequalities.</strong> If \(A \succcurlyeq 0 \) and \(B \succcurlyeq 0 \), then we have $$ 0 \leqslant {\rm tr}(AB)  \leqslant {\rm tr(A)} \lambda_{\max}(B) \leqslant {\rm tr(A)} {\rm tr}(B).$$ Moreover, still if  \(A \succcurlyeq 0 \) and \(B \succcurlyeq 0 \), $$ {\rm tr} (AB) \geqslant 0 \mbox{ with equality if and only if } AB=0.$$ This is used a lot in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming">semi-definite programming</a>, in particular for optimality conditions (see [<a href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/semidef_prog.pdf">9</a>] for details), and can be shown (for the non-trivial direction) by using an eigenvalue decomposition of \(A\) as \(A = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), writing \({\rm tr}(AB) = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i^\top B_i u_i\), which is a sum of non-negative terms and thus if \({\rm tr}(AB)=0\), all terms have to be equal to zero, leading exactly to the result (since \(u^\top B u =0\) is equivalent to \(Bu=0\) when \(B \succcurlyeq 0\)).</p>



<h2 id="matrix-functions">Matrix functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">One particularly elegant and efficient way of using symmetric matrices is through matrix functions. Some are based on classical linear algebra such as the matrix inverse \(A^{\, -1}\), the matrix square root \(A^{1/2}\), or any polynomial or rational functions. Many others are defined as spectral functions. That is, given a function \(f:I \to \mathbb{R}\), defined on some interval \(I\) we can define for any symmetric matrix latex \(A \in \mathbb{S}_d\) with eigenvalue decomposition \(A = \sum_{i=1}^d \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), and all eigenvalues in \(I\): $$f(A) = \sum_{i=1}^d f(\lambda_i) u_i u_i^\top.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We get the usual definition of matrix powers \(A^p\), inverse \(A^{-1}\), but also logarithm \(\log A\) for PSD matrices, exponential \(\exp(A)\), etc. When the matrix is diagonal, then we apply the function on diagonal elements $$f({\rm Diag}(\lambda)) = {\rm Diag}(f(\lambda)).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">For real numbers, a function \(f\) is non-decreasing if and only if for all \(\lambda,\mu\), $$ \lambda \leqslant \mu \Rightarrow f(\lambda) \leqslant f(\mu).$$ When \(f\) is non-decreasing, then for \(d=1\), we do have \(f(A)  \preccurlyeq  f(B)\) as soon as \(A \preccurlyeq B\). Moreover, when \(A\) and \(B\) commute, then can be <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/linmultialg/minpolyandappns.pdf">jointly diagonalized</a>, and then the property above is true for all non-decreasing functions. This is the same if we just want \({\rm tr} [ f(A) ] \leqslant {\rm tr}[f(B)]\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When does it extend to \(d&gt;1\), beyond taking the trace, and for non-commuting matrices? Functions for which $$ \forall A, B \in \mathcal{S}_d, \  A \preccurlyeq B \Rightarrow  f(A) \preccurlyeq f(B)$$ for all dimensions \(d\) are called <em>matrix-monotone</em>. Let us start with a few positive examples with simple direct proofs.</p>

<p class="justify-text">In fact, this is rarely true, indeed, if \(B = A + \Delta\), we have \(B^2 – A^2 = \Delta^2 + A \Delta + \Delta A,\) and as soon as the column space of \(\Delta\) does not contain the one of \(A\), the equality between squares is impossible.

<p class="justify-text">Luckily, as mentioned by my colleague <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~rudi/">Alessandro Rudi</a>, for any incorrect matrix inequality, there is a close by true inequality. Here, for example, we have that \(A \succcurlyeq  B \succcurlyeq 0\) does imply \({\rm tr}(A^2) \geqslant {\rm tr}(B^2)\) (as can be seen by from the positivity of the trace of products of PSD matrices). Moreover, there are the so-called <em>Furuta</em> <em>inequalities</em>, (see Corollary 1.18 in [4]): $$ A \succcurlyeq B \succcurlyeq 0 \Rightarrow A^2 \succcurlyeq ( AB^2A)^{1/2} \mbox{ and } (BA^2B)^{1/2} \succcurlyeq B^2, $$ which can prove useful.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Towards a characterization of matrix-monotone functions.</strong> We have seen that \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^2\) is not matrix-monotone, while \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^{1/2}\) and \(\lambda \mapsto -1/\lambda\) are. So what functions are matrix monotone? It turns out that there is a general answer, which is an amazing result from Löwner: he gives a precise characterization of matrix-monotone functions [<a href="http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN266833020_0038?tify={">2</a>], with a whole book [3] about it with 11 different proofs!</p>



<h2 id="positivity-of-lowner-matrices">Positivity of Löwner matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We start with a first characterization that will please the kernel enthusiasts. The question here is as follows. Given a differentiable function \(f: I \to \mathbb{R}\), and \(n\) real numbers \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_n \in I\) the domain of \(f\), when is the \(n \times n\) matrix \(L\) with values $$L_{ij} = \frac{f(\lambda_i)-f(\lambda_j)}{\lambda_i – \lambda_j} \mbox{ for } i \neq j,$$ and \(L_{ii} = f'(\lambda_i)\), always positive semi-definite? These matrices are called Löwner matrices and it turns out that the differentiable functions \(f\) for which all Löwner matrices are PSD are exactly the matrix-monotone functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To see this, we simply need to compute the derivative at \(t=0\) of the matrix-valued function \(g: [0,1] \to \mathcal{S}_d\) defined as  $$g(t) =  f(A + t(B-A)).$$ Using a former <a href="https://francisbach.com/cauchy-residue-formula/">blog post</a>, we have with the eigenvalue decomposition \(A=\sum_{i=1}^d \! \lambda_i u_i u_i^\top\), $$g'(0) = \sum_{i,j=1}^d \frac{f(\lambda_i)-f(\lambda_j)}{\lambda_i – \lambda_j} u_i^\top (B-A)u_j,$$ with the convention that for \(i=j\), \(\frac{f(\lambda_i)-f(\lambda_j)}{\lambda_i – \lambda_j}  = f'(\lambda_i)\). Therefore, \(g'(0) = \sum_{i,j=1}^d L_{ij}  u_i^\top (B-A)u_j\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, if \(f\) is matrix-monotone, we have \(g'(0) \geqslant 0\), and by choosing \(A = {\rm Diag}(\lambda)\) diagonal and \(B\, – A = zz^\top\) rank-one, we get \(g'(0) = \sum_{i,j=1}^d L_{ij}  z_i z_j \geqslant 0\), which leads to the positivity of \(L\) since this is true for any vector \(z \in \mathbb{R}^n\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In the other direction, if \(L \succcurlyeq 0\) all Löwner matrices are PSD, then as soon as \(B-A \succcurlyeq 0\), we can then get with a similar reasoning \(g'(t) \geqslant 0\) for \(t \in [0,1]\), and thus \(f(B) = g(1) \geqslant g(0) = f(A)\), which shows monotonicity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that, like all generic results on positive-definiteness of matrices (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochner%27s_theorem">Bochner theorem</a>), this is an infinite source of “<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colle_(pr%C3%A9pa)">problèmes de colle</a>” (oral mathematical exams which are common in France).</p>



<h2 id="characterizing-all-matrix-monotone-functions">Characterizing all matrix-monotone functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are many different characterizations of matrix monotonicity (see [3]). I will only mention a simple intuitive result for \(I = (0,+\infty)\), with a sketch of a particularly elegant proof coming from [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0098.pdf">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>A family of non-negative monotone functions.</strong> As seen above, the function \(\lambda \mapsto -1/\lambda\) is matrix-monotone on \(\mathbb{R}_+^\ast\). So is \(\lambda \mapsto \frac{\lambda}{(1-t)\lambda+t}\) for any \(t \in [0,1]\). Moreover, for all \(t \in [0,1]\), these functions are non-negative on \(\mathbb{R}_+^\ast\) and the value at 1 is 1. Note that with \(t=1\), we recover \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda\), while for \(t=0\), we recover \(\lambda \mapsto 1\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Since matrix-monotonicity is a property which is invariant by taking convex combinations of functions, all functions of the form $$ \lambda \mapsto \int_{0}^{1}\frac{\lambda}{(1-t)\lambda+t}d\mu(t)$$ for a probability measure \(\mu\) on \([ 0 , 1 ]\), are also matrix-monotone, non-negative and with value 1 at 1. It turns out we cover them all! The argument is based on showing that the functions \(\lambda \mapsto \frac{\lambda}{(1-t)\lambda+t}\) are the extreme points of the of functions defined above. See details in [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1112.0098.pdf">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then recover all matrix-monotone functions on \( (0,+\infty)\) by adding a constant and letting the mass of \(\mu\) be different from one (and potentially infinite). By making the change of variable \(u = t / (1-t)\), we get the representation as $$f(\lambda) = \alpha + \beta (\lambda-1) + (\lambda-1) \int_0^\infty \!\!\frac{ 1  }{\lambda + u} d\nu(u)$$ for some positive measure \(\nu\) and \(\beta&gt;0\). For example, we have: $$ \log \lambda = (\lambda-1) \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda +u} \frac{du}{1+u},$$ and for \(p \in (0,1]\), $$ \lambda^p = 1 + (\lambda-1) \frac{ \sin p \pi}{\pi} \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda+u} u^{p-1} du,$$ showing the matrix-monotonicity of the logarithm and of certain powers. Note that the exponential function is <em>not</em> matrix-monotone, and that the only powers \(p \neq 0\) such that \(\lambda \mapsto \lambda^p\) or \(\lambda \mapsto -\lambda^p\) are matrix-monotone are \(p \in (0,1]\) and \(p \in [-1, 0)\).</p>



<h2 id="matrix-convex-functions">Matrix-convex functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Similarly to matrix-monotone functions, matrix-convex functions are functions for which $$ \forall A, B \in \mathcal{S}_d, \forall \lambda \in [0,1], \ f( \lambda A + (1-\lambda) B) \preccurlyeq \lambda f(A) + ( 1-\lambda) f(B).$$ Like for real-valued functions, there is an intimate link between monotonicity and convexity here. Indeed, one can show that \(f\) is matrix-convex on the interval \(I\) if and only if for all \(\mu \in I\), the function \(\lambda \mapsto \frac{f(\lambda)-f(\mu)}{\lambda-\mu}\) is matrix-monotone (this is one of these cases where a natural property extends to the matrix case). Using similar arguments than for matrix-monotone functions, all functions of the form $$f(\lambda) = \gamma + \alpha (\lambda-1) + \beta (\lambda-1)^2 + (\lambda-1)^2 \int_0^\infty \!\!\frac{ 1  }{\lambda + u} d\nu(u)$$ for some positive measure \(\nu\) on \([0,+\infty)\) with finite mass, and \(\beta&gt;0\) are matrix-convex on \((0,\infty)\). They also happen to be the only ones (see, e.g., [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/9808016">11</a>]). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The classical examples are then \(f(\lambda) = \, – \log \lambda\), \(f(\lambda) = \lambda \log \lambda\), \(f(\lambda) = \lambda^p\) for \(p \in [1,2]\) and \(p \in [-1,0)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that like for monotonicity, if we just want the <em>real-valued</em> function \(A \mapsto {\rm tr} [ f(A)]\) to be convex, this is equivalent to \(f\) being convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Beyond spectral functions. </strong>There are many nice matrix convex functions beyond spectral functions: for example (see [<a href="http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0024379579901794/pdf?md5=45d3cff8e7f727933ea9aef11cae997c&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0024379579901794-main.pdf">12</a>]) \(A \mapsto A^{-1} \) or \(A \mapsto A^2 \). Among ones that come up naturally: $$ (A,B) \mapsto A B^{\, -1} A$$ $$ (A,B) \mapsto\  – (A^{-1} + B^{\, -1})^{-1} $$ $$ (A,B) \mapsto\  – A^{1/2} ( A^{-1/2}  B A^{-1/2} )^{1/2} A^{1/2} .$$ Add your favorite one!</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Next months, we will see applications of matrix monotonicity and convexity, from sharp concentration inequalities for eigenvalues of random matrices [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">13</a>] to a brand new mix of (quantum) information theory and kernels methods [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">14</a>].<br/><br/><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>.

A key insight: the high perimeter of not-yet-packed squares is an obstacle, but can be controlled by grouping squares into rough grids before packing. (This is why the epsilon is needed: perimeter diverges without it.)</p>

This post is to belatedly wish him a very happy 80th, and to give a short personal perspective. </p><p>Three things come to mind when I think of Allan:</p><p/><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>His range of research topics: I was first exposed to his work (Borodin's Gap Theorem) in a complexity-theory class by Hartmanis in Spring 1990, and have since enjoyed reading---at varying levels of depth---his works on algebraic complexity, space complexity and tradeoffs, circuit complexity, lower bounds in general, routing, adversarial queuing, online algorithms, priority algorithms, and E-commerce (I am surely leaving out some areas). This is an amazingly broad sweep!</li><li>His enthusiasm in learning about and developing new models, as our field has evolved greatly over time.</li><li>The enthusiastic embrace he has given to researchers spanning generations. Indeed, I am one of many who have been inspired by various facets of his research and personality.</li></ol><p/><p>Photos from Allan’s 60th can be seen at <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/birthday/index.htm">Amos Fiat’s page</a>.</p><p>Thank you for everything Allan, and wishing you continued robust health and enjoyment of your academic work! </p></div>
