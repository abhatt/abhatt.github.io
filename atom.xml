We consider the acceleration of
shortest path queries in road networks using Customizable Contraction
Hierarchies (CCH). It is based on computing a nested dissection order by
recursively dividing the road network into parts. Recently, with FlowCutter and
Inertial Flow, two flow-based graph bipartitioning algorithms have been
proposed for road networks. While FlowCutter achieves high-quality results and
thus fast query times, it is rather slow. Inertial Flow is particularly fast
due to the use of geographical information while still achieving acceptable
quality. We combine the techniques of both algorithms to achieve more than six
times faster preprocessing times than FlowCutter and even slightly better
quality. We show that using 16 cores of a shared-memory machine, this
preprocessing needs four minutes on the Europe road network.

often require samples to be generated from a categorical distribution where the
probability of each one of $n$ categories is specified as a parameter. If the
parameters are hyper-parameters then they need to be modified, however, current
implementations of categorical distributions take $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time to
modify a parameter. If $n$ is large and the parameters are being frequently
modified, this can become prohibitive. Here we present the insight that a
Huffman tree is an efficient data structure for representing categorical
distributions and present algorithms to generate samples as well as add, delete
and modify categories in $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ time. We demonstrate that the
time to sample from the distribution remains, in practice, within a few percent
of the theoretical optimal value. The same algorithm may also be useful in the
context of adaptive Huffman coding where computational efficiency is important.

($\MaxIS$) in the standard LOCAL and CONGEST models of distributed computing.
Let $n$ and $\Delta$ be the number of nodes and maximum degree in the input
graph, respectively. Bar-Yehuda et al. [PODC 2017] showed that there is an
algorithm in the CONGEST model that finds a $\Delta$-approximation to $\MaxIS$
in $O(\MIS(n,\Delta)\log W)$ rounds, where $\MIS(n,\Delta)$ is the running time
for finding a \emph{maximal} independent set, and $W$ is the maximum weight of
a node in the network. Whether their algorithm is randomized or deterministic
depends on the $\MIS$ algorithm that they use as a black-box. Our results: (1)
A deterministic $O(\MIS(n,\Delta))$ rounds algorithm for
$O(\Delta)$-approximation to $\MaxIS$ in the CONGEST model. (2) A randomized
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log \log n})}$ rounds algorithm that finds, with high probability,
an $O(\Delta)$-approximation to $\MaxIS$ in the CONGEST model. (3) An
$\Omega(\log^*n)$ lower bound for any randomized algorithm that finds an
independent set of size $\Omega(n/\Delta)$ that succeeds with probability at
least $1-1/\log n$, even for the LOCAL model. This hardness result applies for
graphs of maximum degree $\Delta=O(n/\log^*n)$. One might wonder whether the
same hardness result applies for low degree graphs. We rule out this
possibility with our next result. (4) An $O(1)$ rounds algorithm that finds an
independent set of size $\Omega(n/\Delta)$ in graphs with maximum degree
$\Delta\leq n/\log n$, with high probability. Due to a lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{\log n/\log \log n})$ that was given by Kuhn, Moscibroda and
Wattenhofer [JACM, 2016] on the number of rounds for finding a maximal
independent set ($\MIS$) in the LOCAL model, even for randomized algorithms,
our second result implies that finding an $O(\Delta)$-approximation to $\MaxIS$
is strictly easier than $\MIS$.

$d$-dimensional cubical lattice~$\mathbb{Z}^d$. Let~$A_d(n)$ denote the number
of $d$-dimensional polycubes (distinct up to translations) with~$n$ cubes,
and~$\lambda_d$ denote the limit of the ratio~$A_d(n{+}1)/A_d(n)$ as~$n \to
\infty$. The exact value of~$\lambda_d$ is still unknown rigorously for any
dimension~$d \geq 2$; the asymptotics of~$\lambda_d$, as~$d \to \infty$, also
remained elusive as of today. In this paper, we revisit and extend the approach
presented by Klarner and Rivest in~1973 to bound $A_2(n)$ from above. Our
contributions are: Using available computing power, we prove that~$\lambda_2
\leq 4.5252$. This is the first improvement of the upper bound on~$\lambda_2$
in almost half a century; We prove that~$\lambda_d \leq (2d-2)e+o(1)$ for any
value of~$d \geq 2$, using a novel construction of a rational generating
function which dominates that of the sequence~$\left(A_d(n)\right)$; For $d=3$,
this provides a subtantial improvement of the upper bound on~$\lambda_3$
from~12.2071 to~9.8073;%~10.016; However, we implement an iterative process in
three dimensions, which improves further the upper bound
on~$\lambda_3$to~$9.3835$;

Morazán</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11423">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Vector programming is an important topic in many Introduction to Computer
Science courses. Despite the importance of vectors, learning vector programming
is a source of frustration for many students. Much of the frustration is rooted
in discovering the source of bugs that are manifested as out-of-bounds
indexing. The problem is that such bugs are, sometimes, rooted in incorrectly
computing an index. Other times, however, these errors are rooted in mistaken
reasoning about how to correctly process a vector. Unfortunately, either way,
all too often beginners are left adrift to resolve indexing errors on their
own. This article extends the work done on vector programming using vector
intervals and structural recursion to using generative recursion. As for
problems solved using structural recursion, vector intervals provide beginners
with a useful framework for designing code that properly indexes vectors. This
article presents the methodology and concrete examples that others may use to
build their own CS1 modules involving vector programming using any programming
language.

    <title>A Tight Analysis of Greedy Yields Subexponential Time Approximation for Uniform Decision Tree</title>

hypotheses with nonnegative weights summing to 1 and a set of tests that each
partition the hypotheses, output a decision tree using the provided tests that
uniquely identifies each hypothesis and has minimum (weighted) average depth.
Previous works showed that the greedy algorithm achieves a $O(\log n)$
approximation ratio for this problem and it is NP-hard beat a $O(\log n)$
approximation, settling the complexity of the problem. However, for Uniform
Decision Tree, i.e. Decision Tree with uniform weights, the story is more
subtle. The greedy algorithm's $O(\log n)$ approximation ratio is the best
known, but the largest approximation ratio known to be NP-hard is
$4-\varepsilon$. We prove that the greedy algorithm gives a $O(\frac{\log
n}{\log C_{OPT}})$ approximation for Uniform Decision Tree, where $C_{OPT}$ is
the cost of the optimal tree and show this is best possible for the greedy
algorithm. As a corollary, this resolves a conjecture of Kosaraju, Przytycka,
and Borgstrom. Our results also hold for instances of Decision Tree whose
weights are not too far from uniform. Leveraging this result, we exhibit a
subexponential algorithm that yields an $O(1/\alpha)$ approximation to Uniform
Decision Tree in time $2^{O(n^\alpha)}$. As a corollary, achieving any
super-constant approximation ratio on Uniform Decision Tree is not NP-hard,
assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. This work therefore adds
approximating Uniform Decision Tree to a small list of natural problems that
have subexponential algorithms but no known polynomial time algorithms. Like
the greedy algorithm, our subexponential algorithm gives similar guarantees
even for slightly nonuniform weights.

mean estimation} and \emph{outlier detection}. In robust mean estimation the
goal is to estimate the mean $\mu$ of a distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ given
$n$ independent samples, an $\varepsilon$-fraction of which have been corrupted
by a malicious adversary. In outlier detection the goal is to assign an
\emph{outlier score} to each element of a data set such that elements more
likely to be outliers are assigned higher scores. Our algorithms for both
problems are based on a new outlier scoring method we call QUE-scoring based on
\emph{quantum entropy regularization}. For robust mean estimation, this yields
the first algorithm with optimal error rates and nearly-linear running time
$\widetilde{O}(nd)$ in all parameters, improving on the previous fastest
running time $\widetilde{O}(\min(nd/\varepsilon^6, nd^2))$. For outlier
detection, we evaluate the performance of QUE-scoring via extensive experiments
on synthetic and real data, and demonstrate that it often performs better than
previously proposed algorithms. Code for these experiments is available at

We
prove that each Voronoi or Delaunay cell of a plane curve appears as the limit
of a sequence of cells obtained from point samples of the curve. We then use
this result to study metric features of plane curves, including the medial
axis, curvature, evolute, bottlenecks, and reach. In each case, we provide
algebraic equations defining the object and, where possible, give formulas for
the degrees of these algebraic varieties. We then show how to identify the
desired metric feature from Voronoi or Delaunay cells, and therefore how to
approximate it by a finite point sample from the variety.

    <title>The Adversarial Robustness of Sampling</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561680000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Ben=Eliezer:Omri.html">Omri Ben-Eliezer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/y/Yogev:Eylon.html">Eylon Yogev</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11327">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Random sampling is a fundamental primitive in modern algorithms, statistics,
and machine learning, used as a generic method to obtain a small yet
"representative" subset of the data. In this work, we investigate the
robustness of sampling against adaptive adversarial attacks in a streaming
setting: An adversary sends a stream of elements from a universe $U$ to a
sampling algorithm (e.g., Bernoulli sampling or reservoir sampling), with the
goal of making the sample "very unrepresentative" of the underlying data
stream. The adversary is fully adaptive in the sense that it knows the exact
content of the sample at any given point along the stream, and can choose which
element to send next accordingly, in an online manner.
</p>
<p>Well-known results in the static setting indicate that if the full stream is
chosen in advance (non-adaptively), then a random sample of size $\Omega(d /
\varepsilon^2)$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the full data with good
probability, where $d$ is the VC-dimension of the underlying set system
$(U,R)$. Does this sample size suffice for robustness against an adaptive
adversary? The simplistic answer is \emph{negative}: We demonstrate a set
system where a constant sample size (corresponding to VC-dimension $1$)
suffices in the static setting, yet an adaptive adversary can make the sample
very unrepresentative, as long as the sample size is (strongly) sublinear in
the stream length, using a simple and easy-to-implement attack.
</p>
<p>However, this attack is "theoretical only", requiring the set system size to
(essentially) be exponential in the stream length. This is not a coincidence:
We show that to make Bernoulli or reservoir sampling robust against adaptive
adversaries, the modification required is solely to replace the VC-dimension
term $d$ in the sample size with the cardinality term $\log |R|$. This nearly
matches the bound imposed by the attack.

Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun gave their Turing award lectures, their co-winner Yoshua Bengio not in attendance. Hinton talked about how machine learning triumphed over symbolic AI. LeCun argued that under uncertainty, one should learn the distribution instead of just the average.

In a Petri net you have a list of vectors of integers and an initial and final vector. You start with the initial vector and can add any of the other vectors nondeterministically as often as you like as long as no coordinate goes negative. Can you get to the final vector? This problem was known to be computable in "Ackermannian" time and EXPSPACE-hard. This paper shows the problem is not elementary, i.e. not solvable in running time a tower of 2's to the n. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08575">recent result</a> shows Petri Nets reachability is primitive recursive for fixed dimensions.<br/>

    <title>TR19-090 |  Quasilinear time list-decodable codes for space bounded channels | 

	Ronen Shaltiel</title>
    <summary>We consider codes for space bounded channels. This is a model for communication under noise that was studied by Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) and lies between the Shannon (random) and Hamming (adversarial) models. In this model, a channel is a space bounded procedure that reads the codeword in one pass, and modifies at most a $p$ fraction of the bits of the codeword.

Guruswami and Smith, and later work by Shaltiel and Silbak (RANDOM 2016), gave constructions of list-decodable codes with rate approaching $1-H(p)$ against channels with space $s=c \log n$, with encoding/decoding time $\poly(2^s)=\poly(n^c)$.

In this paper we show that for every constant $0 \le p 0$, there are codes with rate $R \ge 1-H(p)-\epsilon$, list size $\poly(1/\epsilon)$, and furthermore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our codes can handle channels with space $s=n^{\Omega(1)}$, which is much larger than $O(\log n)$ achieved by previous work.
\item We give encoding and decoding algorithms that run in time $n \cdot \polylog(n)$. Previous work achieved large and unspecified $\poly(n)$ time (even for space $s=1 \cdot \log n$ channels).
\item We can handle space bounded channels that read the codeword in any order, whereas previous work considered channels that read the codeword in the standard order.
\end{itemize}
Our construction builds on the machinery of Guruswami and Smith (with some key modifications) replacing some nonconstructive codes and pseudorandom objects (that are found in exponential time by brute force) with efficient explicit constructions.
For this purpose we exploit recent results of Haramaty, Lee and Viola (SICOMP 2018) on pseudorandom properties of ``$t$-wise independence + low weight noise'' which we quantitatively improve using techniques by Forbes and Kelly (FOCS 2018).

To make use of such distributions, we give new explicit constructions of binary linear codes that have dual distance of $n^{\Omega(1)}$, and are also polynomial time list-decodable from relative distance $\half-\epsilon$, with list size $\poly(1/\epsilon)$. To the best of our knowledge, no such construction was previously known.

Somewhat surprisingly, we show that Reed-Solomon codes with dimension $k&lt;\sqrt{n}$, have this property if interpreted as binary codes (in some specific interpretation) which we term: ``Raw Reed-Solomon Codes''. A key idea is viewing Reed-Solomon codes as ``bundles'' of certain dual-BCH codewords.</summary>

    <title>Making a Sieve Random: Improved Semi-Streaming Algorithm for Submodular Maximization under a Cardinality Constraint</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561593600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Alaluf:Naor.html">Naor Alaluf</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Feldman:Moran.html">Moran Feldman</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11237">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we consider the problem of maximizing a non-negative submodular
function subject to a cardinality constraint in the data stream model.
Previously, the best known algorithm for this problem was a
$5.828$-approximation semi-streaming algorithm based on a local search
technique (Feldman et al., 2018). For the special case of this problem in which
the objective function is also monotone, the state-of-the-art semi-streaming
algorithm is an algorithm known as Sieve-Streaming, which is based on a
different technique (Badanidiyuru, 2014). Adapting the technique of
Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective functions has turned out to be a
challenging task, which has so far prevented an improvement over the local
search based $5.828$-approximation. In this work, we overcome the above
challenge, and manage to adapt Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective
functions by introducing a "just right" amount of randomness into it.
Consequently, we get a semi-streaming polynomial time $4.282$-approximation
algorithm for non-monotone objectives. Moreover, if one allows our algorithm to
run in super-polynomial time, then its approximation ratio can be further
improved to $3 + \varepsilon$.

intersection graph of edge paths on a grid. An EPG graph $G$ is a graph that
admits a representation where its vertices correspond to paths in a grid $Q$,
such that two vertices of $G$ are adjacent if and only if their corresponding
paths in $Q$ have a common edge. If the paths in the representation have at
most $k$ changes of direction (bends), we say that it is a $B_k$-EPG
representation. A collection $C$ of sets satisfies the Helly property when
every sub-collection of $C$ that is pairwise intersecting has at least one
common element. In this paper we show that the problem of recognizing $B_k$-EPG
graphs $G=(V,E)$ whose edge-intersections of paths in a grid satisfy the Helly

bounded by a polynomial of $|V(G)|$. In addition, we show that recognizing
Helly-$B_1$ EPG graphs is $NP$-complete, and it remains $NP$-complete even when
restricted to 2-apex and 3-degenerate graphs.

before it can be synthesised for storage. Definition of such an encoding or
mapping must adhere to multiple design restrictions. First, not all possible
sequences of nucleotides can be synthesised. Homopolymers, e.g., sequences of
the same nucleotide, of a length of more than two, for example, cannot be
synthesised without potential errors. Similarly, the G-C content of the
resulting sequences should be higher than 50\%. Second, given that synthesis is
expensive, the encoding must map as many bits as possible to one nucleotide.
Third, the synthesis (as well as the sequencing) is error prone, leading to
substitutions, deletions and insertions. An encoding must therefore be designed
to be resilient to errors through error correction codes or replication.
Fourth, for the purpose of computation and selective retrieval, encodings
should result in substantially different sequences across all data, even for
very similar data. In the following we discuss the history and evolution of
encodings.

location-based service provision or DNA sequence analysis. This dissemination,
however, may expose sensitive patterns that model confidential knowledge (e.g.,
trips to mental health clinics from a string representing a user's location
history). In this paper, we consider the problem of sanitizing a string by
concealing the occurrences of sensitive patterns, while maintaining data
utility. First, we propose a time-optimal algorithm, TFS-ALGO, to construct the
shortest string preserving the order of appearance and the frequency of all
non-sensitive patterns. Such a string allows accurately performing tasks based
on the sequential nature and pattern frequencies of the string. Second, we
propose a time-optimal algorithm, PFS-ALGO, which preserves a partial order of
appearance of non-sensitive patterns but produces a much shorter string that
can be analyzed more efficiently. The strings produced by either of these
algorithms may reveal the location of sensitive patterns. In response, we
propose a heuristic, MCSR-ALGO, which replaces letters in these strings with
carefully selected letters, so that sensitive patterns are not reinstated and
occurrences of spurious patterns are prevented. We implemented our sanitization
approach that applies TFS-ALGO, PFS-ALGO and then MCSR-ALGO and experimentally
show that it is effective and efficient.

    <title>Parameterized Approximation Schemes for Independent Set of Rectangles and Geometric Knapsack</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Grandoni:Fabrizio.html">Fabrizio Grandoni</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kratsch:Stefan.html">Stefan Kratsch</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wiese:Andreas.html">Andreas Wiese</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10982">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The area of parameterized approximation seeks to combine approximation and
parameterized algorithms to obtain, e.g., (1+eps)-approximations in
f(k,eps)n^{O(1)} time where k is some parameter of the input. We obtain the
following results on parameterized approximability: 1) In the maximum
independent set of rectangles problem (MISR) we are given a collection of n
axis parallel rectangles in the plane. Our goal is to select a
maximum-cardinality subset of pairwise non-overlapping rectangles. This problem
is NP-hard and also W[1]-hard [Marx, ESA'05]. The best-known polynomial-time
approximation factor is O(loglog n) [Chalermsook and Chuzhoy, SODA'09] and it
admits a QPTAS [Adamaszek and Wiese, FOCS'13; Chuzhoy and Ene, FOCS'16]. Here
we present a parameterized approximation scheme (PAS) for MISR, i.e. an
algorithm that, for any given constant eps&gt;0 and integer k&gt;0, in time
f(k,eps)n^{g(eps)}, either outputs a solution of size at least k/(1+eps), or
declares that the optimum solution has size less than k. 2) In the
(2-dimensional) geometric knapsack problem (TDK) we are given an axis-aligned
square knapsack and a collection of axis-aligned rectangles in the plane
(items). Our goal is to translate a maximum cardinality subset of items into
the knapsack so that the selected items do not overlap. In the version of TDK
with rotations (TDKR), we are allowed to rotate items by 90 degrees. Both
variants are NP-hard, and the best-known polynomial-time approximation factors
are 558/325+eps and 4/3+eps, resp. [Galvez et al., FOCS'17]. These problems
admit a QPTAS for polynomially bounded item sizes [Adamaszek and Wiese,
SODA'15]. We show that both variants are W[1]-hard. Furthermore, we present a
PAS for TDKR. For all considered problems, getting time f(k,eps)n^{O(1)},
rather than f(k,eps)n^{g(eps)}, would give FPT time f'(k)n^{O(1)} exact
algorithms using eps=1/(k+1), contradicting W[1]-hardness.

    <title>Lawn: an Unbound Low Latency Timer Data Structure for Large Scale, High Throughput Systems</title>

importance of enabling large-scale, unbound algorithms to solve conventional
problems with low to no latency is critical for product viability. Timer
algorithms are prevalent in the core mechanisms behind operating systems,
network protocol implementation, stream processing, and several database
capabilities. This paper presents a field-tested algorithm for low latency,
unbound range timer structure, based upon the well excepted Timing Wheel
algorithm. Using a set of queues hashed by TTL, the algorithm allows for a
simpler implementation, minimal overhead no overflow and no performance
degradation in comparison to the current state of the algorithms under typical
use cases.

Does a hard-on-average language in NP imply the existence of one-way functions?
2) Does a hard-on-average language in NP imply a hard problem in TFNP (i.e.,
the class of total NP search problem)? We show that the answer to (at least)
one of these questions is yes. In other words, in Impagliazzo's Pessiland
(where NP is hard-on-average, but one-way functions do not exist), TFNP is
unconditionally hard (on average). This result follows from a more general
theory of interactive average-case complexity, and in particular, a novel
round-collapse theorem for computationally-sound protocols, analogous to
Babai-Moran's celebrated round-collapse theorem for information-theoretically
sound protocols. As another consequence of this treatment, we show that the
existence of O(1)-round public-coin non-trivial arguments (i.e., argument
systems that are not proofs) imply the existence of a hard-on-average problem
in NP/poly.

    <title>Upper and Lower Bounds on Approximating Weighted Mixed Domination</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1561593600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/x/Xiao:Mingyu.html">Mingyu Xiao</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10801">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A mixed dominating set of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a mixed set $D$ of vertices
and edges, such that for every edge or vertex, if it is not in $D$, then it is
adjacent or incident to at least one vertex or edge in $D$. The mixed
domination problem is to find a mixed dominating set with a minimum
cardinality. It has applications in system control and some other scenarios and
it is $NP$-hard to compute an optimal solution. This paper studies
approximation algorithms and hardness of the weighted mixed dominating set
problem. The weighted version is a generalization of the unweighted version,
where all vertices are assigned the same nonnegative weight $w_v$ and all edges
are assigned the same nonnegative weight $w_e$, and the question is to find a
mixed dominating set with a minimum total weight. Although the mixed dominating
set problem has a simple 2-approximation algorithm, few approximation results
for the weighted version are known. The main contributions of this paper
include: [1.] for $w_e\geq w_v$, a 2-approximation algorithm; [2.] for $w_e\geq
2w_v$, inapproximability within ratio 1.3606 unless $P=NP$ and within ratio 2
under UGC; [3.] for $2w_v &gt; w_e\geq w_v$, inapproximability within ratio 1.1803
unless $P=NP$ and within ratio 1.5 under UGC; [4.] for $w_e&lt; w_v$,
inapproximability within ratio $(1-\epsilon)\ln |V|$ unless $P=NP$ for any
$\epsilon &gt;0$.

    <title>Computational Phase Transition Signature in Gibbs Sampling</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>H. Philathong, V. Akshay, I. Zacharov, J. Biamonte <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10705">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Gibbs sampling is fundamental to a wide range of computer algorithms. Such
algorithms are set to be replaced by physics based processors$-$be it quantum
or stochastic annealing devices$-$which embed problem instances and evolve a
physical system into an ensemble to recover a probability distribution. At a
critical constraint to variable ratio, decision problems$-$such as
propositional satisfiability$-$appear to statistically exhibit an abrupt
transition in required computational resources. This so called, algorithmic or
computational phase transition signature, has yet-to-be observed in
contemporary physics based processors. We found that the computational phase
transition admits a signature in Gibbs' distributions and hence we predict and
prescribe the physical observation of this effect. We simulate such an
experiment, that when realized experimentally, we believe would represent a
milestone in the physical theory of computation.

If you stick your circuit of size <img alt="s(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="s(n)"/> and depth <img alt="O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="O(1)"/> at each node, the depth of the overall circuit would be obviously <img alt="O(\log _{f}n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clog+_%7Bf%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="O(\log _{f}n)"/> and the overall size would be dominated by the input layer which is <img alt="s(f)\cdot n/f&lt;s(f)\cdot n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28f%29%5Ccdot+n%2Ff%3Cs%28f%29%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="s(f)\cdot n/f&lt;s(f)\cdot n"/>. If you are aiming for overall depth <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/>, you need <img alt="f=n^{O(1/d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3Dn%5E%7BO%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f=n^{O(1/d)}"/>. This gives size <img alt="n^{1+O(1/d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2BO%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+O(1/d)}"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Hence we have shown that proving bounds <img alt="n^{1+\omega (1/d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Comega+%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\omega (1/d)}"/> for some depth <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/> suffices to prove <img alt="n^{10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{10}"/> lower bounds for depth <img alt="10" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="10"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>Chen and Tell.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The above is not the most efficient way to build a tree! I am writing this post following their paper to understand what they do. As they say, the idea is quite simple. While above the size will be dominated by the input layer, we want to balance things so that every layer has roughly the same contribution. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Let’s say we are aiming for size <img alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\epsilon }"/> and let’s see what depth we can get. Let’s say now the size is <img alt="s(n)=n^{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29%3Dn%5E%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="s(n)=n^{k}"/>. Let us denote by <img alt="n_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}"/> the number of nodes at level <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/> with <img alt="i=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i=0"/> being the root. The fan-in at level <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/> is <img alt="(n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D%2Fn_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}"/> so that the cost is <img alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\epsilon }"/> as desired. We have the recursion <img alt="n_{i+1}=n_{i}\cdot (n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%2B1%7D%3Dn_%7Bi%7D%5Ccdot+%28n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D%2Fn_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i+1}=n_{i}\cdot (n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The solution to this recursion is <img alt="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-(1-1/k)^{i})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D%3Dn%5E%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon+%29%281-%281-1%2Fk%29%5E%7Bi%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-(1-1/k)^{i})}"/>, see below. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   So that’s it. We need to get to <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> nodes. So if you set <img alt="i=O(k\log (1/\epsilon ))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3DO%28k%5Clog+%281%2F%5Cepsilon+%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i=O(k\log (1/\epsilon ))"/> you get say <img alt="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-\epsilon ^{2})}&gt;n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D%3Dn%5E%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon+%29%281-%5Cepsilon+%5E%7B2%7D%29%7D%3En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-\epsilon ^{2})}&gt;n"/>. Going back to <img alt="k=10" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="k=10"/>, we have exhibited circuits of size <img alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\epsilon }"/> and depth just <img alt="O(\log 1/\epsilon )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clog+1%2F%5Cepsilon+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="O(\log 1/\epsilon )"/>. So proving stronger bounds than this would rule out circuits of size <img alt="n^{10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{10}"/> and depth <img alt="10" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="10"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>Added later: About the recurrence</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Letting <img alt="a_{i}:=\log _{n}n_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bi%7D%3A%3D%5Clog+_%7Bn%7Dn_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a_{i}:=\log _{n}n_{i}"/> we have the following recurrence for the exponents of <img alt="n_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}"/>. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>My two cents.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   I am not sure I need more evidence that making progress on long-standing bounds in complexity theory is hard, but I do find it interesting to prove these links; we have quite a few by now! The fact that we have been stuck forever just short of proving “the whole thing” makes me think that these long-sought bounds may in fact be false. Would love to be proved wrong, but it’s 2019, this connection is proved by balancing a tree better, and you feel confident that P <img alt="\ne " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cne+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ne "/> NP?    </p>

<p>On the Importance of Disciplinary Pride for Multidisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>. I always got further and enjoyed research much more because of my collaborators. I’m forever indebted to so many colleagues and dear, dear friends. Each and every one of them was better than me in some ways. To contribute, I had to remember my own strengths and bring them to the table. The premise of this post is that the same holds for collaboration between fields. It should be read as a call for theoreticians to bring the tools and the powerful way of thinking of TOC into collaborations. We shouldn’t be blind to the limitation of our field but obsessing on those limitations is misguided and would only limit our impact. Instead we should bring our best and trust on the other disciplines we collaborate with to do the same (allowing each to complement and compensate for the other).</p>
<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

    <link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/are-you-smarter-than-5th-grade-amoeba.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Are you smarter than a 5th grade amoeba?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(title of this blog is due to Henry Baker who posted an article about this elsewhere)<br/>
<br/>
Amoeba finds approx solution to TSP in linear time:<a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-amoeba-approximate-solutions-np-hard-problem.html">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years we have seen models of computation that claim to solve NPC or other hard problems quickly. I ask non-rhetorically and with and open mind how they have panned out.<br/>
<br/>
In no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
1) Parallelism. For solving problems faster YES. For speeding up how to solve NPC problems I think YES. For making P=NP somehow NO.  Even so, parallel computers have been a definite practical success.<br/>
<br/>
2) Quantum Computing. Will they factor large numbers anytime soon? Ever? Should we view the effort to build them as an awesome and insightful Physics experiment? Are there any problems that they are NOW doing faster? Is Quantum Crypto (I know, not the same thing) actually used? Will other things of interest come out of the study of quantum computing? It already has, see <a href="https://theoryofcomputing.org/articles/gs002/gs002.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3) DNA computing. Did that lead to practical solutions to NPC problems? I do not think it did. Did that lead to interesting math? Interesting biology? Interesting science?  I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
4) Autistic  computing for finding primes: see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/09/possibly-recruits-for-polymath-primes.html">here</a>. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist ,claimed that two autistic twin brothers could generate large primes quickly. This story was never put to a rigorous test and may not be quite right.<br/>
<br/>
5) Amoeba computing: Too early to tell. The article seems to say it succeeded on 8 cities<br/>
<br/>
The problem with all of these non-standard models of computing is SCALE.  And the more powerful classic computers get, the harder it is for these nonstandard models to compete.<br/>
<br/>
Are these models interesting even if they don't end up getting us fast algorithms? They can be:<br/>
<br/>
1) Do they lead to mathematics of interest? (Quantum- Yes, Parallelism- Yes)<br/>
<br/>
2) Did they inspire algorithms for classical computers? (Quantum- Yes)<br/>
<br/>
3) Do they give insight into other fields? (Quantum for Physics yes, DNA-computing for bio-??)<br/>
<br/>
4) Have they ACTUALLY sped up  up computations in meaningful ways for problems we care about (Parallelism  has)<br/>
<br/>
If  you know of any result which I missed<br/>
<br/>
 (e.g.,<br/>
<br/>
 Amoeba-computing giving insight into evolution,<br/>
<br/>
Autistic computing being used by the NSA to find primes,<br/>
<br/>
 DNA computing  leading to interesting mathematics)<br/>
<br/>
 then leave polite comments!<br/>

<p>
Lucy Lu Wang is the lead author of a paper released this Friday on gender parity in computer science. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07883.pdf">paper</a> is from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The authors are Wang, Gabriel Stanovsky, Luca Weihs, and Oren Etzioni.  We will call them WSWE for short. </p>
<p>
Today we will discuss some of the issues this study raises.</p>
<p>
The paper was highlighted by the New York Times in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html">article</a> titled, “The Gender Gap in Computer Science Research Won’t Close for 100 Years.”  The news article begins with an equally sobering statement of this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>Women will not reach parity with men in writing published computer science research in this century if current trends hold, according to a study released on Friday. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We are for gender-neutral opportunities and have always promoted this—see our earlier discussions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/absolute-firsts/">here</a>. We are for doing a better job in supporting women in computer science. The study by WSWE is an important paper that helps frame the problem. Quoting them:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The field has made more of an effort to reach a more balanced gender status. But the data seems to show that even with all the progress, we are still not making the change fast enough. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I suggest that you might wish to read the paper. Unfortunately there are many papers with similar conclusions—see <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1301">this</a> by Natalie Schluter, for example. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Main Points </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some points of the paper by WSWE:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>There is a measurable gap</i>. No one would, I believe, doubt this. But it is important to see that it is measurable. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The gap is shrinking, but slowly</i>. Again this seems correct, but whether it is shrinking in all relevant measures of publication weight is still an issue.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The predictions</i>. Perhaps it will not be closed for over a century. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Modern technology allows such a study</i>. This is one aspect that we can all applaud. WSWE used automated tools that allowed this study to search millions of papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Issues </h2><p/>
<p>
WSWE filtered a corpus of <b>2.87 million</b> papers tagged as in computer science.  The volume constrained their approaches to handling several basic issues.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> How to tell the gender of an author?  They use first names and try to detect gender from that alone. This is not easy.  Not only can differently-gendered names in different nations or language groups have the same Romanized form, many names apply to both genders within those groups.  The names Taylor and Kelley are perfect examples pf the latter. </p>
<p>
WSWE used a statistical weighing method. So “Taylor,” for example, would be weighted as 55 percent female, 45 percent male.  The weightings come from a large database called <i>Gender API</i> compiled from government and social agencies not directly related to computer science. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> Another issue concerns the prediction part of their paper. They attempt to extrapolate and guess when there will be parity between female and male authorship. </p>
<p>
As all predictions this is not easy. It is my main complaint with this and other papers on the gender-gap issue. They predict that parity will not be reached until 2167, in 168 years. An earlier <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/640548/gender-parity-computer-science-could-take-280-years/">study</a> puts the parity point at 280 years away.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I believe that a major issue is hiring by computer science departments and other institutions. A major CS department just hired <img alt="{N&gt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N&gt;1}"/> assistant professors, of which <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> were male. This is a problem. </p>
<p>
Should studies on the gender gap count all papers? Perhaps they should weight the papers by some citation indices. Are women writing more impactful papers? What percent of papers by gender have citations rate above X?—you get the idea. </p>
<p>
Finally I wonder if parity is the right goal? <b>How about aiming for more women papers than men</b>? Why not?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Spring semester is over, yay! To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent version can be downloaded here:<br/>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO" title="OPTtutorial">OPTtutorial</a></p>
<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>

    <title>TR19-089 |  Exponential separation between shallow quantum circuits and unbounded fan-in shallow classical circuits | 

	Adam Bene Watts, 

	Robin Kothari, 

	Luke Schaeffer, 

	Avishay Tal</title>
    <summary>Recently, Bravyi, Gosset, and König (Science, 2018) exhibited a search problem called the 2D Hidden Linear Function (2D HLF) problem that can be solved exactly by a constant-depth quantum circuit using bounded fan-in gates (or QNC^0 circuits), but cannot be solved by any constant-depth classical circuit using bounded fan-in AND, OR, and NOT gates (or NC^0 circuits). In other words, they exhibited a search problem in QNC^0 that is not in NC^0.

We strengthen their result by proving that the 2D HLF problem is not contained in AC^0, the class of classical, polynomial-size, constant-depth circuits over the gate set of unbounded fan-in AND and OR gates, and NOT gates. We also supplement this worst-case lower bound with an average-case result: There exists a simple distribution under which any AC^0 circuit (even of nearly exponential size) has exponentially small correlation with the 2D HLF problem. Our results are shown by constructing a new problem in QNC^0, which we call the Relaxed Parity Halving Problem, which is easier to work with. We prove our AC^0 lower bounds for this problem, and then show that it reduces to the 2D HLF problem.

As a step towards even stronger lower bounds, we present a search problem that we call the Parity Bending Problem, which is in QNC^0/qpoly (QNC^0 circuits that are allowed to start with a quantum state of their choice that is independent of the input), but is not even in AC^0[2] (the class AC^0 with unbounded fan-in XOR gates).

All the quantum circuits in our paper are simple, and the main difficulty lies in proving the classical lower bounds. For this we employ a host of techniques, including a refinement of H{\aa}stad's switching lemmas for multi-output circuits that may be of independent interest, the Razborov-Smolensky AC^0[2] lower bound, Vazirani's XOR lemma, and lower bounds for non-local games.</summary>

    <summary>As I mentioned in my previous post, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/06/20/portland-street-art.html">my previous post</a>, I just finished attending the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Portland. The <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/portals/lipics/index.php?semnr=16108">conference proceedings are open access through LIPIcs</a>.</p>

<p>The conference started on Tuesday (after some earlier social activities) with the best paper talk by Arnaud de Mesmay, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.27">Almost tight lower bounds for hard cutting problems in embedded graphs</a>” (with V. Cohen-Addad, É. Colin de Verdière, and D. Marx) proving that, to find the shortest set of cuts to slice a genus- surface into a disk, the exponent must depend linearly on  (assuming the exponential time hypothesis).</p>

<p>Several of the contributed talks from throughout the conference particularly caught my attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Shay Moran’s paper with A. Yehudayoff, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.51">On weak -nets and the Radon number</a>” concerned abstract convexity spaces where the convex sets are any set family closed under intersection. A space has Radon number  if every  points can be partitioned into two subsets whose convex hulls (smallest containing convex sets) intersect, and a point in the intersection is called a Radon point. Having bounded Radon number turns out to be equivalent to having weak -nets, subsets of points that (for a given measure on the space) intersect every large convex set.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitchell Jones’ “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.41">Journey to the center of the point set</a>” (with Sariel Har-Peled) improved an old paper of mine on using Radon points to find points of high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centerpoint_(geometry)">Tukey depth</a> in high-dimensional point sets in time polynomial in the dimension, improving both the polynomial and the depth of the resulting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sariel Har-Peled spoke on his work with Timothy Chan, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.23">Smallest -enclosing rectangle revisited</a>”. As well as shaving logs from the time bounds for finding rectangles that enclose a given number of points and minimize their area or perimeter, they found a general reduction from problems on  points to  problems on  points, allowing one to turn factors of  in the time bounds into factors of . Previously such reductions were only known for -point subset problems where the optimal solution lies among the  nearest neighbors of some input point, true for rectangle perimeter but not rectangle area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Timothy Chan’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.20">Computing Shapley values in the plane</a>” concerns an interesting combination of game theory and computational geometry. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value">Shapley value</a> is a method for assigning credit when multiple people collaborate to produce some value (given as input a function from subsets of people to the value of a subset). It can be defined by adding contributors one-by-one in a random order and setting each contributor’s Shapley value to the expected increase in value when that contributor is added. It sums to the total value and is the unique function with this property that obeys several other natural and desirable axioms for credit assignment. For arbitrary functions from subsets of  contributors to subset values, it takes time  to compute, but Timothy described polynomial time algorithms for cases when the value function has some geometric meaning, such as when it measures the area of the convex hull of a subset of  points. There’s probably a lot more to be done in the same direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Patrick Schnider’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.56">Ham-Sandwich cuts and center transversals in subspaces</a>” has some partial results towards a conjectured generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_sandwich_theorem">ham sandwich theorem</a>: given  probability distributions in -dimensional Euclidean space, it should be possible to find  hyperplanes whose checkerboard partition of space simultaneously bisects all of the distributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jie Xue spoke on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.60">Near-optimal algorithms for shortest paths in weighted unit-disk graphs</a>” (with Haitao Wang). Here “weighted” means that overlapping unit disks are connected by an edge whose length is the Euclidean distance between their centers. Previous methods obtained near-linear algorithms by using bichromatic closest pair data structures to simulate Dijkstra’s algorithm. Instead, Wang and Xue use a related relaxation algorithm that partitions the plane into a grid and at each step relaxes all edges between certain pairs of grid squares, using data structures for additively weighted nearest neighbors. By avoiding the overhead of closest pairs they shave several logs from the runtime.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Arnaud de Mesmay spoke again towards the end of the conference on “<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2019.49">The unbearable hardness of unknotting</a>”, with Yo’av Rieck, Eric Sedgwick, and Martin Tancer. They used a reduction from 3-satisfiability, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopf_link">Hopf links</a> for variables and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borromean_rings">Borromean links</a> for clauses (connected to each other by ribbons), to prove that it’s NP-complete to find an unlinked subset of a link with a maximum number of components. By a second level of replacement that doubles the strands of each link, they also showed that it’s NP-complete to find the minimum number of crossing changes or of Reidemeister moves to unlink a link or to unknot a knot.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon I went to the workshop on open problems. After the obligatory open problem session, we debated whether we should collect problems on <a href="https://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/">The Open Problems Project</a>, <a href="http://www.openproblemgarden.org/">The Open Problem Garden</a>, or some new system that, since it doesn’t exist, can be more perfect than anything that does. Then I switched to the Young Researcher’s Forum (unfortunately missing the open problem implementation challenge); at the YRF, my student Daniel Frishberg spoke about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06875">our work on using nearest neighbor chains to speed up greedy algorithms</a>.</p>

<p>The invited talks on Wednesday and Friday were by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Bruce Donald, respectively. Dasgupta spoke on using concepts from geometric data structures to interpret the neural structure of the olfactory system in fruit flies (and hopefully, eventually, vice versa: to use our understanding of neural structures to develop new data structures). For instance, the first three layers of neurons in this system appear to implement an “expand-and-sparsify” data structure that represents low-dimensional normalized vectors by randomly mapping them to much higher dimensional vectors and then listing as a set a smaller number of high-value coordinates. This appears to be closely analogous to known methods for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing">locality-sensitive hashing</a>.  Donald spoke on using geometric methods to represent and infer the shapes of proteins, and to design proteins with desired shapes and functions.</p>

<p>Wednesday evening was the conference banquet, at the famed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ballroom_(Portland,_Oregon)">Crystal Ballroom</a>, conveniently located near Powell’s Books. Matthew Dickerson showed up (after many years absence from SoCG) and brought some musical family members for a live concert.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Marquee for Michael Dickerson and Shaky Situation" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/portland/ShakySituation-m.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;"/></p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon I stopped by the workshop on algebraic methods where I had the pleasure of seing Josh Zahl give his talk on a whiteboard instead of using prepared slides. It was on methods for proving bounds on the number of incidences among geometric objects by combining naive bounds based on forbidden complete bipartite subgraphs of the incidence graphs, cuttings of space into smaller regions within which one applies these naive bounds, and cuttings of the objects into pieces in order to make the forbidden subgraphs smaller.</p>

<p>The conference business meeting was also Thursday, and ran very smoothly.
Next year SoCG will be in Zurich; the year after that, in Buffalo. We now have an officially incorporated society, <a href="http://www.computational-geometry.org/society/index.html">The Society for Computational Geometry</a>, so that we can maintain buffer funds for the conference from one year to the next; it will be supported by an increase of $30-$35 in non-student registration fees. And the attendees voted overwhelmingly in favor of both <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">the SafeTOC anti-harassment guidelines</a> and ensuring and better advertising the availability of childcare at future conferences.</p>

<p>The conference was dedicated to the memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Pollack">Ricky Pollack</a>, but it also included a celebration on Friday of a living computational geometer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hershberger">John Hershberger</a>, who led the effort to bring SoCG to Oregon, and turned 60 just before the conference began. Happy birthday, John!</p>

The context is as follows: in a <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09353">STOC 2018 paper</a> followed by a <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08647">COLT 2019 paper</a>, the following corruption model was discussed: stochastic bandits, except for <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> rounds which are adversarial. The state of the art bounds were of the form: optimal (or almost optimal) stochastic term plus <img alt="K C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-189063850ed2dd251e3453bcdf72bb1f_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="30"/>, and it was mentioned as an open problem whether <img alt="KC" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a11b6676b92ebe2d33985ebf5d9107fe_l3.png?resize=30%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="30"/> could be improved to <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> (there is a lower bound showing that <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-eda88fce4ab12a676aa4baf036291115_l3.png?resize=14%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> is necessary — when <img alt="C = O(\sqrt{T})" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="20" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7a63a8eb07aa9c2f39df62272d6a867e_l3.png?resize=92%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="92"/>). As was discussed in the comment section, it seemed that indeed this clean best of both worlds approach should certainly shed light on the corruption model. It turns out that this is indeed the case, and a one-line calculation resolves positively the open problem from the COLT paper. The formal result is as follows (recall the notation/definitions from <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/">the previous blog post</a>):</p>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Quanta of Solace</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In Quanta magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise? The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In <em>Quanta</em> magazine, Kevin Hartnett has a recent article entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-nevens-law-describe-quantum-computings-rise-20190618/">A New Law to Describe Quantum Computing’s Rise?</a>  The article discusses “Neven’s Law”—a conjecture, by Hartmut Neven (head of Google’s quantum computing effort), that the number of integrated qubits is now increasing exponentially with time, so that the difficulty of simulating a state-of-the-art QC on a fixed classical computer is increasing <em>doubly</em> exponentially with time.  (Jonathan Dowling tells me that he expressed the same thought years ago.)</p>



<p>Near the end, the <em>Quanta</em> piece quotes some UT Austin professor whose surname starts with a bunch of A’s as follows:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“I think the undeniable reality of this progress puts the ball firmly in the court of those who believe scalable quantum computing can’t work.   They’re the ones who need to articulate where and why the progress will stop.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The quote is perfectly accurate, but in context, it might give the impression that I’m endorsing Neven’s Law.  In reality, I’m reluctant to fit a polynomial or an exponential or any other curve through a set of numbers that so far hasn’t exceeded about 50.  I say only that, regardless of what anyone believes is the ultimate rate of progress in QC, what’s already happened today puts the ball firmly in the skeptics’ court.</p>



<p>Also in <em>Quanta</em>, Anil Ananthaswamy has a new article out on <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-turn-a-quantum-computer-into-the-ultimate-randomness-generator-20190619/">How to Turn a Quantum Computer Into the Ultimate Randomness Generator</a>.  This piece covers two schemes for using a quantum computer to generate “certified random bits”—that is, bits you can <em>prove</em> are random to a faraway skeptic.  one due to me, the other due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00640">Brakerski et al</a>.  The article cites my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">paper with Lijie Chen</a>, which shows that under suitable computational assumptions, the outputs in my protocol are hard to spoof using a classical computer.  The randomness aspect will be addressed in a paper that I’m currently writing; for now, see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">these slides</a>.</p>



<p>As long as I’m linking to interesting recent <em>Quanta</em> articles, Erica Klarreich has <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-disproves-hedetniemis-graph-theory-conjecture-20190617/">A 53-Year-Old Network Coloring Conjecture is Disproved</a>.  Briefly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedetniemi%27s_conjecture">Hedetniemi’s Conjecture</a> stated that, given any two finite, undirected graphs G and H, the chromatic number of the tensor product G⊗H is just the minimum of the chromatic numbers of G and H themselves.  This reasonable-sounding conjecture has now been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02167">falsified</a> by Yaroslav Shitov.  For more, see also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/sansation-in-the-morning-news-yaroslav-shitov-counterexamples-to-hedetniemis-conjecture/">this post by Gil Kalai</a>—who appears here <em>not</em> in his capacity as a quantum computing skeptic.</p>



<p>In interesting math news beyond <em>Quanta</em> magazine, the Berkeley alumni magazine has a piece about the crucial, neglected topic of <a href="https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2019-06-14/chalk-market-where-mathematicians-go-get-good-stuff">mathematicians’ love for Hagoromo-brand chalk</a> (hat tip: Peter Woit).  I can personally vouch for this.  When I moved to UT Austin three years ago, most offices in CS had whiteboards, but I deliberately chose one with a blackboard.  I figured that chalk has its problems—it breaks, the dust gets all over—but I could live with them, much more than I could live with the Fundamental Whiteboard Difficulty, of all the available markers always being dry whenever you want to explain anything.  With the Hagoromo brand, though, you pretty much get all the benefits of chalk with none of the downsides, so it just strictly dominates whiteboards.</p>



<p>Jan Kulveit asked me to advertise the <a href="https://espr-camp.org/">European Summer Program on Rationality</a> (ESPR), which will take place this August 13-23, and which is aimed at students ages 16-19.  I’ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">lectured</a> both at ESPR and at a similar summer program that ESPR was modeled after (called SPARC)—and while I was never there as a student, it looked to me like a phenomenal experience.   So if you’re a 16-to-19-year-old who reads this blog, please consider applying!</p>



<p>I’m now at the end of my annual family trip to Tel Aviv, returning to the Eastern US tonight, and then on to <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/stocprogram.html">STOC’2019</a> at the <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">ACM Federated Computing Research Conference</a> in Phoenix (which I can blog about if anyone wants me to).  It was a good trip, although marred by my two-year-old son Daniel falling onto sun-heated metal and suffering a second-degree burn on his leg, and then by the doctor botching the treatment.  Fortunately Daniel’s now healing nicely.  For future reference, whenever bandaging a burn wound, <em>be sure</em> to apply lots of Vaseline to prevent the bandage from drying out, and also to change the bandage daily.  Accept no fancy-sounding substitute.</p></div>

    <title>The Urban/Rural Collegiality Divide</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div>
Just a reminder that Grigory Yaroslavtsev has <a href="http://grigory.us/blog/theory-jobs-2019/">taken over</a> the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oegc0quwv2PqoR_pzZlUIrPw4rFsZ4FKoKkUvmLBTHM/edit?usp=sharing">Theory Jobs Spreadsheet</a>. Check out who is moving where and let everyone know where you will continue your research career.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
In 1999 when I considered leaving the University of Chicago for NEC Research I had a conversation with Bob Zimmer, then VP of Research and current U of C President. Zimmer said it was a shame I didn't live in Hyde Park, the Chicago South Side neighborhood where the university resides, and thus not fully connected with the school. At the time I didn't fully understand his point and did leave for NEC, only to return in 2003 and leave again in 2008. I never did live in Hyde Park.<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Recently I served on a review committee for a computer science department in a rural college town. You couldn't help but notice the great collegiality among the faculty. Someone told me their theory that you generally get more faculty collegiality in rural versus urban locations. Why?</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
In urban locations faculty tend to live further from campus, to get bigger homes and better schools, and face more traffic. They are likely to have more connections with people unconnected with the university. There are more consulting opportunities in large cities, a larger variety of coffee houses to hang out in and better connected airports make leaving town easier. Particularly in computer science, where you can do most of your research remotely, faculty will find themselves less likely to come in every day and you lose those constant informal connections with the rest of the faculty. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
This is a recent phenomenon, even going back to when I was a young faculty you needed to come to the office for access to research papers, better computers to write papers, good printers. Interactions with students and colleagues is always better in person but in the past the methods of electronic communication proved more limiting.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
The University of Chicago helped create and promote its own neighborhood and ran a very strong private school with reduced tuition for faculty children. Maybe my life would have been different had I immersed myself in that lifestyle. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Or maybe we should go the other extreme. If we can find great ways to do on-line meetings and teaching, why do we need the physical university at all?</div></div>
