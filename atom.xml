    <title>How have computers changed society? Harry Lewis (with co-authors) have a book out on that.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> (Disclosure - Harry Lewis was my PhD advisor.)</p><p><br/></p><p>It seems like just a few weeks ago I I blogged about a book of Harry Lewis's that was recently available (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/08/what-are-most-important-46-papers-in.html">here</a>).  And now I am blogging about another one. Writing two books in two years seems hard! I can only think of one other computer scientist who has done that recently (see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B08BJ4G2Z1/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1626492618&amp;sr=8-2">here</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279729/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=gasarch+point&amp;qid=1626492655&amp;sr=8-2">here</a>).</p><p><br/></p><p>In 2008 Abelson, Ledeen, and Lewis wrote </p><p><i>Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness after the Digital Explosion</i></p><p>which I reviewed in SIGACT news, see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/bitsbook.pdf">here</a></p><p><br/></p><p>Both computers and society have changed since 2008. Hence an update was needed. </p><p>In 2021 Adelson, Ledeen, Lewis, and Seltzer wrote a second edition.</p><p><br/></p><p>Should you buy the new version if you bought the old version? </p><p>1) Not my problem- I got them both for free since I reviewed them. </p><p>2) Not your problem- The second edition is available free-on-line <a href="https://www.bitsbook.com/thebook/">here</a>. Is that a link to some dark corner of the dark web? No, its the formal webpage about the book. So the book is available free-on-line legally, if you care (and even if you don't care). </p><p>3) If you like paper, the book is on amazon. (If you don't like paper, the book is still on amazon). </p><p><br/></p><p>I reviewed it in SIGACT news. A non-paywalled link: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/b2bits2.pdf">here</a> (is that link legal? I have no idea.) </p><p>In this post I'll just mention two things that changed since the last book</p><p>1) Shared Music and pirating were an issue back in 2008.  It does not seem to be anymore since there is now a variety of services that seem to make pirating not worth it: itunes, streaming services, and some bands give it away for free and ask you to pay what its worth. Movies are still struggling with this issue. </p><p>2) AI systems that reinforce existing bias is a new problem.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Improved quantum lower and upper bounds for matrix scaling</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1633219200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gribling:Sander.html">Sander Gribling</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nieuwboer:Harold.html">Harold Nieuwboer</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15282">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Matrix scaling is a simple to state, yet widely applicable linear-algebraic
problem: the goal is to scale the rows and columns of a given non-negative
matrix such that the rescaled matrix has prescribed row and column sums.
Motivated by recent results on first-order quantum algorithms for matrix
scaling, we investigate the possibilities for quantum speedups for classical
second-order algorithms, which comprise the state-of-the-art in the classical
setting.
</p>
<p>We first show that there can be essentially no quantum speedup in terms of
the input size in the high-precision regime: any quantum algorithm that solves
the matrix scaling problem for $n \times n$ matrices with at most $m$ non-zero
entries and with $\ell_2$-error $\varepsilon=\widetilde\Theta(1/m)$ must make
$\widetilde\Omega(m)$ queries to the matrix, even when the success probability
is exponentially small in $n$. Additionally, we show that for
$\varepsilon\in[1/n,1/2]$, any quantum algorithm capable of producing
$\frac{\varepsilon}{100}$-$\ell_1$-approximations of the row-sum vector of a
(dense) normalized matrix uses $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ queries, and that there
exists a constant $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$ for which this problem takes
$\Omega(n^{1.5})$ queries.
</p>
<p>To complement these results we give improved quantum algorithms in the
low-precision regime: with quantum graph sparsification and amplitude
estimation, a box-constrained Newton method can be sped up in the
large-$\varepsilon$ regime, and outperforms previous quantum algorithms. For
entrywise-positive matrices, we find an $\varepsilon$-$\ell_1$-scaling in time
$\widetilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^2)$, whereas the best previously known bounds
were $\widetilde O(n^2\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ (classical) and
$\widetilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^3)$ (quantum).

    <title>Blazing a Trail via Matrix Multiplications: A Faster Algorithm for Non-shortest Induced Paths</title>

an induced $uv$-path of $G$ that is not a shortest $uv$-path of $G$. Berger,
Seymour, and Spirkl gave the previously only known polynomial-time algorithm,
running in $O(n^{18})$ time, to either output a $uv$-trail of $G$ or ensure
that $G$ admits no~$uv$-trail. We reduce the complexity to the time required to
perform a poly-logarithmic number of multiplications of $n^2\times n^2$ Boolean
matrices, leading to a largely improved $O(n^{4.75})$-time algorithm.

    <title>Submodular Optimization Beyond Nonnegativity: Adaptive Seed Selection in Incentivized Social Advertising</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1633219200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Tang:Shaojie.html">Shaojie Tang</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/y/Yuan:Jing.html">Jing Yuan</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.15180">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The idea of social advertising (or social promotion) is to select a group of
influential individuals (a.k.a \emph{seeds}) to help promote some products or
ideas through an online social networks. There are two major players in the
social advertising ecosystem: advertiser and platform. The platform sells viral
engagements such as "like"s to advertisers by inserting their ads into the feed
of seeds. These seeds receive monetary incentives from the platform in exchange
for their participation in the social advertising campaign. Once an ad is
engaged by a follower of some seed, the platform receives a fixed amount of
payment, called cost per engagement, from the advertiser. The ad could
potentially attract more engagements from followers' followers and trigger a
viral contagion. At the beginning of a campaign, the advertiser submits a
budget to the platform and this budget can be used for two purposes: recruiting
seeds and paying for the viral engagements generated by the seeds. Note that
the first part of payment goes to the seeds and the latter one is the actual
revenue collected by the platform. In this setting, the problem for the
platform is to recruit a group of seeds such that she can collect the largest
possible amount of revenue subject to the budget constraint. We formulate this
problem as a seed selection problem whose objective function is non-monotone
and it might take on negative values, making existing results on submodular
optimization and influence maximization not applicable to our setting. We study
this problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings. Although we focus
on social advertising in this paper, our results apply to any optimization
problems whose objective function is the expectation of the minimum of a
stochastic submodular function and a linear function.

mechanisms that self-optimize in a demand-aware manner. At the heart of our
approach lies a self-adjusting linear list data structure, where unlike in the
classic data structure, there are dependencies, and some items must be in front
of the others; for example, to correctly classify packets by rules arranged in
a linked list, each rule must be in front of lower priority rules that overlap
with it. After each access we can rearrange the list, similarly to
Move-To-Front, but dependencies need to be respected.
</p>
<p>We present a 4-competitive online rearrangement algorithm, whose cost is at
most four times worse than the optimal offline algorithm; no deterministic
algorithm can be better than 3-competitive. The algorithm is simple and
attractive, especially for memory-limited systems, as it does not require any
additional memory (e.g., neither timestamps nor frequency statistics). Our
approach can simply be deployed as a drop-in replacement for a static
datastructure, potentially benefitting many existing networks.
</p>
<p>We evaluate our self-adjusting list packet classifier on realistic ruleset
and traffic instances. We find that our classifier performs similarly to a
static list for low-locality traffic, but significantly outperforms Efficuts
(by a factor 7x), CutSplit (3.6x), and the static list (14x) for high locality
and small rulesets. Memory consumption is 10x lower on average compared to
Efficuts and CutSplit.

and consider the setting where any agent is allowed to introduce diversity
constraints on the items they are allocated. We motivate this via settings
where the items themselves correspond to user ad slots or task workers with
attributes such as race and gender on which the principal seeks to achieve
demographic parity. We consider the following question: When an agent expresses
diversity constraints into an allocation rule, is the allocation of other
agents hurt significantly? If this happens, the cost of introducing such
constraints is disproportionately borne by agents who do not benefit from
diversity. We codify this via two desiderata capturing robustness. These are no
negative externality -- other agents are not hurt -- and monotonicity -- the
agent enforcing the constraint does not see a large increase in value. We show
in a formal sense that the Nash Welfare rule that maximizes product of agent
values is uniquely positioned to be robust when diversity constraints are
introduced, while almost all other natural allocation rules fail this
criterion. We also show that the guarantees achieved by Nash Welfare are nearly
optimal within a widely studied class of allocation rules. We finally perform
an empirical simulation on real-world data that models ad allocations to show
that this gap between Nash Welfare and other rules persists in the wild.

drawings. In this paper we consider good drawings, i.e., we require that any
two edges have at most one common point which can be a common vertex or a
crossing. Our main result is that there is a polynomial time algorithm to
compute an 8-approximation of the bundled crossing number of a good drawing (up
to adding a term depending on the facial structure of the drawing). In the
special case of circular drawings the approximation factor is 8 (no extra
term), this improves upon the 10-approximation of Fink et al. (Bundled
crossings in embedded graphs, Proc. Latin'16). Our approach also works with the
same approximation factor for families of pseudosegments, i.e., curves
intersecting at most once. We also show how to compute a 9/2-approximation when
the intersection graph of the pseudosegments is bipartite.

$(\Delta+1)$-coloring, degeneracy-coloring, coloring triangle-free graphs, and
others. These algorithms are all randomized in crucial ways and whether or not
there is any deterministic analogue of them has remained an important open
question in this line of work.
</p>
<p>We settle this fundamental question by proving that there is no deterministic
single-pass semi-streaming algorithm that given a graph $G$ with maximum degree
$\Delta$, can output a proper coloring of $G$ using any number of colors which
is sub-exponential in $\Delta$. Our proof is based on analyzing the multi-party
communication complexity of a related communication game, using random graph
theory type arguments that may be of independent interest.
</p>
<p>We complement our lower bound by showing that just one extra pass over the
input allows one to recover an $O(\Delta^2)$ coloring via a deterministic
semi-streaming algorithm. This result is further extended to an $O(\Delta)$
coloring in $O(\log{\Delta})$ passes even in dynamic streams.

pattern graph in a host graph. The recent progress on this problem has not
included complete pattern graphs, i.e., cliques (and their complements, i.e.,
edge-free pattern graphs, in the induced setting). The fastest algorithms for
the aforementioned patterns are based on a straightforward reduction to
triangle detection/counting. We provide an alternative method of
detection/counting copies of fixed size cliques based on a multi-dimensional
matrix product. It is at least as time efficient as the triangle method in
cases of $K_4$ and $K_5.$ The complexity of the multi-dimensional matrix
product is of interest in its own rights. We provide also another alternative
method for detection/counting $K_r$ copies, again time efficient for $r\in \{
4,\ 5 \}$.

$\subseteq$ $\oplus$P (and thus that FewP $\subseteq$ $\oplus$P). In this
paper, we note that there is a tension between the nondeterministic ambiguity
of the class one is seeking to capture, and the density (or, to be more
precise, the needed "nongappy"-ness) of the easy-to-find "targets" used in
iterative constant-setting. In particular, we show that even less restrictive
gap-size upper bounds regarding the targets allow one to capture
ambiguity-limited classes. Through a flexible, metatheorem-based approach, we
do so for a wide range of classes including the logarithmic-ambiguity version
of Valiant's unambiguous nondeterminism class UP. Our work lowers the bar for
what advances regarding the existence of infinite, P-printable sets of primes
would suffice to show that restricted counting classes based on the primes have
the power to accept superconstant-ambiguity analogues of UP. As an application
of our work, we prove that the Lenstra-Pomerance-Wagstaff Conjecture implies
that all O(loglogn)-ambiguity NP sets are in the restricted counting class $\rm
RC_{PRIMES}$.

decompositional parameters such as treewidth or clique-width have so far
traditionally been tailored to specific width parameters. Moreover, for
mim-width, no efficient algorithms for computing good decompositions were
known, even under highly restrictive parameterizations. In this work we
identify F-branchwidth as a class of generic decompositional parameters that
can capture mim-width, treewidth, clique-width as well as other measures. We
show that while there is an infinite number of F-branchwidth parameters, only a
handful of these are asymptotically distinct. We then develop fixed-parameter
and kernelization algorithms (under several structural parameterizations) that
can compute every possible F-branchwidth, providing a unifying framework that
can efficiently obtain near-optimal tree-decompositions, k-expressions, as well
as optimal mim-width decompositions.

    <title>Generating fibbinary numbers, three ways</title>
    <summary>I just added to Wikipedia two articles on the Jordan–Pólya numbers and fibbinary numbers, two integer sequences used in my recent paper on Egyptian fractions. Jordan–Pólya numbers are the products of factorials, while the fibbinary numbers are the ones with binary representations having no two consecutive 1’s. The OEIS page on the fibbinary numbers, A003714, lists many ways of generating this sequence algorithmically, of which most are boring or slow (generate all binary numbers and test which ones belong to the sequence; you can test if a variable x is fibbinary by checking that x&amp;(x&gt;&gt;1) is zero). I thought it might be interesting to highlight two of those methods that are a little more clever and generate these numbers in small numbers of operations.</summary>

I thought it might be interesting to highlight two of those methods that are a little more clever and generate these numbers in small numbers of operations.</p>

<p>Some functional languages, and in part Python even though it’s mostly not functional, have a notion of a stream, a potentially infinite sequence of values generated by a coroutine. In Python, you can program these using <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">simple generators</a> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yield</code> keyword. I wrote here long ago about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2011/10/02/generating-permutations-with.html">methods for using generators recursively</a>: a generator can call itself, manipulate the resulting sequence of values, and pass them on to its output. It’s actually a very old idea, used for instance to generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_number">regular numbers</a> by Dijkstra <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~black/AdvancedProgramming/Lectures/Smalltalk%20II/Dijkstra%20on%20Hamming%27s%20Problem.pdf">in his 1976 book <em>A Discipline of Programming</em></a>. Reinhard Zumkeller used the same idea to generate the fibbinary numbers in Haskell, based on the observation that the sequence of positive fibbinary numbers can be generated, starting from the number 1, by two operations, doubling smaller values or replacing a smaller value \(x\) with \(4x+1\). Here is is, translated into Python:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">heapq</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">merge</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">affine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stream</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">stream</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="n">b</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">merge</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">affine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fibbinary</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="n">affine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fibbinary</span><span class="p">(),</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)):</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It’s elegant, but has a couple of minor flaws. First, it omits the number \(0\), and while it can be modified to include \(0\), the modifications make the code messier. But second, it takes more than a constant amount of time per element to generate each sequence element. A fibbinary number \(x\) has to be generated from a sequence of smaller elements by repeated doubling and quadrupling, and that takes \(\log x\) steps per element. Even if we assume those steps to take constant time each, generating the first \(n\) elements in this way takes time \(\Theta(n\log n)\). It’s better than the \(\Theta(n^{\log_\varphi 2})\approx n^{1.44}\) that you would get from generate-and-test, but still not as good as we might hope for. One way to fix this would be to memoize the generator, so that the recursive calls look at a stored copy of the sequence generated by the outer call rather than generating the same sequence redundantly, but this again makes the code messier and also takes more storage than necessary.</p>

<p>Instead, Jörg Arndt observed that you can generate each fibbinary number directly from the previous one by a process closely resembling binary addition. Adding one to a binary number sets the first available bit from zero to one, and zeros out all the smaller bits; here, a bit is available if it is already zero. Finding the next fibbinary number does the same thing, but with a different definition of availability: a bit is available if both it and the next larger bit are zero. We can find the available bit using binary addition on a modified word that fills in bits whose neighbor is nonzero. Using this idea, we can generate the fibbinary numbers in a constant number of bitwise binary word-level operations per number. Here it is again in Python, translated from Arndt’s C++ and simplified based on <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@efroach76/107037399683569338">a comment by efroach76</a>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">~</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="n">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It’s even possible to use the same idea to generate the fibbinary numbers in a constant amortized number of bit-level operations per number, although this ends up being a little less efficient in practice because high-level languages end up translating all these bit operations into word operations anyway.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">fibbinary</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">yield</span> <span class="n">x</span>
        <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;=~</span> <span class="n">y</span>
            <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">|=</span> <span class="n">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The inner loop ends immediately at fibbinary numbers whose successor is odd (at positions given by the ones of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_word">Fibonacci word</a>), whose fraction of the total is \(1-1/\varphi\approx 0.382\), where \(\varphi\) is the golden ratio. It ends in two steps for the remaining values when their next bit is odd, in the same proportion, and so on. So the average number of steps for the inner loop adds in a geometric series to \(O(1)\).</p>

    <title>TR21-142 |  Mixing of 3-term progressions in Quasirandom Groups  | 

	Amey Bhangale, 

	Prahladh Harsha, 

	Sourya Roy</title>
    <summary>In this note, we show the mixing of three-term progressions $(x, xg, xg^2)$ in every finite quasirandom group, fully answering a question of Gowers. More precisely, we show that for any $D$-quasirandom group $G$ and any three sets $A_1, A_2, A_3 \subset G$, we have
\[ \left|\Pr_{x,y\sim G}\left[ x \in A_1, xy \in A_2, xy^2 \in A_3\right] - \prod_{i=1}^3 \Pr_{x\sim G}\left[x \in A_i\right] \right| \leq \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{D}}\right)^{\frac14}.\] 
Prior to this, Tao answered this question when the underlying quasirandom group is $\mathrm{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Subsequently, Peluse extended the result to all nonabelian finite simple groups. In this work, we show that a slight modification of Peluse's argument is sufficient to fully resolve Gower's quasirandom conjecture for 3-term progressions. Surprisingly, unlike the proofs of Tao and Peluse, our proof is elementary and only uses basic facts from nonabelian Fourier analysis.</summary>

There is a sense of tangible joy among the participants just to be sharing the same physical space, let alone the fantastic environs of the Institute. The renewed energy is all there to witness in the programs this semester on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/si2021"><u>Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference</u></a> (CCSI) and <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/gmos2021"><u>Geometric Methods in Optimization and Sampling</u></a> (GMOS), both of which are now in full swing. Although masking is maintained, it doesn’t seem to change the quintessential Simons program experience even a little bit. I am referring, of course, to the constant feeling of missing out on all the incredibly interesting activities going on, much of which one is unable to fit into their schedule.</p>



<p>At least some of the palpable energy can be attributed to over 40 postdocs and research fellows who have arrived at the Institute this semester, many of whom will stay on for a year or two. This extraordinary group of young researchers covers the whole gamut of topics, ranging from cryptography, quantum computing, and fairness to machine learning, data structures, algorithms, and complexity theory. Each of these postdocs and fellows gave a 10-minute presentation at the “Meet the Fellows’’ welcome event that the Institute held on September 8 and 9. Check out their <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/meet-fellows-welcome-event-wednesday-schedule"><u>talks</u></a> for glimpses of the cutting edge in all these subfields of theory.</p>



<p><strong>An advance in algebraic circuit complexity</strong><br/>
	This time around, there is some good news from the front lines on circuit complexity, one of the most challenging arenas within theoretical computer science.</p>



<p>An algebraic circuit consists of gates, each of which carries out either addition or multiplication over some field, say real numbers. The depth of the circuit is the length of the longest path from the output to one of its inputs. Naturally, an algebraic circuit computes a polynomial over its inputs.</p>



<p>In the world of Boolean circuits with AND/OR/NOT gates, lower bounds against constant depth circuits, aka AC0 circuit lower bounds, have been known since the 1980s and are one of the most influential results in complexity theory. For general algebraic circuits over a large field (say reals), even superpolynomial lower bounds for depth three circuits had remained elusive. In a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/081/">remarkable paper</a>, Nutan Limaye, Srikanth Srinivasan, and Sébastien Tavenas have obtained the first superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of all constant depths over fields of characteristic zero (say reals). Furthermore, the lower-bound result is shown for a simple polynomial known as “iterated matrix multiplication” whose input consists of \(d\) matrices \(X_1,\ldots,X_d\) of dimension \(n \times n\), and the goal is to compute a fixed entry of their product \(X_1 \cdot X_2 \cdots X_d\). The same work also obtains a depth hierarchy theorem for algebraic circuits showing that for every depth <em>D</em>, there is an explicit polynomial that can be computed by a depth <em>D</em> circuit of size <em>s</em>, but requires circuits of size superpolynomial in <em>s</em> if the depth is <em>D</em>-1.</p>



<p><strong>Remarkable work of Matthew Brennan</strong><br/> The theory community suffered a terrible loss this year with the tragic and untimely passing of one of our rising stars, Matthew Brennan. While still a graduate student at MIT, Matthew almost single-handedly pushed forward an ambitious research program at the intersection of computational complexity and statistics. Here we will try to give a glimpse of Matthew’s extensive body of research.</p>



<span id="more-595"/>



<p/>



<p>To set the context, traditionally the field of computational complexity has been concerned with characterizing how much memory or computational power is needed, while statistics sheds light on how much data are needed. The interplay between computational and statistical resources and their underlying trade-offs is only recently coming into focus.</p>



<p>Many statistical estimation tasks exhibit information-computation gaps wherein the accuracy obtained by efficient algorithms is strictly worse than the estimate that one could in principle extract from the data if there were no computational limitations. In other problems, there is an apparent trade-off between the number of samples needed for an estimation task and the computational power of the estimation algorithm.</p>



<p>Identifying and rigorously establishing the presence of these information-computation trade-offs is a fundamental challenge that has drawn much interest in theoretical computer science and statistics. To rigorously establish an information-computation gap, one would need to prove lower bounds against efficient algorithms for statistical estimation problems.</p>



<p>Here on, there are two routes that one could take. First, one can prove limitations for specific classes of algorithms like MCMC, spectral methods, semidefinite programming, statistical queries, and so on. This approach has been highly successful, yielding precise lower bounds in many models and numerous relations discovered between the models.</p>



<p>Alternatively, one can take the grander route: assume the intractability of a well-studied computational problem and use <em>reductions</em> to establish hardness of the statistical estimation problem at hand. In a seminal work, Berthet and Rigollet showed a reduction from the planted clique problem to the sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), thereby establishing the presence of an information-computation gap for a version of sparse PCA.</p>



<p>In its most canonical setup, the input to the sparse PCA problem consists of samples from a \(d\)-dimensional Gaussian with covariance \(\Sigma = I_d + \theta vv^T\), where \(v\) is a \(k\)-sparse unit vector and \(\theta\) denotes the signal strength. A simple hypothesis testing variant of the problem asks to distinguish \(n\) samples drawn from this spiked covariance matrix and \(n\) samples drawn from the standard Gaussian distribution.</p>



<p>Notice that statistical estimation problems like sparse PCA are most interesting when their inputs are drawn from some natural distribution like the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, a reduction from a hard problem <em>A</em> to a statistical estimation problem <em>B</em> will not only have to map instances of <em>A</em> to instances of <em>B</em>, but also have to produce the right distribution over instances of <em>B</em>. For example, ideally a reduction from planted clique to sparse PCA must map instances of planted clique (random graphs with cliques) to random vectors drawn from an appropriate Gaussian measure. How could a reduction ever do this, one might ask.</p>



<p>In fact, this is why one might decide not to take the grand route of using reductions to understand the complexity of statistical problems. While reductions have been exceptionally successful in establishing tight hardness results for <em>NP</em>-complete optimization problems, building a similar web of reductions for statistical problems like sparse PCA seemed hopeless to me. Not for Matthew, who courageously took this challenge head-on and succeeded!</p>



<p>Despite efforts following the seminal work of Berthet and Rigollet, showing a tight hardness result for sparse PCA in its most canonical Gaussian setup seemed out of reach. In a series of works, Matthew and coauthors developed a set of simple reduction tools that when put together led to a tight characterization of the complexity of the sparse PCA problem in its most canonical setup, over the entire range of parameters!</p>



<p>More recently, Matthew and his advisor, Guy Bresler, proposed a generalized planted clique conjecture referred to as “secret leakage planted clique” that can serve as a starting point for a web of reductions encompassing a variety of problems such as tensor PCA, robust sparse mean estimation, and semirandom community recovery. Not only have these works developed a set of useful reduction techniques for statistical problems, but most importantly, they have demonstrated that reductions can indeed be harnessed toward tight hardness results for statistical problems. Matthew was a recipient of the best student paper award at the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) on two separate occasions for this line of work.</p>



<p>Matthew’s work is one of the central themes of this semester’s program on Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference. His work has laid the foundations of a theory of reductions for statistical problems, something for us to build on over the coming years. While his ideas are ever present this semester, his presence at the program is sorely missed.</p></div>

    <title>Being the Chair</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you have Netflix and interested in the academic world, I recommend <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259">The Chair</a>, a six-episode dramatic series starring Sandra Oh as a new English department chair at a "lower tier ivy league university". The series takes many artistic liberties and compresses much in a short time period but gets much about academics right such as the tension between faculty and the administration with the chair caught in the middle, the need to create majors that attract students, faculty past their prime teaching the same courses in the same way for decades, faculty who get themselves in a hole and keep digging, alumni donors controlling academic decisions, pressure to build a diverse faculty, faculty feeling under appreciated and getting outside offers, and a wonderful exposition of how the field has changed over the past thirty years given to someone who had dropped out before finishing their PhD to take on a different career.</p><p>When I served as department chair at Georgia Tech, I dealt with most if not all of these issues above, though not at the same time. I had some challenges that today's English department doesn't face: how to handle enrollments that more than doubled while barely able to hire more faculty than were departing, not that I would trade in a second for the existential crisis that English departments are going through. </p><p>When I left Georgia Tech after seven years, I had outlasted every other current chair in the Colleges of Computing, Science and Engineering. Not sure what this says about me or about Georgia Tech.</p><p>Being chair is the most challenging job in academia. The faculty technically report to you but you aren't their boss in any traditional sense--they came to academia because of the freedom to work on what they want and they won't give it up. It's virtually impossible to fire anyone with tenure. The joke goes that a chair needs two umbrellas, one to block stuff coming from the administration going to the faculty and the other to block the stuff from the faculty from going to the administration. Since I left it has gotten much uglier in the University System of Georgia which has no mask or vaccine mandates and glad I'm not the chair to deal with that.</p><p>This all sounds like I'm discouraging of becoming a department chair and it certainly isn't a job for anyone but it can be a very rewarding job. You can help shape the future of the department by the faculty you hire and the vision you set and create an environment that helps your faculty and students succeed. </p></div>

<p>
Maryna Viazovska was the first person to prove an exact bound on sphere packing in a dimension higher than 3. She <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04246.pdf">achieved</a> this for dimension 8 in 2016 by making an improvement of <b>0.00001</b> over one previous <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/annals-v157-n2-p09.pdf">paper</a> by Henry Cohn and Noam Elkies. This also led to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06518.pdf">solution</a> in dimension 24, joint with Cohn and Abhinav Kumar, Stephen Miller, and Danylo Radchenko.</p>
<p>
Today we talk about partial progress—baby steps—and its relation to solving conjectures.</p>
<p>
This post is a continuation of our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">thoughts</a> about how those who claim to have solved a major problem almost always claim to have solved the whole thing in one large leap. We’ve thought about declaring a rule that any claim on a major open problem, at least about complexity lower bounds, must first be a <em>partial result</em>. We will give concrete suggestions in that direction at the end. But on reflection, we’ll curb the dogmatics a little.</p>
<p>
In her 2016 <em>Quanta</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/sphere-packing-solved-in-higher-dimensions-20160330">article</a> on Viazovska’s breakthrough, Erica Klarreich quotes Peter Sarnak:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “It’s stunningly simple, as all great things are. You just start reading the paper and you know this is correct.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We hasten to add that the paper’s correctness is evident amid the context that others had established over the previous two decades, going back at least to Thomas Hales’s voluminous proof of Johannes Kepler’s conjecture for dimension 3. To quote Klarreich:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Researchers have known for more than a decade what the missing ingredient in the proof [of optimality for dimensions 8 and 24] should be—an “auxiliary” function that can calculate the largest allowable sphere density—but they couldn’t find the right function. … [F]inding the right modular form allowed Viazovska to prove [the case of 8] in a mere 23 pages. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus Viazovska brought in a new tool to the problem, <em>modular forms</em>, which had already proved their merit in resolving the Fermat conjecture. But she still needed to choose the right modular form among many candidates. Klarreich quotes her as saying it is difficult even just to explain how she knew which one to use. This brings us back to the challenge of explaining—or debunking—the flash of insight that claimers claim to have. At least in this case, per Sarnak’s quote, the proof was in the pudding.</p>

<p>
To complete the mixing of our original message, the examples we chose happen to involve improvements by tiny amounts. We’ve even understated Viazovska’s above: reckoned against a later <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2009/170-3/p01">paper</a> by Cohn and Elkies, her improvement was </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  0.000000000000000000000000000001. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0.000000000000000000000000000001.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
The recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">post</a> where we discussed the phrase “the proof is in the pudding” involves a number with six more <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>s than that. These are <b>not</b> what we mean by “baby steps.” But let us tell our next story, which also involves Cohn.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Steps Toward Matrix Multiplication </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/11/29/a-breakthrough-on-matrix-product/">covered</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/12/03/the-meaning-of-omega/">other</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/02/01/a-brief-history-of-matrix-product/">work</a> on the exponent <img alt="{\omega}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of matrix product. This means the infimum of all <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that any two <img alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> matrices can be multiplied in <img alt="{O(n^e)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Ee%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> unit operations. In 1990, Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800132">brought</a> <img alt="{\omega}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> down below <img alt="{2.375477}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.375477%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The current best bound <img alt="{\omega &lt; 2.37286}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega+%3C+2.37286%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is from a SODA 2021 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846">paper</a> by Josh Alman and Virginia Williams; its abstract highlights the improvement by <img alt="{0.00001}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.00001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from the previous best.</p>
<p>
In 2005, however, Cohn wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0511460.pdf">paper</a> with Robert Kleinberg, Balazs Szegedy, and Christopher Umans on ideas for taking <img alt="{\omega}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> all the way down to <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in one jump. This diverges from both the reading of “baby step” as “tiny improvement” and our idea meaning limited-but-definite partial progress. Their strategy for the full jump has come in and out of clouds since then. But their paper has motivated the subsequent partial progress in several ways. We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/03/27/fast-matrix-products-and-other-amazing-results/">mentioned</a> this paper <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/30/test-of-time/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/06/22/cricket-400-and-complexity-theory/">times</a>, notably <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/08/30/limits-on-matrix-multiplication/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
The objective need not be <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> versus <img alt="{2.372...}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.372...%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, however. There is a notable milepost just above <img alt="{2.30}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It comes from a STOC 2015 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5414">paper</a> by Andris Ambainis, Yuval Flimus, and François Le Gall. It shows that a wide class of techniques of the kind used since 1990 cannot achieve better than <img alt="{\omega &lt; 2.3078}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega+%3C+2.3078%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </p>
<p>
Other recent <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8360/pdf/LIPIcs-ITCS-2018-25.pdf">work</a> by Alman and Williams shows both a dimension along which the road down to <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> may still be open but other limits in other directions. Even their new <img alt="{0.00001}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.00001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> improvement has new ideas that may be exploited more generally. This is a feature of partial progress that contrasts with what we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">recently</a> about not learning much from whole-jump attempts: partial progress always shows a higher learning curve.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Partial Progress Objectives </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cohn also has a page of informal <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/">thoughts</a> on how to perform research, including <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/advice.html">advice</a> for those who claim to have solved some open problem. We want to add this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Make sure ahead of time that your advance really covers the intermediate ground it jumps through. Even better, walk back your claim a little so that it proves something only a step or so beyond previous knowledge. </em>

    <title>TR21-141 |  On the (im)possibility of branch-and-bound search-to-decision reductions for approximate optimization | 

	Alexander Golovnev, 

	Siyao Guo, 

	Spencer Peters, 

	Noah Stephens-Davidowitz</title>
    <summary>We study a natural and quite general model of branch-and-bound algorithms. In this model, an algorithm attempts to minimize (or maximize) a function $f : D \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ by making oracle queries to a heuristic $h_f$ satisfying 
\[
    \min_{x \in S} f(x) \leq h_f(S) \leq \gamma \cdot \min_{x \in S} f(x)
\]
for some $\gamma \geq 1$ and any subset $S$ in some allowed class of subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of the domain $D$. We show tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries $q$ needed to find even a $\gamma'$-approximate minimizer for quite large $\gamma'$ in a number of interesting settings, as follows.

- For arbitrary functions $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ contains all subsets of the domain, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve $\gamma' \approx\gamma^{n/\log q}$, while a simple greedy algorithm achieves essentially $\gamma^{n/\log q}$.

- For a large class of MAX-CSPs, where $\mathcal{S} := \{ S_w\}$ contains each set of assignments to the variables induced by a partial assignment $w$, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can do significantly better than essentially a random guess, even for  $\gamma \approx 1+\sqrt{\log(q)/n}$.

- For the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), where $\mathcal{S} := \{S_p\}$ contains each set of tours extending a path $p$, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve $\gamma' \approx (\gamma-1) n/\log q$. We also prove a nearly matching upper bound in our model. 

Behind these results is a "useless oracle lemma," which allows us to argue that under certain conditions the heuristic $h_f$ is "useless," and which might be of independent interest.

We also note two alternative interpretations of our model and results. If we interpret the heuristic $h_f$ as an oracle for an approximate decision problem, then our results unconditionally rule out a large and natural class of approximate search-to-decision reductions (which we think of as "branch-and-bound" search-to-decision reductions). We therefore show an oracle model in which approximate search and decision are strongly separated. (In particular, our lower bound for TSP can be viewed as a negative answer to a question posed by Bellare and Goldwasser (SIAM J. Comput. 1994), though only in an oracle model.) By instead interpreting $h_f$ as a data structure, we see that our results unconditionally rule out black-box search-to-decision reductions for data structures.</summary>

    <title>Statistics as algorithmic summarization</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Though a multifaceted and complex discipline, Statistics’ greatest contribution is a rigorous framework for summarization. Statistics gives us reasonable procedures to estimate properties of a general population by examining only a few individuals from the population. In this regard, statistics is algorithmic: it provides randomized algorithms for extrapolation. In this blog, I’ll review some elementary stats (with as little mathematical formalism as possible), and try to crystalize why this algorithmic view is illuminating. In future blogs, I’ll build upon this algorithm perspective in applying it to more interesting examples in experiment design and prediction.</p>

<p>For a simple starter example, we know that every person on Earth has a height, defined as the distance from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head when standing upright. Suppose we would like to know the mean of the height of all living people. This would require us tracking down every living individual, getting out a tape measure, and measuring the distance from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head. To avoid such exhaustive counting we could instead devise an efficient algorithm to estimate this quantity. What if we selected a subset at random, and used this subset to estimate the mean? That is, we could collect a random sample of individuals from the population and measure the average height of all of the individuals in the sample.</p>

<p>The average height measured on this random sample is a random quantity. Thus it must have a mean and variance like we associate with other random quantities. If we were to sample each individual uniformly at random from all living humans, the expected mean height of the sample would be precisely the average height in the general population. Moreover, the variance of the average height of the sample will shrink proportionally to the number of sampled individuals. The more individuals you measure, the closer the average height on the sample will be to the average over the population.</p>

<p>Statistics provides powerful formulas that let us precisely quantify how close the sample average will be to the population average. For instance, we know a person’s height is a positive number and that there are no people who are taller than nine feet. With these two facts, a simple application of a formula called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality"><em>Hoeffding’s inequality</em></a> tells us that if we sample the heights of thirty thousand individuals, our sample average will be within an inch of the true average height with probability at least 83%. This assertion is true no matter how large the population of individuals. The required sample size is dictated only by the variability of height, not by the number of total individuals.</p>

<p>You could replace “height” in this example with almost any attribute that you are able to measure well. For quantities with reasonable variability, a uniform sample from a general population will give a high quality estimate of the average value. Statistics provides a powerful framework to reason about population-level properties by examining properties of small subsets.</p>

<p>In this example, statistics provided an algorithm for estimation. We began with a quantity whose average value we would like to estimate. We specified how much this quantity can vary in the population under study. Using formulas from statistics, we computed the number of individuals we needed to examine in order to have an estimate of appropriate quality. We then can proceed to do our best to extract a random sample of individuals of this size from the population, measure these individuals, and report the mean of the sample. This is a full procedure for estimating the mean value of the general population.</p>

<p>This algorithmic description of statistical summarization probably seems uncontroversial, but it differs from how statistics is often taught or conceptualized. As I’ve discussed in <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">previous</a> <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/21/models-are-wrong/">blogs</a>, the statistical model is oftentimes given highest precedence. In this model-based framing of statistics, the world is governed by probabilistic rules. With enough effort, these rules can be specified by a generative statistical model, and we assume that measurement is equivalent to sampling from this generative model. The generative model will have properties like a mean, and the law-of-large numbers will tell us that if we sample enough times from the model, we can accurately estimate the mean and other properties.</p>

<p>This distinction between modeling the sampling and modeling the population may appear to be splitting hairs. In some sense, the two viewpoints only differ conceptually as the algorithms for estimating the mean height in a population will be identical. However, our interpretation of these two views is different: in the algorithmic view, one can use statistics to understand the physical world no matter how the general population arose. As our height example highlights, only the most minimal modeling assumptions are needed to make use of statistical methods. In the modeling view, we shoehorn ourselves into modeling all processes with probability distributions. Not only is this unnecessary, but validating probabilistic models is also quite difficult. As I described in my last two blog posts (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">1</a>) (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/21/models-are-wrong/">2</a>), proposed statistical models are never validated in the vast majority of scientific studies.</p>

<p>The algorithmic view of statistics moreover illuminates the aspects of randomness that we have under our control. For example, there are whole branches of computer science dedicated to deterministically generating numbers that look random for all intents and purposes. Random number generation is something we can control. We can focus on understanding how our measurements fail to be ideal, rather than focusing on how the natural world doesn’t obey our models. This empowers the statistical practitioner to tune their procedures to be more robust against the limitations of what that can measure.</p>

<p>I want to once more emphasize that the algorithmic perspective I’ve presented here is not novel at all. Thinking about the combinatorics of random permutations and how they could be used to design randomized experiments is nearly one hundred years old, and, for example, prevalent in the works of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2342192">Jerzy Neyman</a> and the eccentric eugenicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments">Ronald Fisher</a> by the 1930s. Fisher’s rambling discursion on the woman who can tell if milk was added to a cup before tea describes a randomization procedure that does not model the appearance of tea in cups, the composition of tea cups, nor the psychic abilities of the tea expert. It purely counts permutations and uses exact statistics to provide a way to evaluate validity of a claim. I’ll review in more detail how to use these effectively <em>model-free</em> ideas for experimentation in the next post.</p>

<p>There are obviously issues with the algorithmic view. Statistical sampling methods work best when the variability of the quantity of interest is low. In such a case, small experiments quickly reveal insights about the population. When variances are large or effectively unbounded, the number of samples required for high precision estimates might be impractical and our estimators and algorithms need to be rethought. There are many phenomena that obey “power law” scaling, and such quantities are harder to work with in this rudimentary experimental framework. The uniform sampling algorithm we have described will have unbounded variance, and hence the average on the sample will no longer be an accurate measure of the average of the population. More sophisticated means must be deployed to estimate means of quantities with such high variation.</p>

<p>Another drawback of statistical sampling is the requirement that samples be sampled uniformly. Uniform sampling is an idealization and is often hard to implement in practice. For example, what does it mean to collect an i.i.d. sampling of registered voters in a poll? Some voters may not respond to your phone calls. Even more problematic is when you cannot define the population well in advance, as would be the case of the vague notion of “likely” voters. More sophisticated statistical analyses can provide guarantees on non-uniform sampling strategies, but care must be taken to ensure that the statistical bounds we compute reflect the reality of the implementation of the data collection. Understanding our sampling capabilities is crucial to understanding the validity of our estimates.</p>

<p>With these caveats in mind, our algorithmic framing of statistics gives us a focused way to think about experiment design and prediction methods. In the next blogs, I’ll explore these both in depth.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-140 |  Tight Computational Indistinguishability Bound of Product Distributions | 

	Nathan Geier</title>
    <summary>Assume that $X_0,X_1$ (respectively $Y_0,Y_1$) are $d_X$ (respectively $d_Y$) indistinguishable for circuits of a given size. It is well known that the product distributions $X_0Y_0,\,X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y$ indistinguishable for slightly smaller circuits. However, in probability theory where unbounded adversaries are considered through statistical distance, it is folklore knowledge that in fact $X_0Y_0$ and $X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y-d_X\cdot d_Y$ indistinguishable, and also that this bound is tight.

We formulate and prove the computational analog of this tight bound. Our proof is entirely different from the proof in the statistical case, which is non-constructive. As a corollary, we show that if $X$ and $Y$ are $d$ indistinguishable, then $k$ independent copies of $X$ and $k$ independent copies of $Y$ are almost $1-(1-d)^k$ indistinguishable for smaller circuits, as against $d\cdot k$ using the looser bound. Our bounds are useful in settings where only weak (i.e. non-negligible) indistinguishability is guaranteed. We demonstrate this in the context of cryptography, showing that our bounds yield simple analysis for amplification of weak oblivious transfer protocols.</summary>

    <title>My academic lineage and more interesting facts that come out of it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> I got my PhD from Harvard in 1985 with advisor Harry Lewis</p><p>Harry Lewis got his PhD from Harvard in 1974 with advisor Burton Dreben (Dreben was in the Philosophy department and did logic). Burton Dreben never got a PhD (more on that later). So I thought my lineage stopped there. A while back I was in an email conversation with Harry and for some odd reason Galileo came up.</p><p>He then emailed me the following:</p><p>----------------</p><p>Did you know you were descended from Galileo, via Newton? See below. The data is from the Math Genealogy project (see <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">here</a>). As you know  Dreben had no PhD, but it would certainly be fair to call Quine his advisor anyway. And, in fact, the Math Geneology project lists Quine as Dreben's advisor. By starting with Dreben and clicking backwards I found the following:</p><p>In the list below everyone was advised (in some form) by the person below them.</p><p>William Gasarch, Harvard 1985</p><p>Harry Lewis, Harvard 1974</p><p>Burton Dreben, Harvard 1955</p><p>WVO Quine, Harvard 1932</p><p>AN Whitehead, Cambridge 1884</p><p>Edward John Routh, Cambridge 1857</p><p>William Hopkins, Cambridge 1830</p><p>Adam Sedgwick, Cambridge 1811</p><p>Thomas Jones, Cambridge 1782</p><p>Thomas Postlethwaite, Cambridge 1756</p><p>Stephen Whisson, Cambridge 1742</p><p>Walter Taylor, Cambridge 1723</p><p>Robert Smith, Cambridge 1715</p><p>Roger Coles, Cambridge 1706</p><p>Isaac Newton, Cambridge 1668</p><p>Isaac Barrow, Cambridge 1652</p><p>Vincenzo Viviani, Pisa 1642</p><p>Galileo Galilei, Pisa 1585</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>A few observations</p><p>1) Dreben was a philosophy professor at Harvard without a PhD. How? He was a Junior Fellow, which is for brilliant people, some of which were made professors without  the burden of going  through the PhD-getting ritual.  Andrew Gleason was a professor of Math at Harvard without a PhD-- also a junior fellow (he solved Hilbert's 5th problem, which surely helped). Tom Cheatham was a CS professor at Harvard who did not have a PhD but  was <i>not</i> a junior fellow. I do not know how he did that. Things are more formal now, and more people have PhD's, so I suspect it is much rarer to be a professor without a PhD.  Harvard still has the Junior Fellows Program, but even they have PhDs now. If someone solved P vs NP as an ugrad, I suspect they would be hired as a professor even though they do not have a PhD. That's one way for a theorist to get out of taking graduate systems courses. </p><p>2) Note that Galileo and Vincenzo were in Pisa but then a long line of people from Cambridge. In those days schools hired their own. Is this good or bad? They know what they are getting, but you could have an old-boys-network blocking fresh new talent, and you may get stuck in your ways. Nowadays, at least in America, it is uncommon to stay at the same school as you got your PhD.</p><p>3) The shift from Pisa to Cambridge might be part of a more general phenomena--- the intellectual center for science shifting from Italy to England. What caused this? Amir Alexander, in his book <i>Infinitesimals: How a dangerous mathematical idea shaped the modern world </i>(see my review <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/inf.pdf">here</a> ) speculates that the Catholic Church's rejection of Infinitesimals was the cause.  I suspect that letting non-scientists interfere with science was the cause (a lesson for us all).</p><p>4) Lance did a blog on his lineage <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/06/eulerian-tour.html">here</a>. He has Gauss and Euler as ancestors. </p><p>5) To honor the myths about  my two most famous academic ancestors, Galileo and Newton,  I am going to travel to Italy and have Darling drop two apples of different weights off the leaning tower of Pisa and see if they hit my head at the same time.</p><div><br/></div></div>

<p>
David Zuckerman has a beautiful result on the approximate hardness of the clique problem. His <a href="https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v003a006/v003a006.pdf">paper</a>, “Linear Degree Extractors and the Inapproximability of Max Clique and Chromatic Number,” has has received almost 1,000 citations since it was first published in 2007. Wow.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss a possible relevance of this result for P versus NP.</p>
<p>
Recall a clique is a subset of nodes of an undirected graph, such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge. Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_%28graph_theory%29">illustration</a> below does not have large cliques—only two cliques of <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes shaded blue to go with a bunch of triangles shaded lighter.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/26/a-possible-ramsey-insight-into-p-versus-np/clique/" rel="attachment wp-att-19147"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19147" height="160" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/clique.png?resize=200%2C160&amp;ssl=1" width="200"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Is there a relatively small change we could make to the graph to give it a much larger clique? At top right, we could add two edges to extend the blur <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-clique to a <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-clique—a pentagram inside a pentagon. At bottom left we could add <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> edges to make the four triangles blossom into a <img alt="{6}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-clique.</p>
<p>
Computing the size of the largest clique in a graph—or just telling whether it has a clique of a given size <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—is a famous NP-complete problem. Counting the number of cliques of the largest size is evidently a harder problem still. Yet you might think it easier to tell a graph with only small cliques apart from a graph that has large ones. This is where David’s result comes in.</p>
<p>
In passing, we note David’s place among the <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Putnam/Competition_Archive/List%20of%20Previous%20Putnam%20Winners.pdf">winners</a> of the 1986 William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition. Also on the list was Bjorn Poonen, whom we have also <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/">highlighted</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/11/19/two-versus-three/">multiple</a> times <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/01/25/the-halting-no-go-theorem/">including</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/13/hilberts-tenth-again/">recently</a>. Here is the 1986 <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/1986.pdf">exam</a>; Ken and I confess we did much worse when we took the Putnam in earlier years.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> David’s Result </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Polynomial growth refers to a function that is bounded by <img alt="{n^c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ec%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some constant <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. <b>Quasi-polynomial</b> growth means one bounded by <img alt="{n^{\log^c n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%5Clog%5Ec+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for some <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>
Let <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be an <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vertex graph.

<p/><p>
The following is a main result in David’s paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The problem of distinguishing clumpy graphs from limpid graphs is not in <img alt="{\widetilde{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> provided <img alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{P} \neq N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+N%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
It is fundamentally a de-randomization result. Our idea is to scale it down in a way that may bring <img alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{P} \neq N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+N%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> into contact with mathematical theorems that govern effects of the scaling. The theorems may be adjacent to conjectures that can suggest new approaches. The idea may require bringing back randomization, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Question </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our quest to build on David’s theorem leads us to interpose a classic idea. In work with Paul Erdős, Tibor Radó wrote <img alt="{G\rightarrow(H)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Crightarrow%28H%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to mean that every <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-coloring of the edges of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has a monochromatic subgraph <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The classic two-color Ramsey theorem states that for all <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> there is a <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that <img alt="{G\rightarrow(K_r)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Crightarrow%28K_r%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Erdős and George Szekeres further showed <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can have fewer than <img alt="{2^{2r}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B2r%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes. </p>

In Radó’s notation, this is if <img alt="{G \rightarrow (K_{\frac{1}{2}\log_2 n - c})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Crightarrow+%28K_%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog_2+n+-+c%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The first point is that all clumpy graphs are <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Radó for large enough <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

Thus the key question becomes:</p>

<p/><p>
Suppose the answer is <b>no</b>. Then every limpid graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has an edge 2-coloring that does not leave a clique of size <img alt="{k = \frac{1}{2}\log n - c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog+n+-+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We can verify this in quasi-polynomial time by trying all <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-subsets of the vertices. </p>

This sets up a situation where both “limpid” and “clumpy” have an <img alt="{\mathsf{N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BN%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> witness.

The question of <em>finding</em> them, however, has a long trail that leads back into complexity theory.</p>

To be truly “limpid,” however, the graph should exclude smaller cliques. The following problem of Erdős and Radó was open for some time:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does there exist a <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-free graph with the Radó triangle property? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2099355">solved</a> in 1970 by Jon Folkman and then improved in 1987 by a probabilistic argument of Joel Spencer, in a <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82159088.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Three Hundred Million Points Suffice.” That’s right: for the minimum Radó criterion he showed there is a limpid graph with <img alt="{N &lt; \mathbf{300,000,000}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3C+%5Cmathbf%7B300%2C000%2C000%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes. This 2007 <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~spr/PUBL/paper53.pdf">paper</a> by the Ramsey-theory experts Stanisław Radziszowski and Xu Xiaodong proves that the minimum possible <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{19}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B19%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and gives evidence that <img alt="{N \leq 127}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%5Cleq+127%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is plausible. let <img alt="{N_{3,3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> stand for the least possible such <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
However one such graph exists, it must give rise to a “bat”-type construction and forthwith a reduction showing the <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-completeness of the <img alt="{K_4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-free Radó property. Thus the Ramsey-type existence question is entangled with complexity theory. How this relationship <em>scales</em> up for <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Radó and clumpy versus limpid graphs is the point we are driving at.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ramsey Scaling And Complexity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There are two main levers by which we are scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Up from the constant <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the Radó triangle property to <img alt="{\rho = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(n) - c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog_2%28n%29+-+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Radó. <p/>
</li><li>
Up to <img alt="{k=n^\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3Dn%5E%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the allowed clique size in a <em>limpid</em> graph.
</li></ul>
<p>
The latter corresponds to the <img alt="{\epsilon n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> size for <em>clumpy</em> that we are distinguishing, but there is some freedom in <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If we imagine <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as fixed—temporarily ignoring the dependence on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—we can ask, what is the minimum size <img alt="{N = N_{\rho,k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+N_%7B%5Crho%2Ck%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of a <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-limpid graph that is <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-Radó? </p>
<p>
To avoid a complexity collapse, we must bet on at worst a single-exponential dependence on <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, polynomial in <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Can we possibly show this directly? Note that <img alt="{\rho = 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{k = 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> already raised the specter of <img alt="{N_{3,3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the hundred millions. Not only do we not see a way to scale up Spencer’s proof, he remarked in the intro that his proof is “extremely case specific” and does not scale even to 3-edge colorings. The “almost” feature of Definition <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#almost">3</a> adds a further complication.</p>
<p>
It may be that the guiderails for ascending to higher <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\rho}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (scaling with the number <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of nodes) are already present among the details of the graph constructions in David’s proof and the proofs of the theorems his paper builds on. We have not had time to delve. There must be <em>some</em> connection; the question is whether complexity considerations take the lead or follow only in train of the sides that can be mathematically disproved.  Other connections of Ramsey theory are in this nice 2004 <a href="https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/DS13/pdf">survey</a> by Vera Rosta.</p>
<p>
Here is one more indication of why we think the interaction between complexity and Ramsey theory can be nontrivial. Putting <img alt="{R = 2^r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+2%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the upper bound noted above for the diagonal-<img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> Ramsey number has rough order <img alt="{R^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The best known lower bound has rough order <img alt="{R^{1/2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Can we show an impact of the growth of <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on complexity theory, in advance of resolving this gap which has been open for over fifty years?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The key issue is, what about the above question? Assuming the usual belief that quasi-polynomial time and nondeterministic quasi-polynomial time are distinct we must be able to show a fact about <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-colorings of clumpy and limpid graphs. If this is hard to prove, then we have an interesting impasse. Even worse, if this is false, then our beliefs collapse. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
The feature that surprises us about the 1986 Putnam <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/1986.pdf">exam</a> is that it does <em>not</em> have a question that involves the number <b>1,986</b>. Ken and I both remember such features. Here is a problem they could have used; we will give the answer later:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Alan and Barbara play a game in which they take turns filling entries of an initially empty 1986 x 1986 array. Alan plays first. At each turn, a player chooses a real number and places it in a vacant entry. The game ends when all the entries are filled. Alan wins if the determinant of the resulting matrix is nonzero; Barbara wins if it is zero. Which player has a winning strategy? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer is at the end of the next <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/30/baby-steps/">post</a>.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
[removed reference to Putnam ranking, “batch”-&gt;”bats” in the proof from 1985, added answer link for puzzle at end]</p></font></font></div>

    <title>Multilayer tiles</title>
    <summary>You’re probably familiar with the fact that you can draw a convex octagon with corners in an integer grid, fitting into a \(3\times 3\) square. It’s not regular, because its side lengths alternate between \(1\) and \(\sqrt 2\), but it has the same angles as a regular octagon and looks close enough to it for some purposes.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>You’re probably familiar with the fact that you can draw a convex octagon with corners in an integer grid, fitting into a \(3\times 3\) square. It’s not regular, because its side lengths alternate between \(1\) and \(\sqrt 2\), but it has the same angles as a regular octagon and looks close enough to it for some purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="3x3 integer octagon and its 7-ply tiling of the plane" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/7way-octagon.svg"/></p>

<p>It also has another interesting property: if you place copies of it at every point of the integer grid, then each edge of each copy is also the edge of another copy. Therefore, if you let \(p\) be any point that avoids the edges of the octagons, count the number of octagons that cover any point of the plane, and then slide \(p\) around to another edge-avoiding point, the number of covering octagons always stays unchanged. Whenever \(p\) slides off from one octagon, it slides onto another one. Because the area of the integer octagon is seven units, and you’re placing one octagon for every unit square of the grid, the average covering depth is seven. And since the covering depth stays the same everywhere, it’s seven everywhere. You can think of this collection of octagons as forming a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(7\)-ply</span> tiling of the plane, despite the fact that convex octagons cannot tile the plane in the usual \(1\)-ply sense of tiling.</p>

<p>More generally, define a \(k\)-ply tiling to be a covering of the plane by congruent copies of some prototile (allowing rotations, even though these are not necessary for the octagon) such that, except at a subset of the plane of measure zero (the boundaries of the prototiles), every point is covered by exactly \(k\) copies, and define the “ply” of a prototile to be the minimum \(k\) such that it has a \(k\)-ply tiling. The integer octagon has <span style="white-space: nowrap;">ply \(7\):</span> once one octagon is placed anywhere in the plane, the rest of the tiling is forced to follow in the same way around it, in order to avoid creating seams where an octagon edge is not matched by another octagon and the ply changes. The same construction, using centrally symmetric octagons with integer vertices and longer sides, produces for any \(k\ge9\) a convex tile of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">ply \(k\).</span></p>

<p>This is the subject of my new short paper (or maybe extended abstract) “Multifold tiles of polyominoes and convex lattice polygons”, with many coauthors from the 2017 Bellairs Winter Workshop on Computational Geometry: Kota Chida, Erik Demaine, Martin Demaine, Adam Hesterberg, Takashi Horiyama, John Iacono, Hiro Ito, Stefan Langerman, Ryuhei Uehara, and Yushi Uno. You can find it in the <a href="http://www.math.science.cmu.ac.th/tjcdcggg/Book-abstract.pdf">book of abstracts of the 23rd Thailand–Japan Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry, Graphs, and Games (TJCDCG<sup>3</sup> 2020+1)</a>, which was organized online by Chiang Mai University earlier this month.</p>

<p>As well as the family of octagon \(k\)-ply tilers described above, we found that cutting the bottom row of squares off a \(3\times 3\) octagon produces a \(5\)-ply hexagon tiler, this time requiring \(180^\circ\)-degree rotations for its tiling, and that stretching this hexagon can produce an <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(8\)-ply</span> convex tiler. We also found polyomino <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-ply</span> tilers for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">all \(k\ge 2\),</span> and three heptominoes (the smallest possible polyominoes) that can each form <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-ply</span> tilings for all \(k\ge 2\) but not for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k=1\).</span> I imagine the details will become available in a more complete paper at some point but for now the abstract just announces these results and gives pictures of these heptominoes. We still don’t know whether there can exist convex polygons whose ply is one of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\{2,3,4,6\}\).</span></p>

<p>The TJCDCG<sup>3</sup> abstract book has many other intriguing results in discrete geometry, graph theory, and combinatorial game theory, so do check it out if you’re interested. Tiling-related highlights include a variation on Wang tiling adding connectivity constraints and inspired by a dungeon-making mini-game in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> (“Tiling the Plane Connectively with Wang Tiles”, Chao Yang), signal processing using high-dimensional substitution tilings (“Generating Frames via Discretized Substitution Tilings”, Luis S. Silvestre Jr. and Job A. Nable), a partial classification of edge-to-edge monohedral tilings of the sphere (“Tiling of the Sphere by Congruent Polygons”, Yohji Akama, Hoi Ping Luk, Erxiao Wang, and Min Yan), and tilings that can be used to make arrays of joined-up origami cranes (“Renzuru Tilings with Asymmetric Quadrilaterals”, Takashi Yoshino).</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Here’s yesterday’s clickbait offering from <em>Scientific American</em>, the once-legendary home of Martin Gardner’s Mathematical Games column:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-term-jedi-is-problematic-for-describing-programs-that-promote-justice-equity-diversity-and-inclusion/">Why the Term ‘JEDI’ Is Problematic for Describing Programs That Promote Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion</a></p>



<p>The sad thing is, I see few signs that this essay was meant as a Sokal-style parody, although in many ways it’s written as one.  The essay actually develops a 100% cogent, reasoned argument: namely, that the ideology of the <em>Star Wars</em> films doesn’t easily fit with the new ideology of militant egalitarianism at the expense of all other human values, including irony, humor, joy, and the nurturing of unusual talents. The authors are merely oblivious to the conclusion that most people would draw from their argument: namely, so much the worse for the militant egalitarianism then!</p>



<p>I predict that this proposal—to send the acronym “JEDI” the way of “mankind,” “blacklist,” and, err, “quantum supremacy”—will meet with opposition even from the wokeists themselves, a huge fraction of whom (in my experience) have soft spots for the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise.  Recall for example that in 2014, Laurie Penny used <em>Star Wars</em> metaphors in her <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2014/12/on-nerd-entitlement-rebel-alliance-empire">interesting response</a> to my comment-171, telling male nerds like me that we need to learn to accept that “[we’re] not the Rebel Alliance, [we’re] actually part of the Empire and have been all along.”  Admittedly, I’ve never <em>felt like</em> part of an Empire, although I’ll confess to some labored breathing lately when ascending flights of stairs.</p>



<p>As for me, I spent much of my life opposed in principle to <em>Star Wars</em>—I hated how the most successful “science fiction” franchise of all time became that way <em>precisely</em> by ditching any pretense of science and fully embracing mystical woo—but sure, when the chips are down, I’m crazy and radical enough to take the side of Luke Skywalker, even if a team of woke theorists is earnestly, unironically explaining to me that lightsabers are phallocentric and that Vader ranks higher on the intersectional oppression axis because of his breathing problem.</p>



<p>Meantime, of course, the US continues to <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fopinions%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Frobert-kagan-constitutional-crisis">careen toward its worst Constitutional crisis since the Civil War</a>, as Trump prepares to run again in 2024, and as this time around, the Republicans are systematically purging state governments of their last Brad Raffenspergers, of anyone who might stand in the way of them simply setting aside the vote totals and declaring Trump the winner regardless of the actual outcome.  It’s good to know that my fellow progressives have their eyes on the ball—so that when that happens, at least universities will no longer be using offensive acronyms like “JEDI”!</p></div>

    <title>Which integer sequences form denominators of Egyptian fractions?</title>
    <summary>I have a new paper out: “Egyptian Fractions with Denominators from Sequences Closed Under Doubling”, in the Journal of Integer Sequences. (There should also be an arXiv version soon but despite my long association with arXiv they made me get an endorser before I could upload to the number theory category, slowing down my submission there.)</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I have a new paper out: “<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL24/Eppstein/eppstein2.html">Egyptian Fractions with Denominators from Sequences Closed Under Doubling</a>”, in the <em>Journal of Integer Sequences</em>. (There should also be an arXiv version soon but despite my long association with arXiv they made me get an endorser before I could upload to the number theory category, slowing down my submission there.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s basically a journal version of an old blog post here, “<a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/11/20/egyptian-fractions-with.html">Egyptian fractions with practical denominators</a>”. That post concerned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_number">practical numbers</a>, positive integers \(n\) such that all other positive integers up to \(n\) can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of \(n\). This definition gives the practical numbers a natural connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction">Egyptian fractions</a>, representations of rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions: if you represent a number \(k&lt;n\) by a sum of distinct divisors of \(n\), and then divide everything by \(n\), you get an Egyptian fraction for \(k/n\). Zhi-Wei Sun asked whether the practical numbers and Egyptian fractions were connected in a different way, with every positive integer having an Egyptian fraction representation in which all denominators are practical, and my blog post provides a positive answer to Sun’s question.</p>

<p>The new paper simplifies the presentation of the solution, compared to the blog post, by providing direct formulas for the representation rather than an iterative computational method for finding it. But beyond that, it also shows that the same method (based on dividing by a large power of two and dealing separately with the quotient and remainder) works for many other integer sequences beyond the practical numbers. All it needs from an integer sequence is two simple properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The sequence should include a multiple of every integer. In order to represent \(k/p\) as an Egyptian fraction, when \(p\) is prime, the denominators must include at least one multiple of \(p\), so the requirement of including multiples is pretty natural in this context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every number \(n\) that belongs to the sequence, \(2n\) should also belong to the sequence. This is the “closed under doubling” of the new article’s title, and is closely connected to the method used by the article involving division by powers of two.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever a sequence \(S\) of positive integers has both properties, we can find Egyptian fractions for all positive rationals up to \(\sum_{x\in S}1/x\), the natural limiting value for such representations. When \(\sum_{x\in S}1/x\) diverges, we get all positive rationals. As well as the practical numbers, this works for some other nice sequences including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_number">odious</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_number">evil</a> numbers, the <a href="https://oeis.org/A001013">orders of isomorphism groups of trees</a>, and the <a href="https://oeis.org/A003714">fibbinary numbers</a>, numbers whose binary representation avoids consecutive ones. Because they’re based on binary representations, the doubling property of odious, evil, and fibbinary numbers follows from their definitions; the existence of multiples of other integers in these sequences is less obvious but was more or less already known. Isomorphism groups of trees have orders that are the products of factorials, from which (because 2 is a factorial and \(n!\) is a multiple of \(n\)) both properties follow immediately.</p>

<p>Although these two properties are sufficient for a sequence to form Egyptian fractions for rationals up to its natural limit, they are not necessary. Ron Graham’s PhD dissertation was on the same topic, and showed that the sequence of squares greater than one has the same property. (The sequence of all squares, including one, is a little more complicated: its sums of distinct reciprocals can represent all rationals in the intervals \([0,\pi^2/6-1)\) and \([1,\pi^2/6)\) but can’t cover the gap between these two intervals.) Characterizing which sequences do or do not form representations of this type more generally seems like an interesting question, but one that I don’t have much idea how to attack at this point.</p>

    <title>TR21-139 |  Punctured Large Distance Codes, and Many Reed-Solomon Codes, Achieve List-Decoding Capacity | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Jonathan Mosheiff</title>
    <summary>We prove the existence of Reed-Solomon codes of any desired rate $R \in (0,1)$ that are combinatorially list-decodable up to a radius approaching  $1-R$, which is the information-theoretic limit. This is established by starting with the full-length $[q,k]_q$ Reed-Solomon code over a field $\mathbb{F}_q$ that is polynomially larger than the desired dimension $k$, and "puncturing" it by including $k/R$ randomly chosen codeword positions. 
		
Our puncturing result is more general and applies to any code with large minimum distance: we show that a random rate $R$ puncturing of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear "mother" code whose relative distance is close enough to $1-1/q$ is list-decodable up to a radius approaching the $q$-ary list-decoding capacity bound $h_q^{-1}(1-R)$. In fact, for large $q$, or under a stronger assumption of low-bias of the mother-code, we prove that the threshold rate for list-decodability with a specific list-size (and more generally, any "local" property) of the random puncturing approaches that of fully random linear codes. Thus, all current (and future) list-decodability bounds shown for random linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet) code. This can be viewed as a general derandomization result applicable to random linear codes. 
		
To obtain our conclusion about Reed-Solomon codes, we establish some hashing properties of field trace maps that allow us to reduce the list-decodability of RS codes to its associated trace (dual-BCH) code, and then apply our puncturing theorem to the latter. Our approach implies, essentially for free, optimal rate list-recoverability of punctured RS codes as well.</summary>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a model of privacy-preserving machine learning that has garnered significant interest in recent years due to its rigorous privacy guarantees. An algorithm differentially private if the output is stable under small changes in the input database. While DP has been adopted in a variety of applications, most applications of DP in industry actually satisfy a stronger notion called local differential privacy. In local differential privacy data subjects perturb their data before it reaches the data analyst. While this requires less trust, it comes a substantial cost to accuracy. Recent work of Erlingsson, Feldman, Mironov, Raghunathan, Talwar, and Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrated that random shuffling amplifies differential privacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has led to significant interest in the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19, EFMRTT19]. In this talk, we will discuss a new result on privacy amplification by shuffling, which achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in the local privacy parameter. Our result is based on a new proof strategy which is simpler than previous approaches, and extends to a lightly weaker notion known as approximate differential privacy with nearly the same guarantees.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Vitaly Feldman and Kunal Talwar (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803">https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803</a>).</p></blockquote></div>

    <title>Why Conferences?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06438">undergrad thesis</a> from North Carolina State University tries to tackle the question as to why computer science has used conferences as its main and most prestigious publication venues. The author Elijah Bouma-Sims gives a synopsis with some interesting follow up conversation in this <a href="https://twitter.com/ElijahBoumaSims/status/1439041100111548419">Twitter thread</a>.</p><p>The upshot is that the conference culture grew organically early in computing and just took hold as the field grew. My personal non-scientific theory is that technology not available to earlier fields, namely jet airplanes, allowed CS to have national and international meetings that researchers could regularly attend. Before that conferences in more established fields like math were held either locally (<a href="http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/sectional.html">AMS sectional meetings</a>) or less often (<a href="https://www.mathunion.org/icm/icm-2022">ICM</a> held every four years), traditions that continue to this day.</p><p>Covid has temporarily suspended fully on-site conferences, and new technologies allow us to have virtual meetings. It's still not clear what will be the new normal for conferences. I hope we get to the model where we have more virtual meetings and rarer in-person meetings that people make more of an effort to attend. Conferences focused on networking instead of publications.</p><p>The culture of conference publications has been slowly changing. Many subfields in CS, though not no much theory, have moved to a hybrid model where papers are submitted to a journal and those accepted are invited to be presented at a conference.</p><p>Conferences used to be the first place you would hear about new results but that's no longer the case. Papers posted on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> get noticed and Google Scholar doesn't distinguished citations to an arXiv paper differently from any other publication venue. </p><p>Now you don't even need a presentation or a paper, just a promise of one. How many of you are excited about linear-size locally testable codes based on a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/breakthroughs-locally-testable-codes-constant-rate-distance-and-locality">talk announcement</a> alone?</p></div>

    <summary>We propose a diagonalization-based approach to several important questions in proof complexity. We illustrate this approach in the context of the algebraic proof system IPS and in the context of propositional proof systems more generally.

We give an explicit sequence of CNF formulas $\{\phi_n\}$ such that VNP$\neq$VP iff there are no polynomial-size IPS proofs for the formulas $\phi_n$. This provides the first natural equivalence between proof complexity lower bounds and standard algebraic complexity lower bounds. Our proof of this fact uses the implication from IPS lower bounds to algebraic complexity lower bounds due to Grochow and Pitassi together with a diagonalization argument: the formulas $\phi_n$ themselves assert the non-existence of short IPS proofs for formulas encoding VNP$\neq$VP at a different input length. Our result also has meta-mathematical implications: it gives evidence for the difficulty of proving strong lower bounds for IPS within IPS.

More generally, for any strong enough propositional proof system $R$ we propose a new explicit hard candidate, the iterated $R$-lower bound formulas, which inductively asserts the non-existence of short $R$ proofs for formulas encoding this same statement at a different input length. We show that these formulas are unconditionally hard for Resolution following recent results of Atserias and Muller and of Garlik. We further give evidence in favour of this hypothesis for other proof systems.</summary>
