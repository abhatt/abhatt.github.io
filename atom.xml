combine ideas from quantum Gibbs sampling and matrix exponent updates. A
de-quantization of the algorithm also leads to a faster classical solver. For
generic instances, our quantum solver gives a nearly quadratic speedup over
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also provide an efficient randomized rounding

    <title>Approximating Vertex Cover using Structural Rounding</title>

rounding framework for approximation algorithms. Structural rounding works by
first editing to a well-structured class, efficiently solving the edited
instance, and "lifting" the partial solution to recover an approximation on the
input. We focus on the well-studied Vertex Cover problem, and edit to the class
of bipartite graphs (where Vertex Cover has an exact polynomial time
algorithm). In addition to the naive lifting strategy for Vertex Cover
described by Demaine et al., we introduce a suite of new lifting strategies and
measure their effectiveness on a large corpus of synthetic graphs. We find that
in this setting, structural rounding significantly outperforms standard
2-approximations. Further, simpler lifting strategies are extremely competitive
with the more sophisticated approaches. The implementations are available as an
open-source Python package, and all experiments are replicable.

    <title>Well-behaved Online Load Balancing Against Strategic Jobs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1568160000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Li:Bo.html">Bo Li</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Li:Minming.html">Minming Li</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wu:Xiaowei.html">Xiaowei Wu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04481">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the online load balancing problem on related machines, we have a set of
jobs (with different sizes) arriving online, and we need to assign each job to
a machine immediately upon its arrival, so as to minimize the makespan, i.e.,
the maximum completion time. In classic mechanism design problems, we assume
that the jobs are controlled by selfish agents, with the sizes being their
private information. Each job (agent) aims at minimizing its own cost, which is
its completion time plus the payment charged by the mechanism. Truthful
mechanisms guaranteeing that every job minimizes its cost by reporting its true
size have been well-studied [Aspnes et al. JACM 1997, Feldman et al. EC 2017].
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study truthful online load balancing mechanisms that are
well-behaved [Epstein et al., MOR 2016]. Well-behavior is important as it
guarantees fairness between machines, and implies truthfulness in some cases
when machines are controlled by selfish agents. Unfortunately, existing
truthful online load balancing mechanisms are not well-behaved. We first show
that to guarantee producing a well-behaved schedule, any online algorithm (even
non-truthful) has a competitive ratio at least $\Omega(\sqrt{m})$, where m is
the number of machines. Then we propose a mechanism that guarantees
truthfulness of the online jobs, and produces a schedule that is almost
well-behaved. We show that our algorithm has a competitive ratio of $O(\log
m)$. Moreover, for the case when the sizes of online jobs are bounded, the
competitive ratio of our algorithm improves to $O(1)$. Interestingly, we show
several cases for which our mechanism is actually truthful against selfish
machines.

lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$ colored red, green, and blue. Does there exist a
vertical plane $P$ such that a line on $P$ simultaneously bisects all three
classes of points in the cross-section $\mathcal{L} \cap P$? Recently, Schnider
[SoCG 2019] used topological methods to prove that such a cross-section always
exists. In this work, we give an alternative proof of this fact, using only
methods from discrete geometry. With this combinatorial proof at hand, we
devise an $O(n^2\log^2(n))$ time algorithm to find such a plane and the
bisector of the induced cross-section. We do this by providing a general
framework, from which we expect that it can be applied to solve similar
problems on cross-sections and kinetic points.

    <title>Constant factor approximation of MAX CLIQUE</title>

complete sub-graph in a graph $G, G = (V, E)$ (directed or undirected). MCP is
well known to be $NP-Hard$ to approximate in polynomial time with an
approximation ratio of $1 + \epsilon$, for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ [9] (and even a
polynomial time approximation algorithm with a ratio $n^{1 - \epsilon}$ has
been conjectured to be non-existent [2] for MCP). Up to this date, the best
known approximation ratio for MCP of a polynomial time algorithm is
$O(n(log_2(log_2(n)))^2 / (log_2(n))^3)$ given by Feige [1]. In this paper, we
show that MCP can be approximated with a constant factor in polynomial time
through approximation ratio preserving reductions from MCP to MAX DNF and from
MAX DNF to MIN SAT. A 2-approximation algorithm for MIN SAT was presented in
[6]. An approximation ratio preserving reduction from MIN SAT to min vertex
cover improves the approximation ratio to $2 - \Theta(1/ \sqrt{n})$ [10]. Hence
we prove false the infamous conjecture, which argues that there cannot be a
polynomial time algorithm for MCP with an approximation ratio of any constant
factor.

    <title>The Outer Limits of Contention Resolution on Matroids and Connections to the Secretary Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1568160000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dughmi:Shaddin.html">Shaddin Dughmi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04268">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Contention resolution schemes have proven to be a useful and unifying
abstraction for a variety of constrained optimization problems, in both offline
and online arrival models. Much of prior work restricts attention to product
distributions for the input set of elements, and studies contention resolution
for increasingly general packing constraints, both offline and online. In this
paper, we instead focus on generalizing the input distribution, restricting
attention to matroid constraints in both the offline and online random arrival
models. In particular, we study contention resolution when the input set is
arbitrarily distributed, and may exhibit positive and/or negative correlations
between elements. We characterize the distributions for which offline
contention resolution is possible, and establish some of their basic closure
properties. Our characterization can be interpreted as a distributional
generalization of the matroid covering theorem. For the online random arrival
model, we show that contention resolution is intimately tied to the secretary
problem via two results. First, we show that a competitive algorithm for the
matroid secretary problem implies that online contention resolution is
essentially as powerful as offline contention resolution for matroids, so long
as the algorithm is given the input distribution. Second, we reduce the matroid
secretary problem to the design of an online contention resolution scheme of a
particular form.

    <title>Contraction: a Unified Perspective of Correlation Decay and Zero-Freeness of 2-Spin Systems</title>

a multivariate polynomial in terms of the edge interaction parameters and the
uniform external field. We obtain new zero-free regions in which all these
parameters are complex-valued. Crucially based on the zero-freeness, we show
the existence of correlation decay in these regions. As a consequence, we
obtain an FPTAS for computing the partition function of 2-spin systems on
graphs of bounded degree for these parameter settings. One innovative aspect of
this work is to introduce the contraction property, which provides a unified
sufficient condition to devise FPTAS, via either Weitz's algorithm or
Barvinok's algorithm. Our main technical contribution is a very simple but
general approach to extend any real parameter of which the 2-spin system
exhibits correlation decay to its complex neighborhood where the partition
function is zero-free and correlation decay still exists. This result formally
establishes the inherent connection between two distinct notions of phase
transition for 2-spin systems: the existence of correlation decay and the
zero-freeness of the partition function, via a unified perspective,
contraction.

    <title>TR19-117 |  Locally Testable Non-Malleable Codes | 

	Silas Richelson, 

	Sourya Roy</title>
    <summary>In this work we adapt the notion of non-malleability for codes or Dziembowski, Pietrzak and Wichs (ICS 2010) to locally testable codes. Roughly speaking, a locally testable code is non-malleable if any tampered codeword which passes the local test with good probability is close to a valid codeword which either encodes the original, or an unrelated message.
We instantiate our definition by proving that a Reed-Muller-type code is non-malleable in the following sense: any adversary who independently tampers the coordinates of the code so that the tampered code passes the test with good probability, is tampering the underlying polynomial according to an affine transformation.
To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work, polynomial codes were not known to possess any non-malleability guarantees. Our analysis builds on the sampler-based decoding techniques common to several recent works.</summary>

    <title>A New Analysis of "Adaptive Data Analysis"</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div style="text-align: center;"><i>This is a blog post about our new paper, which you can read here: </i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03577">https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03577</a> </div><div style="text-align: center;"><br/></div>The most basic statistical estimation task is estimating the expected value of some predicate $q$ over a distribution $\mathcal{P}$: $\mathrm{E}_{x \sim \mathcal{P}}[q(x)]$, which I'll just write as $q(\mathcal{P})$. Think about estimating the mean of some feature in your data, or the error rate of a classifier that you have just trained.  There's a really obvious way to come up with a good estimate if you've got a dataset $S \sim \mathcal{P}^n$ of $n$ points that were sampled i.i.d. from the distribution: just use the empirical mean $a = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n q(S_i)$! In fact, this is a great way to estimate the values of a really large number of predicates, so long as they were chosen <i>non-adaptively</i>: that is, so long as you came up with all of the predicates you wanted to estimate before you estimated any of the answers. This phenomenon is, for example, what classical generalization theorems in machine learning rely on: the empirical error of a set of classifiers in some model class will be a good estimate of their actual, out-of-sample error, so long as your dataset is at least as large as the logarithm of your model class.<br/><div><br/></div><div>But this guarantee breaks down if the predicates that you want to estimate are chosen in sequence, adaptively. For example, suppose you are trying to fit a machine learning model to data. If you train your first model, estimate its error, and then as a result of the estimate tweak your model and estimate its error again, you are engaging in exactly this kind of adaptivity. If you repeat this many times (as you might when you are tuning hyper-parameters in your model) you could quickly get yourself into big trouble. Of course there is a simple way around this problem: just don't re-use your data. The most naive baseline that gives statistically valid answers is called "data splitting". If you want to test k models in sequence, just randomly partition your data into k equal sized parts, and test each model on a fresh part. The holdout method is just the special case of k = 2.  But this "naive" method doesn't make efficient use of data: its data requirements grow <i>linearly</i> with the number of models you want to estimate. </div><div><br/></div><div>It turns out its possible to do better by perturbing the empirical means with a little bit of noise before you use them: this is what we (Dwork, Feldman, Hardt, Pitassi, Reingold, and Roth --- DFHPRR) showed back in 2014 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2664">this paper</a>, which helped kick off a small subfield known as "adaptive data analysis". In a nutshell, we proved a "transfer theorem" that says the following: if your statistical estimator is simultaneously <i>differentially private</i> and <i>sample accurate</i> --- meaning that with high probability it provides estimates that are close to the empirical means, then it will also be accurate out of sample. When paired with a simple differentially private mechanism for answering queries --- just perturbing their answers with Gaussian noise --- this gave a significant asymptotic improvement in data efficiency over the naive baseline! You can see how well it does in this figure (click to enlarge it): </div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Eip3yKJl5mE/XXWfXoqt8KI/AAAAAAAATxY/FMSJHq4ClJgZXOhuACMC5ZMFFQ0W8cmOgCLcBGAs/s1600/DFHPRRonly.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="205" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Eip3yKJl5mE/XXWfXoqt8KI/AAAAAAAATxY/FMSJHq4ClJgZXOhuACMC5ZMFFQ0W8cmOgCLcBGAs/s320/DFHPRRonly.png" width="320"/></a></div><div style="text-align: left;">Well... Hmm. In this figure, we are plotting how many adaptively chosen queries can be answered accurately as a function of dataset size. By "accurately" we have arbitrarily chosen to mean: answers that have confidence intervals of width 0.1 and uniform coverage probability 95%. On the x axis, we've plotted the dataset size n, ranging from 100,000 to about 12 million. And we've plotted two methods: the "naive" sample splitting baseline, and using the sophisticated Gaussian perturbation technique, as analyzed by the bound we proved in the "DFHPRR" paper. (Actually --- a numerically optimized variant of that bound!) You can see the problem. Even with a dataset size in the tens of millions, the sophisticated method does substantially worse than the naive method! You can extrapolate from the curve that the DFHPRR bound will <i>eventually</i> beat the naive bound, but it would require a truly enormous dataset. When I try extending the plot out that far my optimizer runs into numeric instability issues. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: left;">There has been improvement since then. In particular, DFHPRR didn't even obtain the best bound asymptotically. It is folklore that differentially private estimates generalize in expectation: the trickier part is to show that they enjoy <i>high probability</i> generalization bounds. This is what we showed in a sub-optimal way in DFHPRR. In 2015, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02513">beautiful paper</a> by Bassily, Nissim, Steinke, Smith, Stemmer, and Ullman (BNSSSU) introduced the amazing "monitor technique" to obtain the asymptotically optimal high probability bound. An upshot of the bound was that the Gaussian mechanism can be used to answer roughly $k = n^2$ queries --- a quadratic improvement over the naive sample splitting mechanism! You can read about this technique in the lecture notes of the <a href="https://adaptivedataanalysis.com/">adaptive data analysis class</a> Adam Smith and I taught a few years back.  Lets see how it does (click to enlarge):</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C83SCyN8uzc/XXWjUcHmTHI/AAAAAAAATxk/GbtveNxoh18E7xOA2HQf67OGj9ujeCAuwCLcBGAs/s1600/DFHPRRandBNSSSU.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="206" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-C83SCyN8uzc/XXWjUcHmTHI/AAAAAAAATxk/GbtveNxoh18E7xOA2HQf67OGj9ujeCAuwCLcBGAs/s320/DFHPRRandBNSSSU.png" width="320"/></a></div><div style="text-align: left;">Substantially better! Now we're plotting n from 100,000 up to about only 1.7 million. At this scale, the DFHPRR bound appears to be constant (at essentially 0), whereas the BNSSSU bound clearly exhibits quadratic behavior. It even beats the baseline --- by a little bit, so long as your dataset has somewhat more than a million entries... I should add that what we're plotting here is again a numerically optimized variant of the BNSSSU bound, not the closed-form version from their paper. So maybe not yet a practical technique. The problem is that the monitor argument --- while brilliant --- seems unavoidably to lead to large constant overhead.  </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: left;">Which brings us to our new work (this is joint work with Christopher Jung, Katrina Ligett, Seth Neel, Saeed Sharifi-Malvajerdi, and Moshe Shenfeld). We give a brand new proof of the transfer theorem. It is elementary, and in particular, obtains high probability generalization bounds directly from high probability sample-accuracy bounds, avoiding the need for the monitor argument. I think the proof is the most interesting part --- its simple and (I think) illuminating --- but an upshot is that we get <i>substantially</i> better bounds, even though the improvement is just in the constants (the existing BNSSSU bound is known to be asymptotically tight). Here's the plot with our bound included --- the x-axis is the same, but note the substantially scaled-up y axis (click to enlarge): </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oR4HDFR07bE/XXWlv1vVIDI/AAAAAAAATxw/Fqbm-weNbMoQ5WbOgeOY3f0p6N2QN9bMACLcBGAs/s1600/allthree.png" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oR4HDFR07bE/XXWlv1vVIDI/AAAAAAAATxw/Fqbm-weNbMoQ5WbOgeOY3f0p6N2QN9bMACLcBGAs/s320/allthree.png" width="320"/></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/><b><u>Proof Sketch</u></b><br/>Ok: on to the proof. Here is the trick. In actuality, the dataset S is first sampled from $\mathcal{P}^n$, and then some data analyst interacts with a differentially private statistical estimator, resulting in some transcript $\pi$ of query answer pairs. But now imagine that <i>after the interaction is complete</i>, S is <i>resampled</i> from $Q_\pi = (\mathcal{P}^n)|\pi$, the posterior distribution on datasets conditioned on $\pi$. If you reflect on this for a moment, you'll notice that this resampling experiment doesn't change the joint distribution on dataset transcript pairs $(S,\pi)$ at all. So if the mechanism promised high probability sample accuracy bounds, it still promises them in this resampling experiment. But lets think about what that means: the mechanism can <i>first commit</i> to some set of answers $a_i$, and promise that with high probability, <i>after</i> S is resampled from $Q_\pi$, $|a_i - \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n q_i(S_j)|$ is small. But under the resampling experiment, it is quite likely that the empirical value of the query $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n q_i(S_j)$ will end up being close to its expectation over the posterior: $q_i(Q_{\pi}) = \mathrm{E}_{S \sim Q_{\pi}}[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^n q_i(S_j)]$. So the only way that a mechanism can promise high probability sample accuracy is if it actually promises high probability posterior accuracy: i.e. with high probability, for every query $q_i$ that was asked and answered, we must have that $|a_i - q_i(Q_\pi)|$ is small.<br/><br/>That part of the argument was generic --- it didn't use differential privacy at all! But it serves to focus attention on these posterior distributions $Q_\pi$ that our statistical estimator induces. And it turns out its not hard to see that the expected value of queries on posteriors induced by differentially private mechanisms have to be close to their true answers. For $(\epsilon,0)$-differential privacy, it follows almost immediately from the definition. Here is the derivation. Pick your favorite query $q$ and your favorite transcript $\pi$, and write $S_j \sim S$ to denote a uniformly randomly selected element of a dataset $S$:</div><div style="text-align: left;">$$q (Q_\pi) =  \sum_{x} q (x) \cdot \Pr_{S \sim \mathcal{P}^n, S_j \sim S} [S_j = x | \pi]= \sum_{x} q (x) \cdot \frac{\Pr [\pi | S_j = x ] \cdot \Pr_{S \sim \mathcal{P}^n, S_j \sim S} [S_j = x]}{\Pr[\pi]}$$<br/>$$\leq \sum_{x} q (x) \cdot \frac{e^\epsilon \Pr [\pi] \cdot \Pr_{S_j \sim \mathcal{P}} [S_j = x]}{\Pr[\pi]}<br/>= e^\epsilon \cdot q (\mathcal{P})$$<br/><br/>Here, the inequality follows from the definition of differential privacy, which controls the effect that fixing a single element of the dataset to any value $(S_j = x)$ can have on the probability of any transcript: it can increase it multiplicatively by a factor of at most $e^\epsilon$. </div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/>And thats it: So we must have that (with probability 1!), $|q(Q_\pi) - q(\mathcal{P})| \leq e^\epsilon-1 \approx \epsilon$. The transfer theorem then follows from the triangle inequality. We get a high probability bound for free, with no need for any heavy machinery.<br/><br/>The argument is just a little more delicate in the case of $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy, and can be extended beyond linear queries --- but I think this gives the basic idea. The details are in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03577">our new "JLNRSS" paper</a>. Incidentally, once nice thing about having many different proofs of the same theorem is that you can start to see some commonalities. One seems to be: it takes six authors to prove a transfer theorem!</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br/></div></div>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Paul Bernays Lectures</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">Last week, I had the honor of giving the annual Paul Bernays Lectures at ETH Zürich.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last week, I had the honor of giving the annual <a href="https://gess.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/paul-bernays-lectures.html">Paul Bernays Lectures</a> at ETH Zürich.  My opening line: “as I look at the list of previous Bernays Lecturers—many of them Nobel physics laureates, Fields Medalists, etc.—I think to myself, how badly did you have to screw up this year in order to end up with me?”</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bernays">Paul Bernays</a> was the primary assistant to David Hilbert, before Bernays (being Jewish by birth) was forced out of Göttingen by the Nazis in 1933.  He spent most of the rest of his career at ETH.  He’s perhaps best known for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory">von Neumann-Bernays-Gödel set theory</a>, and for writing (in a volume by “Hilbert and Bernays,” but actually just Bernays) arguably the first full proof of Gödel’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Second_incompleteness_theorem">Second Incompleteness Theorem</a>.</p>



<p>Anyway, the idea of the Paul Bernays Lectures is to rotate between Bernays’s different interests in his long, distinguished career—interests that included math, philosophy, logic, and the foundations of physics.  I mentioned that, if there’s any benefit to carting me out to Switzerland for these lectures, it’s that quantum computing theory combines <em>all</em> of these interests.  And this happens to be the moment in history right before we start finding out, directly from experiments, whether quantum computers can indeed solve certain special problems much faster.</p>



<p>The general theme for my three lectures was “Quantum Computing and the Fundamental Limits of Computation.”  The attendance was a few hundred.  My idea was to take the audience from Church and Turing in the 1930s, all the way to the quantum computational supremacy experiments that Google and others are doing now—as part of a single narrative.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, streaming video of the lectures is available as of today (though I haven’t watched it—let me know if the quality is OK!), as well as of course my slides.  Here you go:</p>



<p><strong>Lecture 1: The Church-Turing Thesis and Physics (<a href="https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/bernays/2019/7b11b50e-f813-4d26-95e0-616cc350708c.html">watch streaming</a> / <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/bernays1.ppt">PowerPoint slides</a>)</strong> <strong>(with an intro in German by Giovanni Sommaruga, who knew Bernays, and a second intro in English by Renato Renner, who appeared on this blog <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3975">here</a>)</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Abstract:</em> Is nature computable?  What should we even mean in formulating such a question?  For generations, the identification of “computable” with “computable by a Turing machine” has been seen as either an arbitrary mathematical definition, or a philosophical or psychological claim.  The rise of quantum computing and information, however, has brought a fruitful new way to look at the Church-Turing Thesis: namely, as a falsifiable empirical claim about the physical universe.  This talk seeks to examine the computability of the laws of physics from a modern standpoint—one that fully incorporates the insights of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, quantum gravity, and cosmology.  We’ll critically assess ‘hypercomputing’ proposals involving (for example) relativistic time dilation, black holes, closed timelike curves, and exotic cosmologies, and will make a 21st-century case for the physical Church-Turing Thesis.</p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Lecture 2: The Limits of Efficient Computation (<a href="https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/bernays/2019/5564a353-d71b-46d4-bfc0-fa907de5de25.html">watch streaming</a> / <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/bernays2.ppt">PowerPoint slides</a>)</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Abstract:</em> Computer scientists care about what’s computable not only in principle, but within the resource constraints of the physical universe.  Closely related, which types of problems are solvable using a number of steps that scales reasonably (say, polynomially) with the problem size?  This lecture will examine whether the notorious NP-complete problems, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, are efficiently solvable using the resources of the physical world.  We’ll start with P=?NP problem of classical computer science—its meaning, history, and current status.  We’ll then discuss quantum computers: how they work, how they can sometimes yield exponential speedups over classical computers, and why many believe that not even they will do so for the NP-complete problems.  Finally, we’ll critically assess proposals that would use exotic physics to go even beyond quantum computers, in terms of what they would render computable in polynomial time. </p></blockquote>



<p><strong>Lecture 3: The Quest for Quantum Computational Supremacy (<a href="https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/bernays/2019/2a08c4a0-67e1-4e1f-8019-3e557fcb4cde.html">watch streaming</a> / <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/bernays3.ppt">PowerPoint slides</a>)</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Abstract:</em> Can useful quantum computers be built in our world?  This talk will discuss the current status of the large efforts currently underway at Google, IBM, and many other places to build noisy quantum devices, with 50-100 qubits, that can clearly outperform classical computers at least on some specialized tasks — a milestone that’s been given the unfortunate name of “quantum supremacy.”  We’ll survey recent theoretical work (on BosonSampling, random circuit sampling, and more) that aims to tell us: which problems should we give these devices, that we’re as confident as possible are hard for classical computers?  And how should we check whether the devices indeed solved them?  We’ll end by discussing a new protocol, for generating certified random bits, that can be implemented almost as soon as quantum supremacy itself is achieved, and which might therefore become the first application of quantum computing to be realized.</p></blockquote>



<p>Finally, thanks so much to Giovanni Sommaruga and everyone else at ETH for arranging a fantastic visit.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-116 |  $d$-to-$1$ Hardness of Coloring $4$-colorable Graphs with $O(1)$ colors | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Sai Sandeep</title>
    <summary>The $d$-to-$1$ conjecture of Khot asserts that it is hard to satisfy an $\epsilon$ fraction of constraints of a satisfiable $d$-to-$1$ Label Cover instance, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon &gt; 0$. We prove that the $d$-to-$1$ conjecture for any fixed $d$ implies the hardness of coloring a $4$-colorable graph with $C$ colors for arbitrarily large integers $C$. Earlier, this implication was only known under the $2$-to-$1$ conjecture, which is the strongest in the family of $d$-to-$1$ conjectures.</summary>

    <title>Are there any natural problems complete for NP INTER TALLY? NP INTER SPARSE?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
Recall:<br/>
<br/>
A is a <i>tally set</i> if A ⊆ 1<sup>*</sup>. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A is a <i>sparse set</i> if there is a polynomial p such that the number of strings of length n is ≤ p(n). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If there exists a sparse set A that is NP-hard under m-reductions (even btt-reductions) then P=NP. (See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/04/favorite-theorems-small-sets.html">this post</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
If there exists a sparse set A that is NP-hard under T-reductions then PH collapses. (See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/11/favorite-theorems-nonuniform.html">this post</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
Okay then!<br/>
<br/>
I have sometimes had a tally set or a sparse set that is in NP and I think that its not in P. I would like to prove, or at least conjecture, that it's NP-complete. But alas, I cannot since then P=NP. (Clarification: If my set is NP-complete then P=NP. I do not mean that the very act of conjecturing it would make P=NP. That would be an awesome superpower.)<br/>
<br/>
So what to do?  <br/>
<br/>
A is <i>NPSPARSE-complete </i> if A is in NP, A is sparse, and for all B that are in NP and sparse, B ≤<sub>m</sub> A.<br/>
<br/>
Similar for NPTALLY and one can also look at other types of reductions.<br/>
<br/>
So, can I show that my set is NPSPARSE-complete? Are there any NPSPARSE-complete sets? Are there NATURAL ones? (Natural is a slippery notion- see this <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/03/unnatural-post.html">post by Lance</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I was able to find out (if more is known then please leave comments with pointers.)<br/>
<br/>
1) It was observed by <a href="https://lance.fortnow.com/papers/files/npsparse.pdf">Bhurman, Fenner, Fortnow, van Velkebeek</a> that the following set is NPTALLY-complete:<br/>
<br/>
Let M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, ... be a standard list of NP-machines. Let<br/>
<br/>
A = { 1<sup>(i,n,t)</sup> : M<sub>i</sub>(1<sup>n</sup>) accepts on some path within t steps }'<br/>
<br/>
The set involves Turing Machines so its not quite what I want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/messnertoran.pdf">Messner and Toran</a> show that, under an unlikely assumption about proof systems there exists an NPSPARSE-complete set. The set involves Turing Machines. Plus it uses an unlikely assumption. Interesting, but not quite what I want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Buhrman, Fenner, Fortnow, van Melkebeek also showed that there are relativized worlds where there are no NPSPARSE sets (this was their main result). Interesting but not quite what I want.  <br/>
<br/>
4) If A is NE-complete then the tally version: { 1<sup>x</sup> : x is in A } is likely NPTALLY-complete. This may help me get what I want.<br/>
<br/>
Okay then!<br/>
<br/>
Are there any other sets that are NPTALLY-complete. NPSPARSE-complete? The obnoxious answer is to take finite variants of A.  What I really want a set of such problems so that we can proof other problems NPTALLY-complete or NPSPARSE-complete with the ease we now prove problems NP-complete.<br/>

    <summary>The k-Even Set problem is a parameterized variant of the Minimum Distance Problem of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_2$, which can be stated as follows: given a generator matrix A and an integer k, determine whether the code generated by A has distance at most k, or in other words, whether there is a nonzero vector x such that Ax has at most k nonzero coordinates. The question of whether k-Even Set is fixed parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the distance k has been repeatedly raised in literature; in fact, it is one of the few remaining open questions from the seminal book of Downey and Fellows (1999). In this work, we show that k-Even Set is W[1]-hard under randomized reductions.

We also consider the parameterized k-Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), in which we are given a lattice whose basis vectors are integral and an integer k, and the goal is to determine whether the norm of the shortest vector (in the $\ell_p$ norm for some fixed p) is at most k. Similar to k-Even Set, understanding the complexity of this problem is also a long-standing open question in the field of Parameterized Complexity. We show that, for any p&gt;1, k-SVP is W[1]-hard to approximate (under randomized reductions) to some constant factor.</summary>

This confirms a conjecture of Littlewood from 1966.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">A little more about the result</span></h3>
<p>It is still a major open problem to replace <img alt="\delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\delta"/> by <img alt="(1-o(1))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-o%281%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1-o(1))"/> and <img alt="\Delta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CDelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\Delta"/> by <img alt="1+o(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Bo%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="1+o(1)"/> (ultra-flat polynomials).</p>
<p>The problem can be traced back to a 1916 paper by Hardy and Littlewood.</p>
<p>Shapiro (1959) and Rudin (1959) showed the existence of such polynomials when you only require <img alt="P(z) \le \Delta \sqrt n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28z%29+%5Cle+%5CDelta+%5Csqrt+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="P(z) \le \Delta \sqrt n"/> for all <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-7-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-45"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-46"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-47">z </span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-48">∈ </span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-49"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-50"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-51">C</span></span></span></span></span></span></em> with <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-8-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-52"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-53"><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-54"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-55"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-56">|</span></span></span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-57">z</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-58"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-59"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-60">|</span></span></span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-61">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-62">1</span></span></span></span></em>.</p>
<p>The new result confirms a conjecture of Littlewood from 1966 and answers a question by Erdős from 1957.</p>
<p>If one allows complex coefficients of absolute value one, ultra flat polynomials exist by a result of Kahane (1980). Bombieri and Bourgain (2009) gave an explicit construction with sharper bounds.</p>
<p>The proof relies strongly on Spencer’s famous result :”Six standard deviation suffices”.  (In fact, on a version of Spencer’s result by Lovett and Meka.)<span id="more-17957"/></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Six standard deviation suffices</span></h3>
<p>Here is a reminder of Spencer’s theorem. (See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/discrepancy-games-and-sensitivity/">this GLL post;</a> We talked about it before and also on related results in Discrepancy’s theory, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2011/08/28/discrepancy-the-beck-fiala-theorem-and-the-answer-to-test-your-intuition-14/">this post</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/poznan-random-structures-and-algorithms-2013/">this one</a> and also <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/08/27/edp23-second-guest-post-by-gil-kalai/">this one</a> on Gowers’s blog.)</p>
<p>Spencer’s “Six standard deviation suffices” theorem:  If <img alt="L_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)=" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_i%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%3D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="L_i(x_1,\dots,x_n)="/> <img alt="= a_{i1} x_1 + \dots + a_{in} x_n," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3D+a_%7Bi1%7D+x_1+%2B+%5Cdots+%2B+a_%7Bin%7D+x_n%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="= a_{i1} x_1 + \dots + a_{in} x_n,"/> <img alt="\quad 1 \leq i \leq n," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cquad+1+%5Cleq+i+%5Cleq+n%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\quad 1 \leq i \leq n,"/> are <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> linear forms in <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> variables with all <img alt="|a_{ij}| \leq 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ca_%7Bij%7D%7C+%5Cleq+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="|a_{ij}| \leq 1"/>, then there exist numbers <img alt="\varepsilon_1,\dots,\varepsilon_n \in \{-1,+1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarepsilon_1%2C%5Cdots%2C%5Cvarepsilon_n+%5Cin+%5C%7B-1%2C%2B1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\varepsilon_1,\dots,\varepsilon_n \in \{-1,+1\}"/> such that <img alt="|L_i(\varepsilon_1,\dots,\varepsilon_n)| \leq K \sqrt{n}," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CL_i%28%5Cvarepsilon_1%2C%5Cdots%2C%5Cvarepsilon_n%29%7C+%5Cleq+K+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="|L_i(\varepsilon_1,\dots,\varepsilon_n)| \leq K \sqrt{n},"/> for all <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">My favorite (rather) flat polynomial: the determinant</span></h3>
<p>The determinant thought of as a polynomial of <img alt="n^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^2"/> variable is rather flat as far as upper bounds are concerned.  (Moreover, if you restrict yourself to matrices where the rows are orthonormal then the determinant is constant.) I will be happy to learn about  other rather-flat examples of explicit and algebraically significant polynomials. (Even on sub-varieties.)</p>
<p>Remark: Here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04806">a paper by the same team</a> on Erdős’ covering systems.</p>

Jeffrey Shallit is a famous researcher into many things, including number theory and being a skeptic. He has a colorful website with an extensive quotation <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/quotes.html">page</a>—one of my favorites by Howard Aiken is right at the top:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Don’t worry about people stealing an idea. If it’s original, you will have to ram it down their throats. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Today I thought I would discuss a wonderful problem that Jeffrey has worked on.</p>
<p>
Jeffrey’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4513">paper</a> is joint with Erik Demaine, Sarah Eisenstat, and David Wilson. See also his <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Talks/bc4.pdf">talk</a>. They say in their introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Imagine a computing device with very limited powers. What is the simplest computational problem you could ask it to solve? It is not the addition of two numbers, nor sorting, nor string matching—it is telling two inputs apart: distinguishing them in some way. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
More formally: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Let <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> be two distinct <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> long strings over the usual binary alphabet. What is the size of the smallest deterministic automaton <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/> that can accept one of the strings and reject the other? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
That is, how hard is it for a simple type of machine to tell <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> apart from <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>? There is no super cool name for the question—it is called the <i>Separating Words Problem</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separating_words_problem">SWP</a>). </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some History </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Pavel Goral&amp;ccaron;ik and Vaclav Koubek introduced the problem in 1986—see their paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-16761-7_61">here</a>. Suppose that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> are distinct binary words of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. Define <img alt="{\bf{SEP}(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf%7BSEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bf{SEP}(x,y)}"/> to be the number of states of the smallest automaton that accepts <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and rejects <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> or vice-versa. They proved the result that got people interested:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For all distinct binary words <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) =o(n). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29+%3Do%28n%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) =o(n). "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the size of the automaton is asymptotically sub-linear. Of course there is trivially a way to tell the words apart with order <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> states. The surprise is that one can do better, always.</p>
<p>
In 1989 John Robson obtained the best known result: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> For all distinct binary words <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = O(n^{2/5}(\log n)^{3/5}). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+O%28n%5E%7B2%2F5%7D%28%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B3%2F5%7D%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = O(n^{2/5}(\log n)^{3/5}). "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This bound is pretty strange. We rarely see bounds like it. This suggest to me that it is either special or it is not optimal. Not clear which is the case. By the way it is also known that there are <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> so that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = \Omega(\log n). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5COmega%28%5Clog+n%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,y) = \Omega(\log n). "/></p>
<p>Thus there is an exponential gap between the known lower and upper bounds. Welcome to complexity theory.</p>
<p>
What heightens interest in this gap is that whenever the words have different lengths, there is always a logarithmic-size automaton that separates them. The reason is our old friend, the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Simply, if <img alt="{m &lt; n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m &lt; n}"/> there is always a short prime <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> that does not divide <img alt="{n - m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+-+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n - m}"/>, which means that the DFA that goes in a cycle of length <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> will end in a different state on any <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> of length <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> from the state on any <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. Moreover, the strings <img alt="{0^m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5Em%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0^m}"/> and <img alt="{0^N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%5EN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0^N}"/> where <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> equals <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> plus the least common multiple of <img alt="{1,\dots,m+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5Cdots%2Cm%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1,\dots,m+1}"/> require <img alt="{\Omega(\log N)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5COmega%28%5Clog+N%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Omega(\log N)}"/> states to separate. Padding these with <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>s gives equal-length pairs of all lengths <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> giving <b>SEP</b>(x,y)<img alt="{\sim \log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim+%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sim \log n}"/>.</p>
<p>
Some other facts about SWP can be found in the paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
(a) It does not matter whether the alphabet is binary or larger. <p/>
</li><li>
(b) For random distinct <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/>, the expected number of states needed to separate them is at most <img alt="{4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{4}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
(c) All length-<img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> pairs <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x,y}"/> can be distinguished by deterministic pushdown automata (with two-way input tape) of size <img alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\log n)}"/>.
</li></ul>
<p>
Point (b) underscores why it has been hard to find “bad pairs” that defeat all small DFAs. All this promotes belief that logarithmic is the true upper bound as well. Jeffrey stopped short of calling this a conjecture in his talk, but he did offer a 100-pound prize (the talk was in Britain) for improving Robson’s bound. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Questions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There are many partial results in cases where <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> are restricted in some way. See the papers for details. I thought I would just repeat a couple of interesting open cases.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> How hard is it to tell words from their reversal? That is, if <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is a word can we prove a better bound on 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,x^{R}). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Cbf+SEP%7D%28x%2Cx%5E%7BR%7D%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\bf SEP}(x,x^{R}). "/></p>
<p>Recall <img alt="{x^{R}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7BR%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^{R}}"/> is the reversal of the word <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/>. Of course we assume that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is not the same as its reversal—that is, we assume that <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is not a palindrome.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> How hard is it to tell words apart from their cyclic shifts?</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> How hard is it to tell words from their <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> You get the idea: try other operations on words. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The SWP is a neat question in my opinion. I wonder if there would be some interesting consequence if we could always tell two words apart with few states. The good measure of a conjecture is: how many consequences are there that follow from it? I wonder if there could be some interesting applications. What do you think?</p>

    <title>TR19-114 |  Singular tuples of matrices is not a null cone (and, the symmetries of algebraic varieties) | 

	Visu Makam, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>The following multi-determinantal algebraic variety plays a central role in algebra, algebraic geometry and computational complexity theory: ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$, consisting of all $m$-tuples of $n\times n$ complex matrices which span only singular matrices. In particular, an efficient deterministic algorithm testing membership in ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$ will imply super-polynomial circuit lower bounds, a holy grail of the theory of computation.
  A sequence of recent works suggests such efficient algorithms for memberships in a general class of algebraic varieties, namely the null cones of linear group actions. Can this be used for the problem above? Our main result is negative: ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$ is not the null cone of any (reductive) group action! This stands in stark contrast to a non-commutative analog of this variety, and points to an inherent structural difficulty of ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$.
  To prove this result we identify precisely the group of symmetries of ${\rm SING}_{n,m}$. We find this characterization, and the tools we introduce to prove it, of independent interest. Our work significantly generalizes a result of Frobenius for the special case $m=1$, and suggests a general method for determining the symmetries of algebraic varieties.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I'm shortly hopping on a plane to head to ALGO/ESA.  I'll be giving a survey-ish talk on Learning Augmented Algorithms, covering my work so far in the area as well as some of the work by others.  I think it's a highly promising direction fitting in the framework of Beyond Worst Case Analysis, so I'm excited to give the talk, and hoping it's still a novel enough area to be new to most of the audience. <br/><br/>For those of you who are there, feel free to say hi -- I'm looking forward to talking to people. <br/><br/><br/></div>

    <title>Transitioning</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">You may have noticed, or not, that I haven't posted or tweeted much in the last month. I've had a busy time moving back to Chicago and starting my new position as Dean of the College of Science at Illinois Tech.<br/>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Part of that trip involved driving my electric Chevy Bolt from Atlanta to Chicago. You can do it, but it got a bit nerve wracking. There is only one high-speed charging station between Indianapolis and Chicago and you pray the charger outside the Lafayette Walmart actually works (it did). We passed many Tesla charging superstations, I will have to admit they have the better network. </div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Theoremwise, Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu and Jiapeng Zhang had <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/">significant improvements on the sunflower conjecture</a>. I posted on the sunflower theorem for Richard Rado's <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2006/04/richard-rado-1906-1989.html">centenary</a>. Nice to see there is still some give in it.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I probably will post less often in this new position. Bill asked me "Why is being a dean (or maybe its just the move) more time then being a chair? Were you this busy when you moved and first became chair?"<br/>
<br/>
When I moved to Atlanta, I moved a year ahead of the rest of the family and rented a condo. We had plenty of time to search for a house in Atlanta and plan the move. Here it all happened in a much more compressed time schedule and, since we've bought a condo, into a much more compressed space.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Being a chair certainly ate up plenty of time but it feels different as dean with a more external focus. I won't give up the blog but you'll probably hear a lot more from Bill than from me at least in the near future.</div></div>

    <title>TR19-113 |  Instance Complexity and Unlabeled Certificates in the Decision Tree Model | 

	Tomer Grossman, 

	Ilan Komargodski, 

	Moni Naor</title>
    <summary>Instance complexity is a measure of goodness of an algorithm in which the performance of one algorithm is compared to others per input. This is in sharp contrast to worst-case and average-case complexity measures, where the performance is compared either on the worst input or on an average one, respectively.

  We initiate the systematic study of instance complexity and optimality in the query model (a.k.a. the decision tree model). In this model, instance optimality of an algorithm for computing a function is the requirement that the complexity of an algorithm on any input is at most a constant factor larger than the complexity of the best correct algorithm. That is we compare the decision tree to one that receives a certificate and its complexity is measured only if the certificate is correct (but correctness should hold on any input).  We study both deterministic and randomized decision trees and provide various characterizations and barriers for more general results.

  We introduce a new measure of complexity called unlabeled-certificate complexity, appropriate for graph properties and other functions with symmetries, where information about the structure of the graph is given as a certificate, but not labels of individual vertices. More precisely, the certificate is some permutation of the input (rather than the input itself) and the correctness should be maintained even if the certificate is wrong. We study both worst case complexity and instance optimality with respect to this measure of complexity. In this setting an algorithm is said to be instance optimal if for every input it performs roughly as well as the best algorithm that is given an unlabeled certificate (but is correct on every input).  We show that instance optimality depends on the group of permutations in consideration. Our proofs rely on techniques from hypothesis testing and analysis of random graphs.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A comparatively slow month, as summer draws to a close: we found three papers online. Please let us know if we missed any! <em>(Edit: And we added two papers missed from June.) </em></p>



<p><strong>Testing convexity of functions over finite domains</strong>, by Aleksandrs Belovs, Eric Blais, and Abhinav Bommireddi (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/092/">arXiv</a>). This paper studies the classic problem of convexity testing, and proves a number of interesting results on the adaptive and non-adaptive complexity of this problem in single- and multi-dimensional settings. In the single-dimensional setting on domain \([n]\), they show that adaptivity doesn’t help: the complexity will be \(O(\log n)\) in both cases. However, in the simplest two-dimensional setting, a domain of \([3] \times [n]\), they give a polylogarithmic upper bound in the adaptive setting, but a polynomial lower bound in the non-adaptive setting, showing a strong separation. Finally, they provide a lower bound for \([n]^d\) which scales exponentially in the dimension. This leaves open the tantalizing open question: is it possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality when testing convexity?</p>



<p><strong>Testing Isomorphism in the Bounded-Degree Graph Model</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/102/">ECCC</a>). This work investigates the problem of testing isomorphism of graphs, focusing on the special case when the connected components are only polylogarithmically large (the general bounded-degree case is left open). One can consider when a graph is given as input, and we have to query a graph to test if they are isomorphic. This can be shown to be equivalent (up to polylogarithmic factors) to testing (from queries) whether a sequence is a permutation of a reference sequence. In turn, this can be shown to be equivalent to the classic distribution testing question of testing (from samples) whether a distribution is equal to some reference distribution. The same sequence of equivalences <em>almost</em> works for the case where there is no reference graph/sequence/distribution, but we only have query/query/sample access to the object. The one exception is that the reduction doesn’t work to reduce from testing distributions to testing whether a sequence is a permutation, due to challenges involving sampling with and without replacement. However, the author still shows the lower bound which would be implied by such a reduction by adapting Valiant’s proof for the distribution testing problem to this case.   </p>



<p><strong>Learning Very Large Graphs with Unknown Vertex Distributions</strong>, by Gábor Elek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10170">arXiv</a>). In this note, the author studies a variant of distribution-free property testing on graphs, in which (roughly) neighboring vertices have probabilities of bounded ratio, and a query reveals this ratio. Applications to local graph algorithms and connections to dynamical systems are also discussed.</p>



<p>EDIT: We apparently missed two papers from June — the  first paper was accepted to NeurIPS 2019, the second to COLT 2019.<br/><strong>The Broad Optimality of Profile Maximum Likelihood</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10170">arXiv</a>). Recently, Acharya, Das, Orlitsky, and Suresh (ICML 2017) showed that the Profile Maximum Likelihood (PML) estimator enables a unified framework for estimating a number of distribution properties, including support size, support coverage, entropy, and distance to uniformity, obtaining estimates which are competitive with the best possible. The approach is rather clean: simply estimate the PML of the distribution (i.e., the maximum likelihood distribution of the data, if the the labels are discarded and only the multiplicities of elements are kept), and apply the plug-in estimator (i.e., if you want to estimate entropy, compute the entropy of the resulting PML distribution). The present work shows that PML is even more broadly applicable — such an approach applies to <em>any</em> property which is additive, symmetric, and appropriately Lipschitz. They also show specific results for many other properties which have been considered in the past, including Rényi entropy, distribution estimation, and identity testing.</p>



<p><strong>Sample-Optimal Low-Rank Approximation of Distance Matrices</strong> by Piotr Indyk, Ali Vakilian, Tal Wagner, David Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00339">arXiv</a>). Getting a rank \(k\) approximation of an \(n \times m\) matrix \(M\) is about as classic a problem as it gets. Suppose we wanted a running time of \(O(n+m)\), which is sublinear in the matrix size. In general, this is not feasible, since there could be a single large entry that dominates the matrix norm. This paper studies the case where the matrix is itself a <em>distance matrix</em>. So there is an underlying point set in a metric space, and the \(i, j\)th entry of \(M\) is the distance between the $i$th and $j$th point. Previous work showed the existence of \(O((n+m)^{1+\gamma})\) time algorithms (for arbitrary small constant $\gamma &gt; 0$, with polynomial dependence on \(k\) and error parameters). This work gives an algorithm that runs in \(\widetilde{O}(n+m)\) time. The main idea is to sample the rows and columns according to row/column norms. </p></div>

Avrim Blum is the CAO for TTIC. That is he is the Chief Academic Officer at the Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago. Avrim has and continues to make key contributions to many areas of theory—including machine learning, approximation algorithms, on-line algorithms, algorithmic game theory, the theory of database privacy, and non-worst-case analysis of algorithms. </p>
<p>
Today I want to discuss a suggestion of Avrim for research on self-play.<span id="more-16223"/></p>
<p>
Self-play is the key to many recent AI results on playing games. These results include essentially solving the games Chess, Go, Shogi, forms of poker, and many others. They were solved by algorithms that start with no knowledge of the game, save the rules. The algorithm then learn the secrets of playing the game by self-play: by playing games against itself. For example, the AI chess programs did not know that “a rook is worth more than a pawn.” But they discover that by playing the game over and over. Impressive. </p>
<p>
For example, David Sweet on his hacker <a href="https://hackernoon.com/self-play-1f69ceb06a4d">site</a> says referring to self-play: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This is mysterious to me. If it only played against itself, where did new information come from? How did it know if it was doing well? If I play a game of chess against myself, should I say I did well if I beat myself? But when I beat myself, I also lose to myself. And how could I ever know if I’d do well against someone else? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Planted Clique Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I was at TTIC last month and over lunch we discussed self-play possibilities for theory problems. I suggested that the planted clique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planted_clique">problem</a> might be a potential example. Recall the planted clique problem is the task of distinguishing two types of graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Random graphs on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vertices generated with <img alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p=1/2}"/>, the probability that there is an edge between each pair of nodes; <p/>
</li><li>
Random graphs on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vertices generated with <img alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p=1/2}"/>, with a clique of size <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> added, the planted clique.
</li></ul>
<p>
If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> is large, it is easy to tell these apart—just count the number of edges. If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> is small enough, it is open if one can tell them apart. The largest clique in a random graph typically has size near <img alt="{k=2\log_{2} n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D2%5Clog_%7B2%7D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k=2\log_{2} n}"/>. This implies that there is a quasi-polynomial time average-case algorithm: just try all subsets of size around <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>.</p>
<p>
My intuition was that a program might be able to exploit self-play to solve planted clique problems. The point is that it is easy, by definition, to generate “yes” and “no” examples for this problem. Note, this is not known for SAT problems—generating hard instances there is not clear. This was my point. Could the AI methods somehow divine the planted clique version of “a rook is worth more than a pawn”? Could they use self-play to solve planted clique problems?</p>
<p>
I wondered to the lunch group about all this. It left the group unexcited. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ramsey Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Then Avrim asked a better question. He wondered if self-play methods could be used to solve a long standing problem concerning Ramsey numbers. Recall the Ramsey number <img alt="{R(s,s)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28s%2Cs%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(s,s)}"/> is defined as the smallest <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> such every red-green coloring of the edges of the complete graph <img alt="{K_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{n}}"/> has either a red or a green subgraph of size at least <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/>.</p>
<p>
The exact value of <img alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5, 5)}"/> is unknown, although it is known to lie between <img alt="{43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{43}"/> and <img alt="{48}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B48%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{48}"/>. See a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">post</a> by Gil Kalai on his blog for some discussions. Joel Spencer quotes Paul Erdős: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Erdős asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of <img alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5, 5)}"/> or they will destroy our planet. In that case, he claims, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for <img alt="{R(6, 6)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%286%2C+6%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(6, 6)}"/>. In that case, he believes, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.	 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Aliens are not attacking currently, but Avrim’s idea is that perhaps we could organize a self-play attack on the <img alt="{R(5,5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5,5)}"/> problem. The idea would be to try to build a “game” version of this question. The algorithm would try to create a strategy that finds a red/green coloring for the complete graph so that no <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/>-clique is all red or all green. </p>
<p>
We need to arrange the computation of the Ramsey number as the result of some type of game. The paradox to me is that the play of a game suggests <img alt="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPSPACE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}"/>, while the Ramsey calculation is clearly of complexity <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>. So how do we make the Ramsey calculation into a game? Ken and I wonder if there is a natural game <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> so that playing the game well yields insight into the value of a Ramsey number.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is there a game <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> with simple rules so that playing it well yields bounds on general Ramsey numbers?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Attacks on Ramsey Numbers </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There have been several attempts to use non-standard methods to compute Ramsey numbers. See the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
In this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-013-0541-9">article</a>, quantum methods studied for the future, when hopefully quantum computers will be available. <p/>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://themusegarden.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/a-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-ramsey-theory/">project</a> genetic methods are used on related Ramsey numbers. <p/>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01613.pdf">approach</a>, AI methods are used on related Ramsey numbers.
</li></ul>
<p>
See also this <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0662/893d7e04745a0709b3f1a092574f9dd3bf7b.pdf">survey</a> on computational methods in general.</p>
<p>
The asymmetry between the upper and lower bounds shapes approaches. The lower bound of 43 was proved by finding a two-coloring of the edges of <img alt="{K_{42}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B42%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{42}}"/> without a green or red <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/>-clique. Once a single coloring is guessed its property is easy to prove. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08768">improvement</a> of the upper bound from 49 to 48 two years ago <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">needed</a> checking two trillion cases in order to fence-away all possible colorings. This has led to a common belief that 43 is the answer—if it were higher then a coloring of <img alt="{K_{43}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B43%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{43}}"/> would have been found by now.</p>
<p>
Can we use self-play to turn this belief into something more concrete? The training would begin on running self-play on the known cases <img alt="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots+38%2C39%2C40%2C41%2C42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}"/>. This should create a neural net that is highly skilled at finding colorings that are free of small monochrome cliques. The question is how to leverage its presumed failure once we hit size <img alt="{43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{43}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perhaps someone should take Avrim’s suggestion and try it out. A natural idea would be to see if this approach could compute the known smaller Ramsey numbers—getting their exact upper bounds. </p>

    <title>Happy New Academic Year:  Teaching Randomized Algorithms</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It seems I haven't written on this blog for a while.<br/><br/>Today was the start of a new semester.  I'll be teaching Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis, using the new edition of my book with Eli Upfal as a base, and throwing in other material.  (Everyone should buy the book!  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/110715488X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=michaelmitzen-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=110715488X&amp;linkId=d598fb636637ebb656410099e7042a7c">Here's a link</a>.)  <br/><br/>It's a graduate level class, but generally designed for first year graduate students, and there were a lot of undergrads "shopping" it today.  (We don't do pre-registration at Harvard, and students get the first week to choose classes, known as shopping.)  So many that people were standing out the doors of the room.  But because we have a bit of a shortage of classes this semester, I'm guessing there's a good fraction of students just checking it out.  We'll see Thursday, but for now I'll predict we'll fit in the classroom, and wait to see if I'm wrong.  (If I'm wrong, that's wonderful too.)    <br/><br/>It's been four years since I last taught the course, so this time I'm trying something new.  When I've previously taught the course, I tried to make the class inviting and friendly by telling the class we'd begin without assuming the class knew probability, and so the first couple of weeks would be reviewing basics (like, say, linearity of expectations and union bounds), albeit in a CS algorithms context.  This time, I let the class know I'm assuming they know (or will pick up) basic probability, and so they should read chapters 1-4 on their own, and we'll start with Chapter 5, Balls and Bins models.  Over the last decade, I've seen a huge shift in probability knowledge -- Stat 110, Harvard's probability course, has become one of Harvard's biggest classes.  Many students have already taking AI or ML or even data science courses where they've done some (further) probability.  It feels appropriate (and safe) to assume people entering in the class know probability, or can review what they need on their own, and start the class further along.<br/><br/>Now finally, a request.  It's actually hard for me to teach when using this book, because I don't want to just read the book to the students.  That's boring.  On the other hand, if I thought something was important, I most likely already put it in the book.  We have to mix up the standard lecturing format a bit.  So two things we'll be doing are<br/><br/>1)  doing some "puzzle problems" at the beginning of most classes, so people can try to solve problems.  (Kind of a flipped classroom approach, but not a full commitment.)<br/>2)  reading papers, related to the class topics.<br/><br/>So if you have any good suggestions of probability puzzle problems, or readable papers (particularly application papers) that use relatively basic probabilistic analysis in neat ways, send them over.  I've got a semester to fill.<br/><br/>For curious people, here's one of today's starting problems, which I first learned about in graduate school.  (I'm pretty sure I owe thanks to Claire Kenyon for teaching it.  I'll link to the corresponding Wikipedia page on the problem maybe later.)<br/><br/>After lunch, Bob suggests the following game to see who pays.  Alice and Bob will each choose a different sequence of three flips.  (So they could choose "Heads-Tails-Heads'', or "Tails-Tails-Tails'' for example.)  After they choose, a fair coin will be tossed until one of their sequences appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin tosses.  The player whose sequence appears first wins. (Note that if they choose the above sequences, and if the flips come up Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails, the player that chose Tails-Tails-Tails would win as soon as their subsequence appears;  it's not three flips, then start over again.)  Bob politely says that Alice can choose first, and after she chooses and tells him her sequence he'll choose a different sequence.  What should Alice choose?</div>

    <title>Can Mathematicians Fix Iphones? Can anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
In my last post I noted that if I am asked (since I am a CS prof)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Can you fix my iphone</i><br/>
<br/>
is<br/>
<br/>
<i>No, I work on the math side of CS</i><br/>
<br/>
Some readers emailed me (I told them to comment instead but they were worried that other readers would argue with them) that NO, this is a tired and incorrect stereotype.  Here are some samples:<br/>
<br/>
1) People in Mathematics are no better or worse at fixing iphones, fixing cars, programming their VCR's, etc than the public.<br/>
<br/>
2) For that matter, people in academica, even in practical sounding fields like Systems, are no better.<br/>
<br/>
3) Is your nephew Jason who used to fix forklifts for a living  better at these things then the general public? I asked him. Answer: No, though he is better at fixing forklifts.<br/>
<br/>
I think something else is going on here. Lets look at fixing your own car. I think this is the sort of thing that some people used to be able to do but now very few can do it. Cars have gotten more complicated. <br/>
<br/>
Iphones are not quite there yet but its getting that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course somethings have gotten easier--- programming a DVR is much easier than programming a VCR.   And people can easily use WORD or write programs without having to know any hardware.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, after all these random thoughts, here is the question: What do you think? <br/>
<br/>
Are people in CS or Math or CS theory better at X than the general public where X is NOT CS, Math or CS theory, but something like fixing their cars?<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
What has gotten harder? What has gotten easier?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>TR19-112 |  Agreement testing theorems on layered set systems | 

	Yotam Dikstein, 

	Irit Dinur</title>
    <summary>We introduce a framework of layered subsets, and give a sufficient condition for when a set system supports an agreement test. Agreement testing is a certain type of property testing that generalizes PCP tests such as the plane vs. plane test. 

Previous work has shown that high dimensional expansion is useful for agreement tests. We extend these results to more general families of subsets, beyond simplicial complexes. These include

* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are faces of high dimensional expanders. Our new tests apply to all dimensions of complexes both in case of two-sided expansion and in the case of one-sided partite expansion.  This improves and extends an earlier work of Dinur and Kaufman (FOCS 2017) and applies to matroids, and potentially many additional complexes.
* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are neighborhoods of vertices in a high dimensional expander. This family resembles the expander neighborhood family used in the gap-amplification proof of the PCP theorem. This set system is quite natural yet does not sit in a simplicial complex, and demonstrates some versatility in our proof technique. %It could potentially be useful towards new and more efficient constructions of locally testable codes and PCPs.
* Agreement tests on families of subspaces (also known as the Grassmann poset). This extends the classical low degree agreement tests beyond the setting of low degree polynomials.

Our analysis relies on a new random walk on simplicial complexes which we call the ``complement random walk'' and which may be of independent interest. This random walk generalizes the non-lazy random walk on a graph to higher dimensions, and has significantly better expansion than previously-studied random walks on simplicial complexes.</summary>

<p>Let <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G"/> be a bipartite graph with <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/> vertices on one side and <img alt="n " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n "/> vertices on the other side, and with vertex-degrees <img alt="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_1%2Cd_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Cd_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m"/> and <img alt="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2Ce_2%2C%5Cdots+e_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Ehrenborg’s problem:</strong> Is it the case that the number of spanning trees of <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G"/> is at most</p>
<p><img alt="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%7B-1%7Dn%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cprod_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Em+d_i+%5Cprod_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+e_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j"/>.</p>
<p>In words, the number of spanning trees is at most the product of the vertex degrees divided by the sizes of the two sides.</p>
<p>For example for the complete bipartite graph the number of the spanning trees is <img alt="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bm-1%7Dm%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}"/> so equality hold.  More genarally,  equality holds for <strong>Ferrer’s graphs</strong>. Those are graphs where the vertices on the two sides are ordered and if <img alt="(a,b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a,b)"/> is an edge so are <img alt="(a',b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%27%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a',b)"/> and <img alt="(a,b')" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a,b')"/> for <img alt="a'&lt;a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27%3Ca&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a'&lt;a"/> and <img alt="b'&lt;b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%27%3Cb&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="b'&lt;b"/>. See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2918"> this paper of Richard Ehrenborg and Stephanie van Willigenburg</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Klee and Matthiew Stamps  found a new point of view for both the weighted and unweighted settings. (See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03575"> this paper</a> by Klee and Stamps and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04973">this paper</a>.) <span id="more-17923"/></p>
<p>There is an analogous problem for general graphs where threshold graphs replace Ferrer’s graphs. This is related to a conjecture by Grone and Merris. (There are importat related works by Kelmans.) See <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2002-354-11/S0002-9947-02-03082-9/home.html">this paper</a> by Duval and Reiner and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0302213">this paper</a> by Martin and Reiner for related results and conjectures on spectrum of Laplacians for general simplicial complexes and shifted simplicial complexes.</p>
<p>I have learned that the Crone-Merris conjecture itself was <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2011-363-08/S0002-9947-2011-05393-6/home.html">settled by Hua Bai in 2012</a>.

How should one visualize the order-type of a set of points (which triples are clockwise, which counterclockwise, and which collinear)? Aichholzer et al consider points without collinear triples, and draw a graph over the points so that as points move the order-type changes only as points cross edges. Their graph’s embedding determines the order type and has at most a third as many edges as the complete graph.</p>

As <em>Quanta</em> describes, one possible resolution is to add a third black hole to the mix, and get a (significantly less stable) three-body problem.</p>

<p>Update and follow-up on the Safe ToC initiative:  </p>



<p>Last year, a group of us served on an ad hoc committee to combat harassment and discrimination in the Theory of Computing community.  In our report, we suggested a number of measures that the various theory conferences could adopt to help in this effort.  At a minimum, we wanted conferences to adopt a code of conduct and to appoint volunteers to serve as ToC Advocates whose role will be to provide support to any individual who has experienced harassment at a conference.  Our full final report is now available here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf</a></p>



<p>A small subset of the original committee along with Yuval Rabani in his capacity as IEEE TCMF chair are working on implementing some of the recommendations in the recent report. We have now launched a web site for the SafeToC Initiative: <a href="http://safetoc.org">safetoc.org</a><br/></p>



<p>So far, the support from the broader community has been strong. Quite a few conferences have passed resolutions to adopt the recommended practices in our report. The new web site lists all the participating conferences as well as the names of volunteers who have signed on to be ToC Advocates. The web site also provides information for ToC Advocates, conference organizers, and members of the ToC community. <br/></p>



<p>Participating conferences all have codes of conduct and are ensuring that participants agree to abide by the code as part of their registration process. In addition, some of these conferences are adopting new mechanisms for author-declared conflicts of interests. This is especially important if an author feels that he or she may receive an unfair review due to a previous harassment-related incident. <br/></p>



<p>Of course, the work is not done, and this important effort needs to continue. What can everyone do from here?<br/></p>



<ul><li>First, we are in need of trained ToC Advocates, to spread this important service around!  An advocate would be a designated conference attendee who would be available to provide support and information to anyone who has observed or experienced harassment at the conference The work is not difficult. Right now the training consists of an hour-long webinar sponsored by the ACM. We are envisioning one or two group Skype meetings per year to share experiences and best practices. If you are interested in serving as a ToC Advocate for a conference, you can contact someone on the steering committee for that conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Second, even if you are not serving as an Advocate, please familiarize yourself with the various codes of conduct, and perhaps even listen to a training video!  A larger community of invested bystanders who are aware of these issues and prepared to support and/or intervene as needed is critical.  This does not have to mean formal reporting – even helping to diffuse a problematic situation or checking in on a colleague to be sure they are ok after a difficult conversation can make a big difference to someone involved in an incident.</li></ul>



<p>We will continue to update the web page as participation in this effort grows. Thank you to everyone for helping to make our community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.<br/></p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Recently, my Facebook wall was full of discussion about instituting an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/16/mathematicians-need-doctor-style-hippocratic-oath-says-academic-hannah-fry?fbclid=IwAR1yvNyv8P4UJWhiAH_kshgXjjs_MZ2aVsfmLxrEv4d2sKAIzf2q3TtS4PQ">oath for STEM workers</a>, analogous to the Hippocratic oath for doctors.  Perhaps some of the motivation for this comes from a worldview I can’t get behind—one that holds STEM nerds almost uniquely responsible for the world’s evils.  Nevertheless, on reflection, I find myself in broad support of the idea.</p>



<p>But I prefer writing the oath myself.  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<p>1. I will never allow anyone else to make me a cog.  I will never do what is stupid or horrible because “that’s what the regulations say” or “that’s what my supervisor said,” and then sleep soundly at night.  I’ll never do my part for a project unless I’m satisfied that the project’s broader goals are, at worst, morally neutral.  There’s no one on earth who gets to say: “I just solve technical problems.  Moral implications are outside my scope.”  </p>



<p>2. If I build or supply tools that are used to do evil or cause suffering, I’ll be horrified as soon as I learn about it.  Yes, I might judge that the good of the tools outweighs the bad, that the bad can’t be prevented, etc.  But I’ll be hyper-alert to the possibility of self-serving bias in such reflections, and will choose a different course of action whenever the reflections are no longer persuasive to my highest self.</p>



<p>3. I will pursue the truth, and hold the sharing of truth and exposing of falsehoods among my highest moral values.</p>



<p>4. I will make a stink, resign, leak to the press, sabotage, rather than go along quietly with decisions inimical to my values.</p>



<p>5. I will put everything on the line for my students, advisees, employees—my time, funds, reputation, and credibility.  And not only because it can somewhat make up for failings in the other areas.</p>



<p>6. Black, white, male, female, trans, gay, straight, Israeli, Palestinian, young, old.  Whatever ideologies I might subscribe to about which groups are advantaged and which disadvantaged in which aspects of life—when it comes time to interact with a person, I will throw ideology into the ocean and treat them solely as an individual, not as a representative of a group.</p>



<p>7. I will not be Jeffrey Epstein—and not just in the narrow sense of not collecting underage girls on a private sex island.  I’ll see myself always as accountable to the moral judgment of history.  Whenever I’m publicly accused of wrongdoing, I’ll consider only two options: (a) if guilty, then confess, offer restitution, beg for forgiveness, or (b) if innocent, then mount a full public defense.  Finding some escape that avoids the need for either of these—from legal maneuvering to suicide—will never be on the table for me.</p>



<p>8. I’m under no obligation to blog or tweet every detail of my private life.  Yet even in my most private moments, I’ll act in such a way that, <em>if</em> my actions were made public, I’d have a defense of which I was unashamed.</p>



<p>9. To whatever extent I was gifted at birth with a greater-than-average ability to prove theorems or write code or whatever, I’ll treat it as just that—a gift, which I didn’t earn or deserve.  It doesn’t make me inherently worthier than anyone else, but it <em>does</em> give me a moral obligation to use the gift for good.  And whenever I’m tempted to be jealous of various non-nerds—of their ease in social or romantic situations, wealth, looks, power, athletic ability, or anything else about them—I’ll remember the gift, and that all in all, I made out better than I had a right to expect.</p>



<p>10. I’ll be conscious always of living in a universe where catastrophes—genocides, destructions of civilizations, extinctions of magnificent species—have happened and will happen again.  The burning of the Amazon, the deaths of children, the bleaching of coral reefs, will weigh on me daily, to the maximum extent consistent with being able to get out of bed in the morning, live, and work.  While it’s not obvious that <em>any</em> of these problems are open to a STEM-nerd solution, of the sort I could plausibly think of or implement—nevertheless, I’ll keep asking myself whether any of them are.  And if I ever <em>do</em> find myself before one of the levers of history, I’ll pull with all my strength to try to prevent these catastrophes.</p></div>

    <title>Grid majors</title>
    <summary>I’ve written here about grid minors before, more than once. These are grid graphs that you can get from a given graph as a minor (that is, by removing edges or vertices from and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of must be a grid graph that has as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (arXiv:1908.05706, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/12/16/grid-minors-in.html">written here about grid minors</a> before, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/03/05/more-on-grid.html">more than once</a>. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph">grid graphs</a> that you can get from a given graph  as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_minor">minor</a> (that is, by removing edges or vertices from  and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of  must be a grid graph that has  as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05706">arXiv:1908.05706</a>, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</p>

<p>You can define the terms in the paper’s title for any planar graph, but our results are cleanest for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_planar_graph">maximal planar graphs</a>. If we define the height of a grid to be the smaller of its two dimensions, then the grid-major height of a graph  is just the smallest height of a grid that has  as a minor. The detailed definition of homotopy height is trickier to explain, but the rough idea is that (after choosing one face of your graph to be the outer one) you should sweep a path from one edge of the outer face, across the graph, to another edge of the outer face, trying as you do to keep the path as short as possible. Paths can move across triangular faces (changing the number of vertices by ) or path vertices can “slide” along edges  (leaving the total number unchanged. The smallest length  such that you can do this sweep and always maintain length at most  turns out to equal the grid-major height, and both are lower bounds on the height of a conventional drawing of the graph (with its vertices at grid points and its edges as straight line segments).</p>

<p>For instance, the following drawing shows a height- grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, a sequence of  paths of length at most  sweeping from the left to the right edge of the graph, and the subsets of vertices to contract in a  grid to produce the graph as a minor. Each column of the grid has the same vertices as the corresponding path in the walk. For this graph, the drawing height, homotopy height, and grid-major height are all equal, but it is possible for the drawing height to be much larger than the other two quantities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, homotopy sequence for the graph, and grid major representation of the graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/grid-majors.svg"/></p>

<p>Both homotopy height and grid-major height come in simple and non-simple variations. They are equal for both variations, and both variations give a valid lower bound on graph drawing height. In simple homotopy height the swept path is required to stay simple (as it is in the example here) while more generally we allow walks that can repeat vertices. (In particular they can have “spikes”, parts of paths that double back along a single edge.) Correspondingly, non-simple grid-major height does not restrict how  is formed as a minor of a grid while the simple variant requires the parts of the grid corresponding to a single vertex of  to be contiguous within each column of the grid (as they are in the example here).</p>

<p>Because grid-major height behaves nicely under graph minor operations, it is automatically fixed-parameter tractable, but in a non-uniform way. What this means is that for each  there are finitely many graphs that, when they are a minor of , prevent  from having grid-major height . We can find the grid-major height of  by looking for these “obstacles” and returning the smallest  for which no obstacles are found. And, whenever  is bounded, the time of the resulting algorithm is a polynomial whose exponent is independent of the size of . So an algorithm exists for any fixed , but we don’t know how to actually write it down as a program because we don’t know what the obstacles are or even whether the number of obstacles is computable.</p>

<p>Simple grid-major height is nicer from the algorithmic point of view, but still not entirely satisfactory. Our paper describes the existence of a simple grid major using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a>. When  is bounded this gives us a linear-time algorithm via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcelle%27s_theorem">Courcelle’s theorem</a>. The algorithm could in principle be written out explicitly as a program,
with  given as an input to the program rather than hardcoded into it. There is no problem with unknown lists of obstacles. But the logical description is huge and the dependence of Courcelle’s theorem on the size of the logical description is very high, so although the time is linear in the size of the graph it gets multiplied by a very quickly growing function <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of .</span></p>

Danny Cohen was a pioneer who advanced many areas of computer science. He made contributions to computer graphics, networking, and flight simulation, and much more.</p>
<p>
Today I want to remember him and his work.</p>
<p><span id="more-16208"/></p>
<p>
Danny is hard to label. Leonard Kleinrock, said that Cohen “had the uncanny ability to employ his deep mathematical intellect and insight to real world challenges, with enormous impact.” Indeed. This is quoted in last week’s New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/obituaries/danny-cohen-who-helped-set-the-stage-for-a-digital-era-dies-at-81.html">obit</a>. The Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2019-08-20/danny-cohen-computer-scientist-dead">obit</a> noted his 1981 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667115">paper</a> addressed to warring “Big Endian” and “Little Endian” camps.</p>
<p>
Obituaries for Danny do not, in my opinion, explain why Danny was so remarkable. For example, he impacted theory even though he never worked in it. Let me explain in a moment. But first <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Danny—isms </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I worked with Danny. I was on a government committee that he chaired, years ago. He was an excellent leader, a tough chair, and ran a tight ship. He had been a fighter pilot, perhaps that is why he was such a great leader. On that committee—I will not identify it—he once fired a new committee member as he left the first meeting. Really as he walked out the door, while the rest of us were still meeting. He immediately said that he would not be staying on the committee. Tough. Yes. But Danny knew how to run a meeting.</p>
<p>
Danny had a clever wit. One of his favorite jokes was based on a form he had printed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The_____________________________technology is a promising technology and always will be.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He then would fill in the blank with whatever you thought was a great technology and hand it to you. Today perhaps we might fill in “quantum computing”—or is that wrong to say?</p>
<p>
Danny loved irony. His son revealed that Danny had joined the Flat Earth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">Society</a>. Danny was initially rejected—no scientists allowed. After he got in—this time he did not list his profession—he framed the certificate of membership, the rejection letter and the Flat Earth Society’s map of the world, complete with an emblazoned “Australia Not Down Under..”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> MOSIS </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A key contribution that seems to be missed in obits I’ve seen is that he helped create the VLSI revolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSIS">MOSIS</a> is the <i>Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service</i>. Danny created it, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9412602.pdf">styling</a> it after the earlier work of the pioneer Lynn Conway. Ten points if you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a> stands for.</p>
<p>
MOSIS allowed researchers to actually fabricate their designs: to convert digital plans into chips that worked. You designed the chips yourself, encoded in a strange digital file format. Then you sent the files to MOSIS. They then placed you design along with other designs onto one wafer. A wafer held many designs. The wafer files were finally sent to a commercial foundry. There they were converted from digital into silicon. When MOSIS got them back they broke the wafers up and sent you the chips that you designed. </p>
<p>
This was magical. The beauty was we could make working chips without having to have our own foundry. At that time frame many companies in the computer business would boast that they had they own <i>captive foundry</i>. Few could afford the huge cost of having their own fabrication foundry. Danny liked to say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A captive foundry was one that captured you. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>His point was that if you had your own foundry, you probably would be forced to use it, even if it was not the right type for your needs. Captive indeed.</p>
<p>
Since 1981, when it started, countless projects have been fabricated. MOSIS was a brilliant idea that made it possible for many to build working VLSI chips. We did that more that once while I was at Princeton University. While at Princeton my students and I sent several designs to MOSIS. For example, Dan Lopresti sent in a design that we discussed before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/nsf-workshop-on-design-automation-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/29/danny-cohen-passed-away/lop/" rel="attachment wp-att-16217"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16217" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/lop.png?w=140&amp;h=300" width="140"/></a></p>
<p>
The ability to make chips was a terrific motivator. I believe that the excitement of being able to make your own devices helped move the field forward. Without MOSIS, without Danny, the field would have advanced much slower. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perhaps the lesson of MOSIS is not lost on us. Today there are “MOSIS” like systems that allow even theorists to execute physically real quantum computations. This is indirectly thanks to Danny. We owe him much.</p>
