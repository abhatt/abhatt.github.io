    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Optimization is a key tool in machine learning, where the goal is to achieve the best possible objective function value in a minimum amount of time. Obtaining any form of global guarantees can usually be done with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">convex</a> objective functions, or with special cases such as risk minimization with one-hidden over-parameterized layer neural networks (see the <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">June post</a>). In this post, I will consider low-dimensional problems (imagine 10 or 20), with no constraint on running time (thus get ready for some running-times that are exponential in dimension!).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider minimizing a function \(f\) on a bounded subset  \(\mathcal{X}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), based only on function evaluations, a problem often referred to as zero-th order optimization or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization">derivative-free optimization</a>. No convexity is assumed, so we should not expect fast rates, and, again, no efficient algorithms that can provably find a global minimizer. Good references on what I am going to cover in this post are [1, 2, 5].</p>



<p class="justify-text">One may wonder why this is interesting at all. Clearly, such algorithms are not made to be used to find millions of parameters for logistic regression or neural networks, but they are often used for hyperparameter tuning (regularization parameters, size of neural network layer, etc.). See, e.g., [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/05311655a15b75fab86956663e1819cd-Paper.pdf">6</a>] for applications.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are going to assume some regularity for the functions we want to minimize, typically bounded derivatives. We will thus assume that \(f \in \mathcal{F}\), for a space \(\mathcal{F}\) of functions from \(\mathcal{X}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\). We are going to take a worst-case approach, where we characterize convergence over all members of \(\mathcal{F}\).  That is, we want our guarantees to hold for <em>all</em> functions in \(\mathcal{F}\). Note that this worst-case analysis may not predict well what’s happening for a particular function; in particular, it is (by design) pessimistic.</p>



<p class="justify-text">An algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\) will be characterized by (a) the choice of points \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\) to query the function, and (b) the algorithm to output a candidate \(\hat{x} \in \mathcal{X}\) such that \(f(\hat{x}) \ – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)  \) is small. The estimate \(\hat{x}\) can only depend on \((x_i,f(x_i))\), for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). In most of this post, the choice of points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) is made once (without seeing any function values). We show later in this blog post that going <em>adaptive</em>, where the point \(x_{i+1}\) is selected after seeing \((x_j,f(x_j))\) for all \(j \leqslant i\), does not bring much (at least in the worst-case sense).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given a selection of points and the algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\), the rate of convergence is the supremum over all functions \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) of the error \(f(\hat{x}) \ – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\). This is a function \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O})\) of the number \(n\) of sampled points (and of the the class of functions \(\mathcal{F}\)). The optimal algorithm (minimizing \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O})\)) will lead to a rate we denote \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt}\), and which we aim to characterize.</p>



<h2>Direct lower/upper bounds for Lipschitz-continuous functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The argument is particularly simple for a bounded metric space \(\mathcal{X}\) with distance \(d\), and \(\mathcal{F}\) the class of \(L\)-Lipschitz-continuous functions, that is, such that for all \(x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}\), \(|f(x) -f(x’)| \leqslant L d(x,x’)\). This is a very large set of functions, so expect weak convergence rates.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Set covers. </strong>We will need to cover the set \(\mathcal{X}\) with balls of a given radius. The minimal radius \(r\) of a cover of \(\mathcal{X}\) by \(n\) balls of radius \(r\) is denoted \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\). This corresponds to \(n\) ball centers \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). See example below for the unit cube \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^2\) and the metric obtained from the \(\ell_\infty\)-norm, with \(n = 16\), and \(r_n([0,1]^2,\ell_\infty) = 1/8\). See more details on covering numbers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_number">here</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5187" height="269" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cover-1024x1024.png" width="269"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">More generally, for the unit cube \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]^d\), we have \(r_n([0,1]^d,\ell_\infty) \approx \frac{1}{2} n^{-1/d}\) (which is not an approximation where \(n\) is the \(d\)-th power of an integer). For other normed metrics, (since all norms are equivalent) the scaling as \(r_n \sim {\rm diam} (\mathcal{X}) n^{-1/d}\) is the same on any bounded set in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (with an extra constant that depends on \(d\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Algorithm. </strong>Given the ball centers \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), outputting the minimum of function values \(f(x_i)\) for \(i=1,\dots,n\), leads to an error which is less than \(L r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\), as the optimal \(x_\ast \in \mathcal{X}\) is at most at distance \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\) from one of the cluster centers, let’s say \(x_k\), and thus \(f(x_k)\  – f(x_\ast) \leqslant L d(x_k,x_\ast) \leqslant L r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\). This provides an upper-bound on \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt}\). The algorithm we just described seems naive, but it turns out to be optimal for this class of problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lower-bound.</strong> Consider any optimization algorithm, with its first \(n\) point queries and its estimate \(\hat{x}\). By considering the functions which are zero in these \(n+1\) points, the algorithm outputs zero. We now simply need to construct a function \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) such that \(f\) is zero at these points, but maximally smaller than zero at a different point. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Consider a cover of \(\mathcal{X}\) with \(n+2\) balls of minimal radius  (equal to \(r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\)), there has to exist at least one of the \(n+2\) corresponding ball centers such that the corresponding ball contains no points from the algorithm (denote by \(y\) its center). We can then construct the function $$ f(x)  = \ – L \big( r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \ – d(x,y) \big)_+ = \ – L \max \big\{  r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \ – d(x,y) ,0 \big\}, $$ which is zero on all points of the algorithm and the output point \(\hat{x}\), and with minimum value \(– L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\) attained at \(y\). Thus, we must have \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \geqslant 0 \ – (\ – L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) ) = L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\). This difficult function is plotted below in one dimension.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5260" height="73" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/lowerbound-1-1024x178.png" width="423"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, the performance of any algorithm from \(n\) function values has to be larger than \(L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d)\).  Thus, so far, we have shown that $$L r_{n+2}(\mathcal{X},d) \leqslant \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant L r_{n}(\mathcal{X},d).$$  For \(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^d\), \(r_n(\mathcal{X},d)\) is typically of order \({\rm diam}(\mathcal{X}) n^{-1/d}\), and thus the difference between \(n\) and \(n+2\) above is negligible. Note that the rate in \(n^{-1/d}\) is <strong>very</strong> slow, and symptomatic of the classical curse of dimensionality. The appearance of a covering number is not totally random here, as we will see below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Random search.</strong> We can have a similar bound up to logarithmic terms for random search, that is, after selecting independently \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), uniformly at random in \(\mathcal{X}\), and selecting the points with smallest function value \(f(x_i)\). The performance can be shown to be proportional to \(L {\rm diam}(\mathcal{X}) ( \log n )^{1/d} n^{-1/d}\) in high probability, leading to an extra logarithmic term (the proof can be obtained with a simple covering argument, as shown at the end of the post). Therefore, random search is optimal up to logarithmic terms for this very large class of functions to optimize.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We would like to go beyond Lipschitz-continuous functions, and study if we can leverage smoothness, and hopefully avoid the dependence in \(n^{-1/d}\). This can be done by a somewhat surprising equivalence between worst case guarantees from optimization and worst case guarantees for uniform approximation.</p>



<h2>Optimization is as hard as uniform function approximation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now also consider the problem of outputting a whole function \(\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}\), such that \(\|f – \hat{f}\|_\infty = \max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} | \hat{f}(x)\ – f(x)|\) is as small as possible. For any approximation algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) that builds an estimate \(\hat{f} \in \mathcal{F}\) from \(n\) function values, we can define its convergence rate in the same way as for optimization algorithm \(\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{A})\), as a function of \(n\). The optimal approximation algorithm has a convergence rate denoted by \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From approximation to optimization. </strong>Clearly, an approximation algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) leads to an optimization algorithm \(\mathcal{O}\) with at most twice the same rate, that is, $$  \varepsilon_n(\mathcal{O}) \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n(\mathcal{A}),$$ by simply approximating \(f\) by \(\hat{f}\) and outputting any \(\hat{x} \in \arg \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \hat{f}(x)\), for which $$f(\hat{x})  \leqslant \hat{f}(\hat{x}) + \| \hat{f}\ – f\|_\infty =  \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \hat{f}(x) + \| \hat{f}\  – f\|_\infty \leqslant \min_{x \in \mathcal{X}} {f}(x) +2  \| \hat{f} \ – f\|_\infty. $$ See an illustration below (with a function estimated from the values at green points), with the candidate minimizer in orange.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5268" height="254" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/optim_approx-1024x553.png" width="470"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Thus in terms of worst-case performance, we get $$ \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}.$$ Intuitively, it seems that this upper-bound should be very loose, as approximating uniformly a function, in particular far from its minimum, seems useless for minimization. For worst-case performance, this intuition is incorrect… Indeed, the optimal rate for optimization with \(n\) function evaluations happens to be greater than the optimal rate for approximation with \(n+1\) function evaluations, which we will now show.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lower-bound on optimization performance. </strong>We will need an extra assumption, namely that the function space \(\mathcal{F}\) is convex and symmetric (and bounded in uniform norm).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider an optimization algorithm over the class of function \(\mathcal{F}\), that is considering \(n\) observation points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\), and an estimate \(\hat{x}\). The worst-case performance over all functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) is greater than over the (smaller) class of functions for which \(f(x_1) = \cdots = f(x_n) = f(\hat{x}) = 0\). Given that the performance measure is \(f(\hat{x})\  – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\), the performance is greater than the supremum of  \(– \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\) over functions in \(\mathcal{F}\) such that \(f(x_1) = \cdots = f(x_n) = f(\hat{x}) = 0\). For Lipschitz-continuous functions above, we built explicitly a hard function. In the general case, an explicit construction is not that easy, but we will relate the construction of such a function to the general approximation problem.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As we just saw, the optimal rate of the optimization algorithm is greater than $$\inf_{x_1,\dots,\, x_{n+1} \in \, \mathcal{X}} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}, \ f(x_1)\ =\ \cdots \ = \ f(x_{n+1}) \ =\ 0} – \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x) . $$ The quantity above characterizes how small a function can be when equal to zero on \(n+1\) points. When the set of function \(\mathcal{F}\) is centrally symmetric, that is \(f \in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow \ – f \in \mathcal{F}\), we can replace \(– \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\) in the expression above by \(\| f\|_\infty\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that for convex and centrally symmetric spaces \(\mathcal{F}\) of functions, this happens to be the optimal rate of approximation with \(n+1\) function evaluations. This is sometimes referred to as Smolyak’s lemma [3], which we state here (see a very nice and short proof in [4]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smolyak’s lemma. </strong>We consider a space of functions \(\mathcal{F}\) which is convex and centrally symmetric. Then:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>For any \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathcal{X}\), the optimal approximation method, that is the optimal map \(\mathcal{S}: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathcal{F}\), i.e., an algorithm that computes \(\hat{f} = \mathcal{S}(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) \in \mathcal{F}\), is <em>linear</em>, that is, there exist functions \(g_1,\dots,g_n: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that $$\mathcal{S}(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)) = \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) g_i.$$</li><li>The optimal rate of uniform approximation in \(\mathcal{F}\) is equal to $$ \displaystyle \varepsilon_n^{\rm app} = \inf_{x_1,\dots,\, x_{n} \in \, \mathcal{X}} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}, \ f(x_1)\ =\ \cdots \ = \ f(x_{n}) \ =\ 0} \| f \|_\infty.$$</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, we have “shown” that: $$ \varepsilon_{n+1}^{\rm app} \leqslant \varepsilon_n^{\rm opt} \leqslant 2\varepsilon_n^{\rm app}, $$ that is, optimization is at most twice as hard as uniform approximation (still in the worst-case sense). We can now consider examples of uniform approximation algorithms to get optimization algorithms.</p>



<h2>Examples and optimal algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As seen above, we simply need algorithms that approximate the function in uniform norm, and then we minimize the approximation. This is computationally optimal in terms of access to function evaluations (but clearly not in terms of computational complexity).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lipschitz-continuous functions.</strong> One can check that with \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) the centers of the cover above, and a piecewise constant function on each of the ball (with arbitrary values at intersections), then we have $$ \| \hat{f} \, – f \|_\infty \leqslant L   r_n(\mathcal{X},d),$$ which is a standard approximation result using covering numbers. We recover the result above directly from the cover argument (and here the sharper result that the rates of uniform approximation and optimization are asymptotically the same for this class of functions).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smooth functions in one dimension.</strong> For simplicity, I will focus on the one-dimensional problem, where all concepts are simpler, some of them directly extend to higher dimensions, some of them don’t.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(\mathcal{X} = [0,1]\). The simplest interpolation techniques are piecewise constant and piecewise affine interpolations. That is, if we observe \(0 = x_1 \leqslant \cdots \leqslant x_n = 1\), we consider \(\hat{f}\) defined on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\) as $$\hat{f}(x) = \frac{1}{2}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_{i+1}) $$ </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5286" height="152" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation_constant-2-1024x451.png" width="339"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">or $$ \hat{f}(x) = f(x_i) + \frac{ x\  – x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i}\big[ f(x_{i+1})\ – f(x_i) \big].$$</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5287" height="144" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation_affine-1024x449.png" width="324"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume that \(f\) is twice differentiable with second-derivative bounded by \(M_2\), then, we can show that on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\), we have for piecewise affine interpolation: $$ | f(x) \ – \hat{f}(x) | \leqslant \frac{M_2}{8} | x_{i+1} – x_i |^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume that \(f\) is differentiable with first-derivative bounded by \(M_1\), then, we can show that on \([x_i,x_{i+1}]\), we have for piecewise affine or constant interpolation: $$ | f(x) \ – \hat{f}(x) | \leqslant \frac{M_1}{2} | x_{i+1} – x_i |.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This leads to, when \(x_i = (i-1)/(n-1)\), to uniform error in \(O(1/n)\) for functions with a bound on a single derivative and or \(O(1/n^2)\) for two derivatives. Thus, we see two effects, that are common in approximations problems: (a) the more regular the function to approximate, the better the approximation rate, (b) If we consider a method tailored to smoother functions, it often works well for less smooth functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Explicit piecewise affine interpolation is harder to perform in higher dimensions, where other techniques can be used as presented below, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel methods</a> (again!).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Going high-dimensional with kernel methods.</strong> We assume that we have a positive definite kernel \(k: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), and, given the \(n\) elements \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) of \(\mathcal{X}\) and function values \(f(x_1),\dots,f(x_n)\), we look for the interpolating function \(f\) in the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space with minimum norm. By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representer_theorem">representer theorem</a>, it has to be of the form \(\sum_{i=1}^n  \alpha_i k(x,x_i)\). Since it has to interpolate, we must have \(K\alpha = y\) and thus \(\alpha = K^{-1} y\), where \(y_i = f(x_i)\) for \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\), and \(K\) the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix. Thus, interpolation can then be easily done in higher dimensions.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev spaces</a> are commonly used in the interpolation context, and for \(s\) square-integrable derivatives, for \(s &gt; d/2\), they are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. See below for examples of interpolations with various Sobolev spaces and increasing number of interpolating points, where the approximation errors (in uniform norm) are computed. With \(s=1\), we recover piecewise affine interpolation, but smoother functions are obtained for \(s=2\).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5238" height="250" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/interpolation-2.gif" width="468"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Optimal rates of approximation.</strong> With the method defined above, we can obtain the optimal rates of approximation (and hence of optimization) of \(\varepsilon_n^{\rm app} \approx \displaystyle \frac{1}{n^{m/d}}\), for the set of functions with \(m\) bounded derivatives. Thus, for very smooth functions, we can escape the curse of dimensionality (that is, obtain a power of \(n\) that does not decay too slowly). See [1] for more details.</p>



<h2>The powerlessness of adaptivity</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The critical reader may argue that the algorithm set-up described in this post is too simple: the points at which we take function values are decided once and for all, independently of the observed function values. Clearly, some form of adaptivity should beat random search. The sad truth is that the bound for worst-case performance is the same… up to a factor of 2 at most (still in the worst-case sense).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The argument is essentially the same as for non-adaptive algorithms: for the Lipschitz-continuous example, our hard function can also be built for adaptive algorithms, while for the general case, it simply turns out that the rate for adaptive approximation is exactly the same than for adaptive approximation [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, adaptive and non-adaptive approximations are just a factor of two of each other. Note that given the practical success of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization">Bayesian optimization</a> (which is one instance of adaptive optimization) on some problems, there could be at least two explanations (choose the one you prefer, or find a new one): (1) the worst-case analysis can be too pessimistic, or (2) what is crucial in Bayesian optimization is not the adaptive choice of points to evaluate the function, but the adaptivity to smoothness of the function to optimize (that is, if the function has \(m\) derivatives, then the rate is \(n^{-m/d}\), which can be much better than \(n^{-1/d}\)).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I highlighted the strong links between approximation problems and optimization problems. It turns out that the parallel between worst-case performances goes beyond: computing integrals from function evaluations, a problem typically referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration">quadrature</a>, is also as hard. More on this in a future post.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As warned early in the post, the algorithms presented here all have running time that are exponential in dimension, as they either perform random sampling or need to minimize a model of the function to optimize. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The only good news in this post: optimization is hard as approximation, but the scenario is more varied than expected. Indeed approximation can be fast and avoid the curse of dimensionality, at least in the exponent of the rate, when the function is very smooth (indeed, for \(m\)-times differentiable functions, the constant in front of \(n^{-m/d}\) still depends exponentially in \(d\)). It would be nice to catch this property also in an optimization algorithm, with a running time complexity depending polynomially on \(n\) only, and not exponentially in \(d\). Next month, I will present recent work with Alessandro Rudi and Ulysse Marteau-Ferey [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/gloptikernel.pdf">7</a>] that does exactly this, by combining the tasks of interpolation and optimization in a single convex optimization problem.</p>

<h2>Performance of random search</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider sampling independently and uniformly in \(\mathcal{X}\) \(n\) points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). For a given \(L\)-Lipschitz-continuous function \(f\), with global minimizer \(x\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), we have $$\min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} f(x_i)\  – f(x) \leqslant L \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i).$$ Thus, to obtain an upper-bound on performance over all functions \(f\) (and potentially all locations of the global minimizer \(x\)), we need to bound $$\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i).$$ If we have a cover with \(m\) points \(y_1,\dots,y_m\), and radius \(r = r_m(\mathcal{X},d)\), we have $$\max_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(x,x_i) \leqslant r + \max_{j  \in \{1,\dots,m\}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(y_j,x_i) .$$ We can then bound the probability that $$ \max_{j \in \{1,\dots,m\}} \min_{i \in \{1,\dots,n\}} d(y_j,x_i) \geqslant r$$ by the union bound (and using the independence of the \(x_i\)’s) as \(m\) times the \(n\)-th power of the probability that one of the \(x_i\) is not in a given ball of radius \(r\). By a simple volume argument (and assuming that all balls of a given radius have the same volume), this probability is less than \(( 1 – 1/m)\). Thus with probability greater than \(1 – m(1 – 1/m)^n \geqslant 1 – m e^{ – n /m}\) the worst-case performance is less than \(2Lr\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since for normed metrics in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), \(r  \sim m^{-1/d} {\rm diam}(\mathcal{X})\), by selecting \(m = 2n \log n\), we get an overall performance proportional to \( L \big( \frac{ \log n}{n} \big)^{1/d}\) with probability greater than \(1 – \frac{ \log n}{n}\) (which tends to one when \(n\) grows).</p></div>

    <title>Induced Disjoint Paths in AT-free Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Petr A. Golovach, Daniël Paulusma, Erik Jan van Leeuwen <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09814">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Paths $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ are mutually induced if any two
distinct $P_i$ and $P_j$ have neither common vertices nor adjacent vertices
(except perhaps their end-vertices). The Induced Disjoint Paths problem is to
decide if a graph $G$ with $k$ pairs of specified vertices $(s_i,t_i)$ contains
$k$ mutually induced paths $P_i$ such that each $P_i$ connects $s_i$ and $t_i$.
This is a classical graph problem that is NP-complete even for $k=2$. We study
it for AT-free graphs.
</p>
<p>Unlike its subclasses of permutation graphs and cocomparability graphs, the
class of AT-free graphs has no geometric intersection model. However, by a new,
structural analysis of the behaviour of Induced Disjoint Paths for AT-free
graphs, we prove that it can be solved in polynomial time for AT-free graphs
even when $k$ is part of the input. This is in contrast to the situation for
other well-known graph classes, such as planar graphs, claw-free graphs, or
more recently, (theta,wheel)-free graphs, for which such a result only holds if
$k$ is fixed.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of our main result, the problem of deciding if a given
AT-free graph contains a fixed graph $H$ as an induced topological minor admits
a polynomial-time algorithm. In addition, we show that such an algorithm is
essentially optimal by proving that the problem is W[1]-hard with parameter
$|V_H|$, even on a subclass of AT-free graph, namely cobipartite graphs. We
also show that the problems $k$-in-a-Path and $k$-in-a-Tree are polynomial-time
solvable on AT-free graphs even if $k$ is part of the input. These problems are
to test if a graph has an induced path or induced tree, respectively, spanning
$k$ given vertices.

    <title>Maximum cut on interval graphs of interval count five is NP-complete</title>

graphs has been open since the 80's, being one of the problems considered by
Johnson on his Ongoing Guide to NP-completeness, and has been settled as
NP-complete only recently by Adhikary, Bose, Mukherjee and Roy. On the other
hand, many flawed proofs of polynomiality for MaxCut on the more restrictive
class of proper/unit interval graphs (or graphs with interval count 1) have
been presented along the years, and the classification of the problem is still
not known. In this paper, we present the first NP-completeness proof for MaxCut
when restricted to interval graphs with bounded interval count, namely graphs

    <title>Hardness of Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09720">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the complexity of PAC learning halfspaces in the presence of Massart
(bounded) noise. Specifically, given labeled examples $(x, y)$ from a
distribution $D$ on $\mathbb{R}^{n} \times \{ \pm 1\}$ such that the marginal
distribution on $x$ is arbitrary and the labels are generated by an unknown
halfspace corrupted with Massart noise at rate $\eta&lt;1/2$, we want to compute a
hypothesis with small misclassification error. Characterizing the efficient
learnability of halfspaces in the Massart model has remained a longstanding
open problem in learning theory.
</p>
<p>Recent work gave a polynomial-time learning algorithm for this problem with
error $\eta+\epsilon$. This error upper bound can be far from the
information-theoretically optimal bound of $\mathrm{OPT}+\epsilon$. More recent
work showed that {\em exact learning}, i.e., achieving error
$\mathrm{OPT}+\epsilon$, is hard in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. In this
work, we show that there is an exponential gap between the
information-theoretically optimal error and the best error that can be achieved
by a polynomial-time SQ algorithm. In particular, our lower bound implies that
no efficient SQ algorithm can approximate the optimal error within any
polynomial factor.

    <title>Sampling Arborescences in Parallel</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Nima Anari, Nathan Hu, Amin Saberi, Aaron Schild <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09502">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the problem of sampling a uniformly random directed rooted spanning
tree, also known as an arborescence, from a possibly weighted directed graph.
Classically, this problem has long been known to be polynomial-time solvable;
the exact number of arborescences can be computed by a determinant [Tut48], and
sampling can be reduced to counting [JVV86, JS96]. However, the classic
reduction from sampling to counting seems to be inherently sequential. This
raises the question of designing efficient parallel algorithms for sampling. We
show that sampling arborescences can be done in RNC.
</p>
<p>For several well-studied combinatorial structures, counting can be reduced to
the computation of a determinant, which is known to be in NC [Csa75]. These
include arborescences, planar graph perfect matchings, Eulerian tours in
digraphs, and determinantal point processes. However, not much is known about
efficient parallel sampling of these structures. Our work is a step towards
resolving this mystery.

    <title>Query-Competitive Sorting with Uncertainty</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Magnús M. Halldórsson, Murilo S. de Lima ICE-TCS, Department of Computer Science, Reykjavik University, Iceland, School of Informatics, University of Leicester, United Kingdom) <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09475">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the problem of sorting under incomplete information, when queries
are used to resolve uncertainties. Each of $n$ data items has an unknown value,
which is known to lie in a given interval. We can pay a query cost to learn the
actual value, and we may allow an error threshold in the sorting. The goal is
to find a nearly-sorted permutation by performing a minimum-cost set of
queries.
</p>
<p>We show that an offline optimum query set can be found in poly time, and that
both oblivious and adaptive problems have simple competitive algorithms. The
competitive ratio for the oblivious problem is $n$ for uniform query costs, and
unbounded for arbitrary costs; for the adaptive problem, the ratio is 2.
</p>
<p>We present a unified adaptive strategy for uniform costs that yields the
following improved results: (1) a 3/2-competitive randomized algorithm; (2) a
5/3-competitive deterministic algorithm if the dependency graph has no
2-components after some preprocessing, which has competitive ratio
$3/2+\mathrm{O}(1/k)$ if the components obtained have size at least $k$; and
(3) an exact algorithm for laminar families of intervals. The first two results
have matching lower bounds, and we have a lower bound of 7/5 for large
components.
</p>
<p>We also give a randomized adaptive algorithm with competitive ratio
$1+\frac{4}{3\sqrt{3}}\approx 1.7698$ for arbitrary query costs, and we show
that the 2-competitive deterministic adaptive algorithm can be generalized for
queries returning intervals and for a more general vertex cover problem, by
using the local ratio technique. Moreover, we prove that the advice complexity
of the adaptive problem is $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ if no error threshold is
allowed, and $\lceil n/3\cdot\lg 3\rceil$ for the general case.
</p>
<p>Finally, we present some graph-theoretical results on co-threshold tolerance
graphs, and we discuss uncertainty variants of some classical interval
problems.

completion time in parallel graph processing systems. Among the various
partition strategies, edge partition has demonstrated more promising
performance in power-law graphs than vertex partition and thereby has been more
widely adopted as the default partition strategy by existing graph systems. The
graph edge partition problem, which is to split the edge set into multiple
balanced parts to minimize the total number of copied vertices, has been widely
studied from the view of optimization and algorithms. In this paper, we study
local search algorithms for this problem to further improve the partition
results from existing methods. More specifically, we propose two novel
concepts, namely adjustable edges and blocks. Based on these, we develop a
greedy heuristic as well as an improved search algorithm utilizing the property
of the max-flow model. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we first
provide adequate theoretical analysis in terms of the approximation quality. We
significantly improve the previously known approximation ratio for this
problem. Then we conduct extensive experiments on a large number of benchmark
datasets and state-of-the-art edge partition strategies. The results show that
our proposed local search framework can further improve the quality of graph
partition by a wide margin.

    <title>Metrical Task Systems with Online Machine Learned Advice</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kevin Rao <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09394">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Machine learning algorithms are designed to make accurate predictions of the
future based on existing data, while online algorithms seek to bound some
performance measure (typically the competitive ratio) without knowledge of the
future. Lykouris and Vassilvitskii demonstrated that augmenting online
algorithms with a machine learned predictor can provably decrease the
competitive ratio under as long as the predictor is suitably accurate.
</p>
<p>In this work we apply this idea to the Online Metrical Task System problem,
which was put forth by Borodin, Linial, and Saks as a general model for dynamic
systems processing tasks in an online fashion. We focus on the specific class
of uniform task systems on $n$ tasks, for which the best deterministic
algorithm is $O(n)$ competitive and the best randomized algorithm is $O(\log
n)$ competitive.
</p>
<p>By giving an online algorithms access to a machine learned oracle with
absolute predictive error bounded above by $\eta_0$, we construct a
$\Theta(\min(\sqrt{\eta_0}, \log n))$ competitive algorithm for the uniform
case of the metrical task systems problem. We also give a $\Theta(\log
\sqrt{\eta_0})$ lower bound on the competitive ratio of any randomized
algorithm.

    <title>Balancing Geometry and Density: Path Distances on High-Dimensional Data</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Anna Little, Daniel McKenzie, James Murphy <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09385">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>New geometric and computational analyses of power-weighted shortest-path
distances (PWSPDs) are presented. By illuminating the way these metrics balance
density and geometry in the underlying data, we clarify their key parameters
and discuss how they may be chosen in practice. Comparisons are made with
related data-driven metrics, which illustrate the broader role of density in
kernel-based unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning.
Computationally, we relate PWSPDs on complete weighted graphs to their
analogues on weighted nearest neighbor graphs, providing high probability
guarantees on their equivalence that are near-optimal. Connections with
percolation theory are developed to establish estimates on the bias and
variance of PWSPDs in the finite sample setting. The theoretical results are
bolstered by illustrative experiments, demonstrating the versatility of PWSPDs
for a wide range of data settings. Throughout the paper, our results require
only that the underlying data is sampled from a low-dimensional manifold, and
depend crucially on the intrinsic dimension of this manifold, rather than its
ambient dimension.

    <title>Quantum Algorithm for Lexicographically Minimal String Rotation</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Qisheng Wang, Mingsheng Ying <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09376">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Lexicographically minimal string rotation (LMSR) is a problem to find the
minimal one among all rotations of a string in the lexicographical order, which
is widely used in equality checking of graphs, polygons, automata and chemical
structures.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose an $O(n^{3/4})$ quantum query algorithm for LMSR.
In particular, the algorithm has average-case query complexity $O(\sqrt n \log
n)$, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal up to a polylogarithmic
factor, compared with its $\Omega\left(\sqrt{n/\log n}\right)$ lower bound.
Furthermore, we claim that our quantum algorithm outperforms any (classical)
randomized algorithms in both worst-case and average-case query complexities by
showing that every (classical) randomized algorithm for LMSR has worst-case
query complexity $\Omega(n)$ and average-case query complexity $\Omega(n/\log
n)$.
</p>
<p>Our quantum algorithm for LMSR is developed in a framework of nested quantum
algorithms, based on two new results: (i) an $O(\sqrt{n})$ (optimal) quantum
minimum finding on bounded-error quantum oracles; and (ii) its $O\left(\sqrt{n
\log(1/\varepsilon)}\right)$ (optimal) error reduction. As a byproduct, we
obtain some better upper bounds of independent interest: (i) $O(\sqrt{N})$
(optimal) for constant-depth MIN-MAX trees on $N$ variables; and (ii)
$O(\sqrt{n \log m})$ for pattern matching which removes
$\operatorname{polylog}(n)$ factors.

    <title>The Quad Layout Immersion: A Mathematically Equivalent Representation of a Surface Quadrilateral Layout</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kendrick M. Shepherd, René R. Hiemstra, Thomas J. R. Hughes <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09368">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Quadrilateral layouts on surfaces are valuable in texture mapping, and
essential in generation of quadrilateral meshes and in fitting splines.
Previous work has characterized such layouts as a special metric on a surface
or as a meromorphic quartic differential with finite trajectories. In this
work, a surface quadrilateral layout is alternatively characterized as a
special immersion of a cut representation of the surface into the Euclidean
plane. We call this a quad layout immersion. This characterization, while posed
in smooth topology, naturally generalizes to piecewise-linear representations.
As such, it mathematically describes and generalizes integer grid maps, which
are common in computer graphics settings. Finally, the utility of the
representation is demonstrated by computationally extracting quadrilateral
layouts on surfaces of interest.

Mahadevan <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09241">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Kirigami involves cutting a flat, thin sheet that allows it to morph from a
closed, compact configuration into an open deployed structure via coordinated
rotations of the internal tiles. By recognizing and generalizing the geometric
constraints that enable this art form, we propose a design framework for
compact reconfigurable kirigami patterns, which can morph from a closed and
compact configuration into a deployed state conforming to any prescribed target
shape, and subsequently be contracted into a different closed and compact
configuration. We further establish a condition for producing kirigami patterns
which are reconfigurable and rigid deployable allowing us to connect the
compact states via a zero-energy family of deployed states. All together, our
inverse design framework lays out a new path for the creation of shape-morphing
material structures.

    <title>Clustering with Iterated Linear Optimization</title>

(SDP) relaxation of the Max k-Cut problem. The approach is based on a new
methodology for rounding the solution of an SDP using iterated linear
optimization. We show the vertices of the Max k-Cut SDP relaxation correspond
to partitions of the data into at most k sets. We also show the vertices are
attractive fixed points of iterated linear optimization. We interpret the
process of fixed point iteration with linear optimization as repeated
relaxations of the closest vertex problem. Our experiments show that using
fixed point iteration for rounding the Max k-Cut SDP relaxation leads to
significantly better results when compared to randomized rounding.

    <title>Nearly tight Trotterization of interacting electrons</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1608249600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Yuan Su, Hsin-Yuan Huang, Earl T. Campbell <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09194">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider simulating quantum systems on digital quantum computers. We show
that the performance of quantum simulation can be improved by simultaneously
exploiting the commutativity of Hamiltonian, the sparsity of interactions, and
the prior knowledge of initial state. We achieve this using Trotterization for
a class of interacting electrons that encompasses various physical systems,
including the plane-wave-basis electronic structure and the Fermi-Hubbard
model. We estimate the simulation error by taking the transition amplitude of
nested commutators of Hamiltonian terms within the $\eta$-electron manifold. We
develop multiple techniques for bounding the transition amplitude and
expectation of general fermionic operators, which may be of independent
interest. We show that it suffices to use
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{n^{5/3}}{\eta^{2/3}}+n^{4/3}\eta^{2/3}\right)$ gates to
simulate electronic structure in the plane-wave basis with $n$ spin orbitals
and $\eta$ electrons up to a negligible factor, improving the best previous
result in second quantization while outperforming the first-quantized
simulation when $n=\mathcal{O}\left(\eta^2\right)$. We also obtain an
improvement for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We construct concrete
examples for which our bounds are almost saturated, giving a nearly tight
Trotterization of interacting electrons.

<em>A dean of engineering</em><br/>
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/17/database-and-theory/dean-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17922"><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-17922" height="173" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/dean-1.jpg?w=180&amp;h=173" width="180"/></a></p>
<p>Jennifer Widom was appointed as the <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2017/02/27/computer-scientist-jennifer-widom-named-dean-stanford-school-engineering/">Dean</a> of Engineering at Stanford not long ago. No doubt her research in databases and her teaching played a major role in her selection. For example, she is known for her contributions to online education including teaching one of the first massive open courses—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCS</a>—which had over 100,000 students.</p>
<p>Today I thought we might highlight her area, databases, and one of its connections to theory.</p>
<p>But first, I was impressed to hear her say in an ACM <a href="https://learning.acm.org/bytecast">podcast</a> that she used punch cards during the start of her career:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> So my passion in high school actually became music, and when it came time to select a college, I chose to go to music school. I’m pretty sure at this point, I’m the only dean of engineering anywhere who has a bachelor’s degree in trumpet performance, but that’s actually what my undergraduate degree is in. Late in my music education, I just sort of randomly took a class called computer applications and music research. And it was a class in the music school about using programming to analyze music, and it was my first exposure to computer programming. I have to say, it’ll reveal my age, but I used punch cards in that class. It was sort of the end of the punch card era. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>I admit to having used these too at the start of my days as an undergrad at <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/univac/cards.html">Case</a> Institute. Do you know what a punch card is?</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/17/database-and-theory/case/" rel="attachment wp-att-17901"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17901" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/case.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>Ken once had his own experience with punch cards and music. While taking an intro programming course during his sophomore year—taught then by Jeffrey Ullman—Ken and his roommate joined an excursion to NYC for dinner and the New York Philharmonic. Still dressed in suits, on return to Princeton, they descended into the computer center to do their assignment—via punch cards on a batch server. Ken’s roommate got out before 2am, but Ken says he was still fixing punch card typos that ruined runs as late as 4am.</p>
<h2>Data Management</h2>
<p>Widom’s <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/widom/">research</a> has always been in the area of non-traditional databases: semi-structured data, data streams, uncertain data and data provenance.</p>
<p>We theorists view the world as made of questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper Bounds Can we find a faster algorithm for problem X?</li>
<li>Lower Bounds Can we prove there are no faster algorithms for X? Sometimes we replace “faster” by other complexity measures, but these are the dominant questions we ask.
<p>Widom proposed a notion that is called <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/data-provenance">lineage</a>. Theorists worry about the performance of searching, but this issue is about where did the data come from? See also <a href="http://db.cis.upenn.edu/DL/fsttcs.pdf">provenance</a>.</p>
<p>The insight boils down to garbage in and garbage out, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_in,_garbage_out">GIGO</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> On two occasions I have been asked, “Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?”</em></p>
<p><em> Charles Babbage (1864). </em></p></blockquote>
<p>The issue of lineage and provenance is exactly this made modern. How can one track where the data comes from? Of course, finding fast algorithms to do the tracking is still an important question. Oh well.</p>
<h2>Databases Meet Theory</h2>
<p>Of course databases store and allow us to retrieve information—they are everywhere these days. One reason for their dominance is they support complex queries. For example, we can use databases to obtain all <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> so that <img alt="{R(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R(x,y)}"/> is true for some <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/>:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \{ x \mid \exists y R(x,y) \}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5C%7B+x+%5Cmid+%5Cexists+y+R%28x%2Cy%29+%5C%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle \{ x \mid \exists y R(x,y) \}. "/></p>
<p>From a theory point of view any first-order question is allowed.</p>
<p>But searches often use approximate matches. Thus one might wish all <img alt="{R(x',y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28x%27%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R(x',y)}"/> so that <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x'}"/> is near <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/>. We might want all <img alt="{R(x',y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28x%27%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{R(x',y)}"/> so that <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x'}"/> is not “Michael” but also includes “Micheal”. This type of error is not too hard to handle, but a worse type of error is</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle Michael \iff Michal " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+Michael+%5Ciff+Michal+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle Michael \iff Michal "/></p>

Widom co-leads the <em>Stanford Entity Resolution Framework</em> (<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/serf/">SERF</a>) with Hector Garcia-Molina; they were two of the authors on its earliest <a href="http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/779/">paper</a> in 2006. The page highlights the lexical nature of ER:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For instance, two records on the same person may provide different name spellings, and addresses may differ. The goal of ER is to “resolve” entities, by identifying the records that represent the same entity and reconciling them to obtain one record per entity. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Their approach “involves functions that `match’ records (i.e., decide whether they represent the same entity) and `merge’ them.” Their framework has an outer layer that treats the functions as generic. Widom’s emphasis has been on axiomatizing properties of the functions to enable efficient and extensible manipulation by the outer layer.</p>
<p>Necessarily under the hood is a measure of edit distance. Ken recently monitored a large tournament where two players had the same surname and first three prenames, differing only in the last four letters of their last prename. The widget used to download the game file originally given to Ken truncated the names so that there seemed to be one person playing twice as many games. They could also have been distinguished by other database information. More common is when the same player is referenced with different spellings, such as (grandmaster Artur) Jussupow or Yusupov. The similarity metric needs to be extended beyond the name. This is when computation time becomes more a factor and theory enters in.</p>
<h2>Edit Distance</h2>
<p>Computing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">edit distance</a> between two strings is a long-studied problem. The best algorithm known is order quadratic time, as we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/22/bellman-dynamic-programming-and-edit-distance/">here</a>. There are better running times if we allow approximate algorithms or quantum algorithms. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04178.pdf">this</a> for the latter and this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/alberto-apostolico-1948-2015/">post</a> for work related to the former.</p>
<p>Theorists have tried to improve the time needed for classical exact edit distance. It remains at quadratic time, however, and there is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/edit-distance-reveals-hard-computational-problems-20150929/">evidence</a> of inability to do better that we have remarked as <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">puzzling</a>. One of the strange traits of theorists is that when something is hard we try to <a href="https://www.theidioms.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons/">exploit</a> the hardness.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>For instance, factoring integers is hard—so let us make crypto systems. The lemonade in the case of edit distance is a connection to the hardness of really-hard problems. To quote the seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0348.pdf">paper</a> by Arturs Backurs and Piotr Indyk:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In this paper we provide evidence that the near-quadratic running time bounds known for the problem of computing edit distance might be tight. Specifically, we show that, if the edit distance can be computed in time <img alt="{O(n^{2-\epsilon})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B2-%5Cepsilon%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{O(n^{2-\epsilon})}"/> for some constant <img alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}"/>, then the satisfiability of conjunctive normal form formulas with <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{N}"/> variables and <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{M}"/> clauses can be solved in time subexp. The latter result would violate the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, which postulates that such algorithms do not exist. </em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Edit Distance—Searching</h2>
<p>An open problem that is closer to databases is not computing edit distance. Instead, the problem how to search for strings that are <em>near</em> a given string. This can be a generic use of an edit-distance function. A larger question is whether this can be approached more directly.</p>
<p>I believe that while edit distance may indeed be quadratic time, it still is open how fast searches can be done for approximate matches. The problem is given a large collection of strings <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{S}"/> how fast can we find the closest string in the collection to some word <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{w}"/>? That the best algorithms for edit distance are probably quadratic does not—I believe—entail that this search question is difficult.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Two weeks ago, I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5122">blogged about</a> the striking claim, by the group headed by Chaoyang Lu and Jianwei Pan at USTC in China, to have achieved quantum supremacy via BosonSampling with 50-70 detected photons.  I also did a <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/12/chinas-quantum-computer-a-step-not-a-leap/">four-part interview</a> on the subject with Jonathan Tennenbaum at Asia Times, and other interviews elsewhere.  None of that stopped some people, who I guess didn’t google, from writing to tell me how disappointed they were by my silence!</p>



<p>The reality, though, is that a lot has happened since the original announcement, so it’s way past time for an update.</p>



<p><strong>I. The Quest to Spoof</strong></p>



<p>Most importantly, other groups almost immediately went to work trying to refute the quantum supremacy claim, by finding some efficient classical algorithm to spoof the reported results.  It’s important to understand that this is exactly how the process is <em>supposed</em> to work: as I’ve often stressed, a quantum supremacy claim is credible only if it’s open to the community to refute and if no one can.  It’s also important to understand that, for reasons we’ll go into, there’s a decent chance that people <em>will</em> succeed in simulating the new experiment classically, although they haven’t yet.  All parties to the discussion agree that the new experiment is, far and away, the closest any BosonSampling experiment has ever gotten to the quantum supremacy regime; the hard part is to figure out if it’s already there.</p>



<p>Part of me feels guilty that, as one of reviewers on the <em>Science</em> paper—albeit, one stressed and harried by kids and covid—it’s now clear that I didn’t exercise the amount of diligence that I could have, in searching for ways to kill the new supremacy claim.  But another part of me feels that, with quantum supremacy claims, much like with proposals for new cryptographic codes, vetting <em>can’t be the responsibility of one or two reviewers</em>.  Instead, provided the claim is serious—as this one obviously is—the only thing to do is to get the paper out, so that the <em>entire community</em> can then work to knock it down.  Communication between authors and skeptics is also a hell of a lot faster when it doesn’t need to go through a journal’s editorial system.</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, one skeptic of the new quantum supremacy claim is Gil Kalai, who (despite Google’s result last year, which Gil still believes must be in error) rejects the entire possibility of quantum supremacy on quasi-metaphysical grounds.  But other skeptics are current and former members of the Google team, including Sergio Boixo and John Martinis!  And—pause to enjoy the irony—<em>Gil has effectively teamed up with the Google folks</em> on questioning the new claim.  Another central figure in the vetting effort—one from whom I’ve learned much of what I know about the relevant issues over the last week—is Dutch quantum optics professor and frequent <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> commenter <a href="https://people.utwente.nl/j.j.renema">Jelmer Renema</a>.</p>



<p>Without further ado, why might the new experiment, impressive though it was, be efficiently simulable classically?  A central reason for concern is photon loss: as Chaoyang Lu has now explicitly confirmed (it was implicit in the paper), up to ~70% of the photons get lost on their way through the beamsplitter network, leaving only ~30% to be detected.  At least with “Fock state” BosonSampling—i.e., the original kind, the kind with single-photon inputs that Alex Arkhipov and I proposed in 2011—it seems likely to me that such a loss rate would be fatal for quantum supremacy; see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01953">this 2019 paper</a> by Renema, Shchesnovich, and Garcia-Patron.</p>



<p>Incidentally, if anything’s become clear over the last two weeks, it’s that I, the co-inventor of BosonSampling, am no longer any sort of expert on the subject’s literature!</p>



<p>Anyway, one source of uncertainty regarding the photon loss issue is that, as I said in my last post, the USTC experiment implemented a 2016 variant of BosonSampling called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199">Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS)</a>—and Jelmer tells me that the computational complexity of GBS in the presence of losses hasn’t yet been analyzed in the relevant regime, though there’s been <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12075">work aiming in that direction</a>.  A second source of uncertainty is simply that the classical simulations work in a certain limit—namely, fixing the rate of noise and then letting the numbers of photons and modes go to infinity—but any real experiment has a fixed number of photons and modes (in USTC’s case, they’re ~50 and ~100 respectively).  It wouldn’t do to reject USTC’s claim via a theoretical asymptotic argument that would equally well apply to <em>any</em> non-error-corrected quantum supremacy demonstration!</p>



<p>OK, but if an efficient classical simulation of lossy GBS experiments exists, then <em>what is it?</em>  How does it work?  It turns out that we have a plausible candidate for the answer to that, originating with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093">2014 paper</a> by Gil Kalai and Guy Kindler.  Given a beamsplitter network, Kalai and Kindler considered an infinite hierarchy of better and better approximations to the BosonSampling distribution for that network.  Roughly speaking, at the first level (k=1), one pretends that the photons are just classical distinguishable particles.  At the second level (k=2), one correctly models quantum interference involving <em>pairs</em> of photons, but none of the higher-order interference.  At the third level (k=3), one correctly models three-photon interference, and so on until k=n (where n is the total number of photons), when one has reproduced the original BosonSampling distribution.  At least when k is small, the time needed to spoof outputs at the k<sup>th</sup> level of the hierarchy should grow like n<sup>k</sup>.  As theoretical computer scientists, Kalai and Kindler didn’t care whether their hierarchy produced any physically realistic kind of noise, but later work, by Shchesnovich, Renema, and others, showed that (as it happens) it does.</p>



<p>In its original paper, the USTC team ruled out the possibility that the first, k=1 level of this hierarchy could explain its experimental results.  More recently, in response to inquiries by Sergio, Gil, Jelmer, and others, Chaoyang tells me they’ve ruled out the possibility that the k=2 level can explain their results either.  We’re now eagerly awaiting the answer for larger values of k.</p>



<p>Let me add that I owe Gil Kalai the following public <em>mea culpa</em>.  While his objections to QC have often struck me as unmotivated and weird, in the case at hand, Gil’s 2014 work with Kindler is clearly helping drive the scientific discussion forward.  In other words, at least with BosonSampling, it turns out that Gil put his finger precisely on a key issue.  He did exactly what every QC skeptic should do, and what I’ve always implored the skeptics to do.</p>



<p><strong>II. BosonSampling vs. Random Circuit Sampling: A Tale of HOG and CHOG and LXEB</strong></p>



<p>There’s a broader question: why should skeptics of a BosonSampling experiment even have to <em>think</em> about messy details like the rate of photon losses?  Why shouldn’t that be solely the <em>experimenters’</em> job?</p>



<p>To understand what I mean, consider the situation with Random Circuit Sampling, the task Google demonstrated last year with 53 qubits.  There, the Google team simply collected the output samples and fed them into a benchmark that they called “Linear Cross-Entropy” (LXEB), closely related to what Lijie Chen and I called “Heavy Output Generation” (HOG) in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">2017 paper</a>.  With suitable normalization, an ideal quantum computer would achieve an LXEB score of 2, while classical random guessing would achieve an LXEB score of 1.  Crucially, according to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12085">2019 result</a> by me and Sam Gunn, under a plausible (albeit strong) complexity assumption, <em>no</em> subexponential-time classical spoofing algorithm should be able to achieve an LXEB score that’s even slightly higher than 1.  In its experiment, Google reported an LXEB score of about 1.002, with a confidence interval <em>much</em> smaller than 0.002.  Hence: quantum supremacy (subject to our computational assumption), with no further need to know anything about the sources of noise in Google’s chip!  (More explicitly, Boixo, Smelyansky, and Neven <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01875">did a calculation</a> in 2017 to show that the Kalai-Kindler type of spoofing strategy <em>definitely</em> isn’t going to work against RCS and Linear XEB, with no computational assumption needed.)</p>



<p>So then why couldn’t the USTC team do something analogous with BosonSampling?  Well, they tried to.   They defined a measure that they called “HOG,” although it’s different from my and Lijie Chen’s HOG, more similar to a cross-entropy.  Following Jelmer, let me call their measure CHOG, where the C could stand for Chinese, Chaoyang’s, or Changed.  They calculated the CHOG for their experimental samples, and showed that it exceeds the CHOG that you’d get from the k=1 and k=2 levels of the Kalai-Kindler hierarchy, as well as from various other spoofing strategies, thereby ruling those out as classical explanations for their results.</p>



<p>The trouble is this: <em>unlike </em>with Random Circuit Sampling and LXEB, with BosonSampling and CHOG, we <em>know</em> that there are fast classical algorithms that achieve better scores than the trivial algorithm, the algorithm that just picks samples at random.  That follows from Kalai and Kindler’s work, and it even more simply follows from a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7460">2013 paper</a> by me and Arkhipov, entitled “BosonSampling Is Far From Uniform.”  Worse yet, with BosonSampling, we currently have no analogue of my 2019 result with Sam Gunn: that is, a result that would tell us (under suitable complexity assumptions) the highest possible CHOG score that we expect any efficient classical algorithm to be able to get.  And since we don’t know exactly where that ceiling is, we can’t tell the experimentalists exactly what target they need to surpass in order to claim quantum supremacy.  Absent such definitive guidance from us, the experimentalists are left playing whac-a-mole against <em>this</em> possible classical spoofing strategy, and <em>that</em> one, and <em>that</em> one.</p>



<p>This is an issue that I and others were aware of for years, although the new experiment has certainly underscored it.  Had I understood <em>just how serious</em> the USTC group was about scaling up BosonSampling, and fast, I might’ve given the issue some more attention!</p>



<p><strong>III. Fock vs. Gaussian BosonSampling</strong></p>



<p>Above, I mentioned another complication in understanding the USTC experiment: namely, their reliance on Gaussian BosonSampling (GBS) rather than Fock BosonSampling (FBS), sometimes also called Aaronson-Arkhipov BosonSampling (AABS).  Since I gave this issue short shrift in my previous post, let me make up for it now.</p>



<p>In FBS, the initial state consists of either 0 or 1 photons in each input mode, like so: |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩.  We then pass the photons through our beamsplitter network, and measure the number of photons in each output mode.  The result is that the amplitude of each possible output configuration can be expressed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)">permanent</a> of some n×n matrix, where n is the total number of photons.  It was interest in the permanent, which plays a central role in classical computational complexity, that led me and Arkhipov to study BosonSampling in the first place.</p>



<p>The trouble is, preparing initial states like |1,…,1,0,…,0⟩ turns out to be really hard.  No one has yet build a source that reliably outputs <em>one and only one photon</em> at exactly a specified time.  This led two experimental groups to propose an idea that, in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1579">2013 post on this blog</a>, I named Scattershot BosonSampling (SBS).  In SBS, you get to use the more readily available “Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion” (SPDC) photon sources, which output superpositions over different numbers of photons, of the form $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \alpha_n |n \rangle |n \rangle, $$ where α<sub>n</sub> decreases exponentially with n.  You then measure the left half of each entangled pair, <em>hope</em> to see exactly one photon, and are guaranteed that if you do, then there’s also exactly one photon in the right half.  Crucially, one can show that, if Fock BosonSampling is hard to simulate approximately using a classical computer, then the Scattershot kind must be as well.</p>



<p>OK, so what’s <em>Gaussian</em> BosonSampling?  It’s simply the generalization of SBS where, instead of SPDC states, our input can be an arbitrary “Gaussian state”: for those in the know, a state that’s exponential in some quadratic polynomial in the creation operators.  If there are m modes, then such a state requires ~m<sup>2</sup> independent parameters to specify.  The quantum optics people have a much easier time creating these Gaussian states than they do creating single-photon Fock states.</p>



<p>While the amplitudes in FBS are given by permanents of matrices (and thus, the probabilities by the absolute squares of permanents), the probabilities in GBS are given by a more complicated matrix function called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnian">Hafnian</a>.  Roughly speaking, while the permanent counts the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite graph, the Hafnian counts the number of perfect matchings in an <em>arbitrary</em> graph.  The permanent and the Hafnian are both #P-complete.  In the USTC paper, they talk about yet another matrix function called the “Torontonian,” which was <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01639.pdf">invented two years ago</a>.  I gather that the Torontonian is just the modification of the Hafnian for the situation where you only have “threshold detectors” (which decide whether one or more photons are present in a given mode), rather than “number-resolving detectors” (which <em>count</em> how many photons are present).</p>



<p>If Gaussian BosonSampling includes Scattershot BosonSampling as a special case, and if Scattershot BosonSampling is at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling, then you might hope that GBS would <em>also</em> be at least as hard to simulate classically as the original BosonSampling.  Alas, this doesn’t follow.  Why not?  Because for all we know, a <em>random</em> GBS instance might be a lot easier than a <em>random</em> SBS instance.  Just because permanents can be expressed using Hafnians, doesn’t mean that a random Hafnian is as hard as a random permanent.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I think it’s very likely that the sort of analysis Arkhipov and I did back in 2011 could be mirrored in the Gaussian case.  I.e., instead of starting with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random permanents, and then concluding the classical hardness of approximate BosonSampling, one would start with reasonable assumptions about the distribution and hardness of random Hafnians (or “Torontonians”), and conclude the classical hardness of approximate GBS.  But this is theoretical work that remains to be done!</p>



<p><strong>IV. Application to Molecular Vibronic Spectra?</strong></p>



<p>In 2014, Alan Aspuru-Guzik and collaborators put out a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8427">paper</a> that made an amazing claim: namely that, contrary to what I and others had said, BosonSampling was <em>not</em> an intrinsically useless model of computation, good only for refuting QC skeptics like Gil Kalai!  Instead, they said, a BosonSampling device (specifically, what would later be called a GBS device) could be directly applied to solve a practical problem in quantum chemistry.  This is the computation of “molecular vibronic spectra,” also known as “Franck-Condon profiles,” whatever those are.</p>



<p>I never understood nearly enough about chemistry to evaluate this striking proposal, but I was always a bit skeptical of it, for the following reason.  Nothing in the proposal seemed to take seriously that BosonSampling is a <em>sampling</em> task!  A chemist would typically have some <em>specific numbers</em> that she wants to estimate, of which these “vibronic spectra” seemed to be an example.  But while it’s often convenient to estimate physical quantities via Monte Carlo sampling over simulated observations of the physical system you care about, that’s not the <em>only</em> way to estimate physical quantities!  And worryingly, in all the other examples we’d seen where BosonSampling could be used to estimate a number, the same number could <em>also</em> be estimated using one of several polynomial-time classical algorithms invented by Leonid Gurvits.  So why should vibronic spectra be an exception?</p>



<p>After an email exchange with Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Leonardo Novo, and Raul Garcia-Patron, I believe we finally got to the bottom of it, and the answer is: vibronic spectra are <em>not</em> an exception.</p>



<p>In terms of BosonSampling, the vibronic spectra task is simply to estimate the probability histogram of some weighted sum like $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ where w<sub>1</sub>,…,w<sub>m</sub> are fixed real numbers, and (s<sub>1</sub>,…,s<sub>m</sub>) is a possible outcome of the BosonSampling experiment, s<sub>i</sub> representing the number of photons observed in mode i.  Alas, while it takes some work, it turns out that Gurvits’s classical algorithms can be adapted to estimate these histograms.  Granted, running the actual BosonSampling experiment would provide <em>slightly</em> more detailed information—namely, some exact sampled values of $$ w_1 s_1 + \cdots + w_ m s_m, $$ rather than merely additive approximations to the values—but since we’d still need to sort those sampled values into coarse “bins” in order to compute a histogram, it’s not clear why that additional precision would ever be of chemical interest.</p>



<p>This is a pity, since if the vibronic spectra application <em>had</em> beaten what was doable classically, then it would’ve provided not merely a first practical use for BosonSampling, but also a lovely way to <em>verify</em> that a BosonSampling device was working as intended.</p>



<p><strong>V. Application to Finding Dense Subgraphs?</strong></p>



<p>A different potential application of Gaussian BosonSampling, first suggested by the Toronto-based startup <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10730">finding dense subgraphs in a graph</a>.  (Or at least, providing an initial seed to classical optimization methods that search for dense subgraphs.)</p>



<p>This is an NP-hard problem, so to say that I was skeptical of the proposal would be a gross understatement.  Nevertheless, it turns out that there <em>is</em> a striking observation by the Xanadu team at the core of their proposal: namely that, given a graph G and a positive even integer k, a GBS device can be used to sample a random subgraph of G of size k, with probability <em>proportional to the square of the number of perfect matchings in that subgraph</em>.  Cool, right?  And potentially even useful, especially if the number of perfect matchings could serve as a rough indicator of the subgraph’s density!  Alas, Xanadu’s Juan Miguel Arrazola himself recently told me that there’s a cubic-time classical algorithm for the same sampling task, so that the possible quantum speedup that one could get from GBS in this way is at most polynomial.  The search for a useful application of BosonSampling continues!</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>And that’s all for now!  I’m grateful to all the colleagues I talked to over the last couple weeks, including Alex Arkhipov, Juan Miguel Arrazola, Sergio Boixo, Raul Garcia-Patron, Leonid Gurvits, Gil Kalai, Chaoyang Lu, John Martinis, and Jelmer Renema, while obviously taking sole responsibility for any errors in the above.  I look forward to a spirited discussion in the comments, and of course I’ll post updates as I learn more!</p></div>

Kim was in Latvia, preparing to shoot a movie there. He disappeared about a week ago, and it then transpired that he had been hospitalized with Covid symptoms, and died last Friday from Covid complications.</p>



<p>In the early 2000s, living in the San Francisco Bay Area offered me several opportunities to discover cinema that was new to me. There were the several film festivals held each year in San Francisco, the wonderful retrospectives at the Castro Theater. There was also Netflix, that at the time operated by renting DVDs by mail (I am feeling like grandpa Simpson telling stories here) and whose catalog was basically every movie ever released in the US. I discovered the work of Hirokazu Kore-eda and Wong Kar-Wai, whose movies are now among my favorites, and I watched some challenging but rewarding movies by the likes of Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao-Hsien. So, when it came out, I watched “3-iron” by Kim Ki-duk, an amazing movie on the theme of the poor being invisible to the rich, but taken to extreme and fantastical places.</p>



<p>I was reminded of that time during our first lockdown last Spring. After having watched a lot of TV series, I felt like I had to do something a bit more soul-nourishing before the lockdown ended. So I resolved to watch Tarkovsky’s “Solaris” and “Stalker”, which I had never seen. Compared with movies I had watched 15+ years ago like those of Tsai Ming-Lian and Hou Hsiao-Hsien, or like “3-iron”, “Solaris” was like a Michael Bay movie full of explosions and car chases, but I still had a really hard time getting into it. I ended up watching it over five or six sittings, across a couple of weeks (the lockdown actually ended before I was done watching it). I still haven’t seen “Stalker”. I suppose that twelve years of smartphone usage accounts for the difference in attention span.</p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">The other day Dana and I finished watching The Queen’s Gambit, Netflix’s fictional saga of an orphaned girl in the 1960’s, Beth Harmon, who breaks into competitive chess and destroys one opponent after the next in her quest to become the world champion, while confronting her inner demons and addictions.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The other day Dana and I finished watching <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em>, Netflix’s fictional saga of an orphaned girl in the 1960’s, Beth Harmon, who breaks into competitive chess and destroys one opponent after the next in her quest to become the world champion, while confronting her inner demons and addictions.</p>



<p>The show is every bit as astoundingly good as everyone says it is, and I might be able to articulate why.  It’s because, perhaps surprisingly given the description, this is a story where <em>chess actually matters</em>—and indeed, the fact that chess matters so deeply to Beth and most of the other characters is central to the narrative.  (As in two pivotal scenes where Beth has sex with a male player, and then either she or he goes right back to working on chess.)</p>



<p>I’ve watched a lot of TV shows and movies, supposedly about scientists, where the science was just an interchangeable backdrop to what the writers clearly regarded as a more important story.  (As one random example, the drama <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_(TV_series)">NUMB3RS</a>, supposedly about an FBI mathematician, where “math” could’ve been swapped out for “mystical crime-fighting intuition” with barely any change.)</p>



<p>It’s true that a fictional work about scientists shouldn’t try to be a science documentary, just like <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> doesn’t try to be a chess documentary.  But if you’re telling a story about characters who are obsessed with topic X, then you need to <em>make their obsession plausible</em>, make the entire story hinge on it, and even make the audience vicariously feel the same obsession.</p>



<p>This is precisely what <em>Queen’s Gambit</em> does for chess.  It’s a chess drama where the characters are <em>constantly</em> talking about chess, thinking about chess, and playing chess—and that actually succeeds in making that riveting.  (Even if most of the audience can’t follow what’s happening on the board, it turns out that it doesn’t matter, since you can simply convey the drama through the characters’ faces and the reactions of those around them.)</p>



<p>Granted, a few aspects of competitive chess in the series stood out as jarringly unrealistic even to a novice like me: for example, the almost complete lack of draws.  But as for the board positions—well, apparently Kasparov was a consultant, and he helped meticulously design each one to reflect the characters’ skill levels and what was happening in the plot.</p>



<p>While the premise sounds like a feminist wish-fulfillment fantasy—orphan girl faces hundreds of intimidating white men in the sexist 1960s, orphan girl beats them all at their own game with style and aplomb—this is not at all a MeToo story, or a story about male crudity or predation.  It’s after bigger fish than that.  The series, you might say, conforms to all the external requirements of modern woke ideology, yet the actual plot subverts the tenets of that ideology, or maybe just ignores them, in its pursuit of more timeless themes.</p>



<p>At least once Beth Harmon enters the professional chess world, the central challenges she needs to overcome are internal and mental—just like they’re supposed to be in chess.  It’s not the Man or the Patriarchy or any other external power (besides, of course, skilled opponents) holding her down.  Again and again, the top male players are portrayed not as sexist brutes but as gracious, deferential, and even awestruck by Beth’s genius after she’s humiliated them on the chessboard.  And much of the story is about how those vanquished opponents then turn around and try to help Beth, and about how she needs to learn to accept their help in order to evolve as a player and a human being.</p>



<p>There’s also that, after defeating male player after male player, Beth sleeps with them, or at least wants to.  I confess that, as a teenager, I would’ve found that unlikely and astonishing.  I would’ve said: obviously, the only guys who’d even have a <em>chance</em> to prove themselves worthy of the affection of such a brilliant and unique woman would be those who could beat her at chess.  Anyone else would just be dirt between her toes.  In the series, though, each male player propositions Beth only <em>after</em> she’s soundly annihilated him.  And she’s never once shown refusing.</p>



<p>Obviously, I’m no Beth Harmon; I’ll never be close in my field to what she is in hers.  Equally obviously, I grew up in a loving family, not an orphanage.  Still, I was what some people would call a “child prodigy,” what with the finishing my PhD at 22 and whatnot, so naturally that colored my reaction to the show.</p>



<p>There’s a pattern that goes like this: you’re obsessively interested, from your first childhood exposure, in something that most people aren’t.  Once you learn what the something is, it’s evident to you that your life’s vocation couldn’t possibly be anything else, unless some external force prevents you.  Alas, in order to pursue the something, you first need to get past bullies and bureaucrats, who dismiss you as a nobody, put barriers in your way, despise whatever you represent to them.  After a few years, though, the bullies can no longer stop you: you’re finally among peers or superiors in your chosen field, regularly chatting with them on college campuses or at conferences in swanky hotels, and the main limiting factor is just the one between your ears. </p>



<p>You feel intense rivalries with your new colleagues, of course, you desperately want to excel them, but the fact that they’re all on the same obsessive quest as you means you can never actually hate them, as you did the bureaucrats or the bullies.  There’s too much of you in your competitors, and of them in you.</p>



<p>As you pursue your calling, you feel yourself torn in the following way.  On the one hand, you feel close to a moral obligation to humanity not to throw away whatever “gift” you were “given” (what loaded terms), to take the calling as far as it will go.  On the other hand, you also want the same things other people want, like friendship, validation, and of course sex.</p>



<p>In such a case, two paths naturally beckon.  The first is that of asceticism: making a virtue of eschewing all temporal attachments, romance or even friendship, in order to devote yourself entirely to the calling.  The second is that of renouncing the calling, pretending it never existed, in order to fit in and have a normal life.  Your fundamental challenge is to figure out a third path, to plug yourself into a community where the relentless pursuit of the unusual vocation and the friendship and the sex can all complement each other rather than being at odds.</p>



<p>It would be an understatement to say that I have some familiarity with this narrative arc.</p>



<p>I’m aware, of course, of the irony, that I can identify with so many contours of Beth Harmon’s journey—I, Scott Aaronson, who half the Internet denounced six years ago as a misogynist monster who denies the personhood and interiority of women.  In that life-alteringly cruel slur, there was a microscopic grain of truth, and it’s this: I’m not talented at imagining myself into the situations of people different from me.  It’s never been my strong suit.  I might <em>like</em> and <em>admire</em> people different from me, I might sympathize with their struggles and wish them every happiness, but I still don’t know what they’re thinking until they tell me.  And even then, I don’t fully understand it.</p>



<p>As one small but illustrative example, I have no intuitive understanding—zero—of what it’s like to be romantically attracted to men, or what any man could do or say or look like that could possibly be attractive to women.  If you have such an understanding, then imagine yourself sighted and me blind.  Intellectually, I might know that confidence or height or deep brown eyes or brooding artistry are supposed to be attractive in human males, but only because I’m told.  As far as my intuition is concerned, pretty much all men are equally hairy, smelly, and gross, a large fraction of women are alluring and beautiful and angelic, and both of those are just objective features of reality that no one could possibly see otherwise.</p>



<p>Thus, whenever I read or watch fiction starring a female protagonist who dates men, it’s very easy for me to imagine that protagonist judging me, enumerating my faults, and rejecting me, and very hard for me to do what I’m supposed to do, which is to <em>put myself into her shoes</em>.  I could watch a thousand female protagonists kiss a thousand guys onscreen, or wake up in bed next to them, and the thousandth-and-first time I’d still be equally mystified about what she saw in such a sweaty oaf and why she didn’t run from him screaming, and I’d snap out of vicariously identifying with her.  (Understanding gay men of course presents similar difficulties; understanding lesbians is comparatively easy.)</p>



<p>It’s possible to overcome this, but it takes an extraordinary female protagonist, brought to life by an extraordinary writer.  Off the top of my head, I can think of only a few.  There were Renee Feuer and Eva Mueller, the cerebral protagonists of Rebecca Newberger Goldstein’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Body-Problem-Contemporary-American-Fiction/dp/0140172459"><em>The Mind-Body Problem</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Summer-Passion-Woman-Vintage-Contemporaries/dp/0679728236"><em>The Late Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind</em></a>.  Maybe Ellie Arroway from Carl Sagan’s <em>Contact</em>.  And then there’s Beth Harmon.  With characters like these, I can briefly enter a space where their crushes on men seem no weirder or more inexplicable to me than my own teenage crushes … just, you know, inverted.  Sex is in any case secondary to the character’s primary urge to discover timeless truths, an urge that I fully understand because I’ve shared it.</p>



<p>Granted, the timeless truths of chess, an arbitrary and invented game, are less profound than those of quantum gravity or the P vs. NP problem, but the psychology is much the same, and <em>The Queen’s Gambit</em> does a good job of showing that.  To understand the characters of this series is to understand why they could be happier to lose an interesting game than to win a boring one.  And I could appreciate that, even if I was by no means the strongest player at my elementary school’s chess club, and the handicap with which I can beat my 7-year-old daughter is steadily decreasing.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-187 |  If VNP is hard, then so are equations for it | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	C Ramya, 

	Ramprasad Saptharishi, 

	Anamay Tengse</title>
    <summary>Assuming that the Permanent polynomial requires algebraic circuits of exponential size, we show that the class VNP *does not* have efficiently computable equations. In other words, any nonzero polynomial that vanishes on the coefficient vectors of all polynomials in the class VNP requires algebraic circuits of super-polynomial size.

In a recent work of Chatterjee and the authors (FOCS 2020), it was shown that the subclasses of VP and VNP consisting of polynomials with bounded integer coefficients *do*  have equations with small algebraic circuits. Their work left open the possibility that these results could perhaps be extended to all of VP or VNP. The results in this paper show that assuming the hardness of Permanent, at least for VNP, allowing polynomials with large coefficients does indeed incur a significant blow up in the circuit complexity of equations.</summary>

    <title>TR20-186 |  Shrinkage of Decision Lists and DNF Formulas | 

	Benjamin Rossman</title>
    <summary>We establish nearly tight bounds on the expected shrinkage of decision lists and DNF formulas under the $p$-random restriction $\mathbf R_p$ for all values of $p \in [0,1]$. For a function $f$ with domain $\{0,1\}^n$, let $\mathrm{DL}(f)$ denote the minimum size of a decision list that computes $f$. We show that
\[
  \mathbb E[\ \mathrm{DL}(f|\mathbf R_p)\ ] \le 
  \mathrm{DL}(f)^{\log_{2/(1-p)}(\frac{1+p}{1-p})}.
\]
For example, this bound is $\sqrt{\mathrm{DL}(f)}$ when $p = \sqrt{5}-2 \approx 0.24$. For Boolean functions $f$, we obtain the same shrinkage bound with respect to DNF formula size plus $1$ (i.e.,\ replacing $\mathrm{DL}(\cdot)$ with $\mathrm{DNF}(\cdot)+1$ on both sides of the inequality).</summary>

    <title>TR20-185 |  Quantum learning algorithms imply circuit lower bounds | 

	Tom Gur, 

	Alex Grilo, 

	Igor Oliveira, 

	Srinivasan Arunachalam, 

	Aarthi Sundaram</title>
    <summary>We establish the first general connection between the design of quantum algorithms and  circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let $\mathrm{C}$ be a class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that $\mathrm{C}$ can be PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error $1/2 - \gamma$ by a time $T$ quantum algorithm. We prove that if $\gamma^2 \cdot T \ll 2^n/n$, then $\mathrm{BQE} \not\subseteq \mathrm{C}$, where $\mathrm{BQE} = \mathrm{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ is an exponential-time analogue of $\mathrm{BQP}$. This result is optimal in both $\gamma$ and $T$, since it is not hard to learn any class $\mathcal{C}$ of functions in (classical) time $T = 2^n$  (with no error), or in quantum time $T = \mathrm{poly}(n)$ with error at most $1/2 - \Omega(2^{-n/2})$ via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a marginal improvement on these generic learning algorithms would lead to major consequences in complexity theory. 

Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and computational complexity, and crucially, on a connection between non-trivial classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira and Santhanam (CCC 2017). Extending their approach to quantum learning algorithms turns out to create significant challenges. To achieve that, we show among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound connections in a generic fashion, construct the first conditional pseudorandom generator secure against uniform quantum computations, and extend the local list-decoding algorithm of Impagliazzo, Jaiswal, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP 2010) to quantum circuits via a delicate analysis. We believe that these contributions are of independent interest and might find other applications.</summary>

    <title>Quarterly Th. Wksp `at' Northwestern, and thoughts inspired by it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> On the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/">Northwestern CS Theory Group</a> there is a set of Quarterly Theory Workshops. There is one coming up on Dec 17-18, 2020, called the <a href="https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/events/2020-junior-theorists-workshop/">Junior Theorists Workshop</a>. Take a look and possibly go to it! Because it is virtual you do not need to plan that much ahead- though they do want you to register. </p><p>1) I notice broadly two kinds of meetings:</p><p><br/>Based on WHO will be there, e.g., JUNIOR theorists</p><p><br/>Based on TOPIC: e.g., there was a meeting on ALGORITHMIC FAIRNESS.</p><p><br/></p><p>2) These types of meetings (NY Theory day is another) are, I believe, intended to be for people that are local (more on that later). But because the meeting will be on zoom, geography is no longer an impediment for either the attendees or the speakers. </p><p><br/></p><p>3) Before covid there was some talk of  `Gee, flying off to STOC, FOCS, other conferences is bad for the environment, what to do about that?'. With that in mind, here is a history which might not be true but makes a point:</p><p><i>In an earlier era FOCS/STOC were attended by mostly Americans and ICALP was attended by mostly Europeans.  I do not think there was any policy of discrimination on admissions, but it was more like Americans just did not submit to ICALP as much, nor Europeans  to FOCS/STOC. But over time when these conferences got to be considered prestigious people would routinely submit to either one depending on timing. If your paper was done in time for Conf X deadline, that's where you submit. If it does not get in then  you edit it some, perhaps add some new results, and submit to Conf Y. </i></p><p>So one solution to the air-travel-global-Warming   problem of conferences is go back to a time (which may not have ever existed) where it was just understood that you go to LOCAL conferences. Math does this, but it helps that their regional conferences are not  prestigious. But even they don't quite get it right: the joint AMS-MAA meeting alternates coasts. One year when it was in California they invited me to be a guest speaker (on the Muffin Problem). The following year it was in Baltimore. Note that I live in Maryland, so perhaps they should have waited a year. </p><p>How to encourage people to submit locally. I DO NOT want to have a rule or a diff standard for those who don't. As such... I have no idea. </p><p><br/></p><p>4)  Are virtual conferences a good idea? This is a hot topic now so I won't dwell on it, just to say that there is still something about being there IN PERSON, meeting people, serendipity that makes live confs better.</p><p>However, to have it at the same time be virtual and recorded will be VERY HELPFL to those who can't afford to go for whatever reason. </p><p>And of course there is the whole issue of if we should have prestigious conferences, which I won't get into now. Or later. That's more Lance's issue (he thinks no). </p><p><br/></p></div>

<p>He is a longtime faculty member in computer science at the University of Buffalo, a longtime fan of the Buffalo NFL football team, and a longtime international master of chess. He is also one of the world experts on detecting cheating at chess. Players cheat by making their moves based on computer programs instead of relying on their brains. The key issue is: computer programs play chess better than any human. </p>
<p>
Today I thought we might send Ken a tip-of-the-hat for being in the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>
That is he is featured in a WSJ article called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-queens-gambit-catching-chess-cheaters-11607439491">Queen’s Gambit</a> about chess cheating. </p>

<p>
This is not his first mention in the WSJ—see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/high-tech-chess-cheaters-charge-ahead-1444404660">here</a>. See <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2020/12/010.html">this</a> for additional comments by Cory Nealon, who says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The game of chess is no stranger to cheating. But since the pandemic hit and tournaments have moved online, the services of chess detectives have never been more in demand. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ken is perhaps the world’s most feared chess detective. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Beyond Chess </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Chess is important, but it is a game. Yet chess cheating may be an early warning of things to come. Might robotic methods in other areas soon start to dominate humans? Might chess be one of first areas to be lost to robots?</p>
<p>
A 1970 movie that comes to mind is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project">The Forbin Project</a>. The plot is what happens when a computer system, Colossus, takes over the world. Its creator is Dr. Forbin, has the following exchange with it at the end of the movie: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Colossus later tells Forbin that the world, now freed from war, will create a new human millennium that will raise mankind to new heights, but only under its absolute rule. Colossus informs Forbin that “freedom is an illusion” and that “in time you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe, but with love”. Forbin responds, “Never!” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I think there is a reason to worry about computers like Colossus wiping us out. Perhaps not taking absolute control, but nevertheless making us second class citizens. I wonder if the following areas could be potential ones where we lose out to computers:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Protein folding?</i> They already are doing quite <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/02/too-long-didnt-read/">well</a>.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Play calling in the NFL?</i> I made this one up, but I do wonder if using all the statistics available programs could do a better job than players and coaches. They probably could already do better than the Jets defensive coach, who was recently <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/report-jets-fire-defensive-coordinator-gregg-williams-after-legendarily-awful-loss-to-raiders-161424493.html">fired</a>. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Solving Open Math Problems?</i> We recently talked about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/14/surely-you-are-joking/#comment-114892">Lean</a> the proof checking system. But what if Lean could start to conjecture, to suggest directions, and give a proof outline? This would be, I believe, much more disruptive than the ability to check proofs.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are some areas that you think could be next? That could be taken over by robots?<br/>
Moreover, as more areas are dominated by robots, we will need more Ken’s to stop cheaters. </p>
<p>
Thanks again Ken. </p>

<h2>Problem 1: Independence numbers for random induced subgraphs</h2>
<p>For a graph <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> let <img alt="\alpha (G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\alpha (G)"/> be its independence number, namely the maximum  size of an independent set of vertices in <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/>. Now consider a random subset <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W"/> of the set <img alt="V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="V"/> of vertices of <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/>. A vertex <img alt="v \in V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v+%5Cin+V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="v \in V"/> belongs to <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W"/> with probability 1/2, independently.  Now let <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="H"/> be the induced graph from <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> on <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W"/>. Denote by <img alt="\alpha^-(G)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%5E-%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\alpha^-(G)"/> the expected value of <img alt="\alpha (H)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%28H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\alpha (H)"/> over all such random induced subgraphs <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="H"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> For every real number <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\tau"/>, <img alt="0&lt;\tau&lt;1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0%3C%5Ctau%3C1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="0&lt;\tau&lt;1"/> there is <img alt="\epsilon(\tau ) &gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%28%5Ctau+%29+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\epsilon(\tau ) &gt;0"/> such that if <img alt="\alpha (G) =\tau n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%28G%29+%3D%5Ctau+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\alpha (G) =\tau n"/> then <img alt="\alpha^-(G) \le (\tau-\epsilon(\tau ))n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%5E-%28G%29+%5Cle+%28%5Ctau-%5Cepsilon%28%5Ctau+%29%29n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\alpha^-(G) \le (\tau-\epsilon(\tau ))n"/>.</p>
<p>If we look at the example <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> of the complete graph on 1/τ vertices we get that <img alt="\alpha^-(G) =&#xA0; (1-2^{-1/\tau})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%5E-%28G%29+%3D%C2%A0+%281-2%5E%7B-1%2F%5Ctau%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\alpha^-(G) =&#xA0; (1-2^{-1/\tau})"/>. The reason is that the independence number of <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G"/> is always 1 except in one case occurring with probability <img alt="2^{-1/\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B-1%2F%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2^{-1/\tau}"/> where <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="W"/> is empty.</p>
<p>An example coming from a random graph <img alt="G(n,p)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="G(n,p)"/>  gives that <img alt="\epsilon (\tau)&#xA0; = \tau (1-2^{c(-1/\tau)\cdot (\log (1/\tau)}) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+%28%5Ctau%29%C2%A0+%3D+%5Ctau+%281-2%5E%7Bc%28-1%2F%5Ctau%29%5Ccdot+%28%5Clog+%281%2F%5Ctau%29%7D%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\epsilon (\tau)&#xA0; = \tau (1-2^{c(-1/\tau)\cdot (\log (1/\tau)}) "/> and the strong conjecture is that <img alt="\epsilon(\tau )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%28%5Ctau+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\epsilon(\tau )"/> can be taken to be <img alt="2^{C(-1/\tau)\cdot&#xA0; (\log (1/\tau)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7BC%28-1%2F%5Ctau%29%5Ccdot%C2%A0+%28%5Clog+%281%2F%5Ctau%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="2^{C(-1/\tau)\cdot&#xA0; (\log (1/\tau)}"/>.

<p><img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> people are assigned at random white/black hats, Each person sees the hats of the other and need to guess the color of her own hat. They can decide in advance on the guessing strategy and their aim is maximize the probability that they all guessed correctly. How well they can do?</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a strategy with 50% chance of winning. They all need to assume that there are overall an even number of black hats.</p>
<h3>The real infamous hat problem by Lionel Levine</h3>
<p>Now every player has an infinite tower of hats on her head and, again, the hats are taken to be white or black at random. Again each players see all the hats of other players and again the players can plan in advance a strategy for success, This time each player has to point to one of the hats on her head and  the players WIN if all these hats are black.</p>
<p>Again, based on the hats of all others the k-th player says something like “I think the 7th hat on my head is black” or “I think the 3rd hat on my head is black” and the players win if all these statement are correct.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> As the number of players grows the probability for success tends to zero.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="p_k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="p_k"/> be the success probability for <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/> players. (Remark: instead of having infinite number of hats we can assume that <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="k"/> is fixed, each player has <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> hats, and then let <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="n"/> goes to infinity.</p>
<p>Ehud explained why <img alt="1/3 \le p_2 \le 3/8" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F3+%5Cle+p_2+%5Cle+3%2F8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="1/3 \le p_2 \le 3/8"/>. He challenged the audience to prove that <img alt="p_3 &lt; p_2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_3+%3C+p_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="p_3 &lt; p_2"/> which is unknown.</p>
<p>The problem was presented in <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/2011/04/how-many-hats-can-fit-on-your-head/">this 2011 post</a>  on <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/" title="Tanya Khovanova's Math Blog: Mathematics, applications of mathematics to life in general, and my life as a mathematician.">Tanya Khovanova’s Math Blog.</a> Tanya also offered a new variant of her own.  It was also <a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/201607q.html">July 2016 riddle</a> further discussed <a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/201607a.html">here</a> on the math riddles site “<a href="https://www.brand.site.co.il/riddles/">Using your head is permitted</a>”</p>

<p>Bocconi University is looking for two Tenure-Track Assistant Professors in Computer Science, for positions starting in Fall 2021. This is in the context of a build-up toward a new department focused on Computer Science, which is part of the University’s strategic plan, and which is expected to be launched by Fall 2022.</p>



<p>Bocconi is Italy’s premiere private University, located in Milan. It is well known for its excellence in Economics and Management, and a few years ago it has begun a push into the hard sciences and engineering. Currently it offers a <em>Bachelor on Economics, Management and Computer Science</em>, a <em>Bachelor on Mathematical and Computing Sciences for Artificial Intelligence</em>, and a <em>Master’s in Data Science and Analytics</em>. There is a PhD program in Statistics and Computer Science. Additional programs related to computing are being planned.</p>



<p>The University negotiates salaries on an individual basis, and is able to put together very competitive offer packages. Scholars moving to Milan from outside Italy gain, in addition, a 6+ year tax break (90% of the salary is exempt from income tax). The University provides relocation benefits and employs full time staff to assist non-Italian-speaking faculty. Students are admitted on the basis of a competitive admission exam. A large fraction of them are foreigners, and the general academic level is fairly high.</p>



<p>A special note for Italians on how the position relates to positions in public Universities (in Italian because this is only a local concern): la posizione di “assistant professor” è simile a quella di RTDA, ma è un contratto di diritto privato. Dopo una valutazione intermedia, si passa ad una posizione simile a RTDB, ma sempre con un contratto distinto di diritto privato, e dopo una tenure review si viene promossi ad associati. I ruoli di associati ed ordinari sono inquadrati nel sistema nazionale e parificati (a parte la possibilità di una integrazione salariale) ai corrispettivi ruoli nell’università pubblica. Anche se non sono io la persona più qualificata per discutere questi aspetti, rispondo volentieri a qualunque domanda.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-184 |  Proof complexity of natural formulas via communication arguments | 

	Dmitry Itsykson, 

	Artur Riazanov</title>
    <summary>A canonical communication problem ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ is defined for every unsatisfiable CNF $\phi$: an assignment to the variables of $\phi$ is distributed among the communicating parties, they are to find a clause of $\phi$ falsified by this assignment. Lower bounds on the randomized $k$-party communication complexity of ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ in the number-on-forehead (NOF) model imply tree-size lower bounds, rank lower bounds, and size-space tradeoffs for the formula $\phi$ in the semantic proof system ${\rm T}^{cc}(k,c)$ that operates with proof lines that can be computed by $k$-party randomized communication protocol using at most $c$ bits of communication [Göös, Pitassi, 2014]. All known lower bounds on ${\rm Search}(\phi)$ (e.g. [Beame, Pitassi, Segerlind, 2007; Göös, Pitassi, 2014; Impagliazzo, Pitassi, Urquhart, 1994]) are realized on ad-hoc formulas $\phi$ (i.e. they were introduced specifically for these lower bounds). We introduce a new communication complexity approach that allows establishing proof complexity lower bounds for natural formulas.
  
  First, we demonstrate our approach for two-party communication and apply it to the proof system ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$ that operates with disjunctions of linear equalities over $\mathbb{F}_2$ [Itsykson, Sokolov, 2014]. Let a formula ${\rm PMP}_G$ encode that a graph $G$ has a perfect matching. 
    If $G$ has an odd number of vertices, then ${\rm PMP}_{G}$ has a tree-like ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$-refutation of a polynomial-size [Itsykson, Sokolov, 2014]. It was unknown whether this is the case for graphs with an even number of vertices. Using our approach we resolve this question and show a lower bound $2^{\Omega(n)}$ on size of tree-like ${\rm Res}(\oplus)$-refutations of ${\rm PMP}_{K_{n+2,n}}$.
  
  Then we apply our approach for $k$-party communication complexity in the NOF model and obtain a $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{k} 2^{n/2k - 3k/2}\right)$ lower bound on the randomized $k$-party communication complexity of ${\rm Search}({\rm BPHP}^{M}_{2^n})$ w.r.t. to some natural partition of the variables, where ${\rm BPHP}^{M}_{2^n}$ is the bit pigeonhole principle and $M=2^n+2^{n(1-1/k)}$. 
  In particular, our result implies that the bit pigeonhole requires exponential tree-like ${\rm Th}(k)$ proofs, where ${\rm Th}(k)$ is the semantic proof system operating with polynomial inequalities of degree at most $k$ and $k= O(\log^{1-\epsilon} n)$ for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$.
 We also show that ${\rm BPHP}^{2^n+1}_{2^n}$ superpolynomially separates tree-like ${\rm Th}(\log^{1-\epsilon} m)$ from tree-like ${\rm Th}(\log m)$, where $m$ is the number of variables in the refuted formula.</summary>
