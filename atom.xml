<p>
Neil L. is a leprechaun. He has been visiting me or Ken once every year since we started GLL. We had never seen a leprechaun before we began the blog—there must be some connection. </p>
<p>
Today we want to share the experience we each had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>
That’s right—Neil visited both of us separately. Four years ago, when I had major heart surgery on St. Patrick’s Eve, Neil <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">came</a> to my previous New York apartment, grabbed a page of my notes, and took it to Ken. The past two years, Ken was on Zoom with me when Neil appeared. This time, Neil had a bone to pick with Ken—after posing a problem to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Neil’s Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Kathryn, my dear wife, and I are still in our new midtown Manhattan apartment after my procedure two weeks ago. She went to sleep in the bedroom, but I stayed up awaiting Neil’s arrival. I must have dozed off, but jolted awake to his laugh and the waft of his pipe’s green smoke.</p>
<p>
Neil said hi and explained right away that he had a problem. “A classic problem that leprechauns have faced forever.” I nodded to him and rubbed my eyes to be awake enough to listen. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The other day I was minding me business and I fell into a trap. Nasty fall. The trapper was an old foe of mine. She told me she had three wishes. And I was bound to grant them as usual. Sae much, sae normal. But then she breached the rules. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> No More Wishes </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Now I knew the rules of wishes, so Neil did not have to tell me: Must be about something contingent, not love or death, no self-transmogrification, and most of all—well, let’s hear it from the genie in Disney’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)">Aladdin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Three wishes, three. Uno, dos, tres, no substitutions, exchanges, or refunds, and ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/></font><p><font color="darkgreen">
Neil picked up his story: “Her first two wishes were:<br/>
</font> </p>
<ol>
<li>
A pot of gold coins. <p/>
</li><li>
Another pot of gold.
</li></ol>
<p><font color="darkgreen"/></p><font color="darkgreen">
<p>
Those were fair and I showed I could handle them forthwith. But then she asked for: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘Please ten chirag oil lamps, each with a genie who can grant three wishes.’ </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This was terrible. It sent me to the lore. Ye cannot ask your servant for more wishes. Ye cannot involve another leprechaun. But lamps of themselves are just objects. That a <em>chirag</em> lamp has a genie is like an oyster has a pearl. Even if half the lamps be duds, that still  compounds the wishes—and she wished for ten that were not duds.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Math and Myth </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Neil puffed a few more times, as if really expecting an answer from me. He even prompted, “What do ye think?” </p>
<p>
That sent me into befuddlement. Usually I try to engage Neil on a <em>math</em> problem, to trick him into telling the answer to Riemann or factoring or P=NP. But despite the “<img alt="{&gt; 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>” aspect, this wasn’t math—it was more about <em>myth</em>. Math I can take seriously, but with weighty matters personal and worldwide, I did not want to play “meta” games. </p>
<p>
Neil read my mind: “Nay, I assure ye—it be really about math. Even the Riemann—”</p>
<p>
That made me think: if Neil knew that it had real math content, he must know the answer already. No sense groping for it groggily. I just retorted: “I don’t want to guess the answer. Please just tell me.”</p>
<p>
“Ye know there be only one way I ever tell ye answers…”</p>
<p>
“Sure. OK.” I really wanted to join Kathryn for some sleep.</p>
<p>
I blinked as Neil vanished in green light. Only his pipe smoke remained, and it curled around into a shape I couldn’t place at first. It took awhile to become sharp enough that I could tell what it was:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/17/meta-wishes/greenzeta/" rel="attachment wp-att-19758"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19758" height="123" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GreenZeta.png?resize=60%2C123&amp;ssl=1" width="60"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> Myth and Math </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken, shall tell the rest. Ordinarily, I would have been eager to engage Neil again about the NCAA basketball tournaments. But I too am too touched by the same weighty matters, and quite forgot the day.</p>
<p>
My unawareness did not matter because Neil apparated and instantly started confronting me: “What gave ye the mickey to <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/">write</a> of mathematics being ’emergent’? Ye dinna even define it.”</p>
<p>
I had to concede I’d not only been vague but had analogized it too to two senses of “emergent” in philosophy. I started to explain: “It’s like Albert Einstein’s famous question, ‘Did God have a choice?’ among physical laws. Now about math…”</p>
<p>
Neil cut me off: “When Einstein said ‘God,’ he meant nature—but when <em>you</em> say it, you mean leprechauns. You are asking: ‘Do we leprechauns have the power to change mathematical truths in advance of your learning them?’ That’s our turf—!”</p>
<p>
I stammered that I had a right to pose the question and had not meant to insinuate. But Neil kept on: “If we really could change outcomes then what would <em>maths</em> rest on? On <em>myths</em> just as well. But where ye speak of <em>law</em>, we have <em>lore</em>. Established rules. And they suffice.”</p>
<p>
This was waxing cryptic and I thought bringing up Kurt Gödel would only make it more so. Neil sensed I was adrift and went on: “I shall inform ye via the same story I told Dick.”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Neil’s Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Neil unfurled his story. At his same pause, one perception dawned on me: “Neil, did the lady’s wish imply a recursion—meaning the genies would be asked for a wish generator in the same proportion?”</p>
<p>
Neil nodded: “The lore says yes—the lore on hearing what is said. That is what I consulted it for. The rest I could work out on paper.” </p>
<p>
The paper part was easy up to a point. The wishes implied an infinite summation: the original <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then <img alt="{30}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more of the ten genies, with the third wishes to each bringing <img alt="{30}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at the next level, for <img alt="{30 \cdot 10 = 300}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30+%5Ccdot+10+%3D+300%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> more wishes there, and so on. In sum, </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3 + 30 + 300 + 3000 + \cdots = 3\cdot (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3+%2B+30+%2B+300+%2B+3000+%2B+%5Ccdots+%3D+3%5Ccdot+%281+%2B+10+%2B+100+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>wishes. Clearly the number of wishes is bounded by the series </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot(1 + 10 + 3^{\log_2 10} + 100 + 5^{\log_2 10} + 6^{\log_2 10} + 7^{\log_2 10} + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot%281+%2B+10+%2B+3%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+100+%2B+5%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+7%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Which equals <img alt="{3\cdot \zeta(-\log_2 10)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%5Ccdot+%5Czeta%28-%5Clog_2+10%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Without asking Neil how he’d computed that, I went to an <a href="https://solvemymath.com/online_math_calculator/number_theory/riemann_function/index.php">online</a> zeta <a href="https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1180573439">calculator</a> and obtained a bounding total of </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot 0.006023525392866159581193... \;\;= \;\;+0.018070576178598478743579... " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot+0.006023525392866159581193...+%5C%3B%5C%3B%3D+%5C%3B%5C%3B%2B0.018070576178598478743579...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>wishes. Neil puffed and chortled and finished his story:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “So the unlucky lass had wished herself into wishing a grand total of less than one-fiftieth of a wish. Since only whole wishes can be honoured, this sprang me from the trap and kept me both me pots o’ gold to boot. I gave her one coin as a peace offering.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I joined the laughter for just a moment. This followed mathematical rules but outlandishly, and I groped for the point. But Neil supplied it directly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some of your fellow travelers have felt reaching answers by non-constructive methods to be less outlandish only in degree not kind. If ye later apprehend the answer by calculation—which is what your post styled as “emergent” knowledge—then it must be exactly the same object previously described non-constructively. Thus in the realms ye ascribed to us wee folk, we are the guardians and gatekeepers of truth, not the forgers of it.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Neil tipped his hat and simply faded out—no green smoke for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can Neil’s zeta-function calculations insulate against any attempt at recursively gaining infinite wishes? The zeta function whips up and down in tune with the Bernoulli numbers, but the leprechauns do have freedom to choose a bounding series. Or is there an infinite series scheme that rises above 3 wishes even so? We hope this has given some St. Patrick’s Day diversion.</p>

    <title>Natural Hierarchical Cluster Analysis by Nearest Neighbors with Near-Linear Time Complexity</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1647388800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Kaan Gokcesu, Hakan Gokcesu <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08027">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We propose a nearest neighbor based clustering algorithm that results in a
naturally defined hierarchy of clusters. In contrast to the agglomerative and
divisive hierarchical clustering algorithms, our approach is not dependent on
the iterative working of the algorithm, in the sense that the partitions of the
hierarchical clusters are purely defined in accordance with the input dataset.
Our method is a universal hierarchical clustering approach since it can be
implemented as bottom up or top down versions, both of which result in the same
clustering. We show that for certain types of datasets, our algorithm has
near-linear time and space complexity.

complexity-theoretic analysis of problems that depend on a range of parameters.
In this paper we establish a quantum equivalent of classical parameterized
complexity theory, motivated by the need for new tools for the classifications
of the complexity of real-world problems. We introduce the quantum analogues of
a range of parameterized complexity classes and examine the relationship
between these classes, their classical counterparts, and well-studied problems.
This framework exposes a rich classification of the complexity of parameterized
versions of QMA-hard problems, demonstrating, for example, a clear separation
between the Quantum Circuit Satisfiability problem and the Local Hamiltonian
problem.

networks: does it compute valid output given some valid input? It was recently
claimed that the problem is NP-complete for general neural networks and
specifications over the input/output dimension given by conjunctions of linear
inequalities. We recapitulate the proof and repair some flaws in the original
upper and lower bound proofs. Motivated by the general result, we show that
NP-hardness already holds for restricted classes of simple specifications and
neural networks. Allowing for a single hidden layer and an output dimension of
one as well as neural networks with just one negative, zero and one positive
weight or bias is sufficient to ensure NP-hardness. Additionally, we give a
thorough discussion and outlook of possible extensions for this direction of
research on neural network verification.

mining and network research. Given a graph G=(V,E) and a source node $s \in V$,
a single-source PPR (SSPPR) query asks for the PPR value $\vpi(u)$ with respect
to s, which represents the relative importance of node u in the context of the
source node s. Among existing algorithms for SSPPR queries, LocalPush is a
fundamental method which serves as a cornerstone for subsequent algorithms. In
LocalPush, a push operation is a crucial primitive operation, which distributes
the probability at a node u to ALL u's neighbors via the corresponding edges.
Although this push operation works well on unweighted graphs, unfortunately, it
can be rather inefficient on weighted graphs. In particular, on unbalanced
weighted graphs where only a few of these edges take the majority of the total
weight among them, the push operation would have to distribute insignificant
probabilities along those edges which just take the minor weights, resulting in
expensive overhead.
</p>
<p>To resolve this issue, we propose the EdgePush algorithm, a novel method for
computing SSPPR queries on weighted graphs. EdgePush decomposes the
aforementioned push operations in edge-based push, allowing the algorithm to
operate at the edge level granularity. Hence, it can flexibly distribute the
probabilities according to edge weights. Furthermore, our EdgePush allows a
fine-grained termination threshold for each individual edge, leading to a
superior complexity over LocalPush. Notably, we prove that EdgePush improves
the theoretical query cost of LocalPush by an order of up to O(n) when the
graph's weights are unbalanced, both in terms of $\ell_1$-error and normalized
additive error. Our experimental results demonstrate that EdgePush
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of query
efficiency on large motif-based and real-world weighted graphs.

for a variety of sequence data. For comparing polygonal curves $\pi, \sigma$ in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, it provides a robust, outlier-insensitive alternative to the
Fr\'echet distance. However, like the Fr\'echet distance, the DTW distance is
not invariant under translations. Can we efficiently optimize the DTW distance
of $\pi$ and $\sigma$ under arbitrary translations, to compare the curves'
shape irrespective of their absolute location?
</p>
<p>There are surprisingly few works in this direction, which may be due to its
computational intricacy: For the Euclidean norm, this problem contains as a
special case the geometric median problem, which is known not to have an exact
algebraic algorithm (that is, an algorithm using only addition, multiplication,
and $k$-th roots). We thus investigate exact algorithms for non-Euclidean norms
as well as approximation algorithms for the Euclidean norm:
</p>
<p>- For the $L_1$ norm in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we provide an $O(n^{2(d+1)})$-time
algorithm, i.e., an exact polynomial-time algorithm for constant $d$. Here and
below, $n$ bounds the curves' complexities.
</p>
<p>- For the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we show that a simple
problem-specific insight leads to a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation in time
$O(n^3/\epsilon^2)$. We then show how to obtain a subcubic $\tilde
O(n^{8/3}/\epsilon^2)$ time algorithm with significant new ideas; this time
comes close to the well-known quadratic time barrier for computing DTW for
fixed translations. Technically, the algorithm is obtained by speeding up
repeated DTW distance estimations using a dynamic data structure for
maintaining shortest paths in weighted planar digraphs. Crucially, we show how
to traverse a candidate set of translations using space-filling curves in a way
that incurs only few updates to the data structure.

(MLS) constant of the Glauber dynamics for anti-ferromagnetic two-spin systems
with $n$ vertices in the tree uniqueness regime. Specifically, this optimal MLS
bound holds for the following classes of two-spin systems in the tree
uniqueness regime:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ all strictly anti-ferromagnetic two-spin systems (where both edge
parameters $\beta,\gamma&lt;1$), which cover the hardcore models and the
anti-ferromagnetic Ising models;
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ general anti-ferromagnetic two-spin systems on regular graphs.
</p>
<p>Consequently, an optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing time holds for these
anti-ferromagnetic two-spin systems when the uniqueness condition is satisfied.
These MLS and mixing time bounds hold for any bounded or unbounded maximum
degree, and the constant factors in the bounds depend only on the gap to the
uniqueness threshold. We prove this by showing a boosting theorem for MLS
constant for distributions satisfying certain spectral independence and
marginal stability properties.

combines the benefits of DRAM and SSD. This characteristic inspires research on
persistent objects in PM with fine-grained concurrency control. Among such
objects, persistent lock-free data structures (DSs) are particularly
interesting thanks to their efficiency and scalability. One of the most widely
used correctness criteria for persistent lock-free DSs is durable
linearizability (Izraelevitz et. al., DISC 2016). However, durable
linearizability is insufficient to use persistent DSs for fault-tolerant
systems requiring exactly-once semantics for storage systems, because we may
not be able to detect whether an operation is performed when a crash occurs.
</p>
<p>We present a practical programming framework for persistent lock-free DSs
with detectability. In contrast to the prior work on such DSs, our framework
supports (1) primitive detectable operations such as space-efficient
compare-and-swap, insertion, and deletion; (2) systematic transformation of
lock-free DSs in DRAM into those in PM requiring modest efforts; (3) comparable
performance with non-detectable DSs by DRAM scratchpad optimization; and (4)
recovery from both full system and thread crashes. The key idea is memento
objects serving as a lightweight, precise, and per-thread checkpoints in PM. As
a case study, we implement lock-free and combining queues and hash tables with
detectability that outperform (and perform comparably) the state-of-the-art DSs
with (and without, respectively) detectability.

practical applications such as ridesharing, crowdsourcing and job hiring. In
the problem, we are given a set of offline vertices (agents), and, at each
time, an online vertex (task) arrives randomly according to a known
time-dependent distribution. Upon arrival, we assign the task to agents
immediately and irrevocably. The goal of the problem is to maximize the
expected total profit produced by completed tasks. The key features of our
problem are (1) an agent is reusable, i.e., an agent comes back to the market
after completing the assigned task, (2) an agent may reject the assigned task
to stay the market, and (3) a task may accommodate multiple agents. The setting
generalizes that of existing work in which an online task is assigned to one
agent under (1).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose an online algorithm that is $1/2$-competitive for
the above setting, which is tight. Moreover, when each agent can reject
assigned tasks at most $\Delta$ times, the algorithm is shown to have the
competitive ratio $\Delta/(3\Delta-1)\geq 1/3$. We also evaluate our proposed
algorithm with numerical experiments.

Subsurface Recognition (c-SR) problem of finding a subcomplex that is
homeomorphic to a given connected surface with a fixed boundary. We also study
the related Sum-of-Genus Subsurface Recognition (SoG) problem, where we instead
search for a surface whose boundary, number of connected components, and total
genus are given.

<p>For both of these problems, we give parameterized algorithms with respect to
the treewidth $k$ of the Hasse diagram that run in $2^{O(k \log k)}n^{O(1)}$

the exponential-time hypothesis. In fact, we prove the stronger result that our
algorithm is ETH-tight even without restriction on the total genus.

$\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb R^{d}$ that minimizes
$\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}\|_p$ for a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb R^{n
\times d}$ and response vector $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb R^{n}$. There has been
recent interest in developing subsampling methods for this problem that can
outperform standard techniques when $n$ is very large. However, all known
subsampling approaches have run time that depends exponentially on $p$,
typically, $d^{\mathcal{O}(p)}$, which can be prohibitively expensive. We
improve on this work by showing that for a large class of common
\emph{structured matrices}, such as combinations of low-rank matrices, sparse
matrices, and Vandermonde matrices, there are subsampling based methods for
$\ell_p$ regression that depend polynomially on $p$. For example, we give an
algorithm for $\ell_p$ regression on Vandermonde matrices that runs in time
$\mathcal{O}(n\log^3 n+(dp^2)^{0.5+\omega}\cdot\text{polylog}\,n)$, where
$\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. The polynomial dependence on
$p$ crucially allows our algorithms to extend naturally to efficient algorithms
for $\ell_\infty$ regression, via approximation of $\ell_\infty$ by
$\ell_{\mathcal{O}(\log n)}$. Of practical interest, we also develop a new
subsampling algorithm for $\ell_p$ regression for arbitrary matrices, which is
simpler than previous approaches for $p \ge 4$.

and explore variants of classical extremal problems about planar point sets in
this setting, with a main focus on Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres-type problems.
</p>
<p>We provide asymptotically tight bounds for a variant of the
Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres theorem about point sets in convex position in
$\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$, which was initiated by Harborth and M\"oller in
1994. The notion of convex position in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ agrees with
the definition of convex sets introduced by Steinitz in 1913.
</p>
<p>For $k \geq 3$, an (affine) $k$-hole in a finite set $S \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^2$ is a set of $k$ points from $S$ in convex position with no point
of $S$ in the interior of their convex hull. After introducing a new notion of
$k$-holes for points sets from $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$, called projective
$k$-holes, we find arbitrarily large finite sets of points from
$\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ with no projective 8-holes, providing an analogue of
a classical result by Horton from 1983. We also prove that they contain only
quadratically many projective $k$-holes for $k \leq 7$. On the other hand, we
show that the number of $k$-holes can be substantially larger in
$\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ than in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by constructing, for every $k
\in \{3,\dots,6\}$, sets of $n$ points from $\mathbb{R}^2 \subset
\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ with $\Omega(n^{3-3/5k})$ projective $k$-holes and
only $O(n^2)$ affine $k$-holes. Last but not least, we prove several other
results, for example about projective holes in random point sets in
$\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$ and about some algorithmic aspects.
</p>
<p>The study of extremal problems about point sets in $\mathbb{R}\mathcal{P}^2$
opens a new area of research, which we support by posing several open problems.

    <title>Refined Hardness of Distance-Optimal Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>

Given a graph $G$ and a set of agents, each having a start and target vertex,
the goal is to find collision-free paths minimizing the total distance
traveled. To better understand the source of difficulty of the problem, we aim
to study the simplest and least constrained graph class for which it remains
hard. To this end, we restrict $G$ to be a 2D grid, which is a ubiquitous
abstraction, as it conveniently allows for modeling well-structured
environments (e.g., warehouses). Previous hardness results considered highly
constrained 2D grids having only one vertex unoccupied by an agent, while the
most restricted hardness result that allowed multiple empty vertices was for
(non-grid) planar graphs. We therefore refine previous results by
simultaneously considering both 2D grids and multiple empty vertices. We show
that even in this case distance-optimal MAPF remains NP-hard, which settles an
open problem posed by Banfi et al. (2017). We present a reduction directly from
3-SAT using simple gadgets, making our proof arguably more informative than
previous work in terms of potential progress towards positive results.
Furthermore, our reduction is the first linear one for the case where $G$ is
planar, appearing nearly four decades after the first related result. This
allows us to go a step further and exploit the Exponential Time Hypothesis
(ETH) to obtain an exponential lower bound for the running time of the problem.
Finally, as a stepping stone towards our main results, we prove the NP-hardness
of the monotone case, in which agents move one by one with no intermediate
stops.

evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) in multi-player symmetric games. For
two-player games, deciding existence of an ESS is complete for {\Sigma} 2 , the
second level of the polynomial time hierarchy. We show that deciding existence
of an ESS of a multi-player game is closely connected to the second level of
the real polynomial time hierarchy. Namely, we show that the problem is hard
for a complexity class we denote as \exists D . \forall R and is a member of
\exists\forall R, where the former class restrict the latter by having the
existentially quantified variables be Boolean rather then real-valued. As a
special case of our results it follows that deciding whether a given strategy
is an ESS is complete for \forall R. A concept strongly related to ESS is that
of a locally superior strategy (LSS). We extend our results about ESS and show
that deciding existence of an LSS of a multiplayer game is likewise hard for
\exists D \forall R and a member of \exists\forall R, and as a special case
that deciding whether a given strategy is an LSS is complete for \forall R.

edge periodic temporal graphs (EPGs). EPGs are time-varying graphs that
compactly represent periodic behavior of components of a dynamic network, for
example, train schedules on a rail network. In EPGs, for each edge $e$ of the
graph, a binary string $s_e$ determines in which time steps the edge is
present, namely $e$ is present in time step $t$ if and only if $s_e$ contains a
$1$ at position $t \mod |s_e|$. Due to this periodicity, EPGs serve as very
compact representations of complex periodic systems and can even be
exponentially smaller than classic temporal graphs representing one period of
the same system, as the latter contain the whole sequence of graphs explicitly.
In this paper, we study the computational complexity of fundamental questions
of the new concept of EPGs such as what is the shortest traversal time between
two vertices; is there a time step in which the graph (1) is minor-free; (2)
contains a minor; (3) is subgraph-free; (4) contains a subgraph; with respect
to a given minor or subgraph. We give a detailed parameterized analysis for
multiple combinations of parameters for the problems stated above including
several parameterized algorithms.

    <title>Differentially private deep learning can be effective with self-supervised models</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Differential Privacy (DP) is a formal definition of privacy which guarantees that the outcome of a statistical procedure does not vary much regardless of whether an individual input is included or removed from the training dataset. 
This guarantee is desirable when we are tasked to train machine learning models on private datasets that should not memorize individual inputs. 
Past works have shown that differentially private models can be resilient to strong membership inference [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kairouz15.html">1</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519424">34</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/fc4ddc15f9f4b4b06ef7844d6bb53abf-Abstract.html">35</a>] and data reconstruction attacks [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/carlini">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12383">3</a>] when the privacy parameter is set to be sufficiently small. 
See a <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/how-to-deploy-ml-with-dp/">prior post</a> for more background on differentially private machine learning.</p>

<p>Yet, in practice, most attempts at training differentially private deep learning models on moderately-sized datasets have resulted in large performance drops compared to when training without privacy-protection baked in. 
These performance drops are oftentimes large enough to discourage the adoption of differential privacy protection into machine learning pipelines altogether.</p>

<p>To provide a reference of the potential performance hit, the authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12677">5</a>] trained a ResNet-20 from scratch on CIFAR-10 with a privacy budget of \(\epsilon=8\) that has test accuracy barely over 62% (see their Table 1). 
Contrast this with the 8.75% error rate (91.25% accuracy) reported for training the same architecture without enforcing differential privacy [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html">6</a>]. 
While some works report private learning results better than the above, absent additional data, pre-training, or external knowledge, most improvements have been incremental, and the test accuracy for CIFAR-10 models trained under modest privacy leakage (\(\epsilon=3\)) has roughly settled to ~70% in the literature [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>].</p>

<p>One reason behind the performance drop lies in sample efficiency — differentially private learning generally requires much more data than non-private learning to reach an acceptable level of performance. 
This also means that learning the high-level features (e.g., syntactic structure in text, edge detectors for images) necessary to perform specific tasks with private data can be much more sample-costly.</p>

<p>This blog post surveys results that leverage public self-supervised pre-training to obtain high-performing models through differentially private fine-tuning.
The pre-train-fine-tune paradigm is straightforward to execute and results in high-performing models under modest privacy budgets for many standard computer vision and natural language processing tasks. 
Moreover, existing results have shown that private fine-tuning consistently benefits from improvements in public pre-training.</p>

<h2 id="self-supervised-pre-training">Self-Supervised Pre-Training</h2>

<p>Self-supervised learning is a paradigm which leverages unlabeled data to learn representations that can be useful for a range of downstream tasks.
Since self-supervised learning doesn’t target specific tasks itself, 
the (pre-)training procedure doesn’t require labeled data — in many cases, mildly curated unlabeled data is sufficient for self-supervised pre-training to produce models for subsequent fine-tuning. 
So far, there have been two broadly successful instantiations of this learning paradigm in computer vision [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j.html">9</a>] and natural language processing [<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">8</a>]. 
We recap the two approaches below.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Contrastive pre-training for vision:</strong> 
One class of self-supervised methods in computer vision (SimCLR, [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j.html">9</a>]) performs pre-training through contrastive learning. 
Algorithms of this type produce embeddings for images with the goal of creating different embeddings for semantically different images and similar embeddings for similar ones. 
Concretely, the algorithm used in SimCLR forces models to produce similar embeddings for an image and its augmented siblings (e.g., image rotated by some degrees), 
and different embeddings for separate images (and their augmentations). 
The SimCLR framework with large scale models and compute led to state-of-the-art (non-private) ImageNet fine-tuning results at the time of its writing.</p>

<p><strong>Masked language modeling and autoregressive language modeling for text:</strong> 
Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Auto-regressive Language Modeling (ALM) are two self-supervised pre-training approaches. 
While the former asks models to predict deliberately masked out tokens from a piece of text, the latter asks models to simply predict the next token in a sequence. 
With large amounts of unlabeled text data, large and expressive Transformer models [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html">24</a>], and lots of compute, both approaches produce powerful models that are good starting points for downstream fine-tuning. 
For instance, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT, [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">8</a>]), produced state-of-the-art (non-private) results (at the time) for a large collection of language understanding tasks when fine-tuned on each.</p>

<h2 id="fine-tuning-self-supervised-models-with-dp-optimization">Fine-Tuning Self-Supervised Models With DP-Optimization</h2>
<p>Self-supervised pre-training is appealing in the context of differentially private machine learning. 
This is because (i) the mildly curated data needed for pre-training can usually be obtained cheaply from the public domain, and (ii) pre-trained models may contain useful domain knowledge that can reduce the sample complexity of subsequent private learning. 
A paradigm for private learning that leverages self-supervised pre-training could follow two steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect cheap and public (unlabeled) data from the task domain (e.g., vision, language, etc.) to pre-train a model with self-supervised learning, and</li>
  <li>collect moderate amounts of task-specific private (labeled) data and fine-tune the pre-trained model under differential privacy to perform the task.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>To date, some of the best differentially private deep learning results in the literature have resulted from instantiating this paradigm [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06500">12</a>].
Below, we review works which capitalize on self-supervised pre-training by differentially privately fine-tuning pre-trained models with an iterative gradient method like DP-SGD [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978318">19</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6736861">20</a>].<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
<img alt="" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/fine-tuning-paradigm.png"/></p>

<p><strong>Private fine-tuning with SimCLR features:</strong> 
The authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>] fine-tuned a linear model on top of the embedding vectors produced by SimCLRv2 from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Under a privacy budget of \(\epsilon=2\), 
these models reached an average test accuracy of 92.7%. This number can be further improved to ~94% with the use of larger and wider pre-trained models in the SimCLRv2 family.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> 
These test accuracies are very close to some standard non-private results attained by an off-the-shelf ResNet architecture [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html">6</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Privately fine-tuning BERT variants and GPT-2:</strong> 
The authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06500">12</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yu21f.html">16</a>] showed that with appropriate hyper-parameters, fine-tuning BERT variants and GPT-2 with DP-optimization results in high-performing private models for text classification and language generation — even on datasets of modest sizes and under modest privacy budgets. 
Notably, some of these models attain a task performance close to non-private models from previous years in the literature. 
These results also exceed many non-private learning results from the pre-BERT and pre-GPT years.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>More interestingly, the authors showed that the larger (and thus better) the pre-trained model, the better the private fine-tuning performance gets. 
This empirical observation in private fine-tuning of large Transformers is qualitatively different from what’s implied by the usual minimax optimal rates derived for vanilla private learning with convex loss functions under approximate differential privacy [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6979031">14</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/3bd8fdb090f1f5eb66a00c84dbc5ad51-Abstract.html">15</a>]. 
This discrepancy between experimental results for training large models and the theory for learning with convex losses suggests there is more to be understood.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Overall, for both vision and language tasks, private learning performance has consistently improved with the improvement in the quality of pre-training, 
where the latter is measured by the non-private fine-tuning performance.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-outlook">Conclusion and Outlook</h2>

<p>We surveyed recent works in the literature that obtained highly performant private machine learning models leveraging self-supervised pre-training. 
Common to these results is the trend that the performance of private learning consistently improved with the quality of public pre-training. 
We therefore anticipate that the general paradigm may be useful in additional settings (e.g., federated learning) and tasks (e.g., private synthetic image generation), and lead to better private learning results.</p>

<p>We have thus far assumed that the data for public pre-training can be cheaply obtained.
This, however, does not imply that determining whether a particular source of data is appropriate for public pre-training is an easy problem.
Using publicly available data is not necessarily risk-free in terms of privacy.
For instance, the authors of [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/carlini-extracting">33</a>] were able to extract personally identifiable information from a GPT-2 model pre-trained on data scraped from the public internet.</p>

<p>Self-supervised pre-training has led to progress in private deep learning, but leveraging pre-trained models alone will not address several fundamental challenges to differentially private learning.
First and foremost, the datasets of machine learning tasks may be sampled from long-tailed distributions [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1e14bfe2714193e7af5abc64ecbd6b46-Abstract.html">21</a>]. 
When privately trained on such datasets, a machine learning model may fail to acquire the learning signal necessary to perform accurate predictions for examples on the tail [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445934">28</a>] or from underrepresented (sub)populations [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/fc0de4e0396fff257ea362983c2dda5a-Abstract.html">29</a>]. 
Second, many machine learning problems are in a domain where public data (even unlabeled data) may be sparse, e.g., medical imaging. 
Developing refined versions of the pre-train-fine-tune approach for problems from these domains is an interesting avenue for future work.</p>

<p>Lastly, differential privacy as one specific definition of privacy may not capture all that’s desired for privacy in reality. 
For instance, while differentially private algorithms naturally give machine unlearning guarantees [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519428">30</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7163042">32</a>], tailored unlearning algorithms tend to have higher capacities of unlearning [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/9627c45df543c816a3ddf2d8ea686a99-Abstract.html">31</a>].
In addition, what constitutes a record in the differential privacy framework can oftentimes be unclear. 
Inappropriately defined example boundaries can create correlated records which cause differential privacy guarantees to degrade [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01508">22</a>].
Moreover, differential privacy guarantees won’t directly prevent the inference of private data outside the original context [<a href="https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/washlr79&amp;section=16">23</a>]. 
These are fundamental limitations of differential privacy which improvements to differentially private learning won’t touch on.</p>

      <p>Authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">18</a>] framed these self-supervised models which are trained on broad data at scale that are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks as “foundation models.” <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1">↩</a></p>

      <p>The idea of privately fine-tuning a publicly pre-trained model certainly isn’t new. One of the first differentially private deep learning papers [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133">19</a>] considered an experiment which fine-tuned convolutional nets on CIFAR-10 which were pre-trained on CIFAR-100. Results on privately fine-tuning <em>self-supervised</em> models are, on the other hand, more recent. Covering these results is our main focus here. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:2">↩</a></p>

      <p>Hyper-parameters that work well for non-private learning typically aren’t those that work best for differentially private learning [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJg851rYwH">27</a>]. It’s crucial to use a large batch size, a small clipping norm, an appropriate learning rate, and a reasonably large number of training epochs to obtain the mentioned private learning results [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>]. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:5">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:6">
      <p>In practice, past works have presented mixed results on whether larger models would yield better performance. While some showed that using more filters in a convolutional network can degrade the performance of private learning after some threshold [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJg851rYwH">27</a>], others showed that a larger model can outperform a smaller model from a different model family [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>]. Note these results are conditioned on their particular hyperparameter choices. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:6">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:7">
      <p>Since the pre-training data for large language models are oftentimes collected through large scale web scraping (e.g., WebText), a common concern is that some training and test instances for downstream tasks may already appear in the pre-training data. Self-supervised pre-training therefore can give models an opportunity to “see” this data even before they are privately fine-tuned. Authors of [<a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">17</a>] confirmed that there is a 1-6% overlap between the test set of many natural language processing tasks and the pre-training data they collected (WebText); these common tasks, however, don’t include those studied by authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>]. The numbers suggest a possibility that existing private fine-tuning results in the literature could be slightly inflated compared to when the pre-training data didn’t contain any instance for any downstream task for which evaluation was performed. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:7">↩</a></p>

    <title>Problem X won't be solved in MY lifetime- but what about...</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>1) In 1989 on the episde The Royale of Star Trek: The Next Generation (which takes place in the far future)  Captain Picard is working on Fermat's last theorem which he says quite explicitly is still open.</p><p>When I saw the episode I asked Larry Washington, a Number Theorist at Univ of MD, when he thought FLT would be solved. He said</p><p>                                      <i>It will be solved within the next 10 years.</i></p><p>And indeed- Wiles solved it in 1993-sort of. There was a flaw in the proof which he fixed in 1994 with the help of his former student Richard Taylor. Wiles published the correction to the flaw in 1995, so we will date it as having been solved in 1995. Larry Washington was correct.  And in an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in 1995 (episode name:Facets) Dax says that a previous host, Tobin Dax, had done the most creative work on FLT since Wiles. Maybe Tobin wrote this limerick:</p><p>A challenge for many long ages</p><p>Had baffled the savants and sages</p><p>Yet at last came the light</p><p>Seems that Fermat was right</p><p>To the margin add 200 pages.</p><p><br/></p><p>I asked Larry W when he thought Riemann would be solved. He said  </p><p>                   <i> In your lifetime but not in mine.</i></p><p>He is about 10 years older than I am and I think we are both in good health. This seems like a rather precise prediction so I am skeptical. But he did get FLT right...</p><p>2) In class I sometimes say things like </p><p><i>I do not think Quantum Computers will factor faster than classical in my lifetime. </i></p><p><i>I do not think P vs NP will be solved in my lifetime.</i></p><p><i>I can imagine P=BPP will be proven in my lifetime. (I said that 10 years ago. I am less imaginative now.) </i></p><p><i>I hope the muffin problem is solved in my lifetime (it was, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08726">here</a>).</i></p><p>I didn't quite think about the difference in my age and the students until recently when I was working with Ilya Hajiaghayi (Mohammd H's 9 year old son) on cryptography and he said </p><p><i>In your recorded lecture you said you don't think quantum computers will be a threat to cryptography  in your lifetime. What about in my lifetime?</i></p><p>Indeed- his lifetime and mine are rather far apart. </p><p>I am reminded that one of the answers to my P vs NP poll made the point that while we have some sense of what will happen in the next 10 years, maybe even 20, math and life can change so much that conjectures beyond that are guesswork. Any  prediction for x years from now you should have confidence &lt; 1/ln(x) of it being true.</p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <link href="http://benjamin-recht.github.io/2022/03/15/external-validity/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Machine Learning has a validity problem.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>One of the central tenets of machine learning warns the more times you run experiments with the same test set, the more you overfit to that test set. This conventional wisdom is mostly wrong and prevents machine learning from reconciling its inductive nihilism with the rest of the empirical sciences.</p>

<p>Rebecca Roelofs, Ludwig Schmidt, and Vaishaal Shankar led an passionate quest to test the overfitting hypothesis, devoting countless hours to reproducing machine learning benchmarks. In particular, they painstakingly recreated a test set of the famous <a href="https://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet benchmark</a>, which itself is responsible for bringing about the latest AI feeding frenzy. Out of the many surprises in my research career, what <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">they found surprised me the most.</a></p>

<p class="center"><img alt="The scatterplot of nightmares" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/RSS_Scatter.png" width="90%"/></p>

<p>In this graph, the x-axis is the accuracy on the original ImageNet benchmark, which has been used millions of times by individual researchers at Google alone. On the y-axis is the accuracy evaluated on “ImageNet v2” set, which was made by closely trying to replicate the data creation method for the benchmark. Each blue dot represents a single machine learning model trained on the original ImageNet data. The red line is a linear fit to these models, and the dashed line is what we would see if the accuracy was the same on both test sets. What do we see? The models which perform the best on the original test set perform the best on the new test set. That is, there is no evidence of overfitting.</p>

<p>What is clear, however, is a noticeable drop in performance on the new test set. Despite their best efforts in reproducing the ImageNet protocol, there is evidence of a <em>distribution shift</em>. Distribution shift is a far reaching term describing whenever the data on which a machine learning algorithm is deployed is different from the data on which it is trained. The Mechanical Turk workers who labeled the images were different from those originally employed. The API used for the labeling was slightly different. The selection mechanism to aggregate differences in opinions between labelers is slightly different. The small differences add up to around a 10% drop in accuracy, equivalent to five years of progress on the benchmark.</p>

<p>Folks in my research group have reproduced this phenomenon several times. In <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9117-a-meta-analysis-of-overfitting-in-machine-learning">Kaggle competitions</a>, where the held out set and validation set were <em>identically</em> distributed, we saw no overfitting <em>and</em> no distribution shift. We found sensitivity to distribution shifts in CIFAR10, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02168">video</a>, and in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14444">question answering</a> benchmarks. And Chhavi Yadav and Leon Bottou showed that we have not yet overfit to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10498">venerable MNIST data set</a>, but distribution shift remains a challenge.</p>

<p>The marked sensitivity to distribution shift is a huge issue. If small ambiguities in reproductions lead to large losses in predictive performance, what happens when we take ML systems designed on static benchmarks and deploy them in important applications? A decade of AI fever has delivered piles of evidence that distribution shift is machine learning’s achilles heel. Algorithms run inside the big tech companies need to be constantly retrained with their huge computing resources. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002683">Data-driven algorithms for radiology often fail if one changes the X-ray machine</a>. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2781307">AI algorithms for sepsis fail if you change hospitals</a>. And self-driving car systems are readily confused in new environments (No citation needed. Keep your Tesla away from me.).</p>

<p>The only way forward is for machine learning to engage more broadly with other scientists who have been tackling similar issues for centuries. My first proposal is simple: let’s change our terminology to align with the rest of the sciences. The study of distribution shift in machine learning has always been insular and, while machine learning is particularly sensitive, all empirical science must deal with the jump from experiment to reality.</p>

<p>With this in mind, <a href="https://twitter.com/rajiinio">Deb Raji</a> and I have been digging through the scientific literature for a while now hoping to find some answers. In most other parts of science, “robustness to distribution shift” is called external validity. External validity quantifies how well a finding generalizes beyond a specific experiment. For example, a significant result on a particular cohort may not generalize to a broader population.</p>

<p>Predictive algorithms and experimental science both rely on repeatability. “The sun has always risen in the east.” “The apple always falls straight to the ground.” We expect that given the same contexts, the natural world more or less repeats itself. There is unfortunately a big leap from the sun rising in the morning, to an experimental finding in machine learning or biomedicine being reproducible. Why?</p>

<p>The experimental contexts under which predictions and inferences are designed are often far too narrow. The results of a study performed on young male college students in Maine may not help us understand properties of a retirement community in Arizona. These populations are different! However, it may give us insights into other cohorts of male college students: a study at Bates may generalize to Colby or Bowdoin.</p>

<p>Contexts can change in a myriad of ways. Some examples include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The context can just be too narrow in the experiment. Do studies on adults generalize to children? Do studies on medications with only men generalize to women?</li>
  <li>The measured quantity may itself change. It is often easier to measure, detect, and control for exogenous disturbances in a lab setting than in the real world.</li>
  <li>Populations can change over time. For example, medical recommendations from the 1980s may no longer apply to the current population. Recent developments have led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/13/1045746669/task-force-says-most-people-should-not-take-daily-aspirin-to-prevent-a-heart-att">not recommending aspirin to prevent heart attacks</a>.  Machine Learners like to call this <em>covariate shift</em>.</li>
  <li>Even more nefariously, the population can change in response to the intervention. A classic example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a> which states “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”</li>
</ol>

<p>How can we grapple with these external validity challenges? Verifying external validity is daunting and the set of potential solutions remains quite limited. As I mentioned, Deb and I have been chatting about this for a year now, and we’ve now dragged the rest of the group into our investigations. So I’m going to share the blog with Deb for a few posts now, and we’ll both expand on what we’ve been reading and thinking about. In the next few posts, we’ll explore some of the intricacies of when external validity can fail and will also try to spell out some of the research directions that might help bridge the gaps between experiments and reality.</p></div>

Pi Day needs the day to be written American-style as 3/14/22. In international style it would be 31/4/22, but April does not have 31 days. This year involves the numerator of the simplest serviceable approximation to pi: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi \approx \frac{22}{7} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>

Furthermore, the symbol <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> lends itself to many other calculations that yield exact finite results. </p>
<p>
The digits, however, have their own mystique. We still do not know whether they are <a href="http://pi314.at/math/normal.html">normal</a> in any base, let alone base ten. Speaking as mathematical Platonists, we regard the infinite sequence as a completed, unchanging entity—one for which assertions like “it is normal” have currently-definite truth values. </p>
<p>
This is what events of the past few weeks have prompted Dick and me to question. If our world presently stops existing, 7817924264 will be the last digits of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that we know.</p>

<p/><h2> Not Just WW III </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I already have a story of impermanent truth rooted in Russia. On my phone I have a free app for the <a href="https://chessok.com/?page_id=27966">Lomonosov Tablebases</a>, which give the perfect result of all chess positions with 7 or fewer pieces. Those tables took years to compile and exist only as 100+ terabytes on a machine at the Lomonosov Moscow State University computer center. </p>
<p>
Sometime over the new year, I noticed that the server stopped working. It was <a href="http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=74046">reportedly</a> the victim of a ransomware attack. Is it meaningful to say that the tables currently exist? Mathematically, yes, and physically likely also yes—assuming the bits were merely blocked and not altered on the storage plates. </p>
<p>
Happily, there is a second 7-piece table called <a href="https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete">Syzygy</a>, which uses only about 18 terabytes and exists in multiple dowloaded copies. However, this leads us to another question about correctness. The Syzygy computation reproduced some key extremal features of the Lomonosov compilation, such as the position with the longest number of moves needed to win. Not all have been verifiable, because Syzygy counts the time needed to make concrete progress in the form of a capture or pawn advance rather than the time to give checkmate. What I don’t know—and maybe now won’t know—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has Syzygy been used to verify every win/draw/loss (WDL) verdict computed by Lomonosov, and vice-versa? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Doing so would require cross-checking many trillions of chess positions. Of course, we should expect that the algorithms used to produce these tables have been verified as completely correct. </p>
<p>
That is worth saying again: The chess algorithms have been verified in themselves. This is not a case of a shock I had before Christmas, when a module in my own chess software threw an error for the first time since I wrote it in 2014, having worked perfectly on over 100 million moves in several million games. The function in question records not only the exact source and destination squares of a move but also the minimum information required by short-form notation systems to disambiguate it from other pieces that could move to the square. There was one game where the players horsed around until one side had 5 queens that could all move to the same square, and that was 1 more than my scheme had presumed possible. My code is thus not-quite correct.</p>
<p>
But even analytical correctness fails in cases of hardware error. A cosmic ray temporarily <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/subatomic-particles-cosmic-rays-computers-change-elections-planes-autopilot-a7584616.html">changed</a> the outcome of an election in Belgium. Fortunately, the systems have cross-checks to catch these events. When the subject is <em>mathematical truths</em>, however, how are we checking? On what basis can we be satisfied by such checks?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Emergence </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Despite our Platonist convictions, as practitioners of mathematics we experience its truths as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent</a>. By “emergent” we mean more than saying theorems are unknown until the point in time where they are clearly proved. <em>Pace</em> our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/04/21/pnp-proofs/">claimers</a>, P versus NP has not been proved either way, and we live in a world where even those who strongly believe <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> will aver it is unknown. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/">covered</a> this recently.</p>
<p>
Our sense of <em>emergent</em> meets at least the “weak” criterion enunciated <a href="http://consc.net/papers/emergence.pdf">here</a> by David Chalmers, a sense of unexpectedness <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/10/29/guessing-conjectures/">that</a> we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/04/13/even-great-mathematicians-guess-wrong/">have</a> often <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/06/19/guessing-the-truth/">discussed</a> going <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/09/27/surprises-in-mathematics-and-theory/">back</a> to the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/19/we-all-guessed-wrong/">beginning</a> of the blog. </p>
<p>
Chalmers’s strong sense, when applied to mathematics, leads into independence results of the kind effected by Kurt Gödel, this blog’s eponym. We realize that none of our 1,000+ posts has yet attempted a deep appraisal of what these independence results <em>mean</em>. We will not do so now because we are questioning something more basic: Discussion of Gödelian independence is with regard to a truth value that is presumed to exist. What if it doesn’t exist?</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/provemewrong/" rel="attachment wp-att-19741"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19741" height="218" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ProveMeWrong.jpg?resize=277%2C218&amp;ssl=1" width="277"/></a></p>
<p>
We are not just catching the tension of Platonism with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a> and related paths to asking, what is science? We are asking whether reality aligns with the position that we already feel is best for <em>practice</em>. </p>
<p>
“Emergent Mathematics” is a teaching movement that, in the words of one prominent <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23434871">paper</a>, gets away from mathematics courses that “are focused on completed results that often hide the messiness and complication that led to their production.” In trying to explain much data showing that the most experienced mathematicians are not the most accomplished teachers, the paper’s two authors seem to identify the former with the position of putting emphasis on completed results. They seek the best attitude for childhood <em>learning</em> of mathematics, and believe it to be orthogonal to that of presenting finished mathematics.  But going another 90 degrees around the dial, perhaps their compass needle’s other end points to the best philosophical position for <em>creating</em> mathematics.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I think we would all still agree that the next trillion digits of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> currently exist. The tougher question is whether it is scientifically meaningful to postulate knowledge of them, without knowing them. We may get an opinion on that from a regular friend late Wednesday into Thursday.</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Hi, nerd blog! (This is a post that I wrote a long time ago and then never published. I figured it would be nice to publish it on March 14th.)</p>



<p>Today, we’re interested in the Gaussian integral </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[f(C) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-Cx^2} {\rm d} x\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-096cdf537e620c218a57694e9aca2bf4_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="170"/></p> for <img alt="C &gt; 0" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-87ddd944257c5bf57009a80226e5c414_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="47"/>. This integral of course has lots of very serious practical applications, as it arises naturally in the study of the Gaussian/normal distribution. But, more importantly, it’s a lot of fun to play with and is simply beautiful. We’ll see a bit about what it makes it so pretty below. We start by simply trying to figure out the value of this thing, which isn’t super easy.<p/>



<p>By a change of variables, we immediately see that <img alt="f(C)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-051ceeda9119a5fc9be66053f9dd40a3_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="37"/> is proportional to <img alt="1/\sqrt{C}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="21" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-94fd71739495e33d6c86fe0b70cdbcf1_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/>. But, what is the constant of proportionality? It’s actually nicer to ask a slightly different question: what is the unique value of <img alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f34f74d98915e33f37a086f8cbfb996a_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/> such that <img alt="f(C) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="18" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a4141e7514a6f611842effecf51c1199_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="70"/>. A quick numerical computation shows that <img alt="f(3.14159) \approx 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-24b068172655b4e41a85afb20c734882_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="114"/>. E.g., here’s some Mathematica code to find this value:<br/><img alt="" class="wp-image-552" height="110" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-27-at-3.25.48-PM.png" style="width: 400px;" width="1066"/>.</p>



<p>This constant <img alt="C \approx 3.14159" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="13" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3351e9436eef51bd249c328e212df088_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="97"/> is so important for this blog post that it is worth giving it a name. So, I looked through the Greek alphabet for a nice letter that doesn’t get used much and chose the obscure lowercase letter <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>—spelled <em>pi</em> in English, and pronounced like “pie”. In other words, by definition <img alt="f(\pi) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-64cecd17d70571e9f6e5d0e701cda533_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="67"/>. (If this implicit definition bothers you, we can equivalently just define <img alt="\pi := f(1)^{2}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="20" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fd24a2e8eab1e07787b7429db8502015_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="80"/>. But, I find the implicit definition to be more elegant.)</p>



<p>So, we have this brand new mysterious constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>. What should we do with it? It is of course natural to try to find different expressions for it (though our integral expression can already be used to compute it to quite high precision). A first idea is to apply the change of variables <img alt="u = \pi x^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fcb6cf4e246632c794949355411b046b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="62"/> to obtain </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[1 = 2\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x^2}{\rm d} x = \pi^{-1/2} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-u}/u^{1/2} {\rm d} u\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f10d9cf7ba99c79b8b6410cfbffbcb0d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="343"/></p> So, <p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\pi =\Big( \int_0^\infty e^{-u}/u^{1/2} {\rm d} u\Big)^2\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a70346615d75d7bd8aad3e871d66f99c_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="199"/></p> which you might recognize as the square of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gamma function</a> evaluated at <img alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>, i.e., <img alt="\pi = \Gamma(1/2)^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="20" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f89e7a589afd5b47baf442a3c38013ee_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="93"/>. (Recalling that <img alt="\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-59278ef14f8421f91a9c38456784aa70_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="118"/> for integer <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>, one might interpret this as saying that <img alt="\sqrt{\pi}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="18" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a0df3b7b3c88b80bd1b77220c28fb5ec_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/> is “the factorial of <img alt="-1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b5205e45813b524be8d323d4b2d0fade_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="39"/>.”) <p/>



<p>This mysterious identity will play a key role later. We could, of course, find other identities involving this new constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>. But, I thought instead I’d jump ahead to a rather obscure fact about the relationship between <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> and a circle.</p>



<h2>Our constant’s relationship with circles</h2>



<p>In my opinion, the Gaussian distribution is far more interesting in dimensions larger than one. In particular, consider the distribution on <img alt="\mathbb{R}^n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f9868b4451c5811a288f7fdd10be5558_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="21"/> given by the probability density function </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 24px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = e^{-\pi \|\mathbf{x}\|^2}\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-cbeee2e0bc6e4a6f5288818cb4aa2a7a_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="129"/></p> Notice that <p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}e^{-\pi \|\mathbf{x}\|^2} {\rm d} \mathbf{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x_1^2 -\cdots - \pi x_n^2} {\rm d}x_1 \ldots {\rm d} x_n = 1\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8c88f8ef8350b5bf5e3924147dbed5de_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="457"/></p> so that this is in fact a distribution. <p/>



<p>In fact, up to scaling, this distribution is the <em>unique</em> continuous radial product distribution—i.e., the unique distribution such that <img alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}]" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="18" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-17a91f072153c1ba54d02a280dccc979_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="38"/> can be written both as a function only of the norm of <img alt="\mathbf{x}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bcda923e732ff6e429d93d0fa7ea8a47_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>, <img alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = f^*(\|\mathbf{x}\|)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2c1674e9adcb304d86d51e6e3e89bd93_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="124"/> for some continuous function <img alt="f^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="16" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d1bc0c1e9f63254ef68d09d8ea3e316d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="17"/>, <em>and</em> as a product of functions of its coordinates, <img alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = f_1(x_1)\cdots f_n(x_n)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-724a32e8712eb42c68f40510a4461d33_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="188"/>. This makes the Gaussian a uniquely powerful tool for reducing complicated multi-dimensional problems to one-dimensional problems. </p>



<p>For example, suppose that for some strange reason we wish to know the circumference of a circle with radius one. (If we were less civilized mathematicians, we might instead set the diameter to be equal to <img alt="1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="13" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4868771cbc422b5818f85500909ce433_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="7"/>, so that the radius would be <img alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>.) We can try to write this as some kind of path integral or something—and suffer quite a bit in the process—or we can use the following beautiful trick. We can write<br/></p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[1 = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} e^{-\pi \|x\|^2} {\rm d} x = \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} \sigma_r {\rm d} r= \sigma_1 \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r {\rm d} r\;,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7d71e3575dad757294955cdf449254fa_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="430"/></p><br/>where <img alt="\sigma_r" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="11" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-192e8dc0de46182a65dec93ebf8b5081_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> is the circumference of a circle of with radius <img alt="r" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c409433a9e2dfcdb83360a974d243f18_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="8"/>. (The <em>only</em> facts that we have used here are our definition of <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> together with the fact that <img alt="\sigma_r = r \sigma_1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="11" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c8ca93d60deca29a9a89487ef2eddf50_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="66"/>.) Fortunately, the last integral is easy to compute as <br/><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r {\rm d} r = \frac{1}{2\pi} \cdot \int_0^\infty e^{-u} {\rm d} u = \frac{1}{2\pi} \;.\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f7b0b0433407f63b0c9f6682c331ab63_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="303"/></p> Rearranging, we see that <img alt="\sigma_1 = 2\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bceb0469014bc513c98176ca8e9baf1d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="61"/>!<p/>



<p>So, surprisingly, our mysterious constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> is actually intimately related with the circumference of a circle. (If we were less civilized mathematicians, we might even have simply defined <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> to be the circumference of a circle with radius <img alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>.)</p>



<h2>What’s so special about two dimensions? Surface area of n-spheres.</h2>



<p>But, why stop in dimension <img alt="2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e584dd0bab4e6c8efc164939c28db757_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="8"/>? This same <em>one neat trick</em> is just as useful in higher dimensions. E.g., what is the surface area <img alt="\sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e14b74f2c92c5d34a31da4576bfaecc9_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/> of a unit sphere in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> dimensions? (Conventionally, we write the <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>-sphere as <img alt="S^{n-1}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8897f8b728befe1f7421e387094e6fd4_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="37"/> because it as an <img alt="(n-1)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8c10e83257454bc711811cc71f964a7e_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="53"/>-dimensional object that happens to be embedded in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>-dimensional space. This is why I write <img alt="\sigma^{(n-1)}_1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1529a8cd27bcb6dcd64708282b0f0f0f_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/> for its surface area.) Well, we have </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 41px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[1 = \int_{-\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-\pi \|x\|^2} {\rm d} x = \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} \sigma^{(n-1)}_r {\rm d} r= \sigma^{(n-1)}_1 \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="41" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f260e2a2d6410051fb74cc87df3c7792_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="531"/></p> (Again, the only property that I have used here is that <img alt="\sigma_r^{(n-1)} = r^{n-1} \sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b61ebafad59fad72671514841700ebab_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="153"/>.) This integral is a bit less pretty, but using the same approach, we see that  <p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 42px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r = \frac{1}{2\pi^{n/2}} \cdot \int_0^{\infty} e^{-u} u^{n/2-1} {\rm d} u = \frac{\Gamma(n/2)}{2\pi^{n/2}}\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="42" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-65c828363c086f1b820b730be79a4c39_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="437"/></p> where the last step is literally just plugging in the definition of the Gamma function. Rearranging, we see that the surface area of the unit sphere in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> dimensions is exactly <img alt="\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="30" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-50d143fa8519caff967068ce2d9de43f_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="42"/>.<p/>



<p>If the Gamma function intimidates you, that’s fine. (It certainly intimidates me.) We can go a bit further by remembering that for integers <img alt="m" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6b41df788161942c6f98604d37de8098_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="15"/>, <img alt="\Gamma(m) = (m-1)!" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d226e3a5659b079c31cbf51beb7d6f69_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="128"/>, while <img alt="\Gamma(m+1/2) = \sqrt{\pi}(2m)!/(4^m m!)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5d2b39f9e1062dcc5fa00ec58d82eb91_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="246"/>. (Both of these identities follow from the relation <img alt="\Gamma(x) = (x-1) \Gamma(x-1)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fb2599738079fdbd25e5b92aa6f75617_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="178"/>, which follows from integration by parts, together with the values <img alt="\Gamma(1) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-53c41acb4ea9695fbe3fbed4d494e73a_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="65"/> and <img alt="\Gamma(1/2) = \sqrt{\pi}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="19" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-119c76244632be47b3cddb44bcce032b_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="101"/>.) </p>



<p>Then, we see that the surface area of the unit sphere in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> dimensions is </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 55px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[\sigma_1^{(n-1)} = \begin{cases}\pi^{n/2} \cdot \frac{2}{(n/2-1)!} &amp;n\text{ even}\\\pi^{(n-1)/2} \cdot \frac{2^n \cdot ((n-1)/2)!}{(n-1)!} &amp;n\text{ odd}.\end{cases}\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="55" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7093395acfb9701717087f97c5b73145_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="318"/></p> In particular, from this formula, we immediately see the perhaps surprising fact that the surface area of the sphere in <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> dimensions rapidly approaches <img alt="0" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a5e437be25f29374d30f66cd46adf81c_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> as <img alt="n \to \infty" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="10" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-032ad3d6327a419ab33b269b23c31b7c_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="55"/>. (I.e., “<img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>-dimensional unit spheres are tiny.”) We also see the rather strange fact that <img alt="\sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="24" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e14b74f2c92c5d34a31da4576bfaecc9_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="46"/> is a rational multiple of <img alt="\pi^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="17" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-362edd7540e9e43db2e65a0ddc45e684_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/>.<p/>



<p>We can also plug in low values of <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> to see what we get. E.g., I have heard that some people are interested in the case when <img alt="n = 2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a47a3377f14fefc160d10b089a4aab45_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="42"/> and <img alt="n = 3" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8eda9fc1983d40517cca42fa671a0f51_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/>. Plugging in, one sees that the circumference of a circle with radius one is <img alt="2\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5bfa2124624f767670227d1aeab8d85c_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> (which, ok, we already saw before), and that the surface area of a sphere with radius one is <img alt="4\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="12" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a64f86508ea52835b7fd42736282275d_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/>. But, we can easily go farther: the surface area in four dimensions is <img alt="2\pi^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="15" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7249ec3f5fb52ad8207e0f9d873c7a4f_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="27"/>, and in five dimensions, it is <img alt="8\pi^{2}/3" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="20" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5b263bf1209b153f5824b853138f0510_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="45"/>.</p>



<p>And, we can of course find the volume of the unit <img alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/>-ball by computing a simple integral </p><p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 44px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img alt="\[V^{(n)} = \int_0^{1}\sigma_r^{(n)} {\rm} d r = \sigma_1^{(n)} \cdot \int_0^{1} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r = \sigma_1^{(n)}/n \; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" height="44" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-08b8932dcb424209e24a111106e869b2_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="366"/></p><p/>



<p>In short, I think this mysterious constant <img alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" height="8" src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="11"/> is rather nice.

    <title>TR22-039 |  Parallel Repetition For All 3-Player Games Over Binary Alphabet | 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Uma Girish, 

	Justin Holmgren, 

	Wei Zhan, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game, with binary questions and answers and value less than $1$, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to $0$. That is, for every such game, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is at most $n^{-c}$.

Along the way to proving this theorem, we prove two additional parallel repetition theorems for multiplayer (multiprover) games, that may be of independent interest:

$\textbf{Playerwise Connected Games (with any number of players and any Alphabet size):}$ We identify a large class of multiplayer games and prove that for every game with value less than $1$ in that class, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to $0$.

More precisely, our result applies for $\textit{playerwise connected games}$, with any number of players and any alphabet size:
For each player $i$, we define the graph $G_i$, whose vertices are the possible questions for that player and two questions $x,x'$ are connected by an edge if there exists a vector $y$ of questions for all other players, such that both $(x,y)$ and $(x',y)$ are asked by the referee with non-zero probability. We say that the game is $\textit{playerwise connected}$ if for every $i$, the graph $G_i$ is connected.

Our class of playerwise connected games is strictly larger than the class of connected games that was defined in [DHVY17] and for which exponentially fast decay bounds are known [DHVY17]. For playerwise connected games that are not connected, only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96].

$\textbf{Exponential Bounds for the Anti-Correlation Game:}$ In the 3-player $\textit{anti-correlation game}$, two out of three players are given $1$ as input, and the remaining player is given $0$. The two players who were given $1$ must produce different outputs in $\{0,1\}$. We prove that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of that game decays exponentially fast to $0$. That is, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is at most $2^{-cn}$. Only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96].

The 3-player anti-correlation game was studied and motivated in several previous works. In particular, Holmgren and Yang gave it as an example for a 3-player game whose non-signaling value (is smaller than $1$ and yet) does not decrease at all under parallel repetition [HY19].</summary>

    <title>FOCS 2021 Test-of-Time Award winners (and one deserving paper that missed out)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As members of the TCS community will most likely know, FOCS established<a href="https://focs2021.cs.colorado.edu/test-of-time-awards/" target="_blank"> Test-of-Time Awards from its 2021 edition</a> to celebrate contributions published at that conference 30, 20 and 10 years before.

Awards are a scarce resource! My goal with this post is simply to remind our community (and especially its younger members) of a seminal contribution that they might want to read or re-read. <br/></p><p>The paper in question is "<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6860/2019sp/Handouts/EmersonJutla91.pdf" target="_blank">Tree automata, mu-calculus and determinacy</a>" by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/" target="_blank">Allen Emerson</a> and <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-csjutla" target="_blank">Charanjit S. Jutla</a>, which appeared at FOCS 1991. (Emerson shared the 2007 A.M. Turing Award for the invention of model checking and Jutla went on to doing path-breaking work in cryptography.) That paper is absolutely fundamental for the mu-calculus, but also for automata theory, and verification in general. It introduced many ideas and results that became the basis for extensive research. </p><p>As a first contribution, the article introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game" target="_blank">parity games</a> and proved their fundamental properties. The parity condition was a missing link in automata theory on infinite objects. It made the whole theory much simpler than that proposed in earlier work.  Technically, the parity condition is both universal and positional. Universal means that tree automata with parity conditions are as expressive as those with Rabin or Muller conditions. Positional means that in the acceptance game if a player has a winning strategy then she has one depending only on the current position and not on the history of the play so far. This is a huge technical advance for all automata-theoretic constructions and for the analysis of  infinite-duration games. It allows one, for instance,  to avoid the complicated arguments of Gurevich and Harlington in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800070.802177" target="_blank">their seminal STOC 1982 article</a>, which were already a huge simplification of <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1969-141-00/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1.pdf" target="_blank">Rabin's original argument from 1969</a> proving the decidability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic#Decidability_and_complexity_of_satisfiability" target="_blank">monadic second-order theory of the infinite binary tree</a> and much more. In passing, let me remark that Rabin has gone on record saying that "I consider this to be the most difficult research I have ever done." See <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69370-an-interview-with-michael-rabin/fulltext" target="_blank">this interview</a> in CACM. </p><p>The second main contribution of that paper is the discovery of the relation between parity games and the mu-calculus. The authors show how a mu-calculus model-checking problem can be reduced to solving a parity game, and conversely, how the set of winning positions in a parity game can be described by a mu-calculus formula. This result is the birth of the "model-checking via games" approach. It also shows that establishing a winner in parity games is contained both in NP and in co-NP. As a corollary, the model-checking problem is as complex as solving games. It is still not known if the problem is in PTIME. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3055399.3055409" target="_blank">recent advance from STOC'17</a> gives a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm. (See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/parity-games-in-quasipolynomial-time.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for a discussion of that result, which received the STOC 2017 best paper award and was immediately followed up by a flurry of related papers.) </p><p>Finally, the paper also shows how to prove Rabin's complementation lemma, which is the most difficult step in his celebrated aforementioned decidability result, with the help of parity conditions. The proof is radically simpler than previous approaches. The paper puts this contribution most prominently, but actually the conceptual and technical contributions presented later in the paper turned out to be most important for the community. </p><p>Overall, the above-mentioned paper by Emerson and Jutla is a truly seminal contribution that has stood the test of time, has sown the seeds for much research  over the last thirty years (as partly witnessed by the over 1,130 citations it has received so far) and is still stimulating advances at the cutting edge of theoretical computer science that bridge the Volume A-Volume B divide. </p><p>I encourage everyone to read it!</p><p><b>Acknowledgement:</b> I have learnt much of the content of this post from Igor Walukiewicz. The responsibility for any infelicity is mine alone. <br/></p></div>

<p>The Gödel Prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science is sponsored jointly by the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM SIGACT). This award is presented annually, with the presentation taking place alternately at the International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) and the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC). The thirtieth Gödel Prize will be awarded at the forty-ninth International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), which will be hybrid, happening both physically and virtually. The physical meeting will take place in Paris, France, July 4–8 2022.</p>



<p>The Prize is named in honor of Kurt Gödel in recognition of his major contributions to mathematical logic and of his interest, discovered in a letter he wrote to John von Neumann shortly before von Neumann’s death, in what has become the famous “P versus NP” question. The Prize includes an award of USD 5,000.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This month has seen a flurry of activity in sublinear algorithms and a diverse collection of papers have come up, with topics ranging from differentially private sublinear algorithms to local testers for multiplicity codes. Apologies to the readers for the delay in putting this post together!</p>



<p><strong>Almost-Optimal Sublinear-Time Edit Distance in the Low Distance Regime</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08066">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>This paper considers the problem of gap edit distance, i.e., of determining if the edit distance between two strings \(x\) and \(y\) is at most \(k\) or at least \(K\). Their main result is an algorithm that runs in time \(O(n/k + \text{poly}(k))\) and solves the problem for \(K =  k \cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log k})}\). The paper improves upon earlier results of Goldenberg, Krauthgamer and Saha (2019) and Kociumaka and Saha (2020) who solved the problem for \(K = k^2\) with the same asymptotic guarantee on the query complexity. </p>



<p>One of the interesting takeaways from the paper is that the complexity of solving the gap Hamming distance and gap edit distance are similar in the low distance regime. For both, the complexity of solving the \((k, k^{1+o(1)})\)-gap problem is \(n/k^{1 \pm o(1)}\). This needs to be contrasted with the fact that solving \((k, \Omega(n))\)-gap edit distance requires \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) queries as shown by Batu, Ergun, Kilian, Magen and Raskhodnikova (2003), whereas \((k, \Omega(n))\)-gap Hamming distance can be solved in \(O(1)\) time. </p>



<p>These results are incomparable to those obtained by Goldenberg, Kociumaka, Krauthgamer and Saha (which was discussed in our November 2021 post), where they give a nonadaptive algorithm with complexity \(O(n/k^{1.5})\) for \((k, k^2)\)-gap edit distance problem. The algorithm in the present paper is adaptive and works faster for smaller values of \(k\).</p>

<p><strong>Privately Estimating Graph Parameters in Sublinear time</strong> by Jeremiah Blocki, Elena Grigorescu, Tamalika Mukherjee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05776">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>Differentially private approximation algorithms for optimization problems on graphs is a well-studied topic. This paper opens up an exciting research direction by initiating a systematic study of the design of differentially private sublinear-time algorithms. The setting is that graphs are viewed as databases and two graphs are neighboring if they differ in an edge (or a node). An algorithm \(A\) is \(\epsilon\)-differentially private if for every pair of edge-neighboring(or node-neighboring) graphs \(G, G’\) and for every subset \(S\) of outputs, \(\Pr[A(G) \in S] \leq \exp(\epsilon) \cdot \Pr[A(G’) \in S]\).</p>



<p>The paper presents \(\epsilon\)-differentially private sublinear-time algorithms for well-studied problems such as estimating the average degree, the size of a min vertex cover and the size of a maximum matching. These algorithms access the input graphs via <em>neighbor queries</em> and <em>degree queries</em>. </p>



<p>In addition to providing a strong privacy guarantee, their algorithms nearly match the approximation and complexity guarantees of their non-differentially private counterparts. The main idea seems to be the formalization of a sensitivity notion, which they refer to as Global Coupled Sensitivity, and bounding it for the known sublinear-time algorithms for the aforementioned problems. Finally, they add Laplace noise calibrated with this sensitivity value to the output of the algorithms to make them differentially private.  </p>

<p><strong>Testability and Local Certification of Monotone Properties in Minor-closed Classes</strong> by Louis Esperet And Sergey Norin (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00543">arXiv</a>)</p>



<p>One of the major interests in graph property testing is to characterize which properties are testable, i.e, can be \(\epsilon\)-tested with query complexity that depends only on the parameter \(\epsilon\). The question of testability is well-understood in the dense graph model as well as the bounded degree model. This paper concerns itself with testability questions in the general model or the sparse model of graph property testing, where graphs are represented as adjacency lists with no bound on the maximum degree. </p>



<p>The authors prove that every monotone property of<strong> </strong>minor-closed graph classes is testable with one-sided error, where a property is monotone if it is closed under taking subgraphs and a graph class is minor-closed if it is closed under taking minors. A crucial fact to be noted here is that a tester is allowed to make only uniformly random nerighbor queries. </p>



<p>This result is a significant generalization of a 2019 result by Czumaj and Sohler, who proved that for every finite set of graphs \(\mathcal{H}\), every \(\mathcal{H}\)-free property of minor-closed graph classes is testable with one-sided error, where a graph satisfies \(\mathcal{H}\)-freeness if none of its subgraphs belong to \(\mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p>They show an interesting consequence of their results to designing a short local certification scheme for monotone properties of minor-closed graph classes. Roughly speaking, they show the existence of a prover-verifier system for the aforementioned testing problem where proofs of length \(O(\log n)\) are assigned to each vertex and that verifier needs to observe only the proofs assigned to a vertex and its neighbors.<br/></p>



<p><strong>The plane test is a local tester for Multiplicity Codes</strong> by Dan Karliner, Roie Salama, and Amnon Ta-Shma (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/028/">ECCC</a>)</p>



<p>Multiplicity codes are a generalization of Reed-Muller codes and was first studied by Guruswami and Wang (2013) and Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin (2014). The messages here are polynomials of degree \(d\) over \(m\) variables and the codeword corresponding to a polynomial \(p\) is the evaluation of \(p\) and of all of its directional derivatives of order upto \(s\) over all the points in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\), where \(q\) is a prime power. </p>



<p>Even though multiplicity codes are known to be locally decodable, it was open whether they are locally testable. Local testers for Reed Muller codes work by restricting the evaluations to a uniformly random line in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\) and checking whether it corresponds to the evaluations of a degree \(d\) univariate polynomial. The authors first show that such a tester does not work for the case of multiplicity codes when \(d\) is large. They then show that a <em>plane test</em> is a good local tester for multiplicity codes even for larger values of \(d\). Specifically, a plane test checks whether the restriction of a given word, which is purportedly the evaluation of a polynomial of degree \(d\) and of its derivatives, to a uniformly random plane in \(\mathbb{F}_q^m\) is a bivariate multiplicity code of degree \(d\). </p>



<p/>



<p>We conclude the post with a short note from Nader Bshouty and Oded Goldreich on a fundamental characterization result in property testing. </p>



<p><strong>On properties that are non-trivial to test</strong> by Nader H. Bshouty and Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/013/">ECCC</a>)</p>



<p>A property on binary strings is nontrivial if for infinitely many \(n\), the property contains at least one string of length \(n\) and at most \(2^{n – \Omega(n)}\) strings of length \(n\). The note shows that every nontrivial property requires \(\Omega(1/\epsilon)\) queries to \(\epsilon\)-test. </p></div>

    <title>TR22-037 |  Robust Radical Sylvester-Gallai Theorem for Quadratics | 

	Rafael Mendes de Oliveira, 

	Abhibhav Garg, 

	Akash Sengupta</title>
    <summary>We prove a robust generalization of a Sylvester-Gallai type theorem for quadratic polynomials, generalizing the result in [S'20].
More precisely, given a parameter $0 &lt; \delta \leq 1$ and a finite collection $\mathcal{F}$ of irreducible and pairwise independent polynomials of degree at most 2, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is a $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration if for any polynomial $F_i \in \mathcal{F}$, there exist $\delta(|\mathcal{F}| -1)$ polynomials $F_j$ such that $|\mathrm{rad}(F_i, F_j) \cap \mathcal{F}| \geq 3$, that is, the radical of $F_i, F_j$ contains a third polynomial in the set.

In this work, we prove that any $(\delta, 2)$-radical Sylvester-Gallai configuration $\mathcal{F}$ must be of low dimension: that is 
$$\dim \mathrm{span}(\mathcal{F}) = \mathrm{poly}(1/\delta).$$</summary>

    <title>TR22-036 |  Classes of Hard Formulas for QBF Resolution | 

	Agnes Schleitzer, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>To date, we know only a few handcrafted quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) that are hard for central QBF resolution systems such as Q and QU, and only one specific QBF family to separate Q and QU. 

Here we provide a general method to construct hard formulas for Q and  QU. The construction uses simple propositional formulas (e.g. minimally unsatisfiable formulas) in combination with easy QBF gadgets (Sigma_2^b formulas without constant winning strategies). 
This leads to a host of new hard formulas, including new classes of hard random QBFs. 

We further present generic constructions for formulas separating Q and QU, and for separating Q and LDQ.</summary>
