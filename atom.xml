    <title>Fine-grained Meta-Theorems for Vertex Integrity</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1632268800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Lampis:Michael.html">Michael Lampis</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Mitsou:Valia.html">Valia Mitsou</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10333">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Vertex Integrity is a graph measure which sits squarely between two more
well-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently
gained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate
the algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view
of algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order
(MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of
vertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if
$G$ satisfies $\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii)
for MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time
$2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization
arguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and
$2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.
</p>
<p>The complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the
corresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of
exponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and
$2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex
cover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which
lead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence
of our meta-theorems on $k$ is best possible. More precisely, we show that it
is not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time
$2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot
be decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH. Hence, the quadratic
blow-up in the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable and vertex integrity has a
complexity for FO and MSO logic which is truly intermediate between vertex
cover and tree-depth.

    <title>Generalized minimum 0-extension problem and discrete convexity</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1632268800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Martin Dvorak, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kolmogorov:Vladimir.html">Vladimir Kolmogorov</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10203">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Given a fixed finite metric space $(V,\mu)$, the {\em minimum $0$-extension
problem}, denoted as ${\tt 0\mbox{-}Ext}[\mu]$, is equivalent to the following
optimization problem: minimize function of the form $\min\limits_{x\in V^n}
\sum_i f_i(x_i) + \sum_{ij}c_{ij}\mu(x_i,x_j)$ where $c_{ij},c_{vi}$ are given
nonnegative costs and $f_i:V\rightarrow \mathbb R$ are functions given by
$f_i(x_i)=\sum_{v\in V}c_{vi}\mu(x_i,v)$. The computational complexity of ${\tt
0\mbox{-}Ext}[\mu]$ has been recently established by Karzanov and by Hirai: if
metric $\mu$ is {\em orientable modular} then ${\tt 0\mbox{-}Ext}[\mu]$ can be
solved in polynomial time, otherwise ${\tt 0\mbox{-}Ext}[\mu]$ is NP-hard. To
prove the tractability part, Hirai developed a theory of discrete convex
functions on orientable modular graphs generalizing several known classes of
functions in discrete convex analysis, such as $L^\natural$-convex functions.
</p>
<p>We consider a more general version of the problem in which unary functions
$f_i(x_i)$ can additionally have terms of the form $c_{uv;i}\mu(x_i,\{u,v\})$
for $\{u,v\}\in F$, where set $F\subseteq\binom{V}{2}$ is fixed. We extend the
complexity classification above by providing an explicit condition on $(\mu,F)$
for the problem to be tractable. In order to prove the tractability part, we
generalize Hirai's theory and define a larger class of discrete convex
functions. It covers, in particular, another well-known class of functions,
namely submodular functions on an integer lattice.
</p>
<p>Finally, we improve the complexity of Hirai's algorithm for solving ${\tt
0\mbox{-}Ext}$ on orientable modular graphs.

    <title>An Approximation Algorithm for a General Class of Multi-Parametric Optimization Problems</title>

objective value of each solution is an affine function of real-valued
parameters. For many important multi-parametric optimization problems, an
optimal solutions set with minimum cardinality can contain super-polynomially
many solutions. Consequently, any exact algorithm for such problems must output
a super-polynomial number of solutions.
</p>
<p>We propose an approximation algorithm that is applicable to a general class
of multi-parametric optimization problems and outputs a number of solutions
that is bounded polynomially in the instance size and the inverse of the
approximation guarantee. This method lifts approximation algorithms for
non-parametric optimization problems to their parametric formulations,
providing an approximation guarantee that is arbitrarily close to the
approximation guarantee for the non-parametric problem. If the non-parametric
problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time or if an FPTAS is available,
the method yields an FPTAS. We discuss implications to important
multi-parametric combinatorial optimizations problems. Remarkably, we obtain a
$(\frac{3}{2} + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the multi-parametric
metric travelling salesman problem, whereas the non-parametric version is known
to be APX-complete. Furthermore, we show that the cardinality of a minimal size
approximation set is in general not $\ell$-approximable for any natural number
$\ell$.

    <title>Approximating Biobjective Minimization Problems Using General Ordering Cones</title>

biobjective minimization problems with respect to the Pareto cone by solutions
that are (approximately) optimal with respect to larger ordering cones. When
simultaneously considering $\alpha$-approximations for all closed convex
ordering cones of a fixed inner angle $\gamma \in [\frac \pi 2, \pi]$, an
approximation guarantee between $\alpha$ and $2 \alpha$ is achieved, which
depends continuously on $\gamma$. The analysis is best-possible for any inner
angle and it generalizes and unifies the known results that the set of
supported solutions is a 2-approximation and that the efficient set itself is a
1-approximation. Moreover, it is shown that, for maximization problems, no
approximation guarantee is achievable by considering larger ordering cones in
the described fashion, which again generalizes a known result about the set of

bounded by a constant k, QUBO is FP^NP[log]-complete. (3) When coefficients can
only be in the set {1, 0, -1}, QUBO is again FP^NP[log]-complete. With recent
results in quantum annealing able to solve QUBO problems efficiently, our

complexity of the decision version of the QUBO problem with integer
coefficients. We prove that this problem is DP-complete.

intersection graph. A balanced clique-based separator of $G(F)$ is a set $S$
consisting of cliques whose removal partitions $G(F)$ into components of size
at most $\delta n$, for some fixed constant $\delta&lt;1$. The weight of a
clique-based separator is defined as $\sum_{C\in S}\log (|C|+1)$. Recently De
Berg et al. (SICOMP 2020) proved that if $S$ consists of convex fat objects,
then $G(F)$ admits a balanced clique-based separator of weight $O(\sqrt{n})$.
We extend this result in several directions, obtaining the following results.
Map graphs admit a balanced clique-based separator of weight $O(\sqrt{n})$,
which is tight in the worst case. Intersection graphs of pseudo-disks admit a
balanced clique-based separator of weight $O(n^{2/3}\log n)$. If the
pseudo-disks are polygonal and of total complexity $O(n)$ then the weight of
the separator improves to $O(\sqrt{n}\log n)$. Intersection graphs of geodesic
disks inside a simple polygon admit a balanced clique-based separator of weight
$O(n^{2/3}\log n)$. Visibility-restricted unit-disk graphs in a polygonal
domain with $r$ reflex vertices admit a balanced clique-based separator of
weight $O(\sqrt{n}+r\log(n/r))$, which is tight in the worst case. These
results immediately imply sub-exponential algorithms for MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT
SET (and, hence, VERTEX COVER), for FEEDBACK VERTEX SET, and for $q$-COLORING
for constant $q$ in these graph classes.

joint motion of robots to track targets. In this paper, we focus on such target
tracking problems in adversarial environments, where attacks or failures may
deactivate robots' sensors and communications. In contrast to the previous
works that consider no attacks or sensing attacks only, we formalize the first
robust multi-robot tracking framework that accounts for any fixed numbers of
worst-case sensing and communication attacks. To secure against such attacks,
we design the first robust planning algorithm, named Robust Active Target
Tracking (RATT), which approximates the communication attacks to equivalent
sensing attacks and then optimizes against the approximated and original
sensing attacks. We show that RATT provides provable suboptimality bounds on
the tracking quality for any non-decreasing objective function. Our analysis
utilizes the notations of curvature for set functions introduced in
combinatorial optimization. In addition, RATT runs in polynomial time and
terminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for
(non-robust) target tracking. Finally, we evaluate RATT with both qualitative
and quantitative simulations across various scenarios. In the evaluations, RATT
exhibits a tracking quality that is near-optimal and superior to varying
non-robust heuristics. We also demonstrate RATT's superiority and robustness
against varying attack models (e.g., worst-case and bounded rational attacks).

    <title>All Statistical Models Are Wrong. Are Any Useful?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Though I singled out a mask study <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">in the last post</a>, I’ve had a growing discomfort with statistical modeling and significance more generally. Statistical models explicitly describe the probability of outcomes of experiments in terms of specific variables of individuals from a population. Such statistical models bring with them a host of assumptions and powers. But when are they appropriate for deducing significance of the outcomes of experiments? Here, I’ll argue that they are almost never appropriate in most settings, and, moreover, they can result in confidence intervals that rarely contain the correct parameters.</p>

<p>Note that in order to sample from some population, we need not assume that the population is <em>itself</em> random. An experimenter can choose to sample one individual from a larger pool at random even when the pool is a deterministic collection. Similarly, the experimenter can randomly assign each member of the pool to a group for experimentation even when the pool is deterministic. We need not build a statistical model of our population in order to study it experimentally.</p>

<p>But the convention in much scientific practice entangles the randomness used in survey and experiment design with the randomness of the natural world. The dominant convention in experimental sciences is to assert the existence of a probability distribution from which all observations in an experiment are samples. That is, most analyses begin with the assumption that the population is itself a stochastic entity whose statistical properties can be accurately modeled. Such probabilistic modeling is immediately problematic. We are forced to confront the notion of probability itself. What does the probability of an event mean? Is a Bayesian or Frequentist viewpoint more correct? What does it mean to sample a natural process?</p>

<p>My perspective on the pitfalls of probabilistic modeling has been heavily influenced by the writings of David Freedman. Freedman advocates for a pragmatic approach to statistical modeling. “<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf">Probability is just a property of a mathematical model intended to describe some features of the natural world. For the model to be useful, it must be shown to be in good correspondence with the system it describes.</a>” This is the less pithy, but more prescriptive version of Box’s famous and tiresome aphorism “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”</p>

<p>Model building and validation requires deep domain knowledge for a task at hand. One of my favorite models is Ohm’s law, which states that the current that flows across a conductive material is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. Due to thermal noise, the actual model is</p>

\[\small{
  \text{current} = \text{material constant} \times \text{voltage} + \text{noise}}\]

<p>And the noise is Gaussian white noise. This model has been extensively tested and is a foundation of all circuit design. Remarkably, this simple formula describes complex electronic behavior. Physics is full of amazing examples of statistical models that accurately predict the outcome of experiments to a dozen significant figures.</p>

<p>But in biology, medicine, social science, and economics, our models are much less accurate and less grounded in natural laws. Most of the time, models are selected because they are convenient, not because they are plausible, well motivated from phenomenological principles, or even empirically validated. Freedman built a cottage industry around pointing out how poorly motivated many of the common statistical models are.</p>

<p>A particular example called out by Freedman is the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27645896">ubiquitous logistic regression model</a>. Freedman observed that in a variety of randomized control trials, experimenters would “correct” the estimates of their randomized controlled trials by “controlling for fixed effects” with logistic regression. Controlling for fixed effects is pernicious jargon that means “set up a regression problem with all of the variables that one thinks make their effect size look too small, and then solve the regression as an attempt to remove the influence of these variables.” It is most common in observational studies, but many insist it is appropriate in the context of randomized controlled trials as well. This convention of correction persists in the present, and I highlighted similar corrections in my last post. Freedman argues that such corrections are misguided, especially in the context of randomized trials.</p>

<p>To understand the motivation for using logistic in the first place, I need to tell you what an odds ratio is. Experiments are often interested in estimating an odds ratio of particular outcomes. The odds of an outcome is the number of individuals with a positive outcome divided by the number of individuals with a negative outcome. If the odds of winning a lottery are one million to one, that means that for every person that wins, one million people lose.</p>

<p>In the context of randomized experiments, let’s suppose that when given a treatment, M out of N individuals will have a favorable outcome, and without treatment only Q out of N will have a positive outcome Then the odds ratio is simply the ratio of the odds of the outcome with and without treatment</p>

\[\small{
\frac{M}{N-M} \cdot \frac{N-Q}{Q}\,.}\]

<p>When the odds ratio is large, we deem a treatment to be highly effective.</p>

<p>Logistic regression posits that individuals have a vector of features $Z$ that influence the odds of the effectiveness of treatment. Specifically, if $Y$ is the indicator of the desired outcome and $X$ is indicator of treatment, the logistic regression model asserts the log of the odds the outcome is a linear function of the treatment and the selected features. Since the model assumes the population is random, we can write the fraction of individuals with a positive outcome as probability. With this identification, the assumption of logistic regression is</p>

\[\small{
\log  \frac{p(Y=1 | X,Z ) }{ 1-p(Y=1 | X,Z) } = \beta X + \gamma^\top Z + \alpha \,.}\]

<p>This model is convenient if we are interested in odds ratios. In the logistic model, no matter what the covariate $Z$, the odds ratio is</p>

\[\small{
\frac{p(Y=1 | X=1,Z ) } {1-p(Y=1| X=1,Z) }  \cdot \frac{1-p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)}{p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)} = e^\beta\,.}\]

<p>Hence, if we can estimate beta, we can estimate the odds ratio. And if we can estimate the variance of beta, we can compute confidence intervals over our odds ratio estimates.</p>

<p>But all of this assumes that the model is correct! If the logistic model is not correct, then our confidence intervals are meaningless. Or at least, they are not confidence intervals around any true notion of odds ratios.</p>

<p>It’s almost always reasonable to be suspicious of this logistic model. It is first asserting that the odds ratio is a constant for a fixed covariate $Z$. That is, all subjects experience the same proportional effect of treatment. Even less realistically, the model asserts that the outcome is positive for an individual $i$ with treatment value $X_i$ and covariate value $Z_i$ if</p>

\[\small{
  U_i  \leq \alpha + \beta X_i + \gamma^\top Z_i\,,}\]

<p>where $U_i$ is a random variable sampled from the logistic distribution. The model assumes the $U_i$ are independent of the treatment and the covariates, the $U_i$ are independent across all of the individuals, and the $U_i$ have a common logistic distribution. The only thing that differs between treatment and control is the value of the threshold on the left hand side. These are a lot of assumptions, and they are seldom verified or tested in papers where logistic regression is applied.</p>

<p>The question remains: does this matter? Do these modeling assumptions actually affect our inferences about effect size? Freedman provides an elegant argument demonstrating that logistic regression always overestimates the true odds ratio, and sometimes can do so quite poorly. He also shows that simply computing a plugin estimator of the odds ratio with no covariate adjustment at all is consistent in randomized controlled trials. That is, there is no need to adjust for covariates in randomized controlled trials if you want an accurate estimate of the odds ratio. Furthermore, covariate adjustments can lead to significant overestimation of the treatment’s effect size.</p>

<p>Rather than going through Freedman’s theoretical argument, it’s a bit more evocative to give an example. The following is gleaned from a helpful discussion with Joel Middleton. Suppose you sample 10000 children from a larger population where each child in the population has an equal chance of liking and disliking vegetables. We propose a treatment of bribing kids with a cookie to eat their veggies, and randomly assign this treatment to half of the subjects. Left untreated, veggie haters have a 20% probability of finishing their veggies, but veggie lovers have an 80% probability of eating their greens. When bribed with a cookie, veggie haters and veggie lovers have 25% and 85% of eating their vegetables, respectively.</p>

<p>An average child in the study has a probability of 50% of eating their veggies if in control and 55% if in treatment. The log odds ratio is thus</p>

\[\small{
  \log \frac{.55}{1−.55}−\log\frac{.5}{1−.5} \approx 0.2\,.}\]

<p>Now, when you instead run logistic regression, the coefficient of the treatment variable is larger than 0.2. Indeed, <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">when I try this in python</a>, running 1000 synthetic experiments, I find that the median point estimate is 0.32, which is, as promised, larger than the true log odds. Even more worrisome is the 95% confidence interval contains 0.2 only 38% of the time. Clearly, the confidence intervals are not accurate when the model is wrong.</p>

<p>When the true effect size is large, this discrepancy between the logistic regression estimate and the true log odds might not be that big a deal: your error bars are wrong, but the effect size is estimated in the correct direction. But the results of such logistic regression analyzes are regularly quoted as estimates of odds ratios (For example, look at any  observational study of vaccine effectiveness). The precision of these estimates is unfortunately lacking and misleading.</p>

<p>Even if the model <em>was</em> true, the same argument shows that the coefficient of the treatment variable overestimates the log-odds. This is demonstrated in the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">second example in the python notebook</a>. Even when the model is true, the coefficient of the treatment variable is an overestimate of the true log odds. If the model was true, one could at least say they had constructed a reasonable estimate of the change in odds for an individual under treatment. But if the model is wrong, there’s nothing we can say at all other than we have overestimated the effect size and our error bars might not contain the true odds with any certainty.</p>

<p>So what is the remedy here? The thing is, we already know the answer: if we randomized the assignment, we can estimate log odds by counting the number of positive outcomes under treatment and control, and then just plugging these values into the odds ratio. If you do this, you find an estimate whose median is precisely equal to the true log odds. No covariate adjustment is required.</p>

<p>This is merely one example showing why it is critical to decouple the randomness used to probe a system from the randomness inherent in its system itself. Statistical models are not necessary for statistical inference, but randomness itself is amazingly… let’s say… <em>useful</em> for understanding natural phenomena. I will spend the next few blogs reminding myself and you faithful blog readers that proper experiments, machine learning predictions, and statistical summarizations can all be designed without statistical models of populations. Perhaps the mathematical formalizations of randomized algorithms can suggest paths to reform conventional experimental formalism.</p></div>

    <title>Instability of the Betti Sequence for Persistent Homology and a Stabilized Version of the Betti Sequence</title>

proved very useful in a variety of applications. The main persistence tool from
TDA is persistent homology in which data structure is examined at many scales.
Representations of persistent homology include persistence barcodes and
persistence diagrams, both of which are not straightforward to reconcile with
traditional machine learning algorithms as they are sets of intervals or
multisets. The problem of faithfully representing barcodes and persistent
diagrams has been pursued along two main avenues: kernel methods and
vectorizations. One vectorization is the Betti sequence, or Betti curve,
derived from the persistence barcode. While the Betti sequence has been used in
classification problems in various applications, to our knowledge, the
stability of the sequence has never before been discussed. In this paper we
show that the Betti sequence is unstable under the 1-Wasserstein metric with
regards to small perturbations in the barcode from which it is calculated. In
addition, we propose a novel stabilized version of the Betti sequence based on
the Gaussian smoothing seen in the Stable Persistence Bag of Words for
persistent homology. We then introduce the normalized cumulative Betti sequence
and provide numerical examples that support the main statement of the paper.

problem defined as follows: Given a finite set $V$, a budget $B$ and a
$k$-submodular function $f: (k+1)^V \mapsto \mathbb{R}$, the problem asks to
find a solution $\mathbf{s}=(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_k)$, each element $e \in V$
has a cost $c_i(e)$ to be put into $i$-th set $S_i$, with the total cost of
$\mathbf{s}$ does not exceed $B$ so that $f(\mathbf{s})$ is maximized. We
propose several streaming algorithms that provide approximation guarantees for
the problem. In particular, in the case of each element $e$ has the same cost
for all $i$-th sets, we propose a deterministic streaming algorithm which
provides an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{4}-\epsilon$ when $f$ is monotone
and $\frac{1}{5}-\epsilon$ when $f$ is non-monotone. For the general case, we
propose a random streaming algorithm that provides an approximation ratio of
$\min\{\frac{\alpha}{2}, \frac{(1-\alpha)k}{(1+\beta)k-\beta} \}-\epsilon$ when
$f$ is monotone and $\min\{\frac{\alpha}{2},

via an online adversarial erasure oracle. After answering each query to the
input object, such an oracle can erase $t$ input values. Our goal is to
understand the complexity of basic computational tasks in extremely adversarial
situations, where the algorithm's access to data is blocked during the

on property testing in the model with online erasures. We show that two
fundamental properties of functions, linearity and quadraticity, can be tested
for constant $t$ with asymptotically the same complexity as in the standard
property testing model. For linearity testing, we prove tight bounds in terms
of $t$, showing that the query complexity is $\Theta(\log t)$. In contrast to
linearity and quadraticity, some other properties, including sortedness and the
Lipschitz property of sequences, cannot be tested at all, even for $t=1$. Our
investigation leads to a deeper understanding of the structure of violations of

    <title>Information Theoretic HotStuff (IT-HS): Part One</title>
    <summary>This post is the first of two on Information Theoretic HotStuff (IT-HS). Information Theoretic HotStuff is a Byzantine Consensus protocol in the partially synchronous model. It replaces all of HotStuff’s cryptographic signatures with simple information theoretic message passing techniques over authenticated channels. Information theoretic protocols are often easy to reason...</summary>

    <title>The New Jeopardy Champion is a `A CS grad student from a school in New Haven'</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> As of Sept 17, Matt Amodio has won 23 straight games in a row on Jeopardy and won over $800,000 in regular play. The following website is not quite up to date, but its close: <a href="https://www.jeopardy.com/contestant-zone/hall-of-fame">here</a>. Of course, that website will change. </p><p>1) They refer to him as <i>A CS grad student from a school in New Haven</i>. My first thought was <i>probably</i> <i>Yale, but whatever it is, they should just say it. </i>I looked it up and it is Yale. So why aren't they just saying <i>A CS grad student from Yale?  </i>If someone works for <i>an airline company</i> they do not tell you which airline- prob to avoid giving that airline free publicity. But I would think a school is different. And I remember (perhaps incorrectly) that they DO say what school someone teaches at or is a student at. </p><p>(ADDED LATER: a colleague of mine who was on Jeop (he lost his only game) tells me that YES, you re NOT ALLOWED to say the company you work for. He was from <i>Riverdale Park, MD </i>which might make some people think there is a <i>Univ of MD at Riverdale Park</i> . He also told me that when he was on the show the following happened:  <i>On One of the shows of the game before I  played, Alex was curious which LA area restaurant somebody worked at (to see if he had eaten there--- he hadn't), and sure enough, they edited the name of the restaurant out.)</i></p><p>2) Longest streak: Ken Jennings: 74. Also most money in reg play: roughly 2.5 Mill</p><p>    2nd longest: James Holzhauer: 32. Also  2nd most money in reg play: roughly 2.4 Mill</p><p>    3rd longest: Matt Amodio: 23. Also  3rd most money in reg play: roughly 0.8 Mill</p><p>3) I do not think Matt will move into second place on any of these categories. He bets big on the daily doubles and it has paid off but either (a) he will miss and it will lead to a loss, or (b) he will just not get the daily double and be against a very good opponent. Item (b) happened to James H- and the person who beat him did have a good enough win streak to be in the Tournament of Champions. I wonder if they try to stop a long streak by picking really good opponents. I also wonder if they can even tell who will be a really good opponent. </p><p>4) Matt has played in front of (or will- counting tomorrow) six hosts: Robin Roberts, LeVar Burton, David Faber, Joe Buck, Mike Richards, and Mayim Bialik. Six is a record which I suspect won't be broken, except possibly by Matt himself if he also plays in front of Ken Jennings (the rest of 2021 will be Mayim B and Ken J as hosts, see <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/16/1037930905/mayim-bialik-ken-jennings-host-jeopardy">here</a>.</p><p>5) Matt works in AI. When he gets his PhD and is on the job market will his Jeopardy success help him, hurt him, or neither?  </p><p>6) James H and Matt A are both very good at calculating how much to bet. I think Ken J is not quite as good but still good. Generally the players on Jeop are not that good at that aspect. I had the chance to ask some a champions (not any of those three) why that was and she said that most people get into because of the trivia-aspect, not the betting aspect. I wonder if just as players now study lots of facts to prep, they will also learn how to bet better. </p><p>7) Ken J as host is a bit odd in that, if he says (as Alex T did sometimes) <i>That category looks hard </i>I won't believe him. I also have this suspicion that when a contestant gets something wrong Ken might be thinking <i>what a moron; </i>however, (a) by all accounts Ken is a nice guy, and (b)  I might be projecting. </p></div>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Greetings from NYC everybody! </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter Shor</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterShor1/status/1199299777743204354">pioneered</a> (Nov 26, 2019) quantum poetry for the skeptics over Twitter. (We will come shortly to Peter’s poem.) On November and December 2019, there were many very nice contributions all over social media by Renan Gross, John Dowling, Nidit Nanda, ⟨dl|yonge|mallo⟩, Alfred Marcel Bruckstein, Kenneth Regan, Ehud Friedgut, Avi Wigderson, and others. <strong>Keep the quantum poems coming!</strong> Of course, the poems should be taken with humor. Let me start with a beautiful poem by Renan Gross and small a taste of poems from 2020-2021. Stay tuned for a post on classic quantum poems since the late 90’s, and for a post with the latest 2020/2021 vintage.</p>
<h2>Renan Gross</h2>
<p>My favorite poem is by Renan Gross.</p>
<p>Renan: “I can’t quite say I’m a skeptic, but I do like to play with words. Here is my contribution:”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Bit by bit as if on cue,</em><br/>
<em>The beat of qubits slowly grew</em><br/>
<em>To fit the neverending queue</em><br/>
<em>Of them who bit more they could chew.</em><br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Yet there is hope.</em></span></p>
<p><em>For quantum queries queer with wonder</em><br/>
<em>Quibbling quarrels break asunder,</em><br/>
<em>Quenching squabbles, quitting squander –</em><br/>
<em>Quite quaint quest for us to ponder!</em><br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Shall we not try?</em></span></p>
<h2/>
</blockquote>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">G</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span><span style="color: #ffcc00;">o</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">g</span><span style="color: #339966;">l</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e</span></strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">‘s (impressive) Hebrew translate for the first stanza of Renan’s poem</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">,טיפה אחר טיפה כאילו נמצא בתור<br/>
פעימות הקוויטיטים גדלו לאט<br/>
כדי להתאים לתור שלא נגמר<br/>
.מתוכם שנשכו יותר (מש)הם יכלו ללעוס<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff;">.עם זאת יש תקווה</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is Renan Gross Hebrew poem “לבחורה שיושבת מלפני בקומבינטוריקה” (“<a href="https://youtu.be/BXSGXe4qFNE">A la fille qui est assise devant moi en combinatoires</a>“: from a grand poetry slam festival.)</p>
<h2>Taste of 2020/2021 poems</h2>
<h3>asdf (<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5371#comment-1882150">source</a>, 2021) (try singing it in your heart)</h3>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Detecting interference, </em></span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Cryogenics for maintaining coherence,</em></span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Birds tweeting from the <strong>Sycamore</strong> tree,</em></span><br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>Dream of solving BQP.</em></span></p></blockquote>

<h2>Six-word stories</h2>
<h3>Ehud Friedgut</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>For sale: <span class="il">quantum</span> computer. Never used.</em></span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3>Another 6-word story (mine) with a rhyme (of some sort)</h3>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h3><em>If for supremacy <strong><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">G</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span><span style="color: #ffcc00;">o</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">g</span><span style="color: #339966;">l</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e</span></strong></strong> chooses to cut corners </em><br/>
<em>We are all in deep shit</em></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>(Great rhyme, isn’t it)</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">And now, ladies and gentlemen</span></p>
<h2>Shor’s pioneering poem</h2>
<p>This wave of poems for quantum computers skeptics was <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterShor1/status/1199299777743204354">pioneered</a> by Peter Shor.</p>
<h3>Peter’s introduction to his poem</h3>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;">With the Google quantum supremacy paper, the claims that quantum computers can’t possibly work keep on coming. It is becoming clear that reasoned arguments will not stop them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I don’t think illogical poetry is going to work, either. But it’s fun to write</span></p></blockquote>
<h3>Peter Shor</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">A Poem for Quantum Computing Skeptics</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Quantum computers may at first sight seem</em><br/>
<em>To be impossible. How dare we dream</em><br/>
<em>Of solving problems that else would take more time</em><br/>
<em>Than has passed since the cosmos’s Big Bang!</em></p>
<p><em>But is there any reason to believe</em><br/>
<em>The universe computes the way we do?</em><br/>
<em>Nature is profligate with galaxies.</em><br/>
<em>Why shouldn’t her extravagance hold true</em><br/>
<em>For other things? Why mightn’t she achieve</em><br/>
<em>Prodigious feats of computation, too?</em></p></blockquote>
<h3>My short response</h3>
<blockquote>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Understanding nature and ourselves is a worthy dream</em></span><br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Requiring no interaction with the supreme</em></span></h3>
</blockquote>
<h3>My long response</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993366;">A poem for supreme-power dreamers of the good kind</span></h3>
<blockquote><p><em>Nature’s prodigious feats of computation enable us to dream</em><br/>
<em>Dreams of  a supreme power that watch us and care </em><br/>
<em>Dreams of a supreme morality and a supreme kind of justice</em><br/>
<em>Dreams of God and Heaven</em></p>
<p><em>Dreams of supreme kind of computation,<br/>
Of solving problems that else would take more time<br/>
Than has passed since the cosmos’s Big Bang!</em><br/>
<em>Dreams of amazing shortcuts in our difficult slow quest<br/>
For understanding and meaning</em></p>
<p><em>Dreams that give us solace and hope<br/>
Don’t let those transform into deception, hate, and malice. </em><br/>
<span style="color: #993366;"><em>Beware of turning into a supremacy dreamer of the bad kind.</em></span></p></blockquote>

<h2>David Yonge-Mallo</h2>
<p>Peter Shor issued a challenge to the quantum computing community to write some poems. Below is my contribution.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Claimed a skeptic named Gil</em><br/>
<em>“Quantum computers can never be built!”</em><br/>
<em>So we showed him a Sycamore<span class="text_exposed_show"><br/>
But that just caused him to bicker more<br/>
“That device is too noisy still!”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<blockquote><p><em>Despite assurances evidential</em><br/>
<em>Some disbelieved quantum’s potential</em><br/>
<em>If to doubt you’re inclined</em><br/>
<em>Please do keep in mind</em><br/>
<em>Neven’s law is doubly exponential</em></p>
<p><em>There once were some Googlers quantum</em><br/>
<em>Who made some qubits to flaunt them</em><br/>
<em>But their paper got leaked</em><br/>
<em>And rival IBM peeked</em><br/>
<em>And wrote a blog post to taunt them</em></p>
<p><em>Skeptics say and doubters preach</em><br/>
<em>Quantum computing is out of reach</em><br/>
<em>But I know some nice folks</em><br/>
<em>Who’ll convince you it’s no hoax</em><br/>
<em>If you ever visit Venice Beach</em></p>
<p><em>Why don’t you try quantum annealing?</em><br/>
<em>The promised speedups are quite appealing</em><br/>
<em>But you’ve got to suppress those terrors</em><br/>
<em>The Hamiltonian control errors</em><br/>
<em>Or your speedups will hit a ceiling</em></p>
<p><em>I’m paying a huge electrical bill</em><br/>
<em>To keep atoms at near zero chill</em><br/>
<em>In a giant fridge with no door</em><br/>
<em>And what is it all for?</em><br/>
<em>I just want to impress John Preskill</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft bet on fermions Majorana</em><br/>
<em>Cuz it sounds cool and they wanna</em><br/>
<em>But their critics sigh:</em><br/>
<em>“Their hopes are too high</em><br/>
<em>They might as well smoke—”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Wait, I’m stumped, what rhymes with “Majorana” and can be smoked?</p>
</div>
<p><em>(GK: I suppose that David refers to “cucumber”.)</em></p>
<h2>My Anthem for the term HQCA</h2>
<p>There is an interesting debate about the term “quantum supremacy.” I always did not like the term because of its connotations and also because supremacy refers to a large advantage over a large spectrum and here we are talking about a huge advantage for specific purposes. Since I don’t expect it to be demonstrated, the name will serve some educational purpose regarding other sort of supremacy. Anyway, I wanted to use my large influence on the QC community to propose the term HQCA (“Huge Quantum Computational Advantage”).</p>
<p>Here is a song in support of HQCA.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I said young friend, pick yourself from the ground</em><br/>
<em>I said, young friend, ’cause you’re in a new town</em><br/>
<em>There’s no need to be unhappy.</em></p>
<p><em>Young friend, there’s now a computer for you.</em><br/>
<em>I said, young friend, when you’re short on CPU.</em><br/>
<em>You can use it, and I’m sure you will find</em><br/>
<em>Many ways to have a good time.</em></p>
<p><em>Its fun to have the H-Q-C-A</em><br/>
<em>Its even fun to break the R–S-A</em></p>
<p><em>With entanglement at will, you can compute a quantum field </em><br/>
<em>You can do chemistry as much as you feel</em></p>
<p><em>Its fun to have the H-Q-C-A</em><br/>
<em>From NISQ up all the way</em></p>
<p><em>You can factor huge numbers, you can build a boson-sampler</em><br/>
<em>You can defeat each and every scrambler</em></p>
<p><em>Young friend, are you listening to me?</em><br/>
<em>I said, young friend, what do you want to be?</em><br/>
<em>Never mind Gil, you can make your dreams real.…</em><br/>
<em>But you got to know this one thing</em><br/>
<em>NP-hard problems HQCA doesn’t compute by itself</em><br/>
<em>I said, young friend, put your SAT back on the shelf</em><br/>
<em>And just go there, to the H-Q-C-A</em><br/>
<em>I’m sure they can help you today</em></p></blockquote>
<p>“Young friend” was chosen for the sake of inclusiveness and diversity.</p>

<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is a Mathematician </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is of course a co-author of this blog. We try to cover computer science and mathematics, but we are open to other areas. Ken started his career in Mathematics; he obtained a PhD in math from Oxford University in 1986. It was under Dominic Welsh and was tilted: <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. Welsh’s family tree is <a href="https://users.monash.edu.au/~davidwo/files/Welsh-FamilyTree.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is a Programmer </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is of course famous for being one of the world’s top chess cheating detectors. Recall to cheat at chess is to use a computer program to make your moves in a game against a human opponent. This is strictly illegal. </p>
<p>
Ken was featured on the cover in <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/personal/JuneCLarticleKWR.pdf">chess review</a>. His work gets critic review <a href="https://kar.kent.ac.uk/44719/">here</a> by David Barnes and Julio Hernandez-Castro in the 2015 article <i>On the limits of engine analysis for cheating detection in chess</i> in the journal Computers and Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken is Unique </b></p>
<p/><p>
Ken is special in many ways. He is smart, he is a wonderful partner, and he is a great friend. I would claim that he is one of the few people that have the following three properties:</p>
<ol>
<li> He is an international master in chess of rating <img alt="{2372}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2372%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>;
</li><li> He is a strong researcher in complexity theory;
</li><li> He is a terrific programmer.
</li></ol>
<p>
The last I would claim is pretty remarkable. There are many strong chess players, there are many of us working in complexity theory. But few have written as much production quality code as Ken has. For his work on chess cheating he has had to write thousands of lines of code. This code must run fast, and be correct. The latter, correctness, is really important. This since his work on detecting cheating has led players to be suspended from chess for years. It also has helped protect players who did not cheat, even though many thought they had. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Again I wish him a wonderful unbirthday day.</p>

<p/>



<h2>Breakthroughs — Locally Testable Codes with Constant Rate, Distance, and Locality</h2>



<p>Oct 6, 2021 10:00 am – 11:00 am </p>



<h3/>



<p>Speaker: </p>



<p><a href="https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~dinuri/">Irit Dinur</a> (Weizmann Institute of Science) </p>



<p>A locally testable code (LTC) is an error-correcting code together with a property tester. The tester reads a few random bits in the received word and decides if the word is in the code. </p>



<p>LTCs were initially studied as essential components of PCPs, and since then the topic has evolved on its own. High rate LTCs could be useful in practice: before attempting to decode a received word, one can save time by first quickly testing if it is close to the code. </p>



<p>An outstanding open question has been whether there exist LTCs  that are “good” in the coding theory sense of having both constant relative distance and rate, and at the same time testable with a <em><strong>constant</strong></em> number of queries.</p>



<p>In this talk, Irit Dinur will describe a construction of such codes based on a new object which she and her collaborators call Square Cayley Complex. </p>



<p>Joint work with Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alex Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This Erev Yom Kippur, I wish to repent for not putting enough quantum computing content on this blog.  Of course, repentance is meaningless unless accompanied by genuine reform.  That being the case, please enjoy the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnLmGfNKCLU">YouTube video of my ACM TechTalk from last week about quantum supremacy</a>—although, as you’ll see if you watch the thing, I oscillate between quantum supremacy and other terms like “quantum advantage” and even “quantum supremadvantage.”  This represents the first time ever that I got pushback about a talk before I’d delivered it for political reasons—the social-justice people, it turns out, are <em>actually serious</em> about wanting to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">ban the term “quantum supremacy”</a>—but my desire to point out all the difficulties with their proposal competed with my desire not to let that issue overshadow my talk.</p>



<p>And there’s plenty to talk about!  While regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will have already heard (or read) most of what I say, I make some new comments, including about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03494">new paper from last week</a>, the night before my talk (!), by the USTC group in China, where they report a quantum supremacy experiment based on random circuit sampling with a superconducting chip, this time with a record-setting 60 qubits and 24 layers of gates.  On the other hand, I also stress how increasing the circuit fidelity has become a <em>much</em> more urgent issue than further increasing the number of qubits (or in the case of BosonSampling, the number of photons), if our goal is for these experiments to remain a couple steps ahead of classical spoofing algorithms.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy my lovingly handcrafted visuals.  Over the course of this pandemic, I’ve become a full convert to writing out my talks with a stylus pen rather than PowerPointing them—not only is it faster for me, not only does it allow for continuous scrolling rather than arbitrary divisions into slides, but it enforces simplicity and concision in ways they <em>should</em> be enforced.</p>



<p>While there was only time for me to field a few questions at the end of the talk, I later supplied <a href="https://on.acm.org/t/quantum-computational-supremacy/2106/2?u=acm-learning">written answers to 52 questions (!!) that I hadn’t gotten to</a>.  If <em>you</em> have a question, please check to see if it’s already there, and otherwise ask away in the comments!</p>



<p>Thanks so much to Yan Timanovsky for inviting and organizing this talk, and to whurley for hosting it.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Way back in 2005, I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/qchallenge.html">Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory</a>, on at least half of which I’d say there’s been dramatic progress in the 16 years since (most of the challenges were open-ended, so that it’s unclear when to count them as “solved”).  I posed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=471">more open quantum complexity problems</a> in 2010, and some <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=663">classical complexity problems</a> in 2011.  In the latter cases, I’d say there’s been dramatic progress on about a third of the problems.  I won’t go through the problems one by one, but feel free to ask in the comments about any that interest you.</p>



<p>Shall I push my luck as a problem-poser?  Shall or shall not, I have.</p>



<p>My impetus, this time around, was a kind invitation by Travis Humble, the editor-in-chief of the new <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tqc">ACM Transactions on Quantum Computing</a></em>, to contribute a perspective piece to that journal on the occasion of my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5448">ACM Prize</a>.  I agreed—but only on the condition that, rather than ponderously pontificate about the direction of the field, I could simply discuss a bunch of open problems that I wanted to see solved.  The result is below.  It’s coming soon to an arXiv near you, but <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers get it first.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/open.pdf">Open Problems Related to Quantum Query Complexity</a></strong>  (11 pages, PDF)</p><p>by Scott Aaronson</p><p><em>Abstract:</em> I offer a case that quantum query complexity still has loads of enticing and fundamental open problems—from relativized QMA versus QCMA and BQP versus IP, to time/space tradeoffs for collision and element distinctness, to polynomial degree versus quantum query complexity for partial functions, to the Unitary Synthesis Problem and more.</p></blockquote>



<p>Some of the problems on my new hit-list are ones that I and others have flogged for years or even decades, but others, as far as I know, appear here for the first time.  If your favorite quantum query complexity open problem, or a problem I’ve discussed in the past, is missing, that doesn’t mean that it’s been solved or is no longer interesting—it might mean I simply ran out of time or energy before I got to it.</p>



<p>Enjoy!  And tell me what I missed or got wrong or has a trivial solution that I overlooked.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-137 |  Affine extractors and AC0-Parity | 

	Xuangui Huang, 

	Peter Ivanov, 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>We study a simple and general template for constructing affine extractors by composing a linear transformation with resilient functions. Using this we show that good affine extractors can be computed by non-explicit circuits of various types, including AC0-Xor circuits: AC0 circuits with a layer of parity gates at the input. We also show that one-sided extractor can be computed by small DNF-Xor circuits, and separate these circuits from other well-studied classes. As a further motivation for studying DNF-Xor circuits we show that if they can approximate inner product then small AC0-Xor circuits can compute it exactly – a long-standing open problem.</summary>

<p>
Scott Aaronson is one of the top researchers in complexity theory and especially in quantum computing. He is famous for more than his research, he is famous also for his blog <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?m=202109">Shtetl-Optimized</a>. Its scope includes just about everything that touches on complexity theory, but includes many topics that span just about anything that is interesting these days.</p>
<p>
For a whole week, he has had the topic: <i>Exciting opportunities at Kabul University!</i> </p>
<p>
Scott is kidding about Kabul of course. Rather, his topic is the recent Texas law against abortion. Here are his initial comments: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Now, of course, Texas has effectively outlawed abortion—well, after the 6th week, which is before many women even realize they’re pregnant, and when the fetus is still the size of a grain of rice…</p>
<p>
There are no exceptions for rape or incest, and—this is the “novel” part—there’s a bounty system, with $10,000 fines for anyone who helps in any way with an abortion, payable to anyone who snitches on them. Texas has openly defied Roe v. Wade and, for the first time in half a century, has gotten five Supreme Court justices (three appointed by Donald Trump) to go along with it. Roe v. Wade is de facto no longer the law of the United States.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We will not talk about abortion, but rather the novel aspect of the Texas law. This will not lead to quantum computing, not even along lines of a famous SMBC <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">cartoon</a> that Scott created with Zach Weinersmith, from which we give the second panel:</p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/the-talk/" rel="attachment wp-att-19098"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19098" height="270" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-talk.jpg?resize=480%2C270&amp;ssl=1" width="480"/></a></p>
<p>
We promise it will lead to some math, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What can we do to stop the Texas law? Many are worried that the fact that the US Supreme Court has refused to even temporarily block the Texas law is unheard of. Does this mean that the new Texas law somehow is valid? Does this mean that abortions will be made illegal? Not clear.</p>
<p>
One part of the Texas law is clever—we can disagree with it and still note that the new law is clever. The law does not give the usual suspects to the local law enforcement, who are usually the ones responsible to enforce the law. Rather the law insists that anyone can raise the issue that X has violated the law against an abortion. Say S raises that X helped make an abortion happen. Then S gets $10,000 payment provided the case is upheld in court. Scott calls S the <i>snitches</i>. </p>
<p>
As recognized by the Emergency Medical Network (Emnet), this step in moving the enforcement from the usual police to the general public is one of the reasons the Texas law is so hard to fight. The usual way to challenge a new law is to immediately file some counter suit stopping those charged with enforcement. This seems to be impossible with this trick. Who can be S?—by construction that could be just about anyone. There is no single body to force to defend the law in court. Clever.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law—The Trick </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are experts in theory of computation. Can we use that ability to find a way to attack the new <a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">law</a>? Can we see any weakness that is inherent in the law? Some trick? Or is the Texas idea somehow a breakthrough in ways to state a law against abortion?</p>
<p>
Ken and I have an insight. A standard trick in theory is given a new idea can we generalize it. If we can use the new idea to solve other problems then we should shed some light on the new idea. If the idea is too powerful, then we essentially prove that it cannot work in general. If it does work elsewhere, then we can use it to solve previous unsolved problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Texas Law for Speeding </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Cars speeding is a serious problem just about everywhere. I live in a rural area and it is 35 mph here. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/13/texas-sized-problems/attachment/35/" rel="attachment wp-att-19100"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19100" height="114" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/35.png?resize=196%2C114&amp;ssl=1" width="196"/></a></p>
<p>
Yet when I am driving I am often passed by cars that cross a yellow line going 50 or faster. The issue is that the laws insist that some officer witness a violation. But since that rarely happens, the speeders almost always get no ticket.</p>
<p>
Let’s use the same trick that is used in the new Texas law. If a car races by me then I will send a digital message to the police that says: “Today I was driving my car number <b>1236335356</b> at time <b>11:19.42am</b> and witnessed a car with plate number <b>ERRW5365</b> speeding at <b>55.11mph</b> while passing me. I was at location …</p>
<p>
This would be sent to the police and they would then have the task of checking it out. Provided it checks out, I would be awarded a bounty of $500, say. And the speeder would get a fine and …</p>
<p>
How could I prove the speed? I wouldn’t have time to take a video in the moment. But Ken’s smartphone—and those of many of his colleagues—have an app that is solving problems of this type 24/7. His is a University at Buffalo product but there are many similar ones. Quoting the <a href="https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/pocketcares.html">website</a> makes everything quickly clear:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> PocketCare S is a bluetooth low energy (BLE) solution which enables smartphones to send and receive anonymous beacon signals. It checks the distance between a smartphone and another beacon (or smartphone running PocketCare S) … [and] … records the duration a close encounter with another beacon. PocketCare S is designed to report social distance information without collecting or revealing any personally identifiable information about any specific individual. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The car would only need to have a detectable beacon, not the same app—and the info giving proof of speed over said duration might already be in the authorities’ data banks even before the complaint is filed.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Bipartite Epidemiology? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Of course, what we are trying to say is that this kind of lawsuit would become a new kind of virus. It might extend to many other transgressions besides speeding. What strikes us further is that this would assume a binary structure that we do not know to exist in medical pandemics.</p>
<p>
The first point is that the people who voted for the Texas law believe they are not the ones who would be violating it. Call them Team A. The remaining people—Team 2—would want to get back at them. Maybe speeding is an equal vice for those two teams, so that wouldn’t work. We’ve seen suggestions like Team B suing for open-carry of firearms. Let us just suppose Team B finds something.</p>
<p>
The second point is that a “snitch” lawsuit is like one person infecting another. But unlike our present pandemic, it’s one where people in A can only infect those in B, and vice versa. We have a bipartite graph <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. How does this change the math?</p>
<p>
One issue noted by Scott in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5807#comment-1908708">comment</a> is whether the law allows someone to be sued multiple times. If not, then being sued once would be like acquiring immunity. The US recognizes principles of “no double jeopardy” but the Texas law appears to avoid them. </p>
<p>
We’ve tried to look for related analysis of the popular college “Humans Versus Zombies” (<a href="https://humansvszombies.org/">HvZ</a>) game. But in that game, the zombies only increase. <em>Scientific American</em> once published an <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/modelling-a-werewolf-epidemic-2/">analysis</a> titled, “Modelling a werewolf epidemic” that also mentioned zombies. But it did not say the werewolves could only infect zombies and vice-versa. </p>
<p>
Binary infection situations do of course exist when two groups of people suddenly mix, each having already acquired resistance to a disease that infects the other. There have been great tragedies when the mixing was a relatively small number of A colonizing into B. But we still do not know of models that would apply when the kinds of “infections” involve spontaneously arise <em>en masse</em> in the manner of a pandemic with high <img alt="{R_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> factor—as might happen if the courts really legitimize this kind of “snitch suit” law.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this type of snitching a viable adjunct to law enforcement for speeding? Could it save lives? What about the associated dimension of propagating personal information into massive repositories?</p>

    <title>TR21-136 |  LCC and LDC: Tailor-made distance amplification and a refined separation | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>The Alon-Edmonds-Luby distance amplification procedure (FOCS 1995) is an algorithm that transforms a code with vanishing distance to a code with constant distance. AEL was invoked by Kopparty, Meir, Ron-Zewi, and Saraf (J. ACM 2017) for obtaining their state-of-the-art LDC, LCC and LTC. Cohen and Yankovitz (CCC 2021) devised a  procedure that can amplify inverse-polynomial distances, exponentially extending the regime of distances that can be amplified by AEL. However, the improved procedure only works for LDC and assuming rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log n}$.

In this work we devise a distance amplification procedure for LCC with inverse-polynomial distances even for vanishing rate $\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. For LDC, we obtain a more modest improvement and require rate $1-\frac1{\mathrm{poly} \log\log n}$. Thus, the tables have turned and it is now LCC that can be better amplified. Our key idea for accomplishing this, deviating from prior work, is to tailor the distance amplification procedure to the code at hand.

Our second result concerns the relation between linear LDC and LCC. We prove the existence of linear LDC that are not LCC, qualitatively extending a separation by Kaufman and Viderman (RANDOM 2010).</summary>

    <title>TR21-135 |  Strong (D)QBF Dependency Schemes via Implication-free Resolution Paths | 

	Tomáš Peitl, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn</title>
    <summary>We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new infinite collection of implication-free DQBF dependency schemes that generalise the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of all these schemes, implying that they can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of QBF and DQBF resolution systems parameterised by implication-free dependency schemes and show that the hierarchical structure naturally present among the dependency schemes translates isomorphically to a hierarchical structure of parameterised proof systems with respect to p-simulation. As a special case, we demonstrate that our new schemes are exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q-resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency schemes known to date.</summary>

    <link href="http://benjamin-recht.github.io/2021/09/13/effect-size/" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Effect size is significantly more important than statistical significance.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_RCT____Symptomatic_Seropositivity_083121.pdf">A massive cluster-randomized controlled trial run in Bangladesh to test the efficacy of mask wearing on reducing coronavirus transmission</a> released its initial results and the covid pundits have been buzzing with excitement. There have already been too many hot takes on the report, but, after wrangling with the 94 pages, I came to a different conclusion than most who have used this study as evidence for their mask predilections. I worry that because of statistical ambiguity, there’s not much that can be deduced at all.</p>

<p>The Bangladesh mask study was a cluster-randomized controlled trial. Rather than randomizing patients, this study randomized villages. Though the sample size looked enormous (340,000 individuals), the effective number of samples was only 600 because the treatment was applied to individual villages. Villages were paired using demographic attributes and one of each pair was randomly assigned to an intervention and the other to no intervention. The 300 intervention villages received free masks, information on the importance of masking, role modeling by community leaders, and in-person reminders for 8 weeks. The 300 villages in the control group did not receive any interventions.</p>

<p>The goal was to determine how much these interventions contributed to patients who both reported symptoms, subsequently consented to antibody testing, and tested positive. The study reports the precise number of people who report symptoms down to the single person (13,273 in treatment, 13,893 in control). The study reports the precise number of symptomatic people who consented to blood draws (5,414 in treatment, 5,538 in control). And the study reports the precise number of blood draws that were tested for covid antibodies (5,006  in treatment, 4,971 in control). But here’s where the picture gets murky: The number of actual positive tests appears nowhere in the preprint.</p>

<p>The study reports that 0.76% of the people in the control villages were symptomatic and seropositive whereas 0.69% of the people in the treatment villages were symptomatic and seropositive. This corresponds to about a 1.1 fold reduction in risk, and this result was deemed by the authors to be statistically significant.</p>

<p>Where do these seropositivity percentages come from? The paper does not make clear what is being counted. Do the authors compute the number of cases in treatment divided by the number of individuals treated? Or do they compute the prevalence in each cluster and average these up? These two different estimates of prevalence can give different answers. For instance, we can imagine a simplified scenario with two clusters. Let’s say one treatment-control pair consists of two villages with 10,000 people each and pair two consists of villages with 6,000 people. In the larger treatment village, there is an outbreak with 136 cases, but in the smaller treatment village there are no cases. In the control villages, the larger village observes 75 cases and the smaller 46 cases. If we count over the number of individuals, then the prevalence ratio is 1.1 in favor of the control arm. However, if we first compute prevalence at the village level and then average these estimates, we find a prevalence ratio of 1.1 in favor of the treatment arm. But which is better? Reducing prevalence at the village level or the population level? This question is especially difficult when the actual magnitude of the outcome is so small. In either case we are talking about a difference of 15 cases between the treatment and control villages in a population of 32,000 individuals.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="illustration of how different summary statistics can yield different effect sizes." src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/mask_cluster.png" width="75%"/></p>

<p>When effect sizes are small and sensitive to measurement, convention compels us to find refuge in an argument over statistical significance. So let’s then examine how significance is derived in the working paper. The authors say that they model the count of symptomatic seropositive individuals as a “a generalized linear model (GLM) with a normal family and identity link.” This is a fancy way of saying that they modeled the count as if it were sampled from a normal distribution and ran ordinary least-squares regression. Based on the captions on the tables, it appears that they modeled the rate of symptomatic seroprevalence in each village as a normal distribution whose mean is a function of the village cluster and some other covariates. They then apparently computed estimates of village level seroprevalence under the model and averaged these estimates to yield a final estimate of seroprevalence in treatment and control.</p>

<p>While the Gaussian model made the authors’ coding simple and allowed them to report results in standard econometric formatting, the model is also certainly wrong. Counts cannot be normally distributed as normal random variables as they cannot take negative values. Indeed, 36 out of the 300 villages had zero infections, and such an event is exceedingly unlikely when the distribution is well-approximated by a Gaussian. Rather than adjust their modeling assumptions, the authors just removed these villages from the regression, leading to an overestimate of the average seroprevalence.</p>

<p>The report computes p-values and confidence intervals from these regressions. What exactly do these quantities mean? P-values and confidence intervals associated with a regression are valid <em>only if the model is true</em>. What if the model is not true? If the model is wrong, the error bars are meaningless. And if the confidence intervals and p-values are meaningless, then I’m not sure what we can conclude.</p>

<p>The authors provided several robustness checks to fend off claims like mine. They also estimated the effect using a non-preregistered model which modeled the count as being Poisson distributed and found the effects were similar. Again, however, modeling infectious diseases with Poisson distributions is not realistic. A Poisson distribution models independent events that occur with some fixed rate. Such models are reasonable for modeling noninfectious diseases such as heart attacks, but we know that infections do not occur as random independent events: interactions with other sick individuals creates complex dynamic spread and the epidemic curves we see far too often thrown around online. Mathematically, it is not surprising that two models yield the same estimated effect sizes: they are both generalized linear models and their estimates are computed with similar algorithms.  But since both models are wrong, it’s not clear why including both provides much in the way of reassurance.</p>

<p>Rather than providing all of this statistical analysis, why not report the unadjusted counts of positive individuals for the reader to interpret? Especially considering that symptoms were reported precisely down to the person.</p>

<p>It’s useful to compare this mask study to the RCTs for vaccines. Vaccine studies are fortunate to be the purest of randomized controlled trials. If RCTs are a “gold standard” for causal inference, then vaccine studies are the “gold standard” of RCTs. Vaccines trials are easy to blind, almost always have clinical equipoise, only measure direct effects on individuals that can be nearly uniformly sampled from the world’s population, and are trivial to verify statistically. Looking at the example of the Pfizer vaccine, the effect size was enormous (20x risk reduction) and the confidence intervals were just based on exact calculations for independent, binary random variables. And the CIs didn’t matter much because the effect size was so large. You could just stare at the Kaplan-Meier curve and bask in the amazing effectiveness of MRNA vaccines.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, of course, most effect sizes are not factor of 20. Indeed, they are usually less than a factor of 2. As we saw in the mask study, the effect size was less than a factor of 1.1. I’m picking on the mask study only because it has been so attention grabbing.  It’s a convenient example to illustrate how statistical modeling can muddy the waters in randomized control trials. But it is only one of many examples I’ve come across in the past few months. If you pick a random paper out of the New England Journal of Medicine or the American Economic Review, you will likely find similar statistical muddiness.</p>

<p>We lose sight of the forest for the trees when we fight over p-values rather than considering effect sizes. Ernest Rutherford is famously quoted proclaiming “If your experiment needs statistics, you ought to have done a better experiment.” Rutherford, who discovered the structure of the atom, and is famous for pioneering innovations in experiment design and measurement for amplifying small effects. He was not opposed to probing the minuscule, but was interested in how to best produce empirical evidence.</p>

<p>I think a milder version of Rutherford’s aphorism should guide scientific investigation: If the effect size is so small that we need sophisticated statistics, maybe that means the effect isn’t real. Using sophisticated statistical scaffolding clouds our judgement. We end up using statistical methods as a crutch, not to dig signals out of noise, but to convince ourselves of signals when there are none. And this matters for recommendations on policy. If the effects of an intervention are modest at best, and only manifest themselves after statistical correction, how can we use such a study to guide policy?</p>

<p>Misapplication of statistics can lead to bad policy decisions. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121867148093738861">Medical devices can be approved even when the statistics are done in error</a>.  And statistical errors can even <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/23/astrazeneca-may-have-used-outdated-information-in-announcing-covid19-vaccine-results/">dampen confidence in effective vaccines</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, there is an existential problem arguing for large effect sizes. If most effect sizes are small or zero, then most interventions are useless. And this forces us scientists to confront our cosmic impotence, which remains a humbling and frustrating experience.</p>

<p>I’ve probably been thinking too much about statistics and models. I’m not the first mid-career professor to realize that statistical modeling is widely misapplied (For example <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/308/6924/283">Doug Altman</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/statistical-models-and-causal-inference/7CE8D4957FF6E9615AAAC4128FA8246E">David Freedman</a>, or <a href="http://home.uchicago.edu/~amshaikh/webfiles/multiplereview.pdf">Joseph Romano</a>, among many others). But I’m hoping to write more about this with a bit of an algorithmic lens, discussing some of the earlier worries about modeling in the process. Can we revisit suggestions for improving our evidentiary framework with contemporary computational statistics tools? Where might this lead us in both the experimental sciences and in machine learning?</p></div>

    <title>Review of A Blog Book based on the Less Wrong Blog</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There is a blog called <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">lesswrong</a>. Many people contribute to it (how many people must contribute to a website before it stops being called a blog and starts being called... Not sure what?). The theme is rationality. They (not sure who they are) have made a best-of collection from lesswrong which is named</p><p><i><b>A Map that Reflects the Territory (available <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/books">here</a>)</b></i></p><p>Actually, its not one book, but five mini-books. I quote the titles and paraphrase the first sentence of each:</p><p><i>Epistemology</i>:  How we come to know the world.</p><p><i>Agency</i>: The ability to take action in the world and control the future.</p><p><i>Coordination</i>:  The ability of multiple agents to work together.</p><p><i>Curiosity</i>: The desire to understand how the world works.</p><p><i>Alignment</i>: The problem of aligning the thoughts and goals.</p><p>I have written a review of the the book. The book was my first exposure to the blog, except sometimes reading<i> about </i>the blog, probably on Scott's blog.</p><p>I am posting this to both complexity blog and to lesswrong, though with lesswrong I will have a different intro since they know lesswrong but might not know complextyblog. </p><p>My review is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/lesswrong.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>I would appreciate intelligent comments and suggestions, which I will use to improve the review.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-134 |  A refinement of the Meyer-McCreight Union Theorem | 

	Siddharth Bhaskar</title>
    <summary>For a function $t : 2^\star \to 1^\star$, let $C_t$ be the set of problems decidable on input $x$ in time at most $t(x)$ almost everywhere.  The Union Theorem of Meyer and McCreight asserts that any union $\bigcup_{i &lt; \omega} C_{t_i}$ for a uniformly recursive sequence of bounds $t_i$ is equal to $C_L$ for some single recursive function $L$. In particular the class PTIME of polynomial-time relations can be expressed as $C_L$ for some total recursive function $L : 2^\star \to 1^\star$. By controlling the complexity of the construction, we show that in fact PTIME equals $C_L$ for some $L$ computable in quasi-polynomial time.</summary>

    <title>TR21-133 |  Testing Distributions of Huge Objects | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Dana Ron</title>
    <summary>We initiate a study of a new model of property testing that is a hybrid of testing properties of distributions and testing properties of strings. 
Specifically, the new model refers to testing properties of distributions, but these are distributions over huge objects (i.e., very long strings). 
Accordingly, the model accounts for the total number of local probes into these objects (resp., queries to the strings)as well as for the distance between objects (resp., strings).
Specifically, the distance between distributions is defined as the earth mover's distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between strings.

We study the query complexity of testing in this new model, focusing on three directions.
First, we try to relate the query complexity of testing properties in the new model to the sample complexity of testing these properties in the standard distribution testing model.
Second, we consider the complexity of testing properties that arise naturally in the new model (e.g., distributions that capture random variations of fixed strings).
Third, we consider the complexity of testing properties that were extensively studied in the standard distribution testing model: Two such cases are uniform distributions
and pairs of identical distributions, where we obtain the following results.

\begin{itemize}
\item
Testing whether a distribution over $n$-bit long strings is uniform on some set of size $m$ can be tested with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m/\epsilon^3)$, where $\epsilon&gt;(\log_2m)/n$ is the proximity parameter.
\item
Testing whether two distribution over $n$-bit long strings that have support size at most $m$ are identical can be tested  with query complexity ${\widetilde O}(m^{2/3}/\epsilon^3)$.
\end{itemize}
Both upper bounds are pretty tight; that is, for $\epsilon=\Omega(1)$, the first task requires $\Omega(m^c)$ queries for any $c&lt;1$ and $n=\omega(\log m)$, whereas the second task requires $\Omega(m^{2/3})$ queries.
Note that the query complexity of the first task is higher than the sample complexity of the corresponding task in the standard distribution testing model, whereas in the case of the second task the bounds almost match.</summary>

    <title>TR21-132 |  Pseudo-random functions and uniform learnability | 

	Eric Binnendyk</title>
    <summary>Boolean circuits are a model of computation. A class of Boolean circuits is called a polynomial class if the number of nodes is bounded by a polynomial function of the number of input variables. A class $C_n[s(n)]$ of Boolean functions is called learnable if there are algorithms that can approximate functions in $C_n[s(n)]$ when given oracle access to the function. A distribution $D$ of functions is called pseudorandom against a circuit class $C[t(n)]$ if any oracle circuit $C^f$ from $C[t(n)]$ outputs 1 with the same probability if the oracle $f$ is chosen from $D$ as it would if the oracle were random. It is known that a polynomial class of circuits is learnable if and only if it contains no pseudorandom distributions of functions. However, there is no known algorithm to produce the learner given the number of inputs the circuits have (the learner is non-uniform). I investigate a uniform version of the min-max theorem as a possible tool to find an algorithm for such learners.</summary>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: How do molecules, cells and synapses effect reasoning, intelligence, planning, language? Despite dazzling progress in experimental neuroscience, as well as in cognitive science at the other extreme of scale, we do not seem to be making progress in the overarching question: the gap is huge and a completely new approach seems to be required. As Richard Axel recently put it: “We don’t have a logic for the transformation of neural activity into thought […].”</p>



<p>What kind of formal system would qualify as this “logic”?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">I will introduce the Assembly Calculus (AC), a computational system which appears to be a promising bridge between neurons and cognition. Through this programming framework, a Parser was recently implemented which (a) can handle reasonably complex sentences of English and other languages, and (b) works exclusively through the spiking of neurons.</p>

    <title>TR21-131 |  QCDCL with Cube Learning or Pure Literal Elimination - What is best? | 

	Benjamin Böhm, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main approaches for solving quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). We formalise and investigate several versions of QCDCL that include cube learning and/or pure-literal elimination, and formally compare the resulting solving models via proof complexity techniques. Our results show that almost all of the QCDCL models are exponentially incomparable with respect to proof size (and hence solver running time), pointing towards different orthogonal ways how to practically implement QCDCL.</summary>
