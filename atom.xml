    <title>Interactive shallow Clifford circuits: quantum advantage against NC$^1$ and beyond</title>

demonstrates a quantum advantage for shallow circuits: constant-depth quantum
circuits can perform a task which constant-depth classical (i.e., AC$^0$)
circuits cannot. Their results have the advantage that the quantum circuit is
fairly practical, and their proofs are free of hardness assumptions (e.g.,
factoring is classically hard, etc.). Unfortunately, constant-depth classical
circuits are too weak to yield a convincing real-world demonstration of quantum
advantage. We attempt to hold on to the advantages of the above results, while
increasing the power of the classical model.
</p>
<p>Our main result is a two-round interactive task which is solved by a
constant-depth quantum circuit (using only Clifford gates, between neighboring
qubits of a 2D grid, with Pauli measurements), but such that any classical
solution would necessarily solve $\oplus$L-hard problems. This implies a more
powerful class of constant-depth classical circuits (e.g., AC$^0[p]$ for any
prime $p$) unconditionally cannot perform the task. Furthermore, under standard
complexity-theoretic conjectures, log-depth circuits and log-space Turing
machines cannot perform the task either.
</p>
<p>Using the same techniques, we prove hardness results for weaker complexity
classes under more restrictive circuit topologies. Specifically, we give
QNC$^0$ interactive tasks on $2 \times n$ and $1 \times n$ grids which require
classical simulations of power NC$^1$ and AC$^{0}[6]$, respectively. Moreover,
these hardness results are robust to a small constant fraction of error in the
classical simulation.
</p>
<p>We use ideas and techniques from the theory of branching programs, quantum
contextuality, measurement-based quantum computation, and Kilian randomization.

$f$ over the reals, when the coefficients of $f$ come from independent standard
normal distributions. Recently B\"urgisser, Erg\"ur and Tonelli-Cueto showed
that the expected number of real zeros of $f$ in such cases is bounded by
$O(\sqrt{k} \log k)$. In this work, we improve the bound to $O(\sqrt{k})$ and
also show that this bound is tight by constructing a family of sparse support
whose expected number of real zeros is lower bounded by $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$. Our
main technique is an alternative formulation of the Kac integral by
Edelman-Kostlan which allows us to bound the expected number of zeros of $f$ in
terms of the expected number of zeros of polynomials of lower sparsity. Using
our technique, we also recover the $O(\log n)$ bound on the expected number of
real zeros of a dense polynomial of degree $n$ with coefficients coming from
independent standard normal distributions.

is given as an orbit closure and the ambient space is the set of all 3-tensors.
The first variety that we consider is the slice rank variety, which consists of
all 3-tensors of slice rank at most $r$. We show that the membership testing
problem for the slice rank variety is $\NP$-hard. While the slice rank variety
is a union of orbit closures, we define another variety, the minrank variety,
expressible as a single orbit closure. Our next result is the $\NP$-hardness of
membership testing in the minrank variety, hence we establish the
$\NP$-hardness of the orbit closure containment problem for 3-tensors.
</p>
<p>Algebraic natural proofs were recently introduced by Forbes, Shpilka and Volk
and independently by Grochow, Kumar, Saks and Saraf. Bl\"aser et al. gave a
version of an algebraic natural proof barrier for the matrix completion problem
which relies on $\coNP \subseteq \exists \BPP$. It implied that constructing
equations for the corresponding variety should be hard. We generalize their
approach to work with any family of varieties for which the membership problem
is $\NP$-hard and for which we can efficiently generate a dense subset.
Therefore, a similar barrier holds for the slice rank and the minrank
varieties, too. This allows us to set up the slice rank and the minrank
varieties as a test-bed for geometric complexity theory (GCT). We determine the
stabilizers of the tensors that generate the orbit closures of the two
varieties and prove that these tensors are almost characterized by their
symmetries. We prove several nontrivial equations for both the varieties using
different GCT methods. Many equations also work in the regime where membership
testing in the slice rank or minrank varieties is $\NP$-hard. We view this as a
promising sign that the GCT approach might indeed be successful.

    <title>Algorithms and Adaptivity Gaps for Stochastic $k$-TSP</title>

$\textsf{$k$-TSP}$ problem is to find a tour originating at the $\textsf{root}$
of minimum length that visits at least $k$ nodes in $V$. In this work,
motivated by applications where the input to an optimization problem is
uncertain, we study two stochastic versions of $\textsf{$k$-TSP}$.
</p>
<p>In Stoch-Reward $k$-TSP, originally defined by Ene-Nagarajan-Saket [ENS17],
each vertex $v$ in the given metric $(V,d)$ contains a stochastic reward $R_v$.
The goal is to adaptively find a tour of minimum expected length that collects
at least reward $k$; here "adaptively" means our next decision may depend on
previous outcomes. Ene et al. give an $O(\log k)$-approximation adaptive
algorithm for this problem, and left open if there is an $O(1)$-approximation
algorithm. We totally resolve their open question and even give an
$O(1)$-approximation \emph{non-adaptive} algorithm for this problem.
</p>
<p>We also introduce and obtain similar results for the Stoch-Cost $k$-TSP
problem. In this problem each vertex $v$ has a stochastic cost $C_v$, and the
goal is to visit and select at least $k$ vertices to minimize the expected
\emph{sum} of tour length and cost of selected vertices. This problem
generalizes the Price of Information framework [Singla18] from deterministic
probing costs to metric probing costs.
</p>
<p>Our techniques are based on two crucial ideas: "repetitions" and "critical
scaling". We show using Freedman's and Jogdeo-Samuels' inequalities that for
our problems, if we truncate the random variables at an ideal threshold and
repeat, then their expected values form a good surrogate. Unfortunately, this
ideal threshold is adaptive as it depends on how far we are from achieving our
target $k$, so we truncate at various different scales and identify a
"critical" scale.

common approximations for TSP, to parameterized approximations for ATSP. The
parameters we consider for the respective parameterizations are upper bounded
by the number of asymmetric distances in the given instance, which yields
algorithms to efficiently compute constant factor approximations also for
moderately asymmetric TSP instances. As generalization of the Christofides
algorithm, we derive a parameterized 2.5-approximation, where the parameter is
the size of a vertex cover for the subgraph induced by the asymmetric edges.
Our generalization of the tree doubling algorithm gives a parameterized
3-approximation, where the parameter is the number of asymmetric edges in a
given minimum spanning arborescence. Both algorithms are also stated in the
form of additive lossy kernelizations, which allows to combine them with known
polynomial time approximations for ATSP. Further, we combine them with a notion
of symmetry relaxation which allows to trade approximation guarantee for
runtime. We complement our results by experimental evaluations, which show that
both algorithms give a ratio well below 2 and that the parameterized
3-approximation frequently outperforms the parameterized 2.5-approximation with
respect to parameter size.

($\mathrm{CVP}_p$) cannot be solved in $2^{(1-\varepsilon)n}$ time for all $p
\notin 2\mathbb{Z}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ (assuming SETH). In fact, we show
that the same holds even for (1)~the approximate version of the problem
(assuming a gap version of SETH); and (2) $\mathrm{CVP}_p$ with preprocessing,
in which we are allowed arbitrary advice about the lattice (assuming a
non-uniform version of SETH). For "plain" $\mathrm{CVP}_p$, the same hardness
result was shown in [Bennett, Golovnev, and Stephens-Davidowitz FOCS 2017] for
all but finitely many $p \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$, where the set of exceptions
depended on $\varepsilon$ and was not explicit. For the approximate and
preprocessing problems, only very weak bounds were known prior to this work.

<p>We also show that the restriction to $p \notin 2\mathbb{Z}$ is in some sense
inherent. In particular, we show that no "natural" reduction can rule out even
a $2^{3n/4}$-time algorithm for $\mathrm{CVP}_2$ under SETH. For this, we prove
that the possible sets of closest lattice vectors to a target in the $\ell_2$

biologically-plausible algorithm using a Hebbian-type synaptic update rule to
solve streaming principal component analysis (PCA). Computational
neuroscientists have known that this biological version of Oja's rule converges
to the top eigenvector of the covariance matrix of the input in the limit.
However, prior to this work, it was open to prove any convergence rate
guarantee.
</p>
<p>In this work, we give the first convergence rate analysis for the biological
version of Oja's rule in solving streaming PCA. Moreover, our convergence rate
matches the information theoretical lower bound up to logarithmic factors and
outperforms the state-of-the-art upper bound for streaming PCA. Furthermore, we
develop a novel framework inspired by ordinary differential equations (ODE) to
analyze general stochastic dynamics. The framework abandons the traditional
step-by-step analysis and instead analyzes a stochastic dynamic in one-shot by
giving a closed-form solution to the entire dynamic. The one-shot framework
allows us to apply stopping time and martingale techniques to have a flexible
and precise control on the dynamic. We believe that this general framework is
powerful and should lead to effective yet simple analysis for a large class of
problems with stochastic dynamics.

applications in graph mining, particularly in areas like social network
analysis, protein and gene analyses etc. Depending on the application, finding
dense subgraphs can be used to determine regions of high importance, similar
characteristics or enhanced interaction. The densest subgraph extraction
problem is a fundamentally a non-linear optimization problem. Nevertheless, it
can be solved in polynomial time by an exact algorithm based on the iterative
solution of a series of maximum flow sub-problems. Despite its polynomial time
complexity, the computing time required by the exact algorithms on very large
graphs could be prohibitive. Thus, to approach graphs with millions of vertices
and edges, one has to resort to heuristic algorithms. We provide an efficient
implementation of a greedy heuristic from the literature that is extremely fast
and has some nice theoretical properties. We also introduce a new heurisitic
algorithm that is built on top of the greedy and the exact methods. An
extensive computational study is presented to evaluate the performance of
various solution methods on a benchmark composed of 86 instances taken from the
literature. This analysis shows that the proposed heuristic algorithm proved
very effective on a large number of test instances, often providing either the
optimal solution or near-optimal solution within short computing times.

    <title>Breaching the 2-Approximation Barrier for Connectivity Augmentation: a Reduction to Steiner Tree</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573171200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Jaros≈Çaw Byrka, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Grandoni:Fabrizio.html">Fabrizio Grandoni</a>, Afrouz Jabal Ameli <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02259">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The basic goal of survivable network design is to build a cheap network that
maintains the connectivity between given sets of nodes despite the failure of a
few edges/nodes. The Connectivity Augmentation Problem (CAP) is arguably one of
the most basic problems in this area: given a k(edge)-connected graph G and a
set of extra edges (links), select a minimum cardinality subset A of links such
that adding A to G increases its edge connectivity to k + 1. Intuitively, one
wants to make an existing network more reliable by augmenting it with extra
edges. The best known approximation factor for this NP-hard problem is 2, and
this can be achieved with multiple approaches (the first such result is in
[Frederickson and Jaja'81]).
</p>
<p>It is known [Dinitz et al.'76] that CAP can be reduced to the case k = 1,
a.k.a. the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP), for odd k, and to the case k = 2,
a.k.a. the Cactus Augmentation Problem (CacAP), for even k. Several better than
2 approximation algorithms are known for TAP, culminating with a recent 1.458
approximation [Grandoni et al.'18]. However, for CacAP the best known
approximation is 2.
</p>
<p>In this paper we breach the 2 approximation barrier for CacAP, hence for CAP,
by presenting a polynomial-time $2 ln(4) - 967 + \epsilon &lt; 1.91$
approximation. Previous approaches exploit properties of TAP that do not seem
to generalize to CacAP. We instead use a reduction to the Steiner tree problem
which was previously used in parameterized algorithms [Basavaraju et al.'14].
This reduction is not approximation preserving, and using the current best
approximation factor for Steiner tree [Byrka et al.'13] as a black-box would
not be good enough to improve on 2. To achieve the latter goal, we "open the
box" and exploit the specific properties of the instances of Steiner tree
arising from CacAP.

    <title>Multi-Item Mechanisms without Item-Independence: Learnability via Robustness</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1573171200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Johaness Brustle, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Cai:Yang.html">Yang Cai</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Daskalakis:Constantinos.html">Constantinos Daskalakis</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.02146">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the sample complexity of learning revenue-optimal multi-item
auctions. We obtain the first set of positive results that go beyond the
standard but unrealistic setting of item-independence. In particular, we
consider settings where bidders' valuations are drawn from correlated
distributions that can be captured by Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks
-- two of the most prominent graphical models. We establish parametrized sample
complexity bounds for learning an up-to-$\varepsilon$ optimal mechanism in both
models, which scale polynomially in the size of the model, i.e. the number of
items and bidders, and only exponential in the natural complexity measure of
the model, namely either the largest in-degree (for Bayesian Networks) or the
size of the largest hyper-edge (for Markov Random Fields).
</p>
<p>We obtain our learnability results through a novel and modular framework that
involves first proving a robustness theorem. We show that, given only
"approximate distributions" for bidder valuations, we can learn a mechanism
whose revenue is nearly optimal simultaneously for all "true distributions"
that are close to the ones we were given in Prokhorov distance. Thus, to learn
a good mechanism, it suffices to learn approximate distributions. When item
values are independent, learning in Prokhorov distance is immediate, hence our
framework directly implies the main result of Gonczarowski and Weinberg
\cite{GonczarowskiW18}. When item values are sampled from more general
graphical models, we combine our robustness theorem with novel sample
complexity results for learning Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks in
Prokhorov distance, which may be of independent interest. Finally, in the
single-item case, our robustness result can be strengthened to hold under an
even weaker distribution distance, the L\'evy distance.

every vertex to a pair of consecutive edges in the ordering -- an \emph{angle}
-- such that each edge participates in at least one such pair. We show that any
graph of maximum degree 4 admits an angle cover, give a poly-time algorithm for
deciding if a graph with no degree-3 vertices has an angle-cover, and prove
that, given a graph of maximum degree 5, it is NP-hard to decide whether it
admits an angle cover. We also consider extensions of the angle cover problem
where every vertex selects a fixed number $a&gt;1$ of angles or where an angle
consists of more than two consecutive edges. We show an application of angle
covers to the problem of deciding if the 2-blowup of a planar graph has
isomorphic thickness 2.

    <title>Efficiently Learning Structured Distributions from Untrusted Batches</title>

untrusted batches. Here, we assume $m$ users, all of whom have samples from
some underlying distribution $p$ over $1, \ldots, n$. Each user sends a batch
of $k$ i.i.d. samples from this distribution; however an $\epsilon$-fraction of
users are untrustworthy and can send adversarially chosen responses. The goal
is then to learn $p$ in total variation distance. When $k = 1$ this is the
standard robust univariate density estimation setting and it is well-understood
that $\Omega (\epsilon)$ error is unavoidable. Suprisingly, Qiao and Valiant
gave an estimator which improves upon this rate when $k$ is large.
Unfortunately, their algorithms run in time exponential in either $n$ or $k$.
</p>
<p>We first give a sequence of polynomial time algorithms whose estimation error
approaches the information-theoretically optimal bound for this problem. Our
approach is based on recent algorithms derived from the sum-of-squares
hierarchy, in the context of high-dimensional robust estimation. We show that
algorithms for learning from untrusted batches can also be cast in this
framework, but by working with a more complicated set of test functions.
</p>
<p>It turns out this abstraction is quite powerful and can be generalized to
incorporate additional problem specific constraints. Our second and main result
is to show that this technology can be leveraged to build in prior knowledge
about the shape of the distribution. Crucially, this allows us to reduce the
sample complexity of learning from untrusted batches to polylogarithmic in $n$
for most natural classes of distributions, which is important in many
applications. To do so, we demonstrate that these sum-of-squares algorithms for
robust mean estimation can be made to handle complex combinatorial constraints
(e.g. those arising from VC theory), which may be of independent technical
interest.

theory concerning the symmetry of relative randomness. It establishes that for
any pair of infinite sequences $A$ and $B$, $B$ is Martin-L\"of random and $A$
is Martin-L\"of random relative to $B$ if and only if the interleaved sequence
$A \uplus B$ is Martin-L\"of random. This implies that $A$ is relative random
to $B$ if and only if $B$ is random relative to $A$ \cite{vanLambalgen},
\cite{Nies09}, \cite{HirschfeldtBook}. This paper studies the validity of this
phenomenon for different notions of time-bounded relative randomness.
</p>
<p>We prove the classical van Lambalgen theorem using martingales and Kolmogorov
compressibility. We establish the failure of relative randomness in these
settings, for both time-bounded martingales and time-bounded Kolmogorov
complexity. We adapt our classical proofs when applicable to the time-bounded
setting, and construct counterexamples when they fail. The mode of failure of
the theorem may depend on the notion of time-bounded randomness.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This morning a humanities teacher named Richard Horan, having read my <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/opinion/google-quantum-computer-sycamore.html">NYT op-ed on quantum supremacy</a>, emailed me the following question about it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Is this pursuit [of scalable quantum computation] just an arms race? A race to see who can achieve it first? To what end? Will this achievement yield advances in medical science and human quality of life, or will it threaten us even more than we are threatened presently by our technologies? You seem rather sanguine about its possible development and uses. But how close does the hand on that doomsday clock move to midnight once we ‚Äúcan harness an exponential number of amplitudes for computation‚Äù?</p></blockquote>



<p>I thought this question might possibly be of some broader interest, so here‚Äôs my response (with some light edits).</p>



<p>Dear Richard,</p>



<p>A radio interviewer asked me a similar question a couple weeks ago‚Äîwhether there‚Äôs an ethical dimension to quantum computing research.¬† I replied that there‚Äôs an ethical dimension to everything that humans do.</p>



<p>A quantum computer is not like a nuclear weapon: it‚Äôs not going to directly kill anybody (unless the dilution refrigerator falls on them or something?).¬† It‚Äôs true that a full, scalable QC, if and when it‚Äôs achieved, will give a temporary advantage to people who want to break certain cryptographic codes.¬† The morality of that, of course, could strongly depend on whether the codebreakers are working for the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (like the British breaking the Nazi codes during WWII) or the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù (like, perhaps, Trump or Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping).</p>



<p>But in any case, there‚Äôs already a push to switch to new cryptographic codes that already exist and that we think are quantum-resistant.¬† An actual scalable QC on the horizon would of course massively accelerate that push.¬† And once people make the switch, we expect that security on the Internet will be more-or-less back where it started.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the big upside potential from QCs is that they‚Äôll provide an unprecedented ability to simulate physics and chemistry at the molecular level.¬† That could at least <em>potentially</em> help with designing new medicines, as well as new batteries and solar cells and carbon capture technologies‚Äîall things that the world desperately needs right now.</p>



<p>Also, the theory developed around QC has already led to many new and profound insights about physics and computation.¬† Some of us regard that as an inherent good, in the same way that art and music and literature are.</p>



<p>Now, one could argue that the climate crisis, or various other crises that our civilization faces, are so desperate that instead of working to build QCs, we should all just abandon our normal work and directly confront the crises, as (for example) Greta Thunberg is doing.¬† On some days I share that position.¬† But of course, were the position upheld, it would have implications not just for quantum computing researchers but for almost everyone on earth‚Äîincluding humanities teachers like yourself.</p>



<p>Best,<br/>Scott</p></div>

    <title>TR19-155 |  Pseudorandomness and the Minimum Circuit Size Problem | 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>We explore the possibility of basing one-way functions on the average-case hardness of the fundamental Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP[$s$]), which asks whether a Boolean function on $n$ bits specified by its truth table has circuits of size $s(n)$. 

1. (Pseudorandomness from Zero-Error Average-Case Hardness) We show that for a given size function $s$, 
the following are equivalent: Pseudorandom distributions supported on strings describable by $s(O(n))$-size circuits exist; Hitting sets supported on strings describable by $s(O(n))$-size circuits exist; MCSP[$s(O(n))$] is zero-error average-case hard. Using similar techniques, we show that Feige's hypothesis for random $k$-CNFs implies that there is a pseudorandom distribution (with constant error) supported entirely on satisfiable formulas. Underlying our results is a general notion of semantic sampling, which might be of independent interest.

2. (A New Conjecture) In analogy to a known universal construction of succinct hitting sets against arbitrary polynomial-size adversaries, we propose the Universality Conjecture: there is a universal construction of succinct pseudorandom distributions against arbitrary polynomial-size adversaries. We show that under the Universality Conjecture, the following are equivalent: One-way functions exist; Natural proofs useful against sub-exponential size circuits do not exist; Learning polynomial-size circuits with membership queries over the uniform distribution is hard; MCSP[$2^{\epsilon n}$] is zero-error hard on average for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$; Cryptographic succinct hitting set generators exist.

3. (Non-Black-Box Results) We show that for weak circuit classes C against which there are natural proofs [Razborov-Rudich97], pseudorandom functions secure against poly-size circuits in C imply superpolynomial lower bounds in P against poly-size circuits in C. We also show that for a certain natural variant of MCSP, there is a polynomial-time reduction from approximating the problem well in the worst case to solving it on average. These results are shown using non-black-box techniques, and in the first case we show that there is no black-box proof of the result under standard crypto assumptions.</summary>

    <title>TR19-154 |  Ar?kan meets Shannon: Polar codes with near-optimal convergence to channel capacity | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Andrii Riazanov, 

	Min Ye</title>
    <summary>Let $W$ be a binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS) channel with Shannon capacity $I(W)$ and fix any $\alpha &gt; 0$. We construct, for any sufficiently small $\delta &gt; 0$, binary linear codes of block length $O(1/\delta^{2+\alpha})$ and rate $I(W)-\delta$ that enable reliable communication on $W$ with quasi-linear time encoding and decoding. Shannon's noisy coding theorem established the existence of such codes (without efficient constructions or decoding) with block length $O(1/\delta^2)$. This quadratic dependence on the gap $\delta$ to capacity is known to be best possible. Our result thus yields a constructive version of Shannon's theorem with near-optimal convergence to capacity as a function of the block length. This resolves a central theoretical challenge associated with the attainment of Shannon capacity. Previously such a result was only known for the erasure channel.

Our codes are a variant of Ar?kan‚Äôs polar codes based on multiple carefully constructed local kernels, one for each intermediate channel that arises in the decoding. A crucial ingredient in the analysis is a strong converse of the noisy coding theorem when communicating using random linear codes on arbitrary BMS channels. Our converse theorem shows extreme unpredictability of even a single message bit for random coding at rates slightly above capacity.</summary>

    <title>TR19-153 |  Optimally Resilient Codes for List-Decoding from Insertions and Deletions | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Bernhard Haeupler, 

	Amirbehshad Shahrasbi</title>
    <summary>We give a complete answer to the following basic question: ``What is the maximal fraction of deletions or insertions tolerable by $q$-ary list-decodable codes with non-vanishing information rate?''

This question has been open even for binary codes, including the restriction to the binary insertion-only setting, where the best known results was that a $\gamma \leq 0.707$ fraction of insertions is tolerable by some binary code family.

For any desired $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we construct a family of binary codes of positive rate which can be efficiently list-decoded from any combination of $\gamma$ fraction of insertions and $\delta$ fraction of deletions as long as $ \gamma + 2\delta \leq 1 -\epsilon$. On the other hand, for any $\gamma, \delta$ with $\gamma + 2\delta = 1$ list-decoding is impossible. Our result thus precisely characterizes the feasibility region of binary list-decodable codes for insertions and deletions. 

We further generalize our result to codes over any finite alphabet of size $q$. Surprisingly, our work reveals that the feasibility region for $q&gt;2$ is *not* the natural generalization of the binary bound above. We provide tight upper and lower bounds that precisely pin down the feasibility region, which turns out to have a $(q-1)$-piece-wise linear boundary whose $q$ corner-points lie on a quadratic curve.  

The main technical work in our results is proving the existence of code families of sufficiently large *size* with good list-decoding properties for any combination of $\delta,\gamma$ within the claimed feasibility region. We achieve this via an intricate analysis of codes introduced by [Bukh, Ma; SIAM J. Discrete Math; 2014]. Finally we give a simple yet powerful concatenation scheme for list-decodable insertion-deletion codes which transforms any such (non-efficient) code family (with vanishing information rate) into an efficiently decodable code family with constant rate.</summary>

    <title>TR19-152 |   Quantum versus Randomized Communication Complexity, with Efficient Players | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz, 

	Avishay Tal</title>
    <summary>We study a new type of separation between quantum and classical communication complexity which is obtained using quantum protocols where all parties are efficient, in the sense that they can be implemented by small quantum circuits with oracle access to their inputs. More precisely, we give an explicit partial Boolean function that can be computed in the quantum-simultaneous-with-entanglement model of communication, however, every interactive randomized protocol is of exponentially larger cost. Furthermore, all the parties in the quantum protocol can be implemented by quantum circuits of small size with blackbox access to the inputs. Our result qualitatively matches the strongest known separation between quantum and classical communication complexity and is obtained using a quantum protocol where all parties are efficient.</summary>

<div>We prove bounds on the generalization error of convolutional networks. The bounds are characterized in terms of the training loss, the number of parameters, the Lipschitz constant of the loss, and the distance of the initial and final weights. The bounds are independent of the number of pixels in the input, as well as the width and height of hidden feature maps. These are the first bounds for DNNs with such guarantees.¬† We present experiments with CIFAR-10, varying hyperparameters of a deep convolutional network, comparing our bounds with practical generalization gaps.</div>

<p>Existing techniques for derandomizing algorithms based on circuit lower bounds yield a large polynomial slowdown in running time.¬†We show that assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we can convert any randomized algorithm running in time T to¬†a deterministic one running in time nearly T^2. Under complexity-theoretic assumptions, such a slowdown is nearly optimal.</p>
<p>In this talk I will concentrate on the role of error-correcting codes in those techniques. We will see which properties of error-correcting codes are¬†useful for constructing pseudorandomness primitives sufficient for derandomization, where they came short of achieving better slowdown, and how we can overcome that.</p>

<div>¬†There are many basic problems over sequences. For example, computing the edit distance between two sequences, detecting how RNA sequences fold, finding the distance between a sequence and a language (collection of sequences), understanding how disbalanced a parenthesis sequence is. They have natural applications in various areas including computational biology, natural language processing, compiler optimization, and data cleaning. The last few years have seen a plethora of results where new faster algorithms have been developed for these problems with various trade-offs between approximation (quality of solution) and running time (scalability). In this talk, I will present some of the tools that have been developed from my work related to these problems. Depending on time and audience choices, we will cover one or more of the following.</div>

<p><em>Local Computation Algorithms</em></p>
<p>Consider a setting in which inputs to and outputs from a computational¬†problem are so large, that there is not time to read them in their¬†entirety.¬†¬† However, if one is only interested in small parts of the¬†output at any given time, is it really necessary to solve the entire¬†computational problem? Is it even necessary to view the whole input?¬†We survey recent work in the model of¬† ‚Äúlocal computation algorithms‚Äù¬†which for a given input, supports queries by a user to values of¬†specified bits of a legal output.¬† The goal is to design local computation algorithms¬†in such a way that very little of the input needs to be seen in order¬†to determine the value of any single bit of the output. Though this model describes¬†sequential computations, techniques from local distributed algorithms have been extremely¬†important in designing efficient local computation algorithms.¬†In this talk, we describe results on a variety of problems for which¬†sublinear time and space local computation algorithms have been developed ‚Äî we will¬†give special focus to finding maximal independent sets and sparse¬†spanning graphs.</p>

    <title>TR19-151 |  Optimal Inapproximability with Universal Factor Graphs | 

	Johan Hastad, 

	Per Austrin, 

	Jonah Brown-Cohen</title>
    <summary>The factor graph of an instance of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is the bipartite graph indicating which variables appear in each constraint.  An instance of the CSP is given by the factor graph together with a list of which predicate is applied for each constraint. We establish that many Max-CSPs remains as hard to approximate as in the general case even when the factor graph is fixed (depending only on the size of the instance) and known in advance.

Examples of results obtained for this restricted setting are:

Optimal inapproximability for Max-3-Lin.

Approximation resistance for predicates supporting pairwise independent subgroups.

Hardness of the ``$(2+\epsilon)$-Sat'' problem and other Promise CSPs.

The main technical tool used to establish these results is a new way of folding the long code which we call ``functional folding''.</summary>

    <title>TR19-150 |  A Logical Characteristic of Read-Once Branching Programs | 

	Stanislav ≈Ω√°k</title>
    <summary>We present a mathematical model of the intuitive notions such as the
knowledge or the information arising at different stages of
computations on branching programs (b.p.). The model has two
appropriate
properties:\\
i) The "knowledge" arising at a stage of computation in question is
derivable from the "knowledge" arising at the previous stage
according to the rules of the model and according to the local
arrangement of the b.p.\\
ii) The model confirms the intuitively well-known fact that the
knowledge arising at a node of a computation depends not only on
it but in some cases also on a "mystery" information. (I. e.
different computations reaching the same node may have different
knowledge(s) arisen at it.)\\
We prove that with respect to our model no such information exists
in read-once b.p.`s but on the other hand in b. p.`s which are not
read-once such information must be present. The read-once property
forms a frontier.\\
More concretely, we may see the instances of our models as a systems
$S=(U,D)$ where $U$ is a universe of knowledge and $D$ are
derivation rules. We say that a b.p. $P$ is compatible with a system
$S$ iff along each computation in $P$ $S$ derives $F$ ($false$) or
$T$ ($true$) at the end correctly according to the label of the
reached sink. This key notion modifies the classic paradigm
according to which the computational complexity is defined with
respect to different classes of restricted b.p.`s (e.g. read-once
b.p.`s, k-b.p.`s, b.p.`s computing in limited time etc.). Now, the
restriction is defined by a subset of systems and only these
programs are taken into account which are compatible with
at least one of the chosen systems.\\
Further  we may understand the sets $U$ of knowledge(s) as a sets of
admissible logical formulae.  More rich  sets $U$`s imply the larger
(= more free) restrictions on b.p.`s and consequently the smaller
complexities of Boolean functions are detected. More rich logical
equipment implies stronger computational effectiveness.\\</summary>

They obtain a linear in the dimension competitive ratio for convex body chasing, a problem which was entirely open for any <img alt="d \geq 3" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e001a3fd5bcc2fc507220b28ff996717_l3.png?resize=42%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="42"/> just two years ago. What‚Äôs more is that they found <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11968">the algorithm (and proof)</a> from The Book! Let me explain.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>Convex body chasing</strong></p>
<p>In convex body chasing an online algorithm is presented at each time step with a convex body <img alt="K_t \subset \mathbb{R}^d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3fdc69e932e1950b410306bf5e91f317_l3.png?resize=65%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="65"/>, and it must choose a point <img alt="x_t \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-dcddd0271254f09cb70e59f7636af336_l3.png?resize=58%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="58"/>. The online algorithm is trying to minimize its total movement, namely <img alt="\sum_{t \geq 0} \|x_{t+1} - x_{t}\|" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="21" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ac0ba40fd0d872561b9bbfe0c2430fa6_l3.png?resize=132%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="132"/> (all the norms here will be Euclidean, for simplicity). To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, one benchmarks it against the smallest movement one could achieve for this sequence of bodies, if one knew in advance the whole sequence. A good example to have in mind is if the sequence <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> corresponds to lines rotating around some fixed point, then the best thing to do is to move to this fixed point and never move again, while a greedy algorithm might have infinite movement (in the continuous time limit). The competitive ratio is the worst case (over all possible sequences of convex bodies) ratio of the algorithm‚Äôs performance to those of the oracle optimum. This problem was introduced in 1993 by Linial and Friedman, mainly motivated by considering a more geometric version of the <a class="liimagelink" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2017/12/16/k-server-part-1-online-learning-and-online-algorithms/"><img alt="k" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9dc53f8ecc1bcf15020c6df4c12f1c27_l3.png?resize=9%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>-server problem</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this problem in fact has a lot of ‚Äúreal‚Äù applications. It is not too surprising given how elementary the problem is. Just to give a flavor, <a class="liexternal" href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~adamw/">Adam Wierman</a> and friends show that <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.caia.swin.edu.au/cv/landrew/pubs/capacity_provision_ToN.pdf">dynamic powering of data centers</a> can be viewed as an instance of convex *function* chasing. In convex function chasing, instead of a convex body one gets a convex function <img alt="f_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9bdb4107531e167960c3d7ea0ac6c6e3_l3.png?resize=14%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="14"/>, and there is then a movement cost <img alt="\|x_t - x_{t-1}\|" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a5c985c7efa58f7b4fc27244d6ceecab_l3.png?resize=85%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="85"/> and a *service cost* <img alt="f_t(x_t)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9a9f0c7799e133ea6e52dce0ee96f00f_l3.png?resize=43%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/>. While this is more general than convex body chasing, it turns out that convex body chasing in dimension <img alt="d+1" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c9bf571295c1727c51ef654b528967d2_l3.png?resize=39%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="39"/> is enough to solve convex function chasing in dimension <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> (this is left to the reader as an exercise). Roughly speaking in dynamic power management, one controls various power levels (number of servers online, etc), and a request correspond to a new set of jobs. Turning on/off servers has an associated cost (the movement cost), while servicing the jobs with a certain number of servers has an associated delay (the service cost). You get the idea.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>The Steiner point</strong></p>
<p>In <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00999">a paper</a> to appear at SODA too, we propose (with <a class="liexternal" href="http://yintat.com/">Yin Tat Lee</a>, <a class="liinternal" href="https://web.stanford.edu/~yuanzhil/">Yuanzhi Li</a>, <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/math/klartag/home">Bo‚Äôaz Klartag</a>, and <a class="liexternal" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~msellke/main">Mark Sellke</a>) to use the <strong>Steiner point</strong> for the nested convex body chasing problem. In nested convex body chasing the sequence of bodies is nested, and to account for irrelevant additive constant we assume that the oracle optimum starts from the worst point in the starting set <img alt="K_0" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-145ecd5f60fadeca35a63e23997d92f2_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/>. In other words, opt is starting at the point the furthest away in <img alt="K_0" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-145ecd5f60fadeca35a63e23997d92f2_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/> from the closest point in <img alt="K_T" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c59edf016e3136f9eb4e117bb8f69221_l3.png?resize=25%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>, so its movement is exactly equal to the <a class="liinternal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_distance" rel="nofollow">Hausdorff distance</a> between <img alt="K_0" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-145ecd5f60fadeca35a63e23997d92f2_l3.png?resize=22%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="22"/> and <img alt="K_T" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c59edf016e3136f9eb4e117bb8f69221_l3.png?resize=25%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>. So all we have to do is to give an online algorithm whose movement is proportional to this Hausdorff distance. Some kind of Lipschitzness in Hausdorff distance. Well, it turns out that mathematicians have been looking at this for centuries already, and Steiner back in the 1800‚Äôs introduced just what we need: a <strong>selector</strong> (a map from convex sets to points in them, i.e. <img alt="S(K) \in K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9a5879256c4564abf0f19723bdcbd0f2_l3.png?resize=80%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="80"/> for any convex set <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/>) which is Lipschitz with respect to the Hausdorff distance, that is:</p>

<p>Note that obtaining such a selector is not trivial, for example the first natural guess would be the center of gravity, but it turns out that this is <strong>not</strong> Lipschitz (consider for example what happens with <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> being a very thin triangle and <img alt="K'" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="14" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b063268581b06951ebc5637f21fad0fd_l3.png?resize=20%2C14&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> being the base of this triangle). Crazy thing is, this Steiner point selector (to be defined shortly) is not only Lipschitz, it is in fact <strong>the most Lipschitz selector</strong> for convex sets. How would you prove such a thing? Well, you clearly need a miracle to happen, and the miracle here is that the Steiner point satisfies some symmetries, which define it uniquely. From there all you need to do is that starting with any selector, you can add some of these symmetries while also improving the Lipschitz constant (for more on this see the references in the linked paper above).</p>
<p>OK, so what is the Steiner point? It has many definitions, but a particular appealing one from an optimizer‚Äôs viewpoint is as follows. For a convex set <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/> and a vector <img alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="16" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-24a3864c0a0fdb33b8b28c5c9e29f616_l3.png?resize=51%2C16&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="51"/> let <img alt="g_K(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d1ee2708d01f3d597e257c20c654f8bc_l3.png?resize=43%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="43"/> be the maximizer of the linear function <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> in the set <img alt="K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b760ebc707e08dd6e1888ea8da4c2454_l3.png?resize=16%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="16"/>.

The algorithm we proposed in our SODA paper is simply to move to <img alt="x_t = \mathrm{St}(K_t)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-07cd7d19d64122c29f27b6976bbe68f2_l3.png?resize=90%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="90"/>. Let us now see how to analyze this algorithm.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>The nested case proof</strong></p>
<p>First we give an alternative formula for the Steiner point. Denote <img alt="h_K(\theta) = \max_{x \in K} \theta \cdot x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8eebb9649a1de2ee8930a5cc0519bb77_l3.png?resize=168%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="168"/>, and observe that <img alt="g_K(\theta) = \nabla h_K(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f721cf39b79100662e95d1ee8ef8d5ea_l3.png?resize=128%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="128"/> for almost all <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>. Thus using the <a class="liinternal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem" rel="nofollow">divergence theorem</a> one obtains:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 21px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\[ \mathrm{St}(K) = d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [\theta h_K(\theta)] \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="21" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-9e786f72667e6f0939c1fc5e0e436e41_l3.png?resize=225%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="225"/></p>
<p>(The factor <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> comes from the ratio of the volume of the ball to the sphere, and the <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> in the expectation is because the normal to <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> is <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> on the sphere.)</p>
<p>Now we have the following one-line inequality to control the movement of the Steiner point:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 52px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\begin{align*} \|\mathrm{St}(K) - \mathrm{St}(K')\| &amp; = d \cdot \| \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [\theta (h_K(\theta) - h_{K'}(\theta))] \| \\ &amp; \leq d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ |h_K(\theta) - h_{K'}(\theta)| ] \end{align*}" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="52" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bf37a0d06362627ccbf1c16cdfccce58_l3.png?resize=410%2C52&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="410"/></p>
<p>It only remains to observe that <img alt="|h_K(\theta) - h_{K'}(\theta)| \leq \mathrm{dist}_H(K,K')" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fa3f0632ef28037f09617b6c8b676ba7_l3.png?resize=249%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="249"/> to obtain a proof that Steiner is <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/>-Lipschitz (in fact as an exercise you can try to improve the above argument to obtain <img alt="O(\sqrt{d})" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="20" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8286f5a825001e7cfbcea2430495a77b_l3.png?resize=51%2C20&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="51"/>-Lipschitz). Now for nested convex body chasing we will have <img alt="K' \subset K" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3c0e71eb2cbbf930d61ca3800bfa1559_l3.png?resize=61%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="61"/> so that</p>
<p><img alt="|h_K(\theta) - h_{K'}(\theta)| = h_K(\theta) - h_{K'}(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6e1794a42bb76829d10b26116a31d32e_l3.png?resize=267%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="267"/> (i.e., no absolute values), and thus the upper bound on the movement will telescope! More precisely:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 96px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\begin{align*} \sum_{t \geq 0} \|\mathrm{St}(K_t) - \mathrm{St}(K_{t+1})\| &amp; \leq d \cdot \sum_{t \geq 0} \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ h_{K_t}(\theta) - h_{K_{t+1}}(\theta) ] \\ &amp; = d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ h_{K_0}(\theta) - h_{K_{T}}(\theta) ] \\ &amp; \leq d \cdot \mathrm{dist}_H(K_0, K_T) \,. \end{align*}" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="96" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e648f7a36eb3795aae31e998ff0866c5_l3.png?resize=470%2C96&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="470"/></p>
<p>This proves that the Steiner point is <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/>-competitive for nested convex body chasing. How to generalize this to the non-nested case seemed difficult, and the breakthrough of Mark and the CMU team is to bring back an old friend of the online algorithm community: the work function.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p><strong>The work function</strong></p>
<p>The work function <img alt="W_t : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-c06617c85ba7669c6be3e632519a2dec_l3.png?resize=99%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="99"/> is defined as follows.

In the definition of the work function there is an associated trajectory for both <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> and <img alt="y" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-0e13c52c4764efa3f5b1e98e3c2cf98a_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>.

<p>A very simple property we will need from the work function is that the norm of its gradient carries some information on the current request. Namely, <img alt="x \not\in K_t \Rightarrow \|\nabla W_t(x)\| = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3b1e7323a40ebc675833af415d7b3d42_l3.png?resize=191%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="191"/> (indeed, if <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> is not in the current request set, then the best way to end up there is to move to a point <img alt="z" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d9d772a59543419785ce66946592259a_l3.png?resize=9%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> in <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> and then move to <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/>, and if <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> is a polytope then when you move a little bit <img alt="x" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1b9fbfb207b6d17d74b33c6d8342a1a4_l3.png?resize=10%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> you don‚Äôt move <img alt="z" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="8" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d9d772a59543419785ce66946592259a_l3.png?resize=9%2C8&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>, so the cost is changing at rate <img alt="1" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="7"/>, hence the norm of the gradient being <img alt="1" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-21b5b4cbe9a10b6d847eeb4265b99898_l3.png?resize=7%2C13&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="7"/>). Or to put it differently: <img alt="\|\nabla W_t(x)\| &lt; 1 \Rightarrow x \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d5613103c6538abdfe07fb8a6f0bdf73_l3.png?resize=189%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="189"/>.</p>

<p><strong>The Sellke point</strong></p>
<p>Mark‚Äôs beautiful idea (and the CMU team very much related ‚Äìin fact equivalent‚Äì idea) to generalize the Steiner point to the non-nested case is to use the work function as a surrogate for the request. Steiner of <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> will clearly not work since all of <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> does not matter in the same way, as some points might be essentially irrelevant because they are very far from the previous requests, a fact which will be uncovered by the work function (while on the other hand the random direction from the Steiner point definition is oblivious to the geometry of the previous requests). So how to pick an appropriately random point in <img alt="K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="15" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3acdb1aa9c31aca7aa2a197708de9e60_l3.png?resize=20%2C15&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="20"/> while respecting the work function structure? Well we just saw that <img alt="\|\nabla W_t(x)\| &lt; 1 \Rightarrow x \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="19" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d5613103c6538abdfe07fb8a6f0bdf73_l3.png?resize=189%2C19&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="189"/>. So how about taking a random direction <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/>, and applying the inverse of the gradient map, namely the gradient of the <strong>Fenchel dual</strong> <img alt="W_t^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="17" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef52bfe9fd84a48a8585c0d4cc7445c5_l3.png?resize=25%2C17&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/>? Recall that the Fenchel dual is defined by:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 29px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\[ W_t^*(\theta) = \max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} \theta \cdot x - W_t(x) \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="29" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-38f4e45e13b56402f2542d6d10104c23_l3.png?resize=216%2C29&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="216"/></p>
<p>This is exactly the algorithm Mark proposes and it goes like this (Mark calls it the *functional Steiner point*):</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 22px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\[ \mathrm{Se}(K_t) = \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| &lt; 1} [\nabla W_t^*(\theta)] \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="22" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-1c48be67527ecd410d08235502958d42_l3.png?resize=219%2C22&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="219"/></p>
<p>Crucially this is a valid point, namely <img alt="\mathrm{Se}(K_t) \in K_t" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4a1a15b2c69480b3c0cad98acf3b2ad9_l3.png?resize=94%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="94"/>. Moreover just like for the Steiner point we can apply the divergence theorem and obtain:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 22px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\[ \mathrm{Se}(K_t) = d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [\theta W_t^*(\theta)] \,. \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="22" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-329630ec5ed1634f7880d91ce9666807_l3.png?resize=235%2C22&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="235"/></p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that we can now <strong>exactly</strong> repeat the nested convex body argument, since <img alt="W_{t+1}^*(\theta) \leq W_t^*(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="21" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3dd6961afcbaae41b54d8e7651b9cd94_l3.png?resize=135%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="135"/> for all <img alt="\theta" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="12" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-218cdf16b16c99af5ecb73d9adb061f4_l3.png?resize=9%2C12&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="9"/> (just like we had in the nested case <img alt="h_{K_{t+1}}(\theta) \leq h_{K_t}(\theta)" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="21" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f34e37633e4a00d3fa90457f5a676ef7_l3.png?resize=139%2C21&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="139"/>) and so we get:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 40px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\[ \sum_{t \geq 0} \|\mathrm{Se}(K_t) - \mathrm{Se}(K_{t+1})\| \leq d \cdot \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ W_{0}^*(\theta) - W^*_{{T}}(\theta) ] \]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="40" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-593f9a9e90a2740715be744ac89275ac_l3.png?resize=426%2C40&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="426"/></p>
<p>The first term with <img alt="W_0^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="18" src="https://i0.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-03b6bb14cb85145aa8efb2ba6b6fba23_l3.png?resize=25%2C18&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="25"/> is just some additive constant which we can ignore, while the second term is bounded as follows:</p>
<p class="ql-center-displayed-equation" style="line-height: 105px;"><span class="ql-right-eqno"> ¬† </span><span class="ql-left-eqno"> ¬† </span><img alt="\begin{align*} \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ - W^*_{{T}}(\theta) ] &amp; = \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1} [ \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} W_t(x) - \theta \cdot x ] \\ &amp; \leq \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} \mathbb{E}_{\theta : \|\theta\| = 1}[ W_t(x) - \theta \cdot x ] \\ &amp; = \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^d} W_t(x) \,. \end{align*}" class="ql-img-displayed-equation " height="105" src="https://i1.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f7d98d503b4ecd2f79bb081ccddccceb_l3.png?resize=364%2C105&amp;ssl=1" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="364"/></p>
<p>Thus we exactly proved that the movement of the Sellke point is upped bounded by a constant plus <img alt="d" class="ql-img-inline-formula " height="13" src="https://i2.wp.com/blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-ef6965453c87cda7872c06b350e81478_l3.png?resize=10%2C13&amp;ssl=1" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" width="10"/> times the minimum of the work function, and the latter is nothing but the value of the oracle optimum!</p>
<p>Note that once everything is done and said, the proof has only <strong>two</strong> inequalities (triangle inequality as in the nested case, and the minimum of the expectation is less than the expectation of the minimum). It doesn‚Äôt get any better than this!</p></div>

    <title>TR19-149 |  Log-Seed Pseudorandom Generators via Iterated Restrictions | 

	Dean Doron, 

	William Hoza, 

	Pooya Hatami</title>
    <summary>There are only a few known general approaches for constructing explicit pseudorandom generators (PRGs). The ``iterated restrictions'' approach, pioneered by Ajtai and Wigderson [AW89], has provided PRGs with seed length $\mathrm{polylog} n$ or even $\tilde{O}(\log n)$ for several restricted models of computation. Can this approach ever achieve the optimal seed length of $O(\log n)$?

In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative. Using the iterated restrictions approach, we construct an explicit PRG for read-once depth-$2$ $\mathbf{AC}^0[\oplus]$ formulas with seed length $O(\log n) + \tilde{O}(\log(1/\epsilon))$. In particular, our PRG achieves optimal seed length $O(\log n)$ with near-optimal error $\epsilon = \exp(-\tilde{\Omega} (\log n))$. Even for constant error, the best prior PRG for this model (which includes read-once CNFs and read-once $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomials) has seed length $\Theta(\log n \cdot (\log \log n)^2)$ [Lee19]. 

A key step in the analysis of our PRG is a tail bound for subset-wise symmetric polynomials, a generalization of elementary symmetric polynomials. Like elementary symmetric polynomials, subset-wise symmetric polynomials provide a way to organize the expansion of $\prod_{i = 1}^m (1 + y_i)$. Elementary symmetric polynomials simply organize the terms by degree, i.e., they keep track of the number of variables participating in each monomial. Subset-wise symmetric polynomials keep track of more data: for a fixed partition of $[m]$, they keep track of the number of variables from each subset participating in each monomial. Our tail bound extends prior work by Gopalan and Yehudayoff [GY14] on elementary symmetric polynomials.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(I wrote this a while back so when I say `I Googled BLAH' I meant back then. It is prob different now.)<br/>
<br/>
While the web is a <i>wonderful</i> to find things out there are times when it doesn't quite work.  <br/>
<ol>
<li> An old blog of Scott Aaronson's  had as part of its title <a href="http://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=240">a Woitian Link</a>. Wanting to find out what <i>a Woitian Link</i> is but not wanting to bother Scott (he's busy enough making comments on Shtetl-Optimized) I went to google and typed in <i>"Woitian Link"</i>. The ONLY hits I got back were to Scotts blog. I finally had to email Scott. He told me that it was referring to the blog <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress">not even wrong</a> by Peter Woit which often has links that... Well, Scott never told me quite what it was but I'll go there myself and try to figure it out.<br/>
</li>
<li> An old blog of mine was <a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/2007/05/man-who-loved-algorithms.html">the man who loved algorithms</a>. Part of my blog said that I thought the man would be Knuth but it was not. (It was Thomas Kailath) One of the commenters said that it couldn't be Knuth since he was still alive. This made me want to check the original article to see if  Thomas Kailath, is also still alive (he is). I didn't have the issue with me at the time so I typed "the man who loved algorithms" into google. The first page of hits all refered to my posting.  Eventually I found one to verify that yes, indeed, he was still alive.<br/>
</li>
<li> Donald Knuth VOLUME FOUR was originally published in a series of fascicile's. Whats a fascicle? Here the web was helpful- Wikipedia said it was a book that comes out in short pieces, the pieces of which are called `fascicle'. They gave only one example: <i>Donald Knuth's Volume 4 will be coming out in Fascicle.</i> Still, they DID tell me what I want to know. (Note- this was a while back, they have since removed that comment.) For most things the web is great. But for some more obscure things, better off asking someone who knows stuff. </li>
</ol>
<div>
Do you have experiences where you ask the web for a question and you end up in a circle?</div></div>

    <title>News for October 2019</title>
    <summary>Last month was a lean month, with only three papers: one on direct product testing, one on finding forbidden patterns in a sequence, and one (an update of a paper which we had missed in the Spring) on quantum distribution testing. Direct sum testing ‚Äì the general case, by Irit Dinur and Konstantin Golubev (ECCC). [‚Ä¶]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Last month was a lean month, with only three papers: one on direct product testing,  one on finding forbidden patterns in a sequence, and one (an update of a paper which we had missed in the Spring) on quantum distribution testing.</p>



<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Direct sum testing ‚Äì the general case</strong>, by Irit Dinur and Konstantin Golubev (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/139/">ECCC</a>). Say a function \(f\colon \prod_{i=1}^d [n_i] \to \mathbb{F}_2\) is a direct product if it can be factored as \(f(x_1,\dots,x_d)=\sum_{i=1}^d f_i(x_i)\), where \(f_i\colon [n_i]\to\mathbb{F}_2\).<br/>This paper provides a 4-query tester (i.e., a <em>proximity oblivious tester</em> (POT)) for the direct product property, reminiscent of (and relying on) the BLR linearity test: specifically, draw two subsets \(S,T\subseteq [d]\) and two inputs \(x,y\in \prod_{i=1}^d [n_i]\) u.a.r., and accept iff<br/>\(f(x)+f(x_Sy)+f(x_Ty)+f(x_{S\Delta T}y) = 0\,.\)<br/>The main theorem of the paper is to show that the probability that this simple test rejects is lower bounded (up to a constant factor) by the distance of \(f\) to direct-product-ness. (The authors also provide a different POT making \(d+1\) queries, but with a simpler analysis.)</p>



<p><strong>Finding monotone patterns in sublinear time</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Cl√©ment Canonne, Shoham Letzter, and Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/134/">ECCC</a>). Given a function \(f\colon [n]\to\mathbb{R}\), a <em>monotone subsequence</em> of size \(k\) is a \(k\)-tuple of indices \(i_1 &lt; \dots &lt;i_k\) such that \(f(i_j) &lt; f(i_{j+1})\) for all \(j\). This work considers (non-adaptive) one-sided testing of monotone-subsequence-freeness, or, equivalently, the task of <em>finding</em> such a monotone subsequence in a function promised to contain many of them. (This, in particular, generalizes the problem of one-sided monotonicity testing, which is the case \(k=2\).) The main result is a full characterization of the query complexity of this question (for constant \(k\)): strange as the exponent may seem, \(\Theta_\varepsilon( (\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k\rfloor} )\) queries are necessary and sufficient. The  proof relies on a structural dichotomy result, stating that any  far-from-free sequence either contains ‚Äúeasy to find‚Äù increasing  subsequences with increasing gaps between the elements, or has a specific hierarchical structure.</p>



<p><strong>Quantum Closeness Testing: A Streaming Algorithm and Applications</strong>, by Nengkun Yu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03218">arXiv</a>). This paper is concerned with quantum distribution testing in the <em>local</em> model, which only allows a very restricted (albeit, as the author argues, more natural and easier to implement) type of measurements, and is particularly well-suited to a streaming setting. The main contribution of this paper is to show a connection to <em>classical</em> distribution testing, allowing one to obtain quantum distribution testing upper bounds from their classical distribution testing counterparts. In more detail, the paper shows that, from local measurements to two \(d\)-dimensional quantum states \(\rho,\sigma\), one can provide access to two classical distributions \(p,q\) on \(\approx d^2\) elements such that (i) \(\| p-q\|_2 \approx \|\rho-\sigma\|_2/d\) and (ii) \(\| p\|_2,\| q\|_2 = O(1/d)\).<br/>Using this connection, the paper proceeds to establish a variety of upper bounds for testing several distribution properties in the local quantum model.</p></div>

    <title>Call for opinions: Length of papes in conference proceedings in TCS</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As current chair of the editorial board of <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/">LIPIcs, Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics</a>, I have been looking at some data about the length of the papers published in the series. The average length of the articles published in LIPIcs in 2019 so far is of 15.8 pages, including front matter and bibliography. However, three of the published papers are over 40 pages and three conferences have an average article length above 20 pages (22,  23.9 and 28.4, respectively).<br/><br/>I have seen that some conferences in TCS have no limit on the length of the submitted papers. A colleague whose opinions I hold in high esteem wrote to me saying: <br/><blockquote>Some people in the "conference name removed" community strongly feel there should be no page limit. My opinion may not be as strong as some, but I believe these people have a point. </blockquote><blockquote>Whether we like it or not, most papers in the TOC community only appear in conferences. Many of those conferences have no page limit for submissions, and encourage authors to include all proofs while making sure that the key ideas are presented in the first 10 pages or so. Scientific progress is hindered when authors are then forced to take out parts of their writeups for the conference proceedings in order for their papers to fit within the page limits. One may wish that they'd publish a full version of their paper in a journal subsequently, but most of them won't bother. The net effect is that there is no actual paper with all the details, which is no good. </blockquote>I share the point made in the last sentence, but I am somewhat bothered by the fact that full versions of papers in TCS are increasingly not being submitted to journals. I am probably very old fashioned, but I feel that it is desirable to see our published results vetted by a journal-strength review process. I still view conferences as means for the rapid dissemination of results and as a meeting point for their community of reference, and I consider journals as the media for final archival publication of mature pieces of research. However, with my LIPIcs EB chair hat on and out of personal interest, I am keen to hear your opinion on whether it is good for the TCS community to publish only in conferences and to publish conference papers without page limits, bearing in mind that, quoting from the <a href="http://focs2019.cs.jhu.edu/cfp/">FOCS 2019 call for papers</a>:<br/><blockquote>Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the title page, references, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee‚Äôs discretion.  </blockquote>I'd be grateful if you could post your thoughts on this matter in the comment section. Let's focus on what is best for the dissemination of science, even though long articles are more expensive than those whose average length is around 15 pages.<br/><br/>I look forward to hearing your opinions. Thanks in advance!<br/><br/></div>

    <title>TR19-148 |  Simultaneous Max-Cut is harder to approximate than Max-Cut | 

	Amey Bhangale, 

	Subhash Khot</title>
    <summary>A systematic study of simultaneous optimization of constraint satisfaction problems was initiated in [BKS15]. The simplest such problem is the simultaneous Max-Cut. [BKKST18] gave a $.878$-minimum approximation algorithm for simultaneous Max-Cut which is {\em almost optimal} assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). For a single instance Max-Cut, [GW95] gave an $\alpha_{GW}$-approximation algorithm where $\alpha_{GW}\approx .87856720...$ which is {\em optimal} assuming the UGC.

It was left open whether one can achieve an $\alpha_{GW}$-minimum approximation algorithm for simultaneous Max-Cut. We answer the question by showing that there exists an absolute constant $\varepsilon_0\geq 10^{-5}$ such that it is NP-hard to get an $(\alpha_{GW}- \varepsilon_0)$-minimum approximation for simultaneous Max-Cut assuming the UGC.</summary>

    <title>TR19-147 |  Capacity-Approaching Deterministic Interactive Coding Schemes Against Adversarial Errors | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Shahar Samocha</title>
    <summary>We devise a deterministic interactive coding scheme with rate $1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon\log(1/\varepsilon)})$ against $\varepsilon$-fraction of adversarial errors. The rate we obtain is tight by a result of Kol and Raz (STOC 2013). Prior to this work, deterministic coding schemes for any constant fraction $\varepsilon&gt;0$ of adversarial errors could obtain rate no larger than $1/2$. Achieving higher rate was obtained either using probabilistic coding schemes by Haeupler (FOCS 2014) or otherwise assumed weaker error models such as binary symmetric channels, erasure channels or feedback channels.</summary>
