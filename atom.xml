    <title>TR20-160 |  Non-adaptive vs Adaptive Queries in the Dense Graph Testing Model | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>We study the relation between the query complexity of adaptive and non-adaptive testers in the dense graph model. 
It has been known for a couple of decades that the query complexity of non-adaptive testers is at most quadratic in the query complexity of adaptive testers. 
We show that this general result is essentially tight; that is, there exist graph properties for which any non-adaptive tester must have query complexity that is almost quadratic in the query complexity of the best general (i.e., adaptive) tester. 

More generally, for every $q:\N\to\N$ such that $q(n)\leq{\sqrt n}$ and constant $c\in[1,2]$, we show a graph property that is testable in $\Theta(q(n))$ queries, but its non-adaptive query complexity is $\Theta(q(n)^c)$, omitting $\poly(\log n)$ factors and ignoring the effect of the proximity parameter $\epsilon$. Furthermore, the upper bounds hold for one-sided error testers,
and are at most quadratic in $1/\epsilon$. 

These results are obtained through the use of general reductions that transport properties of ordered structured (like bit strings) to those of unordered structures (like unlabeled graphs). 
The main features of these reductions are query-efficiency and preservation of distance to the properties.
This method was initiated in our prior work ({\em ECCC}, TR20-149), and we significantly extend it here.</summary>

    <title>TR20-159 |  Relating existing powerful proof systems for QBF | 

	Leroy Chew</title>
    <summary>We advance the theory of QBF proof systems by showing the first simulation of the universal checking format QRAT by a theory-friendly system. We show that the sequent system G fully p-simulates QRAT, including the Extended Universal Reduction (EUR) rule which was recently used to show QRAT does not have strategy extraction. Because EUR heavily uses resolution paths our technique also brings resolution path dependency and sequent systems closer together. 
	While we do not recommend G for practical applications this work can potentially show what features are needed for a new QBF checking format stronger than QRAT.</summary>

<p>
Michael is a long-time friend who is a leader in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and much <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/">more</a>. He also overlapped with Ken at Oxford while visiting Les Valiant there in the mid-1980s. He is at the University of Pennsylvania in computer science along with his co-author Roth. Cynthia Dwork and Roth wrote an earlier <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/privacybook.html">book</a> on the related issue of Differential Privacy.</p>
<p>
Today we will talk about making algorithms ethical.</p>
<p>
Tuesday is the 2020 US national election for President, for Congress, and for state and local offices. Every four years we have a national election, and we cannot imagine a better motivation for making sure that algorithms are ethical. </p>
<p>
The word “algorithm” appears 157 times in their book. Two words used hand-in-hand with it are “data” (132 times) and “model” (103 times), both spread through all of the book’s 232 pages. Models of electorates, trained on data from past elections, inform the algorithms used by news agencies to make election-night projections. These carry more responsibilities than election-eve forecasts. There have been infamous mistakes, most notably the premature calls of Florida both ways in the 2000 election. </p>
<p>
We believe that Tuesday’s election in our novel pandemic situation requires attention to ethics from first principles. We will discuss why this is important. What it means to be ethical here? And how one can make an algorithm ethical? </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Issue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Algorithms have been around forever. Euclid devised his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">gcd</a> algorithm in 300 BCE. In the first half of the last century, the central issue was how to define that an algorithm is <b>effective</b>. This led to showing that some problems are <em>uncomputable</em>, so that algorithms for them are impossible.</p>
<p>
In the second half, the emphasis shifted to whether algorithms are <b>efficient</b>. This led to classifying problems as <em>feasible</em> or (contingently) <em>hard</em>. Although many algorithms for feasible problems have been improved in ways that redouble the effect of faster and cheaper hardware, the study of complexity classes such as <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> has given reasons why algorithms for hard problems may never be improvable.</p>
<p>
The new territory, that of Kearns and Roth, is whether algorithms are <b>ethical</b>. Current ones that they and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction">others</a> have critqued as unethical accompany models for the likes of mortgages, small-business loans, parole decisions, and college admissions. The training data for these models often bakes in past biases. Besides problems of racial and gender bias and concerns of societal values, the raw fact is that past biases cause the models to miss the mark for today’s applications. For algorithms with such direct application to society, ethical design is critical. </p>
<p>
But this requirement is further reaching that one might initially imagine, so that as with computability and complexity, the factors can be ingrained in the <em>problems</em>. </p>
<p>
Consider a simple problem: We given a collection of pairs of numbers <img alt="{(x,y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{(x,y)}"/>. We are to predict whether this number pair has the property </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x + y \ge 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%2B+y+%5Cge+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  x + y \ge 0. "/></p>
<p>This is pretty easy if we can use both <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/>. But imagine a world where <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> is allowed to be viewed but <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/> is secret. Perhaps the law requires that we cannot use <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{y}"/>—it is illegal. Now we might do as poorly as <img alt="{50\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B50%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{50\%}"/>. Suppose that the data consists of </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2) \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%281%2C-1%29%2C+%281%2C1%29%2C+%282%2C-2%29%2C+%282%2C2%29+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  (1,-1), (1,1), (2,-2), (2,2) \dots "/></p>
<p>Then seeing only <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x}"/> gives no advantage, while giving both is perfect. Thus what in these simplified terms counts as an ethical algorithm is a poor predictor, whereas an unethical one is perfect. </p>
<p>
The blurb for the Kearns-Roth book says that they “…explain how we can better embed human principles into machine code—without halting the advance of data-driven scientific exploration.” While we agree their approach is vital, we suspect that as with complexity there will be indelibly ethically hard tasks. We wonder whether election modeling has already become one of them. </p>
<p>
Ken and I have two separate takes on this. We will do the first and then the other in a second post.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Red/Blue Leakage, Bias, and Ethics </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One question on everyone’s minds is whether we will see a repeat of the forecasting misses from 2016. Let us remind that our own Election Day 2016 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/unskewing-the-election/">post</a> started by defending Nate Silver of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> for giving Donald Trump as much as a 30% chance to defeat Hillary Clinton. He had been attacked by representatives of many news and opinion agencies whose models had Clinton well over 90%. </p>
<p>
We wonder whether these models were affected by the kind of biases highlighted in the book by Kearns and Roth. We must say right away that we are neither alleging conscious biases nor questioning the desire for prediction accuracy. One issue in ethical modeling (for parole, loans, admissions) is the divergence between algorithm outcomes that are most <em>predictive</em> versus those that are best for society. Here we agree that accurate prediction—and accurate projections as results come in after the polls close—is paramount. However, the algorithms used for the latter projections (which were not at fault in 2016 but have been wrong previously) may be even more subject to what we as computer scientists with crypto background see as a “leakage” issue.</p>
<p>
Here is the point. Ideally, models using polling data and algorithms reading the Election Night returns should read the numbers as if they did not have ‘R’ and ‘D’ attached to them. Their own workings should be invariant under transformations that interchange Joe Biden and Donald Trump, or whoever are opposed in a local race. However, a crucial element in the projection models in particular is knowledge of voting geography. They must use data on the general voting preferences of regions where much of the vote is still extant. Thus they cannot avoid intimate knowledge of who is ‘R’ and who is ‘D.’ There is no double-blind or zero-knowledge approach to the subjects being projected.</p>
<p>
There is also the question of error bars. A main point of our 2016 post (and of Silver’s analysis) was the high uncertainty factor that could be read from how the Clinton-Trump race unfolded. Underestimating uncertainty causes overconfidence in models. This can result from “groupthink” of the kind we perceive in newsrooms of many of the same outlets that are doing the projections. The algorithms ought to be isolated from opinions of those in the organization, but again there is reason from the last election to wonder about leakage.</p>
<p>
Unlike cases addressed by Kearns and Roth, we do not see a solution to suggest. As in our simple <img alt="{x+y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{x+y}"/> example, prior knowledge of the data in full may be needed for prediction. This may just be an “Ethics-Hard” problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
The word “election” does <i>not</i> appear in Kearns and Roth’s book.  What further application of their standpoint to elections would you make?</p>
<p>Ken sees a larger question of ethical modeling decisions given the unprecedented circumstances of the current election.  This comes not from spatial geography distorted by the pandemic but rather from the dimension of time injected by massive early voting and late counting of many mailed ballots.  He will address this next.</p></font></font></div>

block-structured quadrangular meshes, and the field singularities have a key
impact on the structure of the resulting meshes. In this paper, we extend
Ginzburg-Landau cross field generation methods with a new formulation that
allows a user to impose inner singularities. The cross field is computed via
the optimization of a linear objective function with localized quadratic
constraints. This method consists in fixing singularities in small holes
drilled in the computational domain with specific degree conditions on their
boundaries, which leads to non-singular cross fields on the drilled domain. We
also propose a way to calculate the Ginzburg-Landau energy of these cross
fields on the perforated domain by solving a Neumann linear problem. This
energy converges to the energy of the Ginzburg-Landau functional as epsilon and
the radius of the holes tend to zero. To obtain insights concerning the sum of
the inner singularity degrees, we give: (i) an extension of the Ginzburg-Landau
energy to the piecewise smooth domain allowing to identify the positions and
degrees of the boundary singularities, and (ii) an interpretation of the
Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem focusing on internal singularities.

    <title>Online Edge Coloring Algorithms via the Nibble Method</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1604275200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bhattacharya:Sayan.html">Sayan Bhattacharya</a>, Fabrizio Grandoni, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wajc:David.html">David Wajc</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16376">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Nearly thirty years ago, Bar-Noy, Motwani and Naor [IPL'92] conjectured that
an online $(1+o(1))\Delta$-edge-coloring algorithm exists for $n$-node graphs
of maximum degree $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. This conjecture remains open in
general, though it was recently proven for bipartite graphs under
\emph{one-sided vertex arrivals} by Cohen et al.~[FOCS'19]. In a similar vein,
we study edge coloring under widely-studied relaxations of the online model.
</p>
<p>Our main result is in the \emph{random-order} online model. For this model,
known results fall short of the Bar-Noy et al.~conjecture, either in the degree
bound [Aggarwal et al.~FOCS'03], or number of colors used [Bahmani et
al.~SODA'10]. We achieve the best of both worlds, thus resolving the Bar-Noy et
al.~conjecture in the affirmative for this model.
</p>
<p>Our second result is in the adversarial online (and dynamic) model with
\emph{recourse}. A recent algorithm of Duan et al.~[SODA'19] yields a
$(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring with poly$(\log n/\epsilon)$ recourse. We
achieve the same with poly$(1/\epsilon)$ recourse, thus removing all dependence
on $n$.
</p>
<p>Underlying our results is one common offline algorithm, which we show how to
implement in these two online models. Our algorithm, based on the R\"odl Nibble
Method, is an adaptation of the distributed algorithm of Dubhashi et
al.~[TCS'98]. The Nibble Method has proven successful for distributed edge
coloring. We display its usefulness in the context of online algorithms.

Williamson</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16316">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Over the last two decades, a significant line of work in theoretical
algorithms has been progress in solving linear systems of the form
$\mathbf{L}\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is the Laplacian matrix
of a weighted graph with weights $w(i,j)&gt;0$ on the edges. The solution
$\mathbf{p}$ of the linear system can be interpreted as the potentials of an
electrical flow. Kelner, Orrechia, Sidford, and Zhu \cite{KOSZ13} give a
combinatorial, near-linear time algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff Current
Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff Potential Law. Here we consider a dual
version of the algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff Potential Law, and
gradually enforces the Kirchoff Current Law. We prove that this dual algorithm
also runs in a near-linear number of iterations. Each iteration requires
updating all potentials on one side of a fundamental cut of a spanning tree by
a fixed amount. If this update step can be performed in polylogarithmic time,
we can also obtain a near-linear time algorithm to solve $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{p}
= \mathbf{b}$. However, if we abstract this update step as a natural data
structure problem, we show that we can use the data structure to solve a
problem that has been conjectured to be difficult for dynamic algorithms, the
online vector-matrix-vector problem \cite{HKNS15}. The conjecture implies that
the data structure does not have an $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for any
$\epsilon &gt; 0$. Thus our dual algorithm cannot be near-linear time algorithm
for solving $\mathbf{L}\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}$ unless we are able to take
advantage of the structure of the particular update steps that our algorithm
uses.

William Helton</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16290">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider 3XOR games with perfect commuting operator strategies. Given any
3XOR game, we show existence of a perfect commuting operator strategy for the
game can be decided in polynomial time. Previously this problem was not known
to be decidable. Our proof leads to a construction, showing a 3XOR game has a
perfect commuting operator strategy iff it has a perfect tensor product
strategy using a 3 qubit (8 dimensional) GHZ state. This shows that for perfect
3XOR games the advantage of a quantum strategy over a classical strategy
(defined by the quantum-classical bias ratio) is bounded. This is in contrast
to the general 3XOR case where the optimal quantum strategies can require high
dimensional states and there is no bound on the quantum advantage.
</p>
<p>To prove these results, we first show equivalence between deciding the value
of an XOR game and solving an instance of the subgroup membership problem on a
class of right angled Coxeter groups. We then show, in a proof that consumes
most of this paper, that the instances of this problem corresponding to 3XOR
games can be solved in polynomial time.

has received growing attention in recent years. In STOC'18, Assadi et al.
presented a distributed algorithm for maintaining an MIS with $O(1)$
(amortized) round complexity and $O(m^{3/4})$ message complexity, where $m$
denotes the dynamic number of edges in the graph. The algorithm of Assadi et
al. is deterministic; to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art
distributed algorithm for this problem with a message complexity of
$o(m^{3/4})$ incurs a round complexity of $\Omega(m^{1/3})$. We propose a
deterministic distributed algorithm that achieves an amortized message
complexity of $\tilde{O}(m^{2/3})$ and an amortized round complexity of
$\tilde{O}(1)$ under fully dynamic edge updates in the CONGEST model, where
$\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ suppresses polylogarithmic factors.

    <title>Glauber dynamics for colourings of chordal graphs and graphs of bounded treewidth</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1604275200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Heinrich:Marc.html">Marc Heinrich</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.16158">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Glauber dynamics on the colourings of a graph is a random process which
consists in recolouring at each step a random vertex of a graph with a new
colour chosen uniformly at random among the colours not already present in its
neighbourhood. It is known that when the total number of colours available is
at least $\Delta +2$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph, this
process converges to a uniform distribution on the set of all the colourings.
Moreover, a well known conjecture is that the time it takes for the convergence
to happen, called the mixing time, is polynomial in the size of the graph. Many
weaker variants of this conjecture have been studied in the literature by
allowing either more colours, or restricting the graphs to particular classes,
or both. This paper follows this line of research by studying the mixing time
of the Glauber dynamics on chordal graphs, as well as graphs of bounded
treewidth. We show that the mixing time is polynomial in the size of the graph
in the two following cases:
</p>
<p>- on graphs with bounded treewidth, and at least $\Delta +2$ colours,
</p>
<p>- on chordal graphs if the number of colours is at least $(1+\varepsilon)
(\Delta +1)$, for any fixed constant $\varepsilon$.

high-dimensional data is computationally challenging. For this problem, both
memory and computational requirements scale quadratically with the dimension.
Fortunately, high-dimensional covariance matrices observed in text,
click-through, and meta-genomics datasets are often sparse. In this paper, we
consider the problem of efficiently estimating a sparse covariance matrix,
which can scale to matrices with trillions of entries. The scale of the
datasets requires the algorithm to be online, as any second pass over the data
is prohibitive. In this paper, we propose Active Sampling Count Sketch (ASCS),
an online and one-pass sketching algorithm, that recovers the large entries of
the covariance matrix accurately. Count Sketch (CS), and other sub-linear
compressed sensing algorithms, offer a natural solution to the problem in
theory. However, vanilla CS does not work well in practice due to a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At the heart of our approach is a novel active
sampling strategy that increases the SNR of classical count sketches. We
demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm with synthetic data and
real-world high dimensional datasets. ASCS significantly improves over vanilla
CS, demonstrating the merit of our active sampling strategy.

analysis may contain hundreds of billions of edges. Yet, they are not
necessarily stored efficiently, and standard graph representations such as
adjacency lists waste a significant number of bits while graph compression
schemes such as WebGraph often require time-consuming decompression. To address
this, we propose Log(Graph): a graph representation that combines high
compression ratios with very low-overhead decompression to enable cheaper and
faster graph processing. The key idea is to encode a graph so that the parts of
the representation approach or match the respective storage lower bounds. We
call our approach "graph logarithmization" because these bounds are usually
logarithmic. Our high-performance Log(Graph) implementation based on modern
bitwise operations and state-of-the-art succinct data structures achieves high
compression ratios as well as performance. For example, compared to the tuned
Graph Algorithm Processing Benchmark Suite (GAPBS), it reduces graph sizes by
20-35% while matching GAPBS' performance or even delivering speedups due to
reducing amounts of transferred data. It approaches the compression ratio of
the established WebGraph compression library while enabling speedups of up to
more than 2x. Log(Graph) can improve the design of various graph processing
engines or libraries on single NUMA nodes as well as distributed-memory
systems.

    <title>Around the diameter of AT-free graphs</title>

connected $m$-edge graphs, for some positive $b &lt; 2$. Roditty and Vassilevska
Williams (STOC'13) proved that under plausible complexity assumptions, there is
no truly subquadratic algorithm for computing the diameter of general graphs.
In this work, we present positive and negative results on the existence of such
algorithms for computing the diameter on some special graph classes.
Specifically, three vertices in a graph form an asteroidal triple (AT) if
between any two of them there exists a path that avoids the closed
neighbourhood of the third one. We call a graph AT-free if it does not contain
an AT. We first prove that for all $m$-edge AT-free graphs, one can compute all
the eccentricities in truly subquadratic ${\cal O}(m^{3/2})$ time. Then, we
extend our study to several subclasses of chordal graphs -- all of them
generalizing interval graphs in various ways --, as an attempt to understand
which of the properties of AT-free graphs, or natural generalizations of the
latter, can help in the design of fast algorithms for the diameter problem on
broader graph classes. For instance, for all chordal graphs with a dominating
shortest path, there is a linear-time algorithm for computing a diametral pair
if the diameter is at least four. However, already for split graphs with a
dominating edge, under plausible complexity assumptions, there is no truly
subquadratic algorithm for deciding whether the diameter is either $2$ or $3$.

$\kappa \in \mathbb{R}$ is fixed. Various characteristics of $S$ such as its
surface measure and the largest $M$ for which it is non-empty, were computed
heuristically in statistical physics in the asymptotic regime $N \to \infty$,
$M/N \to \alpha$. The case $\kappa&lt;0$ is of special interest as $S$ is
conjectured to exhibit a hierarchical tree-like geometry known as "full
replica-symmetry breaking" (FRSB) close to the satisfiability threshold
$\alpha_{\text{SAT}}(\kappa)$, and whose characteristics are captured by a
Parisi variational principle akin to the one appearing in the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. In this paper we design an efficient algorithm
which, given oracle access to the solution of the Parisi variational principle,
exploits this conjectured FRSB structure for $\kappa&lt;0$ and outputs a vector
$\hat{\sigma}$ satisfying $\langle g_a , \hat{\sigma}\rangle \ge \kappa

$\sqrt{\bar{q} N}$, where $\bar{q} \in (0,1)$ is the right-end of the support
of the associated Parisi measure. We expect $\hat{\sigma}$ to be approximately
the barycenter of a pure state of the spherical perceptron. Moreover we expect
that $\bar{q} \to 1$ as $\alpha \to \alpha_{\text{SAT}}(\kappa)$, so that
$\big\langle g_a,\hat{\sigma}/|\hat{\sigma}|\big\rangle \geq
(\kappa-o(1))\sqrt{N}$ near criticality.

<p>For combinatorial algorithms, we provide a new analysis of the classical

in a system of $k$ trees, or the Cartesian product of $k$ trees, we can compute
all eccentricities in ${\cal O}(2^{{\cal O}(k\log{k})}(N+n)^{1+o(1)})$ time,
where $N$ is the cumulative total order over all these $k$ trees. This is near
optimal under the Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis, even in the very special
case of an $n$-vertex graph embedded in a system of $\omega(\log{n})$ spanning
trees. However, given such an embedding in the strong product of $k$ trees,
there is a much faster ${\cal O}(N + kn)$-time algorithm for this problem. All
our positive results can be turned into approximation algorithms for the graphs
and finite spaces with a quasi isometric embedding in trees, if such embedding
is given as input, where the approximation factor (resp., the approximation
constant) depends on the distortion of the embedding (resp., of its stretch).
The existence of embeddings in the Cartesian product of finitely many trees has
been thoroughly investigated for cube-free median graphs. We give the
first-known quasi linear-time algorithm for computing the diameter within this
graph class. It does not require an embedding in a product of trees to be given
as part of the input. On our way, being given an $n$-node tree $T$, we propose
a data structure with ${\cal O}(n\log{n})$ pre-processing time in order to
compute in ${\cal O}(k\log^2{n})$ time the eccentricity of any subset of $k$
nodes. We combine the latter technical contribution, of independent interest,
with a recent distance-labeling scheme that was designed for cube-free median
graphs.

    <title>Eccentricity queries and beyond using Hub Labels</title>

networks and other large complex networks, often answering to a query within a
few microseconds for graphs with millions of edges. In this work, we study
their algorithmic applications beyond distance queries. We focus on
eccentricity queries and distance-sum queries, for several versions of these
problems on directed weighted graphs, that is in part motivated by their
importance in facility location problems. On the negative side, we show
conditional lower bounds for these above problems on unweighted undirected
sparse graphs, via standard constructions from "Fine-grained" complexity.
However, things take a different turn when the hub labels have a sublogarithmic
size. Indeed, given a hub labeling of maximum label size $\leq k$, after
pre-processing the labels in total $2^{{O}(k)} \cdot |V|^{1+o(1)}$ time, we can
compute both the eccentricity and the distance-sum of any vertex in $2^{{O}(k)}
\cdot |V|^{o(1)}$ time. It can also be applied to the fast global computation
of some topological indices. Finally, as a by-product of our approach, on any
fixed class of unweighted graphs with bounded expansion, we can decide whether
the diameter of an $n$-vertex graph in the class is at most $k$ in $f(k) \cdot
n^{1+o(1)}$ time, for some "explicit" function $f$.

learning potentially offer an exponential speedup over all known classical
algorithms. However, there also exist obstacles to obtaining this potential
speedup in useful problem instances. The essential obstacle for quantum
differential equation solving is that outputting useful information may require
difficult post-processing, and the essential obstacle for quantum machine
learning is that inputting the training set is a difficult task just by itself.
In this paper, we demonstrate, when combined, these difficulties solve one
another. We show how the output of quantum differential equation solving can
serve as the input for quantum machine learning, allowing dynamical analysis in
terms of principal components, power spectra, and wavelet decompositions. To
illustrate this, we consider continuous time Markov processes on
epidemiological and social networks. These quantum algorithms provide an
exponential advantage over existing classical Monte Carlo methods.

paper of Fox, Panigrahi, and Zhang which gives an extension of the Karger-Stein
algorithm to minimum cuts and minimum $k$-cuts in hypergraphs. When specialized
to the case of graphs, the algorithm is somewhat different than the original
Karger-Stein algorithm. We show that the analysis becomes particularly clean in
this case: we can prove that the probability that a fixed minimum cut in an $n$
node graph is returned by the algorithm is bounded below by $1/(2H_n-2)$, where
$H_n$ is the $n$th harmonic number. We also consider other similar variants of
the algorithm, and show that no such algorithm can achieve an asymptotically
better probability of finding a fixed minimum cut.

social networks and fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics have been
widely studied. For such structures, bisimulation is a natural notion for
characterizing indiscernibility between states or individuals. There are two
kinds of bisimulations for fuzzy structures: crisp bisimulations and fuzzy
bisimulations. While the latter fits to the fuzzy paradigm, the former has also
attracted attention due to the application of crisp equivalence relations, for
example, in minimizing structures. Bisimulations can be formulated for fuzzy
labeled graphs and then adapted to other fuzzy structures. In this article, we
present an efficient algorithm for computing the partition corresponding to the
largest crisp bisimulation of a given finite fuzzy labeled graph. Its
complexity is of order $O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$, where $n$, $m$ and $l$ are
the number of vertices, the number of nonzero edges and the number of different
fuzzy degrees of edges of the input graph, respectively. We also study a
similar problem for the setting with counting successors, which corresponds to
the case with qualified number restrictions in description logics and graded
modalities in modal logics. In particular, we provide an efficient algorithm
with the complexity $O((m\log{m} + n)\log{n})$ for the considered problem in
that setting.

    <title>Three computational models and its equivalence</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1604188800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ciro Ivan Garcia Lopez <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15600">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The study of computability has its origin in Hilbert's conference of 1900,
where an adjacent question, to the ones he asked, is to give a precise
description of the notion of algorithm. In the search for a good definition
arose three independent theories: Turing and the Turing machines, G\"odel and
the recursive functions, Church and the Lambda Calculus.
</p>
<p>Later there were established by Kleene that the classic models of computation
are equivalent. This fact is widely accepted by many textbooks and the proof is
omitted since the proof is tedious and unreadable. We intend to fill this gap
presenting the proof in a modern way, without forgetting the mathematical
details.

problems. It uses the weighted greedy algorithm as a basic building block. By
multiplicative updates of the weights attached to the elements, the greedy
solution is iteratively improved. The implementation of this algorithm is
trivial and the algorithm is essentially free of parameters that would require
tuning. More iterations can only improve the solution. This set of features
makes the approach attractive for practical problems.

Efficiently
computing such nodes has received a lot of attention. When considering the
generalization of computing central groups of nodes, challenging optimization
problems occur. In this work, we study two such problems, group-harmonic
maximization and group-closeness maximization both from a theoretical and from
an algorithm engineering perspective.
</p>
<p>On the theoretical side, we obtain the following results. For group-harmonic
maximization, unless $P=NP$, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that
achieves an approximation factor better than $1-1/e$ (directed) and $1-1/(4e)$
(undirected), even for unweighted graphs. On the positive side, we show that a
greedy algorithm achieves an approximation factor of $\lambda(1-2/e)$
(directed) and $\lambda(1-1/e)/2$ (undirected), where $\lambda$ is the ratio of
minimal and maximal edge weights. For group-closeness maximization, the
undirected case is $NP$-hard to be approximated to within a factor better than
$1-1/(e+1)$ and a constant approximation factor is achieved by a local-search
algorithm. For the directed case, however, we show that, for any
$\epsilon&lt;1/2$, the problem is $NP$-hard to be approximated within a factor of
$4|V|^{-\epsilon}$.
</p>
<p>From the algorithm engineering perspective, we provide efficient
implementations of the above greedy and local search algorithms. In our
experimental study we show that, on small instances where an optimum solution
can be computed in reasonable time, the quality of both the greedy and the
local search algorithms come very close to the optimum. On larger instances,
our local search algorithms yield results with superior quality compared to
existing greedy and local search solutions, at the cost of additional running
time. We thus advocate local search for scenarios where solution quality is of
highest concern.

    <title>Free-boundary conformal parameterization of point clouds</title>

interest in the use of point clouds in science and engineering. To facilitate
the computations and analyses of point clouds, prior works have considered
parameterizing them onto some simple planar domains with a fixed boundary shape
such as a unit circle or a rectangle. However, the geometry of the fixed shape
may lead to some undesirable distortion in the parameterization. It is
therefore more natural to consider free-boundary conformal parameterizations of
point clouds, which minimize the local geometric distortion of the mapping
without constraining the overall shape. In this work, we propose a novel
approximation scheme of the Laplace--Beltrami operator on point clouds and
utilize it for developing a free-boundary conformal parameterization method for
disk-type point clouds. With the aid of the free-boundary conformal
parameterization, high-quality point cloud meshing can be easily achieved.
Furthermore, we show that using the idea of conformal welding in complex
analysis, the point cloud conformal parameterization can be computed in a
divide-and-conquer manner. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method.

curvature, we propose a similar approach for networks. To this end we make
appeal to three types of discrete curvature, namely the graph Forman-, full
Forman- and Haantjes-Ricci curvatures for edge-based and node-based sampling.
We present the results of experiments on real life networks, as well as for
square grids arising in Image Processing. Moreover, we consider fitting Ricci
flows and we employ them for the detection of networks' backbone. We also
develop embedding kernels related to the Forman-Ricci curvatures and employ
them for the detection of the coarse structure of networks, as well as for
network visualization with applications to SVM. The relation between the Ricci
curvature of the original manifold and that of a Ricci curvature driven
discretization is also studied.

property of a randomized algorithm is preserved when one replaces the atomic
registers that the algorithm uses with linearizable (implementations of)
registers. We show that in general this is not so: roughly speaking, every
randomized algorithm A has a corresponding algorithm A' that solves the same
problem if the registers that it uses are atomic or strongly-linearizable, but
does not terminate if these registers are replaced with "merely" linearizable
ones. Together with a previous result shown in [15], this implies that one
cannot use the well-known ABD implementation of registers in message-passing
systems to automatically transform any randomized algorithm that works in
shared-memory systems into a randomized algorithm that works in message-passing
systems: with a strong adversary the resulting algorithm may not terminate.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A global pandemic, apocalyptic fires, and the possible descent of the US into violent anarchy three days from now can do strange things to the soul.</p>



<p>Bertrand Russell—and if he’d done nothing else in his long life, I’d love him forever for it—once wrote that “in adolescence, I hated life and was continually on the verge of suicide, from which, however, I was restrained by the desire to know more mathematics.”  This summer, unable to bear the bleakness of 2020, I obsessively read up on the celebrated proof of the unsolvability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">Continuum Hypothesis</a> (CH) from the standard foundation of mathematics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms</a> of set theory.  (In this post, I’ll typically refer to “ZFC,” which means Zermelo-Fraenkel plus the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a>.)</p>



<p>For those tuning in from home, the Continuum Hypothesis was formulated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, shortly after his epochal discovery that there are different orders of infinity: so for example, the infinity of real numbers (denoted C for continuum, or \( 2^{\aleph_0} \)) is strictly greater than the infinity of integers (denoted ℵ<sub>0</sub>, or “Aleph-zero”).  CH is simply the statement that there’s no infinity <em>intermediate</em> between ℵ<sub>0</sub> and C: that anything greater than the first is at least the second.  Cantor tried in vain for decades to prove or disprove CH; the quest is believed to have contributed to his mental breakdown.  When David Hilbert presented his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems">famous list</a> of 23 unsolved math problems in 1900, CH was at the very top.</p>



<p>Halfway between Hilbert’s speech and today, the question of CH was finally “answered,” with the solution earning the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal">Fields Medal</a> that’s ever been awarded for work in set theory and logic.  But unlike with any previous yes-or-no question in the history of mathematics, the answer was that there provably <em>is</em> no answer from the accepted axioms of set theory!  You can either have intermediate infinities or not; neither possibility can create a contradiction.  And if you <em>do</em> have intermediate infinities, it’s up to you how many: 1, 5, 17, ∞, etc.</p>



<p>The easier half, the consistency of CH with set theory, was proved by incompleteness dude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a> in 1940; the harder half, the consistency of not(CH), by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cohen">Paul Cohen</a> in 1963.  Cohen’s work introduced the method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a>, which was so fruitful in proving set-theoretic questions unsolvable that it quickly took over the whole subject of set theory.  Learning Gödel and Cohen’s proofs had been a dream of mine since teenagerhood, but one I constantly put off.</p>



<p>This time around I started with <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.rmjm/1181070010">Cohen’s retrospective essay</a>, as well as Timothy Chow’s <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/sci.math.research/c/pQdPHJYML0E/m/ZrvqIxpd1sIJ?pli=1">Forcing for Dummies</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1320">A Beginner’s Guide to Forcing</a>.  I worked through Cohen’s own <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Continuum-Hypothesis-Dover-Mathematics/dp/0486469212">Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis</a>, and Ken Kunen’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Independence-Studies-Foundations-Mathematics/dp/0444868399">Set Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs</a>, and <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scott67.pdf">Dana Scott’s 1967 paper</a> reformulating Cohen’s proof.  I emailed questions to Timothy Chow, who was ridiculously generous with his time.  When Tim and I couldn’t answer something, we tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Solovay">Bob Solovay</a> (one of the world’s great set theorists, who later worked in computational complexity and quantum computing), or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Blass">Andreas Blass</a> or <a href="http://karagila.org/">Asaf Karagila</a>.  At some point mathematician and friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kuperberg">Greg Kuperberg</a> joined my quest for understanding.  I thank all of them, but needless to say take sole responsibility for all the errors that surely remain in these posts.</p>



<p>On the one hand, the proof of the independence of CH would seem to stand with general relativity, the wheel, and the chocolate bar as a triumph of the human intellect.  It represents a culmination of Cantor’s quest to know the basic rules of infinity—all the more amazing if the answer turns out to be that, in some sense, we <em>can’t</em> know them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, perhaps no other scientific discovery of equally broad interest remains so sparsely popularized, not even (say) quantum field theory or the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem.  I found barely any attempts to explain how forcing works to non-set-theorists, let alone to non-mathematicians.  One notable exception was Timothy Chow’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1320">Beginner’s Guide to Forcing</a>, mentioned earlier—but Chow himself, near the beginning of his essay, calls forcing an “open exposition problem,” and admits that he hasn’t solved it.  My modest goal, in this post and the following ones, is to make a further advance on the exposition problem.</p>



<p>OK, but why a doofus computer scientist like me?  Why not, y’know, an actual expert?  I won’t put forward my ignorance as a qualification, although I <em>have</em> often found that the better I learn a topic, the more completely I forget what initially confused me, and so the less able I become to explain things to beginners.</p>



<p>Still, there is <em>one</em> thing I know well that turns out to be intimately related to Cohen’s forcing method, and that made me feel like I had a small “in” for this subject.  This is the construction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_machine">oracles</a> in computational complexity theory.  In CS, we like to construct hypothetical universes where P=NP or P≠NP, or P≠BQP, or the polynomial hierarchy is infinite, etc.  To do so, we, by fiat, insert a new function—an <em>oracle</em>—into the universe of computational problems, carefully chosen to make the desired statement hold.  Often the oracle needs to satisfy an infinite list of conditions, so we handle them one by one, taking care that when we satisfy a new condition we don’t invalidate the previous conditions.</p>



<p>All this, I kept reading, is <em>profoundly</em> analogous to what the set theorists do when they create a mathematical universe where the Axiom of Choice is true but CH is false, or vice versa, or any of a thousand more exotic possibilities.  They insert new sets into their models of set theory, sets that are carefully constructed to “force” infinite lists of conditions to hold.  In fact, some of the exact same people—such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_M._Solovay">Solovay</a>—who helped pioneer forcing in the 1960s, later went on to pioneer oracles in computational complexity.  We’ll say more about this connection in a future post.</p>



<p><strong>How Could It Be?</strong></p>



<p>How do you study a well-defined math problem, and return the answer that, as far as the accepted axioms of math can say, there <em>is</em> no answer?  I mean: even supposing it’s <em>true</em> that there’s no answer, how do you <em>prove</em> such a thing?</p>



<p>Arguably, not even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems">Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem</a> achieved such a feat.  Recall, the Incompleteness Theorem says loosely that, for every formal system F that could possibly serve as a useful foundation for mathematics, there exist statements even of elementary arithmetic that are true but unprovable in F—and Con(F), a statement that encodes F’s own consistency, is an example of one.  But the very statement that Con(F) is unprovable is equivalent to Con(F)’s being <em>true</em> (since an inconsistent system could prove anything, including Con(F)).  In other words, if the Incompleteness Theorem as applied to F holds any interest, then that’s only because F <em>is, in fact</em>,<em> consistent</em>; it’s just that resources beyond F are needed to prove this.</p>



<p>Yes, there’s a “self-hating theory,” F+Not(Con(F)), which believes in its own inconsistency.  And yes, by Gödel, this self-hating theory is <em>consistent</em> if F itself is.  This means that it has a <strong>model</strong> (involving “nonstandard integers,” formal artifacts that effectively promise a proof of F’s inconsistency without ever actually delivering it).  We’ll have much, <em>much</em> more to say about models later on, but for now, they’re just collections of objects, along with relationships between the objects, that satisfy all the axioms of a theory (thus, a model of the axioms of group theory is simply … any group!).  In any case, though, the self-hating theory ZF+Not(Con(ZF)) can’t be <em>arithmetically sound</em>: I mean, just look at it!  It’s either unsound because F is consistent, or else it’s unsound because F is inconsistent.</p>



<p>The independence of CH from the ZFC axioms of set theory is of a fundamentally different kind.  It will give us models of ZFC+CH, and models of ZFC+Not(CH), that are <em>both</em> at least somewhat plausible as “sketches of mathematical reality”—and that both even have defenders.  The question of which is right, or whether it’s possible to decide at all, will be punted to the future: to the discovery (or not) of some intuitively compelling foundation for mathematics that, as Gödel hoped, answers the question by going beyond ZFC.</p>



<p><strong>Four Levels to Unpack</strong></p>



<p>While experts might consider this too obvious to spell out, Gödel’s and Cohen’s analyses of CH aren’t so much about infinity, as they are about our ability to <em>reason </em>about about infinity using finite sequences of symbols.  The game is about building self-contained mathematical universes to order—universes where all the accepted axioms about infinite sets hold true, and yet that, in some cases, seem to mock what those axioms were supposed to <em>mean</em>, by containing vastly fewer objects than the mathematical universe was “meant” to have.</p>



<p>In understanding these proofs, the central hurdle, I think, is that there are at least four different “levels of description” that need to be kept in mind simultaneously.</p>



<p>At the first level, Gödel’s and Cohen’s proofs, like all mathematical proofs, are finite sequences of symbols.  Not only that, they’re proofs that can be formalized in elementary arithmetic (!).  In other words, even though they’re <em>about</em> the axioms of set theory, they don’t themselves <em>require</em> those axioms.  Again, this is possible because, at the end of the day, Gödel’s and Cohen’s proofs won’t be talking about infinite sets, but “only” about finite sequences of symbols that make statements about infinite sets.</p>



<p>At the second level, the proofs are making an “unbounded” but perfectly clear claim.  They’re claiming that, if someone showed you a proof of either CH or Not(CH), from the ZFC axioms of set theory, then no matter how long the proof or what its details, you could convert it into a proof that <em>ZFC itself</em> was inconsistent.  In symbols, they’re proving the “relative consistency statements”</p>



<p>Con(ZFC) ⇒ Con(ZFC+CH),<br/>Con(ZFC) ⇒ Con(ZFC+Not(CH)),</p>



<p>and they’re proving these as theorems of <em>elementary arithmetic</em>.  (Note that there’s no hope of proving Con(ZF+CH) or Con(ZFC+Not(CH)) <em>outright</em> within ZFC, since by Gödel, ZFC can’t even prove its own consistency.)</p>



<p>This translation is completely explicit; the independence proofs even yield <em>algorithms</em> to convert proofs of inconsistencies in ZFC+CH or ZFC+Not(CH), supposing that they existed, into proofs of inconsistencies in ZFC itself.</p>



<p>Having said that, as Cohen himself often pointed out, thinking about the independence proofs in terms of algorithms to manipulate sequences of symbols is hopeless: to have any chance of understanding these proofs, let alone coming up with them, at some point you need to think about what the symbols <em>refer</em> to.</p>



<p>This brings us to the third level: the symbols refer to <em>models of set theory</em>, which could also be called “mathematical universes.”  Crucially, we always can and often will take these models to be only <em>countably</em> infinite: that is, to contain an infinity of sets, but “merely” ℵ<sub>0</sub> of them, the infinity of integers or of finite strings, and no more.</p>



<p>The fourth level of description is from within the models themselves: each model imagines itself to have an <em>uncountable</em> infinity of sets.  As far as the model’s concerned, it comprises the entire mathematical universe, even though “looking in from outside,” we can see that that’s not true.  In particular, each model of ZFC <em>thinks</em> it has uncountably many sets, many themselves of uncountable cardinality, even if “from the outside” the model is countable.</p>



<p>Say what?  The models are <em>mistaken</em> about something as basic as their own size, about how many sets they have?  Yes.  The models will be like <em>The Matrix</em> (the movie, not the mathematical object), or <em>The Truman Show</em>.  They’re self-contained little universes whose inhabitants can never discover that they’re living a lie—that they’re missing sets that we, from the outside, know to exist.  The poor denizens of the Matrix will never even be able to learn that their universe—what<em> </em>they mistakenly think of as <em>the</em> universe—is secretly countable!  And no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_(The_Matrix)">Morpheus</a> will ever arrive to enlighten them, although—and this is crucial to Cohen’s proof in particular—the inhabitants will be able to reason more-or-less intelligibly about what would happen if a Morpheus <em>did</em> arrive.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%B6wenheim%E2%80%93Skolem_theorem">Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem</a>, from the early 1920s, says that <em>any</em> countable list of first-order axioms that has any model at all (i.e., that’s consistent), must have a model with at most countably many elements.  And ZFC is a countable list of first-order axioms, so Löwenheim-Skolem applies to it—even though ZFC implies the existence of an uncountable infinity of sets!  Before taking the plunge, we’ll need to not merely grudgingly accept but love and internalize this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skolem%27s_paradox">“paradox,”</a> because pretty much the entire proof of the independence of CH is built on top of it.</p>



<p>Incidentally, once we realize that it’s possible to build self-consistent yet “fake” mathematical universes, we can ask the question that, incredibly, the <em>Matrix</em> movies never ask.  Namely, how do we know that our own, larger universe isn’t similarly a lie?  The answer is that we don’t!  As an example—I hope you’re sitting down for this—even though Cantor proved that there are uncountably many real numbers, that only means there are uncountably many reals <em>for us</em>.  We can’t rule out the possibly that God, looking down on our universe, would see countably many reals.</p>



<p><strong>Cantor’s Proof Revisited</strong></p>



<p>To back up: the whole story of CH starts, of course, with Cantor’s epochal discovery of the different orders of infinity, that for example, there are more subsets of positive integers (or equivalently real numbers, or equivalently infinite binary sequences) than there are positive integers.  The devout Cantor thought his discovery illuminated the nature of God; it’s never been entirely obvious to me that he was wrong.</p>



<p>Recall how Cantor’s proof works: we suppose by contradiction that we have an enumeration of all infinite binary sequences: for example,</p>



<p>s(0) = <strong>0</strong>0000000…<br/>s(1) = 0<strong>1</strong>010101…<br/>s(2) = 11<strong>0</strong>01010….<br/>s(3) = 100<strong>0</strong>0000….</p>



<p>We then produce a new infinite binary sequence that’s not on the list, by going down the diagonal and flipping each bit, which in the example above would produce 1011…</p>



<p>But look more carefully.  What Cantor really shows is only that, <em>within our mathematical universe</em>, there can’t be an enumeration of all the reals of our universe.  For if there were, we could use it to define a new real that was in the universe but not in the enumeration.  The proof doesn’t rule out the possibility that <em>God</em> could enumerate the reals of our universe!  It only shows that, if so, there would need to be additional, heavenly reals that were missing from even God’s enumeration (for example, the one produced by diagonalizing against <em>that</em> enumeration).</p>



<p>Which reals could possibly be “missing” from our universe?  Every real you can name—42, π, √e, even uncomputable reals like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant">Chaitin’s Ω</a>—has to be there, right?  Yes, and there’s the rub: <em>every real you can name</em>.  Each name is a finite string of symbols, so whatever your naming system, you can only ever name countably many reals, leaving 100% of the reals nameless.</p>



<p>Or did you think of only the <em>rationals</em> or <em>algebraic numbers</em> as forming a countable dust of discrete points, with numbers like π and e filling in the solid “continuum” between them?  If so, then I hope you’re sitting down for this: <em>every real number you’ve ever heard of</em> belongs to the countable dust!  The entire concept of “the continuum” is only needed for reals that don’t have names and never will.</p>



<p><strong>From ℵ<sub>0</sub> Feet</strong></p>



<p>Gödel and Cohen’s achievement was to show that, without creating any contradictions in set theory, we can adjust size of this elusive “continuum,” put more reals into it or fewer.  How does one even start to begin to prove such a statement?</p>



<p>From a distance of ℵ<sub>0</sub> feet, Gödel proves the consistency of CH by building minimalist mathematical universes: one where “the only sets that exist, are the ones <em>required</em> to exist by the ZFC axioms.”  (These universes can, however, differ from each other in how “tall” they are: that is, in how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinals</a> they have, and hence how many sets overall.  More about that in a future post!)  Gödel proves that, <em>if</em> the axioms of set theory are consistent—that is, if they describe any universes at all—then they also describe these minimalist universes.  He then proves that, in any of these minimalist universes, from the standpoint of someone <em>within</em> that universe, there are exactly ℵ<sub>1</sub> real numbers, and hence CH holds.</p>



<p>At an equally stratospheric level, Cohen proves the consistency of not(CH) by building … well, <em>non</em>-minimalist mathematical universes!  A simple way is to start with Gödel’s minimalist universe—or rather, an even more minimalist universe than his, one that’s been cut down to have only countably many sets—and then to stick in a bunch of <em>new real numbers</em> that weren’t in that universe before.  We choose the new real numbers to ensure two things: first, we still have a model of ZFC, and second, that we make CH false.  The details of how to do that will, of course, concern us later.</p>



<p><strong>My Biggest Confusion</strong></p>



<p>In subsequent posts, I’ll say more about the character of the ZFC axioms and how one builds models of them to order.  Just as a teaser, though, to conclude this post I’d like to clear up a fundamental misconception I had about this subject, from roughly the age of 16 until a couple months ago.</p>



<p>I thought: the way Gödel proves the consistency of CH, must be by examining all the sets in his minimalist universe, and checking that each one has either at most ℵ<sub>0</sub> elements or else at least C of them.  Likewise, the way Cohen proves the consistency of not(CH), must be by “forcing in” some extra sets, which have more than ℵ<sub>0</sub> elements but fewer than C elements.</p>



<p>Except, it turns out that’s not how it works.  Firstly, to prove CH in his universe, Gödel is not going to check each set to make sure it doesn’t have intermediate cardinality; instead, he’s simply going to count all the reals to make sure that there are only ℵ<sub>1</sub> of them—where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number#Aleph-one">ℵ<sub>1</sub></a> is the next infinite cardinality after ℵ<sub>0</sub>.  This will imply that C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, which is another way to state CH.</p>



<p>More importantly, to build a universe where CH is false, Cohen is going to start with a universe where C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, like Gödel’s universe, and then <em>add in more reals:</em> say, ℵ<sub>2</sub> of them.  The ℵ<sub>1</sub> “original” reals will then supply our set of intermediate cardinality between the ℵ<sub>0</sub> integers and the ℵ<sub>2</sub> “new” reals.</p>



<p>Looking back, the core of my confusion was this.  I had thought: I can visualize what ℵ<sub>0</sub> means; that’s just the infinity of integers.  I can <em>also</em> visualize what \( C=2^{\aleph_0} \) means; that’s the infinity of points on a line.  Those, therefore, are the two bedrocks of clarity in this discussion.  By contrast, I <em>can’t</em> visualize a set of intermediate cardinality between ℵ<sub>0</sub> and C.  The intermediate infinity, being weird and ghostlike, is the one that shouldn’t exist unless we deliberately “force” it to.</p>



<p>Turns out I had things backwards.  For starters, I <em>can’t</em> visualize the uncountable infinity of real numbers.  I might <em>think</em> I’m visualizing the real line—it’s solid, it’s black, it’s got little points everywhere—but how can I be sure that I’m not merely visualizing the ℵ<sub>0</sub> rationals, or (say) the computable or definable reals, which include all the ones that arise in ordinary math?</p>



<p>The continuum C is <em>not at all</em> the bedrock of clarity that I’d thought it was.  Unlike its junior partner ℵ<sub>0</sub>, the continuum is adjustable, changeable—and we <em>will</em> change it when we build different models of ZFC.  What’s (relatively) more “fixed” in this game is something that I, like many non-experts, had always given short shrift to: Cantor’s sequence of Alephs ℵ<sub>0</sub>, ℵ<sub>1</sub>, ℵ<sub>2</sub>, etc.</p>



<p>Cantor, who was a very great man, didn’t merely discover that C&gt;ℵ<sub>0</sub>; he also discovered that the infinite cardinalities form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-order">well-ordered</a> sequence, with no infinite descending chains.  Thus, after ℵ<sub>0</sub>,  there’s a next greater infinity that we call ℵ<sub>1</sub>; after ℵ<sub>1</sub> comes  ℵ<sub>2</sub>; after the entire infinite sequence ℵ<sub>0</sub>,ℵ<sub>1</sub>,ℵ<sub>2</sub>,ℵ<sub>3</sub>,… comes ℵ<sub>ω</sub>; after ℵ<sub>ω</sub> comes ℵ<sub>ω+1</sub>; and so on.  These infinities will always be there in any universe of set theory, and always in the same order.</p>



<p>Our job, as engineers of the mathematical universe, will include pegging the continuum C to one of the Alephs.  If we stick in a bare minimum of reals, we’ll get C=ℵ<sub>1</sub>, if we stick in more we can get C=ℵ<sub>2</sub> or C=ℵ<sub>3</sub>, etc.  We can’t make C equal to ℵ<sub>0</sub>—that’s Cantor’s Theorem—and we <em>also</em> can’t make C equal to ℵ<sub>ω</sub>, by an important <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6nig%27s_theorem_(set_theory)">theorem of König</a> that we’ll discuss later (yes, this is an umlaut-heavy field).  But it will turn out that we can make C equal to just about any other Aleph: in particular, to any infinity other than ℵ<sub>0</sub> that’s not the supremum of a countable list of smaller infinities.</p>



<p>In some sense, this is the whole journey that we need to undertake in this subject: from seeing the cardinality of the continuum as a metaphysical mystery, which we might contemplate by staring really hard at a black line on white paper, to seeing the cardinality of the continuum <em>as an engineering problem</em>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned!  Next installment coming after the civilizational Singularity in three days, assuming there’s still power and Internet and food and so forth.</p>



<p>Oh, and happy Halloween.  Ghostly sets of intermediate cardinality … spoooooky!</p></div>

<p>If polls were 100% accurate, then we would not need election models – we will know that the person polling at more than 50% in a given state will win, and we can just sum up the electoral votes. However, polls have various sources of errors:</p>

As battleground states get polled frequently with large samples, this error is likely to be negligible.</li><li><strong>Sampling bias</strong> – this is the bias incurred by the fact that we cannot actually sample a random subset of the population and get them to answer our questions – the probability that people will pick up their phone may be correlated with their vote. Pollsters hope that these correlations all disappear once you condition on certain demographic variables (race, education, etc..) and so try to ensure the sample is balanced according to these metrics. I believe this was part of the reason that polls were off in 2016, since they didn’t explicitly adjust for levels of education (which were not strongly correlated with party before) and ended up under-representing white voters without college degrees.</li><li><strong>Lying responses or “shy” voters</strong> – Some people suggest that voters lie to pollsters because their choice is considered “socially undesirable”. There is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-supporters-arent-shy-but-polls-could-still-be-missing-some-of-them/">not much support</a> that this is a statistically significant effect. In particular <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/shy-trump-2020/">one study</a> showed there was no statistically significant difference between responders’ responses in online and live calling. Also in  2016 polls equally under-estimated the votes for Trump and Republican senators (which presumably didn’t have the same “social stigma” to them).</li><li><strong>Turnout estimates</strong> – Estimating the probability that a person supporting candidate X will actually show up to vote (or mail it in) is a bit of a dark art, and account for the gap in polls representing registered voters (which make no such estimates) and polls representing likely voters (which do). Since traditionally the Republican electorate is older and more well off, they tend to vote more reliably and hence likely voter estimates are typically better for republicans. The effect seems not to be very strong this year. Turnout might be particularly hard to predict this year, though it seems likely to be historically high.</li><li><strong>Voters changing their mind</strong> –  The poll is done at a given point in time and does not necessarily reflect voters views in election day. For example in 2016 it seems that many undecided voters broke for Trump. In this cycle the effect might be less pronounced since there are few undecided voters and “election day” is smoothed over a 2-4 week period due to early and mail-in voting.</li></ol>



<p>To a first approximation, a poll-based election model does the following:<br/><br/>1. Aggregates polls into national and state-wise predictions </p>



<p>2. Computes a probability distribution over the correlated error vectors (i.e. the vector <img alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\vec{e}"/>  with coordinate for each jurisdiction containing the deviation from the prediction)</p>



<p>3. Samples from the probability distribution over vectors to obtain probabilities over outcomes.</p>



<p>From a skim of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19/">538’s methodology</a> it seems that they do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Aggregate polls (weighing by quality, timeliness, adjusting for house effects, etc..). Earlier in the election cycle they also mix in “fundamentals” such as state of the economy etc.. though their weight decreases with time.</li><li>Estimate magnitude of national error (i.e., sample a value <img alt="E \in \mathbb{R}_+" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D_%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="E \in \mathbb{R}_+"/> according to some distribution that reflects the amount of national uncertainty.</li><li>(This is where I may be understanding wrong.) Sample a vector <img alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\vec{e}"/> whose entries sum up to <img alt="E" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="E"/> according to a correlated distribution, where the correlations between states depends on demographic, location, and other  factors. For each particular choice of $E$, because the sum is fixed, if a state has $E+X$ bias then on average the other states will need to compensate for this $-X$ bias, and hence this can create <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/">negative correlations</a> between states. (It is not clear that negative correlations are unreasonable – one could imagine policies that are deeply popular with population A and deeply unpopular with population B)</li></ol>



<p>From a skim of the <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president/how-this-works">Economist’s methodology</a> it seems that they do the following:</p>



<ol><li>They start again with some estimate on the national popular vote, based on polls and fundamentals, and then assume it is distributed according to some probability distribution to account for errors.</li><li>They then compute some prior on “partisan lean” (difference between state and national popular vote) for each state. If we knew the popular vote and partisan lean perfectly then we would know the result. Again like good Bayesians they assume that the lean is distributed according to some probability distribution.</li><li>They update the prior based on state polls and other information</li><li>They sample from an error distribution <img alt="\vec{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvec%7Be%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\vec{e}"/> according to some explicit pairwise correlation matrix that has only non-negative entries (and hence you don’t get negative correlations in their model).</li></ol>



<p>So, given all of the above, how much do these models differ? Perhaps surprisingy, the answer is “not by much”.  To understand how they differ, I plotted for both models the following: </p>



<ol><li>The histogram of Biden’s popular vote margin</li><li>The probability of Biden to win conditioned on a particular margin</li></ol>



<p>Much of the methodological difference, including the issue of pairwise correlations, should manifest in 2, but eyeballing it, they don’t seem to differ that much. It seems that conditioned on a particular margin, both models give Biden similar probability to win. (In particular both models think that 3% margin is about 50/50, while 4% margin gives Biden about 80/20 chance). The main difference is actually in the first part of estimating the popular vote margin – 538 is more “conservative” and has fatter tails.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/election_models.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7867" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/election_models.png?w=993"/></a></figure>



<p>If you want to check my data, see if I have a bug, or try your own analysis, you can use this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GaoBn71PwIk_uAisNWzp2Naqev9JHW0I?usp=sharing">colab notebook</a>.</p>



<h2>“Make your own needle”</h2>



<p>Another applications for such models is to help us adjust the priors as new information comes in. For example, it’s possible that Florida, North Carolina and Texas will report results early. If Biden loses one of these states, should we adjust our estimate of win probability significantly? It turns out that the answer depends on by how much he loses.</p>



<p>The following graphs show the updated win probability conditioned on a particular margin in a state. We see that winning or losing Florida, North Carolina, and Texas on their own doesn’t make much difference to the probability – it’s all about the margin. In contrast, losing Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes will make a significant difference to Biden’s chances.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/predict_states.png"><img alt="" class="wp-image-7869" src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/predict_states.png?w=1024"/></a></figure>



<p>(The non monotonicity is simply a side effect of having a finite number of simulation runs and would disappear in the limit.)</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In May 2016, after Donald Trump was elected as the republican nominee for president, I wrote the following blog post. I ended up not publishing it – this has always been a technical blog (and also more of a group blog, at the time).  While the damage of a Donald Trump presidency was hypothetical at the time, it is now very real and in a second term the stakes are only higher. I once again hope American readers of this blog would do what they can to support Joe Biden.<br/></p>



<p>Note: this is not an invitation for a debate on who to vote for in the comments. At this point, if you are educated and following the news (as I imagine all readers of this blog are) then if you are not already convinced that Donald Trump is a danger to this country and the world, nothing I will say will change your mind. Similarly, nothing you will say will change mine. Hence this is just a call for those readers who already support Joe Biden to make sure they vote and think of how they can help with their money or time in other ways.</p>



<h2>I’m with Her</h2>



<p><strong>Boaz Barak / May 3, 2016</strong><br/><br/>The republican electorate, in their infinite wisdom, have just (essentially) finalized the election of Donald Trump as their nominee for the position of the president of the United States.</p>



<p>While I have my political views, I don’t consider myself a very political person, and have not (as far as I remember) ever written about politics in this blog. However, extreme times call for extreme measures. It is tempting to be fatalist or cynical about this process, and believe that whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton is elected doesn’t make much of a difference. Some people believe that the presidency shapes the person more than the other way around, and others feel that all politicians are anyway corrupt or that Hillary is not much better than trump since she voted for the Iraq war and gave paid speeches for Wall Street firms. I think the last two presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama demonstrated that the identity of the president makes a huge difference. All evidence points out that with Trump this difference will be entirely in the negative direction.</p>



<p>While his chances might not be great, this is not a bet I’m comfortable taking. I plan to support Hillary Clinton as much as I can, and hope that other American readers of this blog will do the same</p></div>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: I will present a new approach to randomized lower bounds, particularly in the setting where we wish to give a fine-grained analysis of randomized algorithms that achieve small bias. The approach is as follows: instead of considering ordinary randomized algorithms which give an output in <img alt="\{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\{0,1\}"/> and may err, we switch models to look at “forecasting” randomized algorithms which output a confidence in <img alt="[0,1]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="[0,1]"/> for whether they think the answer is 1. When scored by a proper scoring rule, the performance of the best forecasting algorithm is closely related to the bias of the best (ordinary) randomized algorithm, but is more amenable to analysis. <br/>As an application, I’ll present a new minimax theorem for randomized algorithms, which can be viewed as a strengthening of Yao’s minimax theorem. Yao’s minimax theorem guarantees the existence of a hard distribution for a function <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> such that solving <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> against this distribution (to a desired error level) is as hard as solving <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> in the worst case (to that same error level). However, the hard distribution provided by Yao’s theorem depends on the chosen error level. Our minimax theorem removes this dependence, giving a distribution which certifies the hardness of <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="f"/> against all bias levels at once. In recent work, we used this minimax theorem to give a tight composition theorem for randomized query complexity. <br/><br/>Based on joint work with Eric Blais.</p></div>

    <title>2020 Fall Jobs Post</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">My annual fall jobs posts, giving advice to PhDs looking for faculty positions, were getting repetitive. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/2019-fall-jobs-post.html">last year's post</a> for the usual stuff and feel free to post opportunities in the comments on this post. This year let's talk about what's changed.<div><br/></div><div>First something you might have missed--the latest <a href="https://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2019-Taulbee-Survey.pdf">Taulbee Survey</a> shows a small drop in the number of new undergraduate CS majors in 2019 after years of massive growth. Is it a simple blip or have we hit the saturation point? We may never know because of the change you definitely didn't miss seeing.</div><div><br/></div><div>So let's talk about the effect of COVID. We're seeing a large drop in new international students who are having a hard time getting visas or just avoiding the US like the plague (literally). Not sure those numbers will fully come back given other alternatives and a changing international relationship particularly with China. Many undergrads have delayed college and some may never attend. </div><div><br/></div><div>On the other hand, COVID has accelerated digitizing the economy, from videoconferencing to in-home entertainment and games to remote access to work environments. The post-COVID economy could create even a larger demand for computer scientists. </div><div><br/></div><div>Many universities curtailed hiring last year worried and may do so in the spring given the uncertain budget situation due to the virus. Others continue to hire in computing, some to make up for last year. I just can't make a prediction for the upcoming year but I wouldn't rush to the job market if you have the option to wait. Last year the CRA reinstated the <a href="https://cifellows2020.org/">CIFellows</a>, postdocs to help those in a tight job market, and may do so again next year. The CRA will also repeat its <a href="https://cra.org/cras-cv-database-initiative-turns-two/">CV database</a>.</div><div><br/></div><div>Late spring interviews in 2020 went virtual and will likely go virtual again in 2021. Nevertheless take the zoom meetings seriously. Make sure your interview talk is still a discussion--answer questions people give in the chat. Still do your research to have strong conversations with everyone you talk to, especially the non-theorists. And still dress nicely, at least from the waist up. Putting on a sports coat is not a bad idea. </div><div><div><br/></div><div>Though most places continue to focus on data science/ML, cybersecurity and to some degree quantum, Rutgers is <a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/about/employment/details/tenure-track-assistant-professor-position-2">specifically looking</a> for a hire in computational complexity. Don't see that everyday. </div></div></div>
