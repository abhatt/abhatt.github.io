<h2>Rani Sharim’s two-player variants of John Conway’s game-of-life</h2>
<p><a href="https://ranisharim.github.io/game_of_life_2_players/">Here is a web-page</a> by a student in my “Game Theory” course where you can play several two-players variants of John Conway’s game-of-life.  (A couple of variants were considered before. See, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207679">this  paper</a>.)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed playing Rani’s games and it can certainly cheer you up in difficult times. Questions about the game, remarks, and suggestions for improvements and for new features, are most welcome.</p>
<h2>How to catch lies with statistics, a 2006  presentation by Maya Bar-Hillel</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19929" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png?w=640"/></a></p>
<p>Maya Bar-Hillel (left) and Ester Samuel-Cahn</p>
<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>
<h2>New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems</h2>
<p>Peter Keevash, Alexey Pokrovskiy, Benny Sudakov, and Liana Yepremyan’s paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00526">New bounds for Ryser’s conjecture and related problems,</a> describes remarkable progress very old questions regarding transversals in Latin square.</p>
<h2>Topological Tverberg news</h2>
<p>I came across a very interesting paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05251">The topological Tverberg problem beyond <span class="search-hit mathjax">prime</span> powers</a> by Florian Frick and Pablo Soberón with new bounds and a new method for topological Tverberg theorem in the non prime-power case.</p>
<h2>Jeager’s conjecture refuted</h2>
<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>
<h2>A cool rainbow post <a href="http://matroidunion.org/?p=2541">Short rainbow cycles in graphs and matroids</a> by Tony Huynh</h2>
<h2>More on the game of life</h2>
<p>Let me mention two problems I posted 6-7 years ago about Conway’s game of life. <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/132402/conways-game-of-life-for-random-initial-position">Conway’s game of life for random initial position</a> and <a class="question-hyperlink" href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/17914/does-a-noisy-version-of-conways-game-of-life-support-universal-computation">Does a noisy version of Conway’s game of life support universal computation?</a></p>

    <title>Writing Code for a Paper :  A Note to Students</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br/><br/>Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br/><br/>Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br/><br/>Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br/><br/>1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br/>2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br/>3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br/><br/>And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br/><br/>Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br/><br/>For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br/><br/>On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br/><br/>On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br/><br/>For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br/><br/>(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191183-experiments-as-research-validation/fulltext">a viewpoint by Jeffrey Ullman</a>.)<br/><br/><br/></div>

vertex set V into r acyclic sets. The dichromatic number of a directed graph G
is the smallest r such that G allows an acyclic r-coloring. For symmetric
digraphs the dichromatic number equals the well-known chromatic number of the
underlying undirected graph. This allows us to carry over the W[1]-hardness and
lower bounds for running times of the chromatic number problem parameterized by
clique-width to the dichromatic number problem parameterized by directed
clique-width. We introduce the first polynomial-time algorithm for the acyclic
coloring problem on digraphs of constant directed clique-width. From a
parameterized point of view our algorithm shows that the Dichromatic Number
problem is in XP when parameterized by directed clique-width and extends the
only known structural parameterization by directed modular width for this
problem. For directed co-graphs, which is a class of digraphs of directed
clique-width 2, and several generalizations we even show linear time solutions
for computing the dichromatic number. Furthermore, we conclude that directed
co-graphs and the considered generalizations lead to subclasses of perfect
digraphs. For directed cactus forests, which is a set of digraphs of directed
tree-width 1, we conclude an upper bound of 2 for the dichromatic number and we
show that an optimal acyclic coloring can be computed in linear time.

machine learning models during the past years. The related supermodular
maximization models (submodular minimization) also offer an abundance of
applications, but they appeared to be highly intractable even under simple
cardinality constraints. Hence, while there are well-developed tools for
maximizing a submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, there is much
less work on the corresponding supermodular maximization problems.
</p>
<p>We give a broad parameterized family of monotone functions which includes
submodular functions and a class of supermodular functions containing diversity
functions. Functions in this parameterized family are called
\emph{$\gamma$-meta-submodular}. We develop local search algorithms with
approximation factors that depend only on the parameter $\gamma$. We show that
the $\gamma$-meta-submodular families include well-known classes of functions
such as meta-submodular functions ($\gamma=0$), metric diversity functions and
proportionally submodular functions (both with $\gamma=1$), diversity functions
based on negative-type distances or Jensen-Shannon divergence (both with
$\gamma=2$), and $\sigma$-semi metric diversity functions ($\gamma = \sigma$).

    <title>The Power of Connection: Leveraging Network Analysis to Advance Receivable Financing</title>

receivables their customers have yet to pay: a receivable can be sold to a
funder, which immediately gives the firm cash in return for a small percentage
of the receivable amount as a fee. Receivable financing has been traditionally
handled in a centralized way, where every request is processed by the funder
individually and independently of one another. In this work we propose a novel,
network-based approach to receivable financing, which enables customers of the
same funder to autonomously pay each other as much as possible, and gives
benefits to both the funder (reduced cash anticipation and exposure risk) and
its customers (smaller fees and lightweight service establishment). Our main
contributions consist in providing a principled formulation of the
network-based receivable-settlement strategy, and showing how to achieve all
algorithmic challenges posed by the design of this strategy. We formulate
network-based receivable financing as a novel combinatorial-optimization
problem on a multigraph of receivables. We show that the problem is NP-hard,
and devise an exact branch-and-bound algorithm, as well as algorithms to
efficiently find effective approximate solutions. Our more efficient algorithms
are based on cycle enumeration and selection, and exploit a theoretical
characterization in terms of a knapsack problem, as well as a refining strategy
that properly adds paths between cycles. We also investigate the real-world
issue of avoiding temporary violations of the problem constraints, and design
methods for handling it. An extensive experimental evaluation is performed on
real receivable data. Results attest the good performance of our methods.

\dots, n\}$ and they have to check if their sets intersect - is a central
problem in the world of communication complexity. While both deterministic and
randomized communication complexities for this problem are known to be
$\Theta(n)$, it is also known that if the sets are assumed to be drawn from
some restricted set systems then the communication complexity can be much
lower. In this work, we explore how communication complexity measures change
with respect to the complexity of the underlying set system. The complexity
measure for the set system that we use in this work is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC) dimension. More precisely, on any set system with VC dimension bounded by
$d$, we analyze how large can the deterministic and randomized communication
complexities be, as a function of $d$ and $n$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we construct two natural set systems of VC dimension $d$,
motivated from geometry. Using these set systems we show that the deterministic
and randomized communication complexity can be $\widetilde{\Theta}\left(d\log
\left( n/d \right)\right)$ for set systems of VC dimension $d$ and this matches
the deterministic upper bound for all set systems of VC dimension $d$. We also
study the deterministic and randomized communication complexities of the set
intersection problem when sets belong to a set system of bounded VC dimension.
We show that there exists set systems of VC dimension $d$ such that both
deterministic and randomized (one-way and multi-round) complexity for the set
intersection problem can be as high as $\Theta\left( d\log \left( n/d \right)
\right)$, and this is tight among all set systems of VC dimension $d$.

and H are 2-isomorphic, or equivalently, their cycle matroids are isomorphic,

Whitney switches. In this paper we consider the quantitative question arising
from Whitney's theorem: Given two 2-isomorphic graphs, can we transform one

NP-complete for cycles, and we investigate its parameterized complexity. We
show that the problem admits a kernel of size O(k), and thus, is
fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k.

    <title>Approximation of the Diagonal of a Laplacian's Pseudoinverse for Complex Network Analysis</title>

fast algorithms for extracting knowledge from these data. We are motivated here
by three electrical measures for the analysis of large small-world graphs $G =
(V, E)$ -- i.e., graphs with diameter in $O(\log |V|)$, which are abundant in
complex network analysis. From a computational point of view, the three
measures have in common that their crucial component is the diagonal of the
graph Laplacian's pseudoinverse, $L^\dagger$. Computing diag$(L^\dagger)$
exactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix
multiplication -- and the standard tools in practice even require cubic time.
Moreover, the pseudoinverse requires quadratic space -- hardly feasible for
large graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e.g., using the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of $O(\log |V| /
\epsilon^2)$ Laplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is
still very expensive for large inputs.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm that requires the
solution of only one Laplacian linear system. The remaining parts are purely
combinatorial -- mainly sampling uniform spanning trees, which we relate to
diag$(L^\dagger)$ via effective resistances. For small-world networks, our
algorithm obtains a $\pm \epsilon$-approximation with high probability, in a
time that is nearly-linear in $|E|$ and quadratic in $1 / \epsilon$. Another
positive aspect of our algorithm is its parallel nature due to independent
sampling. We thus provide two parallel implementations of our algorithm: one
using OpenMP, one MPI + OpenMP. In our experiments against the state of the
art, our algorithm (i) yields more accurate results, (ii) is much faster and
more memory-efficient, and (iii) obtains good parallel speedups, in particular
in the distributed setting.

of the same length is defined as the minimum Hamming distance between $S_1$ and
any rotation (cyclic shift) of $S_2$. We study the problem of sketching the
shift distance, which is the following communication complexity problem:
Strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ of length $n$ are given to two identical players
(encoders), who independently compute sketches (summaries) $\mathtt{sk}(S_1)$
and $\mathtt{sk}(S_2)$, respectively, so that upon receiving the two sketches,
a third player (decoder) is able to compute (or approximate)
$\mathsf{sh}(S_1,S_2)$ with high probability.
</p>
<p>This paper primarily focuses on the more general $k$-mismatch version of the
problem, where the decoder is allowed to declare a failure if
$\mathsf{sh}(S_1,S_2)&gt;k$, where $k$ is a parameter known to all parties. Andoni
et al. (STOC'13) introduced exact circular $k$-mismatch sketches of size
$\widetilde{O}(k+D(n))$, where $D(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Andoni
et al. also showed that their sketch size is optimal in the class of linear
homomorphic sketches.
</p>
<p>We circumvent this lower bound by designing a (non-linear) exact circular
$k$-mismatch sketch of size $\widetilde{O}(k)$; this size matches
communication-complexity lower bounds. We also design $(1\pm
\varepsilon)$-approximate circular $k$-mismatch sketch of size
$\widetilde{O}(\min(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{k}, \varepsilon^{-1.5}\sqrt{n}))$,
which improves upon an $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n})$-size sketch of
Crouch and McGregor (APPROX'11).

graphs. This is a fundamental graph-mining task with a variety of applications
and thus has received much attention recently. Although most existing methods
assume that each individual edge weight is easily obtained, such an assumption
is not necessarily valid in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel
learning problem for dense subgraph discovery in which a learner queries edge
subsets rather than only single edges and observes a noisy sum of edge weights
in a queried subset. For this problem, we first propose a polynomial-time
algorithm that obtains a nearly-optimal solution with high probability.
Moreover, to deal with large-sized graphs, we design a more scalable algorithm
with a theoretical guarantee. Computational experiments using real-world graphs
demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

    <title>Provably and Efficiently Approximating Near-cliques using the Tur\'an Shadow: PEANUTS</title>

Seshadhri</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13483">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Clique and near-clique counts are important graph properties with
applications in graph generation, graph modeling, graph analytics, community
detection among others. They are the archetypal examples of dense subgraphs.
While there are several different definitions of near-cliques, most of them
share the attribute that they are cliques that are missing a small number of
edges. Clique counting is itself considered a challenging problem. Counting
near-cliques is significantly harder more so since the search space for
near-cliques is orders of magnitude larger than that of cliques.
</p>
<p>We give a formulation of a near-clique as a clique that is missing a constant
number of edges. We exploit the fact that a near-clique contains a smaller
clique, and use techniques for clique sampling to count near-cliques. This
method allows us to count near-cliques with 1 or 2 missing edges, in graphs
with tens of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, there was no
known efficient method for this problem, and we obtain a 10x - 100x speedup
over existing algorithms for counting near-cliques.
</p>
<p>Our main technique is a space-efficient adaptation of the Tur\'an Shadow
sampling approach, recently introduced by Jain and Seshadhri (WWW 2017). This
approach constructs a large recursion tree (called the Tur\'an Shadow) that
represents cliques in a graph. We design a novel algorithm that builds an
estimator for near-cliques, using an online, compact construction of the
Tur\'an Shadow.

    <title>Hardness of Approximation of (Multi-)LCS over Small Alphabet</title>

fundamental problems in computer science, which finds application in fields
such as computational biology, text processing, information retrieval, data
compression etc. It is well known that (decision version of) the problem of
finding the length of a LCS of an arbitrary number of input sequences (which we
refer to as Multi-LCS problem) is NP-complete. Jiang and Li [SICOMP'95] showed
that if Max-Clique is hard to approximate within a factor of $s$ then Multi-LCS
is also hard to approximate within a factor of $\Theta(s)$. By the NP-hardness
of the problem of approximating Max-Clique by Zuckerman [ToC'07], for any
constant $\delta&gt;0$, the length of a LCS of arbitrary number of input sequences
of length $n$ each, cannot be approximated within an $n^{1-\delta}$-factor in
polynomial time unless {\tt{P}}$=${\NP}. However, the reduction of Jiang and Li
assumes the alphabet size to be $\Omega(n)$. So far no hardness result is known
for the problem of approximating Multi-LCS over sub-linear sized alphabet. On
the other hand, it is easy to get $1/|\Sigma|$-factor approximation for strings
of alphabet $\Sigma$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we make a significant progress towards proving hardness of
approximation over small alphabet by showing a polynomial-time reduction from
the well-studied \emph{densest $k$-subgraph} problem with {\em perfect
completeness} to approximating Multi-LCS over alphabet of size $poly(n/k)$. As
a consequence, from the known hardness result of densest $k$-subgraph problem
(e.g. [Manurangsi, STOC'17]) we get that no polynomial-time algorithm can give
an $n^{-o(1)}$-factor approximation of Multi-LCS over an alphabet of size
$n^{o(1)}$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis is false.

Schouery <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13430">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the MAXSPACE problem, given a set of ads A, one wants to schedule a subset
A' of A into K slots B_1, ..., B_K of size L. Each ad A_i in A has a size s_i
and a frequency w_i. A schedule is feasible if the total size of ads in any
slot is at most L, and each ad A_i in A' appears in exactly w_i slots. The goal
is to find a feasible schedule that maximizes the sum of the space occupied by
all slots. We introduce a generalization called MAXSPACE-R in which each ad A_i
also has a release date r_i &gt;= 1, and may only appear in a slot B_j with j &gt;=
r_i. We also introduce a generalization of MAXSPACE-R called MAXSPACE-RD in
which each ad A_i also has a deadline d_i &lt;= K, and may only appear in a slot
B_j with r_i &lt;= j &lt;= d_i. These parameters model situations where a subset of
ads corresponds to a commercial campaign with an announcement date that may
expire after some defined period. We present a 1/9-approximation algorithm for
MAXSPACE-R and a polynomial-time approximation scheme for MAXSPACE-RD when K is
bounded by a constant. This is the best factor one can expect, since MAXSPACE
is NP-hard, even if K = 2.

become an important medium for people to interact. For the minimum distance

    <title>Robust Gaussian Covariance Estimation in Nearly-Matrix Multiplication Time</title>

dimensional statistics: given $N$ samples from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian
$\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \Sigma)$, but where an $\varepsilon$-fraction of
the samples have been arbitrarily corrupted, output $\widehat{\Sigma}$
minimizing the total variation distance between $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0},
\Sigma)$ and $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{0}, \widehat{\Sigma})$. This corresponds
to learning $\Sigma$ in a natural affine-invariant variant of the Frobenius
norm known as the \emph{Mahalanobis norm}. Previous work of Cheng et al
demonstrated an algorithm that, given $N = \Omega (d^2 / \varepsilon^2)$
samples, achieved a near-optimal error of $O(\varepsilon \log 1 /
\varepsilon)$, and moreover, their algorithm ran in time $\widetilde{O}(T(N, d)
\log \kappa / \mathrm{poly} (\varepsilon))$, where $T(N, d)$ is the time it
takes to multiply a $d \times N$ matrix by its transpose, and $\kappa$ is the
condition number of $\Sigma$. When $\varepsilon$ is relatively small, their
polynomial dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ in the runtime is prohibitively large.
In this paper, we demonstrate a novel algorithm that achieves the same
statistical guarantees, but which runs in time $\widetilde{O} (T(N, d) \log
\kappa)$. In particular, our runtime has no dependence on $\varepsilon$. When
$\Sigma$ is reasonably conditioned, our runtime matches that of the fastest
algorithm for covariance estimation without outliers, up to poly-logarithmic
factors, showing that we can get robustness essentially "for free."

structure for accessing the points that best represent the object for a given
viewing frustum and level-of-detail. The building of such data structures
frequently represents a large portion of the cost of the rendering pipeline
both in terms of time and space complexity, especially when rendering is done
for inspection purposes only. This problem has been addressed in the past by
incremental construction approaches, but these either result in low quality
hierarchies or in longer construction times. In this work we present OMiCroN --
Oblique Multipass Hierarchy Creation while Navigating -- which is the first
algorithm capable of immediately displaying partial renders of the geometry,
provided the cloud is made available sorted in Morton order. OMiCroN is fast,
being capable of building the entire data structure in memory spending an
amount of time that is comparable to that of just reading the cloud from disk.
Thus, there is no need for storing an expensive hierarchy, nor for delaying the
rendering until the whole hierarchy is read from disk. In fact, a pipeline
coupling OMiCroN with an incremental sorting algorithm running in parallel can
start rendering as soon as the first sorted prefix is produced, making this
setup very convenient for streamed viewing.

single-agent transportation devices (called {\em bikes}) are initially placed
at the left endpoint $0$ of the unit interval $[0,1]$. The agents are identical
in capability and can move at speed one. The bikes cannot move on their own,
but any agent riding bike $i$ can move at speed $v_i &gt; 1$. An agent may ride at
most one bike at a time. The agents can cooperate by sharing the bikes; an
agent can ride a bike for a time, then drop it to be used by another agent, and
possibly switch to a different bike.
</p>
<p>We study two problems. In the \BS problem, we require all agents and bikes
starting at the left endpoint of the interval to reach the end of the interval
as soon as possible. In the \RBS problem, we aim to minimize the arrival time
of the agents; the bikes can be used to increase the average speed of the
agents, but are not required to reach the end of the interval.
</p>
<p>Our main result is the construction of a polynomial time algorithm for the
\BS problem that creates an arrival-time optimal schedule for travellers and
bikes to travel across the interval. For the \RBS problem, we give an algorithm
that gives an optimal solution for the case when at most one of the bikes can
be abandoned.

homogeneous sparse halfspaces in $\Rd$ under noise. Though recent works have
established attribute-efficient learning algorithms under various types of
label noise (e.g. bounded noise), it remains an open question of when and how
$s$-sparse halfspaces can be efficiently learned under the challenging {\em
malicious noise} model, where an adversary may corrupt both the unlabeled data
distribution and the labels. We answer this question in the affirmative by
designing a computationally efficient algorithm with near-optimal label
complexity $\tilde{O}\big(s \log^3 d \cdot \log^4\frac{1}{\epsilon}\big)$ and
noise tolerance $\eta = \Omega(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is the
target error rate. Our main techniques include attribute-efficient paradigms
for instance reweighting and for empirical risk minimization, and a new
analysis of uniform concentration for unbounded data~--~all of them crucially
take the structure of the underlying halfspace into account. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first near-optimal result in the setting. As a byproduct
of our analysis, we resolve a long-standing problem in statistics and machine
learning: we show that a global optimum of sparse principal component analysis
can be found in polynomial time without any statistical assumption on the data.
This result might be of independent interest to both communities.

    <summary>We investigate the number of pairwise comparisons sufficient to sort $n$ elements chosen from a linearly ordered set. This number is shown to be $\log_2(n!) + o(n)$ thus improving over the previously known upper bounds of the form $\log_2(n!) + \Theta(n)$. The new bound is achieved by the proposed group insertion sorting algorithm.</summary>

    <title>TR20-095 |  On Basing Auxiliary-Input Cryptography on NP-hardness via Nonadaptive Black-Box Reductions | 

	Mikito Nanashima</title>
    <summary>A black-box (BB) reduction is a central proof technique in theoretical computer science. However, the limitations on BB reductions have been revealed for several decades, and the series of previous work gives strong evidence that we should avoid a nonadaptive BB reduction to base cryptography on NP-hardness (e.g., Akavia et al., 2006). Then should we also give up such a familiar proof technique even for an intermediate step towards cryptography?

In this paper, we continue to explore the capability of nonadaptive BB reductions and extend our knowledge on such a central technique out of the current (worst-to-average) framework. In particular, we investigate the attempt to base weaker cryptographic notions allowed to take auxiliary-input via nonadaptive BB reductions. As a result, we prove the following theorems: (1) if we base an auxiliary-input pseudorandom generator (AIPRG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses; (2) if we base an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) or auxiliary-input hitting set generator (AIHSG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then an (i.o.-)one-way function also exists based on NP-hardness (via an adaptive BB reduction).

The first result gives new evidence that nonadaptive BB reductions are insufficient to base AIPRG. The second result also yields a weaker but still surprising consequence of nonadaptive BB reductions, that is, a one-way function based on NP-hardness. In fact, the second result is interpreted as the following two opposite ways. Pessimistically, it shows that basing AIOWF or AIHSG via nonadaptive BB reductions is harder than constructing a one-way function based on NP-hardness, which can be regarded as a negative result. Note that AIHSG is a weak primitive implied even by the hardness of learning; thus, this pessimistic view gives conceptually stronger limitations than the currently known limitations on nonadaptive BB reductions. Optimistically, our result gives a new hope: a breakthrough construction of auxiliary-input primitives might also be useful to construct standard cryptographic primitives. This optimistic view enhances the significance of further investigation on constructing auxiliary-input or other intermediate cryptographic primitives instead of standard cryptographic primitives.</summary>

    <title>An equilibrium in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>While there has been incredible progress in convex and nonconvex minimization, a multitude of problems in ML today are in need of efficient algorithms to solve min-max optimization problems. 
 Unlike minimization, where algorithms can always be shown to converge to some local minimum, there is no notion of a local equilibrium in min-max optimization that exists for general nonconvex-nonconcave functions.
    In two recent papers, we give  two notions of local equilibria that are guaranteed to exist and efficient algorithms to compute them.
In this post we present the key ideas behind a second-order notion of local min-max equilibrium from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> and in the next we will talk about a different notion along with the algorithm and show its implications to GANs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12376">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="min-max-optimization">Min-max optimization</h2>

<p>Min-max optimization of an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$</p>



<p>is a powerful framework in optimization, economics, and ML as it allows one to model learning in the presence of multiple agents with competing objectives.
In ML applications, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs</a> and <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org">adversarial robustness</a>, the min-max objective function may be nonconvex-nonconcave.
We know that min-max optimization is at least as hard as minimization, hence, we cannot hope to find a globally optimal solution to min-max problems for general functions.</p>

<h2 id="approximate-local-minima-for-minimization">Approximate local minima for minimization</h2>

<p>Let us first revisit the special case of minimization, where there is a natural notion of an approximate second-order local minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$x$ is a second-order $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now suppose we just wanted to minimize a function $\mathcal{L}$, and we start from any point which is <em>not</em> at an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}$.
Then we can always find a direction to travel in along which either $\mathcal{L}$ decreases rapidly, or the second derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ is large.
 By searching in such a direction we can easily find a new point which has a smaller value of $\mathcal{L}$ using only local information about the gradient and Hessian of $\mathcal{L}$.
 This means that we can keep decreasing $\mathcal{L}$ until we reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum (see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris_Polyak2/publication/220589612_Cubic_regularization_of_Newton_method_and_its_global_performance/links/09e4150dd2f0320879000000/Cubic-regularization-of-Newton-method-and-its-global-performance.pdf">Nesterov and Polyak</a>,  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055399.3055464">here</a>,  <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Ge15.pdf">here</a>,  and also an earlier <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2016/03/22/saddlepoints">blog post</a> for how to do this with only access to gradients of $\mathcal{L}$).
 If $\mathcal{L}$ is Lipschitz smooth and bounded, we will reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum in polynomial time from any starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an analogous definition with similar properties for min-max optimization?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="problems-with-current-local-optimality-notions">Problems with current local optimality notions</h2>
<p>There has been much recent work on extending theoretical results in nonconvex minimization to min-max optimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00331">here</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9430-efficient-algorithms-for-smooth-minimax-optimization">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02629.pdf">here</a>,  <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9631-solving-a-class-of-non-convex-min-max-games-using-iterative-first-order-methods.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07512">here</a>.
One way to extend the notion of local minimum to the min-max setting is to seek a solution point called a “local saddle”–a point $(x,y)$ where 1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x, \cdot)$ and 2) $x$ is a local minimum for $f(\cdot, y).$</p>

<p>For instance,
 this is used  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00838.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10461.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/adolphs19a.html">here</a>.
But, there are very simple examples of two-dimensional bounded functions where a local saddle does not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, consider $f(x,y) = sin(x+y)$ from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">here</a>. Check that none of the points on this function are simultaneously a local minimum for $x$ and local maximum for $y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that no local saddle exists may be surprising, since an $\varepsilon$-global solution to a min-max optimization problem <em>is</em> guaranteed to exist as long as the objective function is uniformly bounded.
Roughly, this is because, in a global min-max setting, the max-player is empowered to globally maximize the function $f(x,\cdot)$, and the min-player is empowered to minimize the “global max” function $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$.</p>

<p>The ability to compute the global max  allows the min-player to  predict the max-player’s response.
If $x$ is a global minimum of $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$, the min-player is aware of this fact and will have no incentive to update $x$.
On the other hand, if the min-player can only simulate the max-player’s updates locally (as in local saddle),
then the min-player may try to update her strategy even when it leads to a net increase in $f$.
This can happen because the min-player is not powerful enough to accurately simulate the max-player’s response. (See  a  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">related notion</a> of local optimality with similar issues due to vanishingly small updates.)</p>

<p>The fact that players who can only make local predictions are
unable to predict their opponents’ responses can lead to convergence problems in many popular algorithms such as<br/>
gradient descent ascent (GDA). This non-convergence behavior can occur if the function has no local saddle point (e.g. the function $sin(x+y)$  mentioned above), and can even happen on some functions, like $f(x,y) = xy$ which do have a local saddle point.</p>

<br/>
<b>Figure 1.</b> GDA spirals off to infinity from almost every starting point on the objective function $f(x,y) = xy$.

<h2 id="greedy-max-a-computationally-tractable-alternative-to-global-max">Greedy max: a computationally tractable alternative to global max</h2>

<p>To allow for a more stable min-player, and a more stable notion of local optimality, we would like to empower the min-player to more effectively simulate the max-player’s response. 
While the notion of global min-max does exactly this by having the min-player compute the global max function $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, computing the global maximum may be intractable.</p>

<p>Instead, we replace the global max function $\max_y (f(\cdot ,y))$ with a computationally tractable alternative. 
Towards this end, we restrict the max-player’s response, and the min-player’s simulation of this response, to updates which can be computed using any algorithm from a class of second-order optimization algorithms.
More specifically, we restrict the max-player to updating $y$ by traveling along continuous paths which start at the current value of $y$ and along which either $f$ is increasing or the second derivative of $f$ is positive.  We refer to such paths as greedy paths since they model a class of second-order “greedy” optimization algorithms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy path:</strong> A unit-speed path $\varphi:[0,\tau] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is greedy if $f$ is non-decreasing over this path, and for every $t\in[0,\tau]$
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roughly speaking, when restricted to updates obtained from greedy paths, the max-player will always be able to reach a point which is an approximate local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$, although there may not be a greedy path which leads the max-player to a global maximum.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<br/>
 <b>Figure 2.</b> <i>Left:</i> The light-colored region $\Omega$ is reachable from the initial point $A$ by a greedy path; the dark region is not reachable. <i>Right:</i> There is always a greedy path from any point $A$ to a local maximum ($B$), but a global maximum ($C$) may not be reachable by any greedy path.
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To define an alternative to $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, we consider the local maximum point with the largest value of $f(x,\cdot)$ attainable from a given starting point $y$ by any greedy path.
We refer to the value of $f$ at this point as the <em>greedy max function</em>, and denote this value by $g(x,y)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy max function:</strong> 
    $g(x,y) = \max_{z \in \Omega} f(x,z),$
where $\Omega$ is points reachable from $y$ by greedy path.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="our-greedy-min-max-equilibrium">Our greedy min-max equilibrium</h2>
<p>We use the greedy max function to define a new second-order notion of local optimality for min-max optimization, which we refer to as a greedy min-max equilibrium.
Roughly speaking, we say that $(x,y)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if 
1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$ (and hence the endpoint of a greedy path), and 
2) if $x$ is a local minimum of the greedy max function $g(\cdot,y)$.</p>

<p>In other words, $x$ is a local minimum of $\max_y f(\cdot, y)$ under the constraint that the maximum is computed only over the set of greedy paths starting at $y$.
Unfortunately, even if $f$ is smooth, the greedy max function may not be differentiable with respect to $x$ and may even be discontinuous.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2_grid_t.png" width="400"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2g_grid_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 3.</b> <i>Left:</i> If we change $x$ from one value $x$ to a very close value $\hat{x}$, the largest value of $f$ reachable by greedy path undergoes a discontinuous change.  <i>Right:</i>  This means the greedy max function $g(x,y)$ is discontinuous in $x$.</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>This creates a problem, since the definition of $\varepsilon$-local minimum only applies to smooth functions.</p>

<p>To solve this problem we would ideally like to smooth $g$ by convolution with a Gaussian.
Unfortunately, convolution can cause the local minima of a function to “shift”– a point which is a local minimum for $g$ may no longer be a local minimum for the convolved version of $g$ (to see why, try convolving the function $f(x) = x - 3x I(x\leq 0) + I(x \leq 0)$ with a Gaussian $N(0,\sigma^2)$ for any $\sigma&gt;0$).
To avoid this, we instead consider a “truncated” version of $g$, and then convolve this function in the $x$ variable with a Gaussian to obtain our smoothed version of $g$.</p>

<p>This allows us to define a notion of greedy min-max equilibrium.  We say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if $y^\star$ is an approximate local maximum of $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, and $x^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of this smoothed version of $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Greedy min-max equilibrium:</b>
$(x^{\star}, y^{\star})$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if

 
where $S(x,y):= \mathrm{smooth}_x(\mathrm{truncate}(g(x, y))$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any point which is a local saddle point (talked about earlier) also satisifeis our equilibrium conditions. The converse, however, cannot be true as a local saddle point may not always exist. Further, for compactly supported convex-concave functions a point is a greedy min-max equilibrium (in an appropriate sense) if and only if it is a global min-max point. (See Section 7 and Appendix A respectively in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">our paper</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="greedy-min-max-equilibria-always-exist-and-can-be-found-efficiently">Greedy min-max equilibria always exist! (And can be found efficiently)</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> we show: A greedy min-max equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist provided that $f$ is uniformly bounded with Lipschitz Hessian. We do so by providing an algorithm which converges to a greedy min-max equilibrium, and, moreover, we show that it is able to do this in polynomial time from any initial point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Main theorem:</b> Suppose that we are given access to a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and to its gradient and Hessian.  And suppose that $f$ is unformly bounded by $b&gt;0$ and has $L$-Lipschitz Hessian.
Then given any initial point, our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-greedy min-max equilibrium $(x^\star,y^\star)$ of $f$ in $\mathrm{poly}(b, L, d, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of difficulties that our algorithm and proof must overcome:
One difficulty in designing an algorithm is that the greedy max function may be discontinuous. 
To find an approximate local minimum of a discontinuous function, our algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo hill climbing algorithm with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408007">zeroth-order optimization version</a> of stochastic gradient descent.
Another difficulty is that, while one can easily compute a greedy path from any starting point, there may be many different greedy paths which end up at different local maxima.
Searching for the greedy path which leads to the local maximum point with the largest value of $f$ may be infeasible.
In other words the greedy max function $g$ may be intractable to compute.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_paths_no_axes_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 4.</b>There are many different greedy paths that start at the same point $A$.  They can end up at different local maxima ($B$, $D$), with different values of $f$.  In many cases it may be intractable to search over all these paths to compute the greedy max function.
 </div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To get around this problem, rather than computing the exact value of $g(x,y)$, we instead compute a lower bound $h(x,y)$ for the greedy max function. Since we are able to obtain this lower bound by computing only a <em>single</em> greedy path, it is much easier to compute than greedy max function.</p>

<p>In our paper, we prove that if 1) $x^\star$ is an approximate local minimum for the this lower bound $h(\cdot, y^\star)$, and  2) $y^\star$ is a an approximate local maximum for $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, then $x^\star$ is also an approximate local minimum for the greedy max $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.
This allows us to design an algorithm which obtains a greedy min-max point by minimizing the computationally tractable lower bound $h$, instead of the greedy max function which may be intractable to compute.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown how to extend a notion of second-order equilibrium for minimization to min-max optimization which is guaranteed to exist for any function which is bounded and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz gradient and Hessian.
We have also shown that our algorithm is able to find this equilibrium in  polynomial time from any initial point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results do not require any additional assumptions such as convexity, monotonicity, or sufficient bilinearity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an upcoming blog post we will show how one can use some of the ideas from here to obtain a new min-max optimization algorithm with applications to stably training GANs.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-094 |  Is it possible to improve Yao’s XOR lemma using reductions that exploit the efficiency of their oracle? | 

	Ronen Shaltiel</title>
    <summary>Yao's XOR lemma states that for every function $f:\set{0,1}^k \ar \set{0,1}$, if $f$ has hardness $2/3$ for $P/poly$ (meaning that for every circuit $C$ in $P/poly$, $\Pr[C(X)=f(X)] \le 2/3$ on a uniform input $X$), then the task of computing $f(X_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus f(X_t)$ for sufficiently large $t$ has hardness $\half +\epsilon$ for $P/poly$.

Known proofs of this lemma cannot achieve $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k^{\omega(1)}}$, and even for $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k}$, we do not know how to replace
$P/poly$ by AC$^0[\textsc{parity}]$ (the class of constant depth circuits with the gates $\set{\textsc{and,or,not,parity}}$ of unbounded fan-in).

Recently, Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) (building on a sequence of earlier works) showed that these limitations cannot be circumvented by \emph{black-box reductions}. Namely, by reductions $\Red^{(\cdot)}$ that given oracle access to a function $D$ that violates the conclusion of Yao's XOR lemma, implement a circuit that violates the assumption of Yao's XOR lemma.

There are a few known reductions in the related literature on worst-case to average case reductions that are \emph{non-black box}. Specifically, the reductions of Gutfreund, Shaltiel and Ta Shma (Computational Complexity 2007) and  Hirahara (FOCS 2018)) are ``class reductions'' that are only guaranteed to succeed when given oracle access to an oracle $D$ from some efficient class of algorithms. These works seem to circumvent some black-box impossibility results.

In this paper we extend the previous limitations of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola to class reductions, giving evidence that class reductions cannot yield the desired improvements in Yao's XOR lemma.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first limitation on reductions for hardness amplification that applies to class reductions.

Our technique imitates the previous lower bounds for black-box reductions, replacing the inefficient oracle used in that proof, with an efficient one that is based on limited independence, and developing tools to deal with the technical difficulties that arise following this replacement.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (6/24):</span></strong> For further thoughts and context about this unfolding saga, see <a href="https://unherd.com/2020/06/slate-star-codex-must-remain-anonymous/">this excellent piece by Tom Chivers</a> (author of <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em>, so far the only book about the rationalist community, one that I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4361">reviewed here</a>).</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>This morning, like many others, I woke up to the terrible news that Scott Alexander—the man I call “the greatest Scott A. of the Internet”—has <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">deleted SlateStarCodex in its entirety</a>.  The reason, Scott explains, is that the <em>New York Times</em> was planning to run an article about SSC.  Even though the article was going to be <em>positive</em>, NYT decided that by policy, it would need to include Scott’s real surname (Alexander is his middle name).  Scott felt that revealing his name to the world would endanger himself and his psychiatry patients.  Taking down his entire blog was the only recourse that he saw.</p>



<p>The NYT writer, Cade Metz, was someone who I’d previously known and trusted from his reporting on Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.  So in recent weeks, I’d spent a couple hours on the phone with Cade, answering his questions about the rationality community, the history of my interactions with it, and why I thought SlateStarCodex spoke to so many readers.  Alas, when word got around the rationality community that Cade was writing a story, a huge panic arose that he was planning on some sort of <em>Gawker</em>-style hit piece or takedown.  Trying to tamp down the fire, I told Scott Alexander and others that I knew Cade, his intentions were good, he was only trying to understand the community, and everyone should help him by talking to him openly.</p>



<p>In a year of historic ironies, here’s another one: that it was the decent, reasonable, and well-meaning Cade Metz, rather than any of the SneerClubbers or Twitter-gangsters who despised Scott Alexander for sharing his honest thoughts on hot-button issues, who finally achieved the latter’s dark dream of exiling Scott from the public sphere.</p>



<p>The recent news had already been bad enough: Trump’s “temporary suspension” of J1 and H1B visas (which will deal a body blow to American universities this year, and to all the foreign scientists who planned to work at them), on top of the civil unrest, on top of the economic collapse, on top of the now-resurgent coronavirus.  But with no more SlateStarCodex, now I <em>really</em> feel like my world is coming to an end.</p>



<p>I’ve considered SSC to be the best blog on the Internet since not long after discovering it five years ago.  Of course my judgment is colored by one of the most notorious posts in SSC’s history (“Untitled”) being a ferocious defense of me, when thousands were attacking me and it felt like my life was finished.  But that’s merely what brought me there in the first place.  I stayed because of Scott’s insights about everything else, and because of the humor and humanity and craftsmanship of his prose.  Since then I had the privilege to become friends with Scott, not only virtually but in real life, and to meet dozens of others in the SSC community, in its Bay Area epicenter and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In my view, for SSC to be <em>permanently</em> deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of, let’s say, John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works.  That might sound like hyperbole, but not (I don’t think) to the tens of thousands who read Scott’s essays and fiction, particularly during their 2013-2016 heyday, and who went from casual enjoyment to growing admiration to the gradual recognition that they were experiencing, “live,” the works that future generations of teachers will assign their students when they cover the early twenty-first century.  The one thing that mitigates this tragedy is the hope that it will yet be reversed (and, of course, the fact that backups still exist in the bowels of the Internet).</p>



<p>When I discovered Scott Alexander in early 2015, the one issue that gave me pause was his strange insistence on maintaining pseudonymity, even as he was already then becoming more and more of a public figure.  In effect, Scott was trying to erect a firewall between his Internet persona and his personal and professional identities, and was <em>relying on the entire world’s goodwill</em> not to breach that firewall.  I thought to myself, “this can’t <em>possibly</em> last!  Scott simply writes too well to evade mainstream notice forever—and once he’s on the world’s radar, he’ll need to make a choice, about who he is and whether he’s ready to own his gifts to posterity under his real name.”  In retrospect, what astonishes me is that Scott has been able to maintain the “double life” for as long as he has!</p>



<p>In his takedown notice, Scott writes that it’s considered vitally important in psychiatry for patients to know almost nothing about their doctors, beyond their names and their areas of expertise.  That caused me to wonder: OK, but doesn’t the world already have enough psychiatrists who are ciphers to their patients?  Would it be so terrible to have one psychiatrist with a clear public persona—possibly even one who patients sought out <em>because</em> of his public persona, because his writings gave evidence that he’d have sympathy or insight about their conditions?  To become a psychiatrist, does one really need to take a lifelong vow of boringness—a vow never to do or say anything notable enough that one would be “outed” to one’s patients?  What would Freud, or Jung, or any of the other famous therapist-intellectuals of times past have thought about such a vow?</p>



<p>Scott also mentions that he’s gotten death threats, and harassing calls to his workplace, from people who hate him because of his blog (and who found his real name by sleuthing).  I wish I knew a solution to that.  For what it’s worth, my blogging has <em>also</em> earned me a death threat, and threats to sue me, and accusatory letters to the president of my university—although in my case, the worst threats came neither from Jew-hating neo-Nazis nor from nerd-bashing SJWs, but from crackpots enraged that I wouldn’t use my blog to credit their proof of P≠NP or their refutation of quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>When I started <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2005, I remember thinking: this is it.  From now on, the only secrets I’ll have in life will be ephemeral and inconsequential ones.  From this day on, every student in my class, every prospective employer, every woman who I ask on a date (I wasn’t married yet), can know whatever they want to know about my political sympathies, my deepest fears and insecurities, any of it, with a five-second Google search.  Am I ready for that?  I decided that I was—partly just because I‘ve never had the mental space to maintain multiple partitioned identities <em>anyway</em>, to remember what each one is or isn’t allowed to know and say!  I won’t pretend that this is the right decision for everyone, but it was my decision, and I stuck with it, and it wasn’t always easy but I’m still here and so evidently are you.</p>



<p>I’d be <em>overjoyed</em> if Scott Alexander were someday to reach a place in his life where he felt comfortable deciding similarly.  That way, not only could he enjoy the full acclaim that he’s earned for what he’s given to the world, but (much more importantly) his tens of thousands of fans would be able to continue benefitting from his insights.</p>



<p>For now, though, the brute fact is that Scott is obviously <em>not</em> comfortable making that choice.  That being so, it seems to me that, if the NYT was able to respect the pseudonymity of Banksy and many others who it’s reported on in the past, when revealing their real names would serve no public interest, then it should also be able to respect Scott Alexander’s pseudonymity.  Especially now that Scott has sent the most credible signal imaginable of how much he values that pseudonymity, a signal that astonished even me.  The world does not exist only to serve its rare geniuses, but surely it can make such trivial concessions to them.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-093 |  Reduction From Non-Unique Games To Boolean Unique Games | 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Ronen Eldan</title>
    <summary>We reduce the problem of proving a "Boolean Unique Games Conjecture" (with gap $1-\delta$ vs. $1-C\delta$, for any $C&gt; 1$, and sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$) to the problem of proving a PCP Theorem for a certain non-unique game.
In a previous work, Khot and Moshkovitz suggested an inefficient candidate reduction (i.e., without a proof of soundness). 
The current work is the first to provide an efficient reduction along with a proof of soundness. 
The non-unique game we reduce from is similar to non-unique games for which PCP theorems are known.
Our proof relies on a new concentration theorem for functions in Gaussian space that are restricted to a random hyperplane. We bound the typical Euclidean distance between the low degree part of the restriction of the function to the hyperplane and the restriction to the hyperplane of the low degree part of the function.</summary>

    <title>The Uncanny Valley of Virtual Conferences</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We wrapped up two amazing days of <a href="http://www.l4dc.org/">L4DC 2020</a> last Friday. It’s pretty wild to watch this community grow so quickly: starting as a <a href="https://kgatsis.github.io/learning_for_control_workshop_CDC2018/">workshop</a> at <a href="https://kgatsis.github.io/learning_for_control_workshop_CDC2018/">CDC 2018</a>, the conference organizers put together an <a href="https://l4dc.mit.edu/">inaugural event at MIT</a> in only a few months and were overwhelmed by nearly 400 attendees. Based on a groundswell of support from the participants, we decided to add contributed talks and papers this year. We had passionate volunteers for our <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/organizers-pc">70-person program committee</a>, and they did heroic work of reviewing 135 submissions for this year’s program.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the pandemic hit forcing us to cancel our in-person event. As most conferences in a similar situation as ours, we decided to move to a virtual setting. I think that had we not had contributed papers, we would have simply canceled this year (I’ll return to this later). But to respect the passion and hard-work of our contributors, we tried to come up with a reasonable plan for running this conference virtually.</p>

<p>When we started planning to go virtual, there were too many options to sort through: Zoom webinars and breakout rooms? Sli.do Q&amp;As? Google Hangouts? Slack channels? We had so many tools for virtual community building, each with their own pluses and minuses. Our main constraints were that we wanted to highlight the best contributed papers as talks in some way, to give visibility to the wonderful set of accepted papers without burdening the authors with more work, to be inclusive to the broader community of folks interested in learning and automation, and, importantly, to not charge registration fees.</p>

<p>We eventually settled on the following scheme:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We had a Zoom room for invited and contributed speakers and moderators.</li>
  <li>This Zoom was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sJb1k9dVY">live streamed to Youtube</a>.</li>
  <li>Questions were gathered by grad student moderators who scanned the YouTube live chat and then relayed inquiries back to the speakers.</li>
  <li>We tried to keep the live part under four hours per day and to provide ample breaks. We recognize how hard it is to sit in front of a live stream for much more than that.</li>
  <li>Further discussion was then done on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=L4DC.org/2020/Conference">OpenReview</a>, where we hosted all accepted papers of the conference.</li>
  <li>The proceedings of the conference were subsequently archived by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/">Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Though it took a lot of work to tie all these pieces together, everything went super smoothly in the end. I was basically able to run the entire AV setup from my garage.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="where the magic happens" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/command_station.jpg" width="250px"/></p>

<p>The only thing that cost money here was the Zoom account (20 dollars/month, though subsidized by Berkeley) and my home internet connection. I know that Zoom and YouTube have well documented issues, and I think it’s imperative that they continue to strive to fix these problems, but I also think it’s easy to forget how empowering this technology is. This format opens up conferences to those who can’t travel for financial or logistical reasons, and lowers the energy to engage with cutting edge research. Being able to sit in my garage and run a virtual conference with speakers spanning 10 time zones and nearly 2000 viewers is a wonder of modern times.</p>

<h2 id="second-life-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">Second Life still has a long way to go.</h2>

<p>There are still many parts of the online conference that felt cheated and incomplete. I still don’t know how to run a virtual poster session effectively. Most of our papers have not yet received any comments on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=L4DC.org/2020/Conference">OpenReview</a>, though comments are still open and I’d encourage you to drop by and ask questions! Partially, I think this lack of engagement stems from the considerable amount of effort required to participate, especially when it is compared to somewhat aimlessly ambling through a poster session.</p>

<p>Indeed, many aspects of live conferences are simply not replicable with our current tools, whether they be chance encounters or meetings with friends from far away. On the other hand, maybe we shouldn’t try to replicate this experience! Maybe we need to think harder about what opportunities our technology has for building communities and how we can better support these facets of academic interaction. When I think back on the decades of conferences I’ve attended, I can think of only a few posters that really got me interested in reading a paper, and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3323-the-tradeoffs-of-large-scale-learning.pdf">one later won a test of time award at NeurIPS</a>. Poster sessions always felt like an anachronistic means to justify a work travel expense rather than an effective means of academic knowledge dissemination. Is there a better way forward that uses our current technological constraints to amplify the voices of young scholars with cutting edge ideas? I don’t have great ideas for how to do this yet, but new interaction structures may emerge as we deal with at least one more year without meetings with hundreds of people.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-should-conferences-cost">How much should conferences cost?</h2>

<p>We were able to do L4DC, with the proceedings and all, for free. Obviously, the program committee put in tons of work in reviewing and organizing the logistics. But reviewing labor isn’t compensated by any conference. All peer reviewed conferences rely on the volunteer service labor of a dedicated program committee. The main line items we expected for L4DC were for renting physical space, paying an AV crew, and food. But in the virtual world, these expenses drop to near zero.</p>

<p>I’m supposed to give a plenary talk at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">Virtual IFAC Congress</a> in July. I have to say, I am troubled: IFAC is charging <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/registration/">380 euros per person</a> for registration. What does one get for this sum? Access to video streams and the ability to publish papers. This seems exorbitantly expensive. Why would anyone watch a talk I give at IFAC when I promise to just release it on YouTube at the same time? What value is IFAC providing back to the academic community?</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-papers-from-talks">Decoupling papers from talks</h2>

<p>One of the main things the registration fee at many conferences provides is a stamp of academic approval. It is a de facto publication fee. Led by computer science, conferences in engineering are replacing journals as the archives where CV-building work is cataloged. Though this wasn’t the initial purpose of conferences in computer science, conferences do have many attractive features over journals for rapidly evolving fields: Conferences have speedy turn-around times and clearly delineated submission and decision dates. This archival aspect of conferences, however, has nothing to do with community building or scholarly dissemination. Why do we need to couple a talk to a publication? Can’t we separate these two as is done in every other academic field?</p>

<p>Our collective pandemic moment gives us an opportunity not only to rethink community-building but also our publication model. With 10000-person mega-conferences like <a href="http://icml.cc">AI Summer</a> and <a href="http://neurips.cc">AI Winter</a>, why can’t we keep all of the deadlines the same but remove all of the talks? We’d still have the same reviewing architecture, which has been wholly virtual for over a decade. And we could still publish all of the proceedings online for free, which has been done for multiple decades.</p>

<p>The decoupling proposal here would have effectively zero overhead on our communities: the deadlines, CMTs, program committees, and proceedings could all function exactly the same way (though, to be fair, these systems all have warts worth improving upon). New archival, fast-turnaround journals could easily start using the same tools. Indeed, I’ve always been enamored with the idea of an arxiv-overlay journal that simply is a table of contents that points towards particular versions of arxiv papers as “accepted.” And a really radical idea would be to solicit <em>talks</em>—not papers—for virtual conferences where potential speakers would submit slides or videos to demonstrate proficiency in the medium in which they’d present.</p>

<p>I tend to dismiss most of the bloviation about how coronavirus permanently changes everything about how we live our lives. But it does provide us an opportunity to pause and assess whether current systems are functioning well. I’d argue that the current conference system hasn’t been functioning well for a while, but this simple decoupling of papers and talks might clear up a lot of the issues currently facing the hard-charging computing world.</p>

    <title>Subpract</title>
    <summary>I’ve written here before about subtraction games, two-player games in which the players remove tokens from a pile of tokens, the number of removed tokens is required to belong to a designated subtraction set, and the goal is to make the last move. For instance, subtract a square, a game I studied at FUN 2018, is of this type, with the subtraction set being the square numbers.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/04/18/subtraction-games.html">written here before</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction_game">subtraction games</a>, two-player games in which the players remove tokens from a pile of tokens, the number of removed tokens is required to belong to a designated <em>subtraction set</em>, and the goal is to make the last move. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtract_a_square">subtract a square</a>, a game <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2018.20">I studied at FUN 2018</a>, is of this type, with the subtraction set being the square numbers.</p>

<p>At some point in studying these games I also briefly looked at the subtraction game whose subtraction set is the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_number">practical numbers</a>, the numbers whose sums of divisors include all values up to the given numbers. The sequence of these numbers begins</p>



<p>and it turns out to be important here that, after the first one, they’re all even. Let’s call the subtraction game with this subtraction set <em>subpract</em>.</p>

<p>For a subtraction game, or more generally any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game">impartial game</a>, the game states can be partitioned into -positions (where the player who played previously is winning with optimal play) and -positions (where the next player to move can force a win); the -positions tend to be rarer than the -positions, and it’s important to know where they are because the optimal strategy in the game is to move to a -position whenever possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://oeis.org/A275432">OEIS A275432</a> lists the -positions for subpract. They are:</p>



<p>For instance, it’s a winning move in subpract to move to a pile of ten tokens (if you can), because  whatever move your opponent makes from there lets you win. If your opponent takes an even number of tokens, you will be able to take all the remaining tokens and win immediately. And if your opponent takes one token, leaving a pile of nine tokens, you can win by taking six more and leaving a pile of three tokens. Then, regardless of how your opponent responds, you will be able to take all the tokens on your next move.</p>

<p>An obvious pattern jumps out from this list of -positions: they come in pairs, spaced three apart. More precisely, an even number  is a -position if and only if the odd number  is a -position. It’s not just a coincidence, true at the start of the sequence and then false later on: it carries on throughout the entire sequence of -positions. More strongly, this same three-apart pairing of  -positions holds for any subtraction game whose subtraction set contains <span style="white-space: nowrap;">, , and ,</span> and does not contain any other odd numbers.</p>

<h1 id="proof-of-the-pairing-property">Proof of the pairing property</h1>

<p>To prove this, I need to show that  is a -position if and only if  is a winning position. We can prove this by induction, where we assume that all the -positions below  and  are paired up in the same way, and use it to prove that the same pairing holds for  and . The basic idea of the proof is to assume that one of the two players has a winning strategy for the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">position ,</span> and to copy that strategy for , most of the time playing the same moves and responses that you would play for the smaller position. Whenever a sequence of moves is applicable to both  and  and preserves the parity of the starting position, the induction hypothesis shows that it has the same outcome for both starting positions. However, there are a few cases where you may be forced to deviate from this strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If  is an -position, but its winning move is to subtract one token leading to an odd -position , then copying that move from the starting position  would lead to the position  which may not be a -position. Instead you should subtract four tokens to get to the position  directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  is a -position, and you’re trying to copy its winning strategy in the position , your opponent may be able to subtract , a move that is not possible in , so you have no response to copy. But in this case the result is a pile of just one token, from which you can immediately win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, if you’re trying to copy the winning strategy for -position  in the position , your opponent may subtract only one token. In this case, the winning response when starting from  might be to subtract an even number, leading to an odd -position . If you copy this response, you will end up at  which may not be a -position. But instead of copying the -strategy, you can simply subtract two tokens, leading to the position  itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, it may be the case that the winning response to an opponent’s even move from  is to take a single token, leading to odd -position . Copying this strategy from the starting position  would again lead to . But in this case you can subtract four tokens leading to  again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s tempting to guess that, more strongly than pairing -positions and -positions in this way, subpract and similar subtraction games have a pairing of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem">nim-values</a>, where the nim-value of an odd position always equals the nim-value of the even position three units smaller. But it’s not true. For instance, in subpract, a pile of four tokens has nim-value 1 while a pile of seven tokens has nim-value 4.</p>

<h1 id="other-subtraction-sets">Other subtraction sets</h1>

<p>Probably the most obvious choice of another subtraction set that begins  and has no larger odd numbers would be the powers of two, but they don’t give rise to an interesting subtraction game: the -positions are just the multiples of three. The same thing happens whenever there are no multiples of three in the subtraction set, as happens for instance with the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/06/21/Telephone number (mathematics)">telephone numbers</a> and <a href="http://oeis.org/A003422">left factorials</a>.</p>

<p>Another natural subtraction set to which this theory applies is the sequence of <a href="http://oeis.org/A025487">Hardy–Ramanujan integers (A025487)</a>, the numbers whose prime factorization  has a non-increasing sequence of exponents . They are:</p>



<p>These are a subset of the practical numbers so one would expect their subtraction game to have more-dense -positions. My implementation found that these -positions are:</p>



<p>again obeying the offset-by-three pairing as it should, and otherwise having somewhat irregular intervals between its -positions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://oeis.org/A000084">enumeration function of the series-parallel graphs and the cographs</a> is even after its first term because of series-parallel duality; it begins</p>



<p>These are not all practical; for instance, 10, 1532, and 43930 are not practical. The sequence of -positions for their subtraction game begins</p>



<p>mostly differing by three between consecutive values but with occasional glitches where the larger multiple-of-three subtraction set values kick in.</p>

<p>And finally, if we subtract numbers that are one less than a prime, we get the subtraction set</p>



<p>and the sequence of -positions</p>



<p>Its small values have many five-unit gaps but that pattern appears to die out after the quadruple of -positions .</p>

Not just for today, but for the summer at least, Ken and I want to share some gossip, share some problems, and ask our readers a question.</p>
<p>
The question first. Ken and I wonder if GLL should start a virtual theory “lunch” meeting, that would meet periodically via Zoom. It would be like meeting for a theory lunch in the old days—just not all in the same room. Some topic might be agreed on, perhaps a short presentation, and always a chance to swap some gossip. Plus maybe ask the group for advice on a problem.</p>
<p>
I do miss the old meetings: </p>

<p>
What do you think? Should we have such meetings?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Gossip </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The study of gossip feeds into other issues of the spread of information and misinformation during an election year. Ken’s Buffalo colleague Kenny Joseph has <a href="https://kennyjoseph.github.io/">research</a> on the spread of fake news and Twitter sentiment using mathematical tools adjacent to those of the trio above. Ken and I still intend to say more about epidemiology models ourselves when we get time. But no, here by “gossip” we just mean actual pieces of gossip—just as at a conference or other kind of in-person meeting.</p>
<p>
Here are two examples of the kind of gossip we might exchange. </p>
<p>
Anna Gilbert is moving from Michigan math to Yale math and statistics. She will be the John C. Malone Professor of Mathematics, Professor of Statistics &amp; Data Science. Pretty impressive. She was at Michigan math for <img alt="{2^{4}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{4}}"/> years. She told me that she could not wait for the next power of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>, and thus had to try a new place, with new challenges. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/gilbert-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17233" height="163" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/gilbert-1.png?w=127&amp;h=163" width="127"/></a></p>
<p>
Rich DeMillo is a long time friend who is at Georgia Institute of Technology and is not moving. He continues working on making voting fair, secure, and efficient. He is referenced in a recent article on voting issues in Georgia. See <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/activists-cite-tabulation-flaw-georgia-mail-ballots">here</a> for details. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/demillo-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17234" height="138" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/demillo-1.jpg?w=149&amp;h=138" width="149"/></a></p>
<p>
Note: we have in mind pleasant and factual gossip. The most useful kind is about probable directions and emphases to make projects attractive to pursue. This leads into our other component.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Possible Problems To Present </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are a problem from each of us as examples of what could be discussed in these meetings and why that might give advantage over just hunting the literature. Both are about factoring—always factoring…</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Factoring: Ken </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken, would like to know about field tests of approximative methods in quantum computing, specifically of shortcuts to Shor’s Algorithm. The approximations I have in mind are rougher than those I find in the literature and need not be physically natural.</p>
<p>
To explain, the way Shor’s algorithm is proven correct in Shor’s paper and all textbooks we know—including ours—uses an exact analysis involving the quantum Fourier transform, in which exponentially fine phase angles appear in terms. Approximation can be argued in several ways. Circuits of Hadamard, CNOT, and <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/>-gates, in which no phase angle finer than <img alt="{\pi/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi/4}"/> appears, can approximate arbitrary quantum circuits to exponential precision with polynomial overhead. With just Hadamard and Toffoli gates, hence <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> and <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi}"/> as the only phases, one can approximate the data returned by measurements in the algorithm, though without approximating the algorithm’s result vectors in complex Hilbert space. There are other ways to approximate those vectors while eliding the finer phase components. We would like to see more attention to the concrete overheads of all these methods.</p>
<p>
What I would really like to discuss, however, is efforts toward more-brusque approximations that could yield new classical attempts on factoring. For a broad example, note that not only does <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{BQP}}"/> reduce to <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/> but also individual steps in Shor’s algorithm can be broken down as reductions to counting. Now suppose we apply approximate counting heuristics to those steps. The stock answer for why this doesn’t work to approximate quantum measurement properties <em>globally</em> is that those probabilities have the form </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  p = \frac{f_1(x) - f_2(x)}{D} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++p+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bf_1%28x%29+-+f_2%28x%29%7D%7BD%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  p = \frac{f_1(x) - f_2(x)}{D} "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{f_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_1}"/> and <img alt="{f_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2}"/> are <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/> functions and <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> is something like <img alt="{2^{n/2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{n/2}}"/>. Note the knowledge beforehand that <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> is between <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> and <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. The point is that <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> is exponential yet smaller than the additive approximations possible in polynomial time for <img alt="{f_1(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_1(x)}"/> and <img alt="{f_2(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2(x)}"/> individually, so the approximation gives no help to the difference. </p>
<p>
However, this does not prevent using approximations of magnitudes that are not differences at intermediate steps. For a vein of more particular examples, I raise the translation from quantum gates to Boolean formulas in my 2018 <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-56499-8_4">paper</a> with Amlan Chakrabarti and my recent PhD graduate Chaowen Guan. This translation can encode the state <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/> at any intermediate stage of an execution of Shor’s algorithm by a Boolean formula <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. The size of <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> stays linear in the size of the quantum circuit being simulated—the exponential explosion happens only when we try to count solutions to <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. The formula <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> encodes all the information in <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/>, including the implicit presence of fine phase angles. Now suppose we alter <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> to a <img alt="{\phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi'}"/> whose corresponding <img alt="{\Phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi'}"/> is a simplified approximation of <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/>. The kicker is that <img alt="{\Phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi'}"/> might not need to be a legal quantum state. The transformations in our paper for later stages of the circuit will still apply building on <img alt="{\phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi'}"/>. </p>

Is there any chance of this working? Heuristic approaches applying SAT to factoring have been tried and found to be <a href="https://toughsat.appspot.com/">tough</a>. The nice site <a href="http://beyondnp.org/">BeyondNP</a> includes <a href="http://beyondnp.org/pages/solvers/model-counters-exact/">links</a> to #SAT counters such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marcthurley/sharpsat">sharpSAT</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/Cachet/index.htm">Cachet</a>. Thus we are not asking anything outlandish. Leveraging Shor’s algorithm might be a new approach. Has anyone tried it? That’s the kind of question I would visit a conference to ask, where wider arity might work better than asking people individually. Thus also for raising it in a meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Factoring: Dick </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
I have recently been thinking about the power of weak sub-theories of Peano Arithmetic. There are many proofs known that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The usual proofs use this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For all <img alt="{x&gt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3E1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x&gt;1}"/> there is some prime <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> that divides <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this it is not hard to prove, in many ways, that there are an infinite number of primes. Euclid’s original proof uses it in the step: Let <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> divide <img alt="{p_{1}\cdots p_{n} + 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_%7B1%7D%5Ccdots+p_%7Bn%7D+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_{1}\cdots p_{n} + 1}"/>. The idea is suppose some weak theory can prove the above. This means that it can prove: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \forall x&gt;1 \ \exists y \ y|x \text{ and } \mathsf{prime}(y). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cforall+x%3E1+%5C+%5Cexists+y+%5C+y%7Cx+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%5Cmathsf%7Bprime%7D%28y%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \forall x&gt;1 \ \exists y \ y|x \text{ and } \mathsf{prime}(y). "/></p>
<p>	 I believe that this shows that if the theory is weak enough that this implies that factoring is in polynomial time. Is this known? Is it true? </p>
<p>
Once again, we can hunt for literature on this. We can ask individual people, such as Avi Wigderson and various co-authors of his. But our hunch is that this topic was explored in the 1990s without a definitive resolution. It could be more effective to get up to speed on it and share ideas in a meeting.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Time for a non-depressing post.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, which is already available in English and Russian, is about to be published in both Chinese and Japanese.  (So if you read this blog, but have avoided tackling QCSD because your Chinese or Japanese is better than your English, today’s your day!)  To go along with the new editions, Cambridge University Press asked me to write a new foreword, reflecting on what happened in the seven years since the book was published.  The editor, Paul Dobson, kindly gave me permission to share the new foreword on my blog.  So without further ado…</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p><em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> began its life as a course that I taught at the University of Waterloo in 2006.  Seven years later, it became the book that you now hold.  Its preface ended with the following words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here’s hoping that, in 2020, this book will be as badly in need of revision as the 2006 lecture notes were in 2013.</p></blockquote>



<p>As I write this, in June 2020, a lot has happened that I would never have predicted in 2013.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and is up for reelection shortly.  This is not a political book, so let me resist the urge to comment further.  Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, crashing economies, and shutting down schools and universities (including mine).  And in the past few weeks, protests against racism and police brutality started in America and then spread to the world, despite the danger of protesting during a pandemic.</p>



<p>Leaving aside the state of the world, my own life is also very different than it was seven years ago.  Along with my family, I’ve moved from MIT to the University of Texas in Austin.  My daughter, who was born at almost exactly the same time as <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, is now a first-grader, and is joined by a 3-year-old son.  When my daughter’s school shut down due to the coronavirus, I began home-schooling her in math, computer science, and physics—in some of the exact same topics covered in this book.  I’m now engaged in an experiment to see what portion of this material can be made accessible to a 7-year-old.</p>



<p>But what about the material itself?  How has it held up over seven years?  Both the bad news and the (for you) good news, I suppose, is that it’s <em>not</em> particularly out of date.  The intellectual underpinnings of quantum computing and its surrounding disciplines remain largely as they were.  Still, let me discuss what <em>has</em> changed.</p>



<p>Between 2013 and 2020, the field of quantum computing made a striking transition, from a mostly academic pursuit to a major technological arms race.  The Chinese government, the US government, and the European Union have all pledged billions of dollars for quantum computing research.  Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, Intel, and Honeywell also now all have well-funded groups tasked with building quantum computers, or providing quantum-computing-related software and services, or even just doing classical computing that’s “quantum-inspired.”  These giants are joined by dozens of startups focused entirely on quantum computing.</p>



<p>The new efforts vary greatly in caliber; some efforts seem rooted in visions of what quantum computers will be able to help with, and how soon, that I find to be wildly overoptimistic or even irresponsible.  But perhaps it’s always this way when a new technology moves from an intellectual aspiration to a commercial prospect.  Having joined the field around 1999, before there were <em>any</em> commercial efforts in quantum computing, I’ve found the change disorienting.</p>



<p>But while some of the new excitement is based on pure hype—on marketers now mixing some “quantum” into their word-salad of “blockchain,” “deep learning,” etc., with no particular understanding of any of the ingredients—there really have been some scientific advances in quantum computing since 2013, a fire underneath the smoke.</p>



<p>Surely the crowning achievement of quantum computing during this period was the achievement of “quantum supremacy,” which a team at Google announced in the fall of 2019.  For the first time, a programmable quantum computer was used to outperform any classical computer on earth, running any currently known algorithm.  Google’s device, called “Sycamore,” with 53 superconducting qubits cooled to a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero, solved a well-defined albeit probably useless sampling problem in about 3 minutes.  To compare, current state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers need a few days, even with hundreds of thousands of parallel processors.  Ah, but will a better classical simulation be possible?  That’s an open question in quantum complexity!  The discussion of that question draws on theoretical work that various colleagues and I did over the past decade.  That work in turn draws on my so-called <strong>PostBQP</strong>=<strong>PP</strong> theorem from 2004, explained in this book.</p>



<p>In the past seven years, there were also several breakthroughs in quantum computing theory—some of which resolved open problems mentioned in this book. </p>



<p>In 2018, Ran Raz and Avishay Tal gave an oracle relative to which <strong>BQP</strong> (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time) is not contained in <strong>PH</strong> (the Polynomial Hierarchy).  This solved one of the main open questions, since 1993, about where <strong>BQP</strong> fits in with classical complexity classes, at least in the black-box setting.  (What does that mean?  Read the book!)  Raz and Tal’s proof used a candidate problem that I had defined in 2009 and called “Forrelation.”</p>



<p>Also in 2018, Urmila Mahadev gave a protocol, based on cryptography, by which a polynomial-time quantum computer (i.e., a <strong>BQP</strong> machine) could always prove the results of its computation to a classical polynomial-time skeptic, purely by exchanging classical messages with the skeptic.  Following Urmila’s achievement, I was delighted to give her a $25 prize for solving the problem that I’d announced on my blog back in 2007.</p>



<p>Perhaps most spectacularly of all, in 2020, Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen proved that <strong>MIP*</strong>=<strong>RE</strong>.  Here <strong>MIP*</strong> means the class of problems solvable using multi-prover interactive proof systems with quantumly entangled provers (and classical polynomial-time verifiers), while <strong>RE</strong> means Recursively Enumerable: a class that includes not only all the computable problems, but even the infamous halting problem (!).  To say it more simply, <em>entangled provers can convince a polynomial-time verifier that an arbitrary Turing machine halts</em>.  Besides its intrinsic interest, a byproduct of this breakthrough was to answer a decades-old question in pure math, the so-called Connes Embedding Conjecture (by <em>refuting</em> the conjecture).  To my knowledge, the new result represents the first time that quantum computing has reached “all the way up the ladder of hardness” to touch uncomputable problems.  It’s also the first time that non-relativizing techniques, like the ones central to the study of interactive proofs, were ever used in computability theory.</p>



<p>In a different direction, the last seven years have witnessed an astonishing convergence between quantum information and quantum gravity—something that was just starting when <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> appeared in 2013, and that I mentioned as an exciting new direction.  Since then, the so-called “It from Qubit” collaboration has brought together quantum computing theorists with string theorists and former string theorists—experts in things like the black hole information problem—to develop a shared language.  One striking proposal that’s emerged from this is a fundamental role for <em>quantum circuit complexity</em>—that is, the smallest number of 1- and 2-qubit gates needed to prepare a given n-qubit state from the all-0 state—in the so-called AdS/CFT (Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory) correspondence.  AdS/CFT is a duality between physical theories involving different numbers of spatial dimensions; for more than twenty years, it’s been a central testbed for ideas about quantum gravity.  But the duality is extremely nonlocal: a “simple” quantity in the AdS theory, like the volume of a wormhole, can correspond to an incredibly “complicated” quantity in the dual CFT.  The new proposal is that the CFT quantity might be not just complicated, but literally circuit complexity itself.  Fanciful as that sounds, the truth is that no one has come up with any other proposal that passes the same sanity checks.  A related new insight is that the nonlocal mapping between the AdS and CFT theories is not merely analogous to, but literally an example of, a quantum error-correcting code: the same mathematical objects that will be needed to build scalable quantum computers.</p>



<p>When <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> was first published, some people thought it went too far in elevating computer science, and computational complexity in particular, to fundamental roles in understanding the physical world.  But even I wasn’t audacious enough to posit connections like the ones above, which are now more-or-less mainstream in quantum gravity research.</p>



<p>I’m proud that I wrote <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, but as the years go by, I find that I have no particular desire to revise it, or even reread it.  It seems far better for the book to stand as a record of what I knew and believed and cared about at a certain moment in time.</p>



<p>The intellectual quest that’s defined my life—the quest to wrap together computation, physics, math, and philosophy into some sort of coherent picture of the world—might never end.  But it does need to start somewhere.  I’m honored that you chose <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> as a place to start or continue your own quest.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Dear fellow theorists,</p>



<p>As you already know, STOC 2020 this year will be a virtual conference. If you are interested in attending the conference, but haven’t registered yet, <a href="http://www.cvent.com/events/52nd-annual-acm-symposium-on-theory-of-computing-stoc-2020-/event-summary-ea5fa7861d1a476d82bc10f667a1c0f4.aspx">please do so soon</a> (students: $25, regular: $50). This will help us ensure we have capacity for various online events. </p>



<p>Upon registration, you should receive a confirmation email from CVENT, also containing access information for various conference events. Also, if you are a student looking to register for STOC but the cost is a burden, please email us at <a href="mailto:stoc2020@ttic.edu">stoc2020@ttic.edu</a>.</p>



<p><strong>How will the conference work?</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Videos</strong>: The videos for all conference talks are now available on YouTube, and can be accessed through the links in the <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2020/STOCprogram.html">conference program</a>. Registration is <em>not required</em> to view the talks on Youtube.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Slack</strong>: The conference has a Slack workspace, with one channel for every paper and workshop, and additional channels for information, announcements, social events, help, etc. The invitations for the Slack workspace will be sent to registered participants. Authors are also encouraged to monitor the channels for their papers. All access information for the conference will also be available here. The workspace is currently active, and will remain active for at least one week after the conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Zoom sessions</strong>: The conference will feature Zoom sessions with short presentations by the speakers. The total time for each paper is 10 minutes. Given that participants have access to the full talks by the speakers on Youtube, these can be thought of as being analogues of poster sessions. The workshops will also be held as separate sessions. The links for the Zoom session via information in the confirmation email.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Social events</strong>: The conference will include junior/senior “lunches”, breakout tables for impromptu and scheduled hangouts, and a group event using <a href="https://gather.town">gather.town</a>. The timings for the events can be found in the conference program. Sign-up links for various events will be sent to all registered participants – please do sign-up soon!</li></ul>



<p>See you all at (virtual) STOC 2020. Please do let us know if you have any questions or suggestions.</p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">(1) To start with some rare good news: I was delighted that the US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 holding led by Chief Justice Roberts (!), struck down the Trump administration’s plan to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals).

<p>(1) To start with some rare good news: I was delighted that the US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-587_5ifl.pdf">holding</a> led by Chief Justice Roberts (!), struck down the Trump administration’s plan to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Dismantling DACA would’ve been a first step toward deporting 700,000 overwhelmingly blameless and peaceful people from, in many cases, the only homes they remember, for no particular reason other than to slake the resentment of Trump’s base. Better still was the majority’s argument: that when, by law, a federal agency has to supply a <em>reason</em> for a policy change (in this case, ending DACA), its reason can’t just be blatantly invented <em>post facto</em>.</p>



<p>To connect to my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4845">last post</a>: I hope this gives some evidence that, if Trump refuses to accept an electoral loss in November, and if it ends up in the Supreme Court as Bush v. Gore did, then Roberts might once again break from the Court’s other four rightists, in favor of the continued survival of the Republic.</p>



<p>(2) Along with Steven Pinker, Scott Alexander, Sam Altman, Jonathan Haidt, Robert Solovay, and others who might be known to this blog’s readership, I decided after reflection to sign a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/petition-letter-stephen-hsu/home?authuser=0">petition</a> in support of Steve Hsu, a theoretical physicist turned genomics researcher, and the Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation at Michigan State University.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Information Processing: Hail to the Chief" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dVAprDWO_YI/UzGkunExlkI/AAAAAAAAEq4/MuApiqQsX_I/s1600/photo+(4).JPG"/>Hsu is the one on the right.</figure>



<p>Hsu now faces possible firing, because of a social media campaign apparently started by an MSU grad student and SneerClub poster named Kevin Bird.  What are the <a href="https://twitter.com/GradEmpUnion/status/1270829003130261504">charges</a>?  Hsu appeared in 2017 on an alt-right podcast (albeit, one that Noam Chomsky has also appeared on).  On Hsu’s own podcast, he <a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/episode-010-transcript/">interviewed Ron Unz</a>, who despite Jewish birth has become a <a href="https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/">nutcase Holocaust denier</a>—yet somehow that topic never came up on the podcast.  Hsu said that, as a scientist, he doesn’t know whether group differences in average IQ have a genetic component, but our commitment to anti-racism should never hinge on questions of biology (a view also espoused by Peter Singer, perhaps the leading liberal moral philosopher of our time).  Hsu has championed genomics research that, in addition to medical uses, <em>might someday</em> help enable embryo screening for traits like IQ.  Finally, Hsu supports the continued use of standardized tests in university admissions (yes, that’s one of the listed charges).</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong> for present purposes if you disagree with many of Hsu’s views. The question is more like: <em>is agreement with Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, and other mild-mannered, Obama-supporting thinkers featured in your local airport bookstore now a firing offense in academia?  And will those who affirm that it is, claim in the next breath to be oppressed, marginalized, the Rebel Alliance?</em></p>



<p>To be fair to the cancelers, I think they have two reasonable arguments in their favor.</p>



<p>The first that they’re “merely” asking for Hsu to step down as vice president, not for him to lose his tenured professorship in physics.  Only <em>professors</em>, say the activists, enjoy academic freedom; <em>administrators</em> need to uphold the values and public image of their university, as Larry Summers learned fifteen years ago.  (And besides, we might add, what intellectual iconoclast in their right mind would ever <em>become</em> a university VP, or want to stay one??)  I’d actually be fine with this if I had any confidence that it was going to end here.  But I don’t.  Given the now-enshrined standards—e.g., that professors hold positions of power, and that the powerful can oppress the powerless, or even do violence to them, just by expressing or entertaining thoughts outside an ever-shrinking range—why should Hsu trust any assurances that he’ll be left alone, if he <em>does</em> go back to being a physics professor?  If the SneerClubbers can cancel him, then how long until they cancel Pinker, or Haidt, or me?  (I <em>hope</em> the SneerClubbers enthusiastically embrace those ideas!  If they do, then no one ever again gets to call me paranoid about Red Guards behind every bush.)</p>



<p>The second reasonable argument is that, as far as I can tell, Hsu really did grant undeserved legitimacy to a Holocaust denier, via a friendly interview about other topics on his podcast.  I think it would help if, without ceding a word that he doesn’t believe, Hsu were now to denounce racism, Holocaust denial, and specifically Ron Unz’s flirtation with Holocaust denial in the strongest possible terms, and explain why he didn’t bring the topic up with his guest (e.g., did he not know Unz’s views?).</p></div>
