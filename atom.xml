<p>
John Roberts is the Chief Justice of the United States.</p>
<p>
Today I will discuss the recent Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rucho-v-common-cause-2/">decision</a> on gerrymandering.</p>
<p>
The 5-4 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause takes the courts out of deciding if redistricting was done fairly. Roberts, penning the majority argument, felt that it was hard, if not impossible, for courts to determine whether districts were reasonably drawn. That is, whether partisan motives dominated when they were created.</p>
<p>
I will explain what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> is, and how computational methods may play a role. I must add a takeaway: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The current view of computational methods to avoid gerrymandering may be based on incorrect assumptions.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>More on this later.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> How It Works </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
You probably know that gerrymandering is used, negatively, to describe creating voting districts that do not reflect the voters will. The term was coined as part of an attack on the then Governor of Massachusetts in 1812. The shape of one particularly contrived district looked like a salamander. Since his name was Elbridge Gerry, it became a <i>gerrymander</i>. He was a Democratic-Republican and was not re-elected. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/mathematics-of-gerrymandering/gerry/" rel="attachment wp-att-16071"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16071" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/gerry.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
Here is a figure from our friends at Wikipedia that presents examples of gerrymandering. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/mathematics-of-gerrymandering/divide/" rel="attachment wp-att-16072"><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-16072" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/divide.png?w=270" width="270"/></a></p>
<p>
By redistricting in the above, one can achieve anything from districts all won by the majority, to most won by the majority. These examples, show how the party who controls the districts can control the outcome.</p>
<p>
Well that is an overstatement. They can control the believed leanings of the voters in the districts. In the above example, they can control how yellow a district is. Real life is complicated by other factors: </p>
<ol>
<li>
A candidate may win because they are just more popular. That is a green candidate could still win in a yellow district. <p/>
</li><li>
A candidate may win because of random fluctuations. If the voter margin is small enough, random fluctuations could change the “expected” outcome.
</li></ol>
<p>
The latter is a danger for gerrymanderers. This <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/what-is-extreme-gerrymandering">site</a> on gerrymandering says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The trick is not to spread your voters out so much that districts become vulnerable to flipping to the other party in the normal give and take of electoral politics. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> How We Model It </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Since Roberts is not our intended audience we will use mathematical definitions. I am sure Roberts and the rest of the Supreme Court justices are smart, but we have our own methods. We do not use legal jargon such as “prima facie” and suspect they do not use math jargon like “prime” numbers.</p>
<p>
So let the yellow party have <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha}"/> fraction of the voters. Suppose the voters have to be divided into <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> districts of the same size. A division is just a vector <img alt="{y=(y_{1},\dots,y_{d})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%3D%28y_%7B1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cy_%7Bd%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y=(y_{1},\dots,y_{d})}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y_{1} + \cdots + y_{d} = 1, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y_%7B1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+y_%7Bd%7D+%3D+1%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  y_{1} + \cdots + y_{d} = 1, "/></p>
<p>and each <img alt="{y_{i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y_{i}}"/> is non-negative. For such a vector <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> the number that yellow <i>wins</i> is the number of indices <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y_{k} \ge \frac{1}{2d}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y_%7Bk%7D+%5Cge+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2d%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  y_{k} \ge \frac{1}{2d}. "/></p>
<p>Note, we assume that <img alt="{1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/2}"/> of the voters makes a district a win. We can change this to strictly larger than <img alt="{1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1/2}"/>, but will leave it for now.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 1</b> <em> Define <img alt="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha)}"/> to the maximum over all <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> of the number of wins; and define <img alt="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha)}"/> to be the minimum number of wins. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Note, we do not care who is doing the redistricting. Nor do we care about the geometry. For example 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(5, 0.60) = 5 \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(5, 0.60) = 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%285%2C+0.60%29+%3D+5+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%285%2C+0.60%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(5, 0.60) = 5 \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(5, 0.60) = 1. "/></p>
<p>What can we say about these functions? Here are some simple observations.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> If <img alt="{\alpha \ge 0.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%5Cge+0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha \ge 0.5}"/>, then <img alt="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d}"/>. Just place <img alt="{\alpha }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha }"/> fraction of the voters in each district.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> If <img alt="{\alpha &gt; 0.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha &gt; 0.5}"/>, then <img alt="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) \ge 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) \ge 1}"/>. No matter how the districts are drawn there must be at least one where yellow has a majority. </p>
<p>
An advantage of these functions is that now we can discuss growth rates, not just present examples. A strength of theory is that we have replaced statements like “this algorithm is fast” by formulas for their running time. Another advantage is that these functions are <i>independent of geometry</i>. Previously I thought the dominating issue was how regions looked. Now I believe the issue is how close one gets to the best and worst case: <img alt="{\rm MaxWin}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rm MaxWin}"/> and <img alt="{\rm MinWin}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\rm MinWin}"/>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{\alpha &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha &gt; 1/2}"/>. Then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-\lfloor 2(1-\alpha) d \rfloor " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d-%5Clfloor+2%281-%5Calpha%29+d+%5Crfloor+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-\lfloor 2(1-\alpha) d \rfloor "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Let <img alt="{\beta = 1-\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta+%3D+1-%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta = 1-\alpha}"/>. Let’s create the arrangement that makes green win as many districts as possible. If <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> regions are mostly green then that takes <img alt="{\frac{g}{2d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7B2d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{g}{2d}}"/> of the <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta}"/> green voters. This implies that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \frac{g}{2d} \le \beta. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cfrac%7Bg%7D%7B2d%7D+%5Cle+%5Cbeta.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \frac{g}{2d} \le \beta. "/></p>
<p>So it follows 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  g \le 2\beta d. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g+%5Cle+2%5Cbeta+d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  g \le 2\beta d. "/></p>
<p>This proves that <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> is equal to <img alt="{\lfloor 2\beta d \rfloor}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clfloor+2%5Cbeta+d+%5Crfloor%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\lfloor 2\beta d \rfloor}"/>. <img alt="\Box" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\Box"/></p>
<p>
It may help to set <img alt="{\alpha = 1/2 + \epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+1%2F2+%2B+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = 1/2 + \epsilon}"/> where <img alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}"/>. Let’s agree to ignore the rounding off and delete the floor and ceiling functions. Then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-2(1-\alpha) d " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d-2%281-%5Calpha%29+d+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = d-2(1-\alpha) d "/></p>
<p>and so 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 2\epsilon d. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+2%5Cepsilon+d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 2\epsilon d. "/></p>
<p>Thus for <img alt="{\epsilon = 1/10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3D+1%2F10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon = 1/10}"/> we get that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 0.2d. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%7B%5Crm+MaxWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+d+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%7B%5Crm+MinWin%7D%28d%2C+%5Calpha%29+%3D+0.2d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  {\rm MaxWin}(d, \alpha) = d \text{ and } {\rm MinWin}(d, \alpha) = 0.2d. "/></p>
<p>This says that independent of any geometry if yellow has a ten percent majority, then best case if they set the districts they could win all, and if green sets the districts the worst they can get is twenty percent of the districts.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> How Algorithms Can Help </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There is long-term and continuing interest in algorithms that automate redistricting. The hope is that automated systems will be able to create districts that are fair. A trouble with this research is that there is no universal notion of what makes districts fair. The mantra is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>A redistricting is fair if and only if the districts collectively satisfy some geometric criterion</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>An explicit statement of such a criterion, from a <a href="https://bdistricting.com/about.html">site</a> on such algorithms, is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The best district map is the one where people have the lowest average distance to the center of their district</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the name “gerrymandering” came from how districts looked. Somehow this enshrined the notion that districts must look right. I feel this could be wrong.</p>
<p>
Here is a quote from a recent <a href="http://district.cs.brown.edu">paper</a> on an algorithm for redistricting. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We propose a method for redistricting, decomposing a geographical area into subareas, called districts, so that the populations of the districts are as close as possible and the districts are compact and contiguous. Each district is the intersection of a polygon with the geographical area. The polygons are convex and the average number of sides per polygon is less than six. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors are Philip Klein and Neal Young, who are well known researchers on various aspects of algorithms. They do interesting work, their paper is interesting, but the assumption that geometry is the key I do not get.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> How To Do Better? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I think that we need to go beyond geometry to understand and avoid gerrymandering. The connection between geometry and fairness is driven—I believe—by tradition. Voters in the same district probably want to be near each other. In the past being near each other was probably important, since travel was so difficult. Perhaps today location is less of an issue then it was before cars, phones, cell phones, internet access, and email. Perhaps districts can be fair and yet do not look good. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
An analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_cake-cutting">cake cutting</a> may occur to you. Recall in the cake cutting problem success is <i>not</i> measured in how the pieces of the cake look. It is only measured by whether the parties cutting the cake are happy. Is there some way to push this analogy? I just came across a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08781.pdf">paper</a> using the cake cutting method: <i>A Partisan Districting Protocol With Provably Nonpartisan Outcomes</i> by Wesley Pegden, Ariel Procaccia, and Dingli Yu. More in the future.</p>
<p>
Can algorithmic methods help? Is geometry the fundamental issue? </p>

<p><strong>On the Complexity of Estimating the Effective Support Size</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/088/">ECCC</a>). In distribution testing, a classic problem is that of approximating the support size. By a (now) classic result of <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~valiant/papers/VV_stoc11.pdf">Valiant-Valiant</a>, the complexity of this problem is \(\Theta(n/\log n)\). This paper raises the question of approximating the “effective” support, and that too with more than just samples from the distribution. The \(\epsilon\)-support of discrete distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is the smallest support among any distribution \(\mathcal{D}’\) such that \(\|\mathcal{D} – \mathcal{D}’\|_1 \leq \epsilon\) (or TV-distance). Denote this as \(supp_\epsilon(\mathcal{D})\). One can also consider a bicriteria version. Given approximation parameter \(f\) and thresholds \(\epsilon_1 &lt; \epsilon_2\), we need to provide a number in the range \([supp_{\epsilon_2}(\mathcal{D}), f\cdot supp_{\epsilon_1}(\mathcal{D})]\). The primary model studied allows for random samples and evaluation queries (where one gets the probability of any known element of the domain). In this model, for arbitrary \(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2\), there is a continuum of algorithms, trading off query complexity with approximation. At one end, for \(f = O(\log n)\), the query complexity is \(\widetilde{O}(1/\epsilon_1)\). At the other end, for \(f=1\), the query complexity is \(O(\log^* n)\). (Here, \(n = supp_{\epsilon_1}(\mathcal{D})\).) There are lower bounds showing the necessity of evaluation queries for subpolynomial query complexities.</p>



<p><strong>Communication and Memory Efficient Testing of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, Daniel M. Kane, and Sankeerth Rao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04709">arXiv</a>). This paper adds additional computational constraints to the distribution testing problem. In the streaming setting, the algorithm is only allowed a single pass over the random samples. It has \(m\) bits of storage, much smaller than \(n\), the distribution size. The aim is to minimize the number of samples required for uniformity (and closeness) testing. For uniformity testing in the streaming setting, the paper gives an algorithm that uses \(\widetilde{O}(m + n/m)\) samples. The standard collision algorithm requires \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) storage (to store the samples), while this result gives a non-trivial bound for \(m \ll \sqrt{n}\). There are lower bounds showing that these bounds are basically tight. In the distributed distribution testing problem, there are a number of processors, each holding \(\ell\) samples. A referee asks a question to the processor, whose answers are broadcast to everyone. The aim is to minimize communication cost. For uniformity testing in this setting, there is a protocol using \(O(\sqrt{n\log n/\ell})\) bits of communication. As a sanity check, note that for \(\ell = \sqrt{n}\), one processor could simply run the collision algorithm locally to report the result. </p>



<p><strong>Querying a Matrix through Matrix-Vector Products</strong> by Xiaoming Sun, David P. Woodruff, Guang Yang, and Jialin Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05736.pdf">arXiv</a>). Consider \(n \times d\) matrix \(M\) over some field \(\mathbb{F}\). One gets access to this matrix through matrix-vector products, and wishes to test some matrix property. This is a natural model in many settings, and generalizes the classic setting of query access. A subtle point is that one can only right multiply with “query” vectors, and there are problems where left multiplication can change the complexity. (A nice example in the paper is testing if a square matrix is symmetric. With both left and right multiplications, this is easy, since we can directly access rows and columns. By only accessing columns, this is non-trivial.) This paper studies a number of problems, broadly classified as linear algebra problems, statistics problems, and graph problems. Some highlights are: testing symmetry can be done in \(O(1)\) queries, and the maximum eigenvalue can be approximated in \(O(\log n)\) queries adaptively (but there is an \(\Omega(n)\) non-adaptive lower bound). For graph problems, here’s an interesting discovery. If \(M\) is the adjacency matrix, connectivity requires \(\Omega(n/\log n)\) queries. But if \(M\) is the signed edge-vertex matrix, then this can be done in \(poly(\log n)\) queries. This paper provides a number of interesting directions and problems to study.</p>



<p><strong>The Adversarial Robustness of Sampling</strong> by Omri Ben-Eliezer and Eylon Yogev (arXiv). This isn’t a property testing paper, but how can one ignore a paper on understanding the power of sampling? It’s convenient to think of the following setting. An algorithm gets a stream of \(n\) numbers, and has to answer some questions about the stream (say, the median or other quantiles). The simplest strategy is to take a small random sample of the stream. But what if an adversary was generating the stream, depending on the current sample? Under what circumstances is the sample still “representative” of the stream? The specific results of this paper require getting into set systems and VC dimension, which I’ll leave for the sake of simplicity. Let’s go back to the median question. To get an approximate median, a constant number of samples suffice. A consequence of the main result is that if one takes \(O(\log n)\) samples, then this is robust to adversarial streams. On the other hand, lower bounds show that constant sized samples can be fooled by an adversary. The paper is a really interesting read, and is a nice take on “standard facts” that we take for granted.</p>

subdivision of a fixed graph $H$. We focus on $S_d$-graphs as a special case. A
graph $G$ is an $S_d$-graph when it is the intersection graph of connected
subgraphs of a subdivision of a fixed star $S_d$. It is useful to mention that,
for an $S_d$-graph $G$ with some proper maximal clique $C \in G$, each
connected component of $G-C$ is an interval graph and the partial order on the
connected components of $G-C$ has a chain cover of size $\leq d$. Considering
the recognition algorithm given by Chaplick et al., we give an FPT-time
algorithm to solve the isomorphism problem for $S_d$-graphs with bounded clique
size. Then, we give a polynomial time reduction to $S_d$-graph isomorphism from
the isomorphism problem for posets of width $d$. Finally, we show that the
graph isomorphism problem for $S_d$-graphs can be solved in FPT-time with
parameter $d$, even when the clique size is unbounded.

    <title>A hybrid algorithm framework for small quantum computers with application to finding Hamiltonian cycles</title>

certain SAT-solving algorithms even when the number of available qubits is
significantly smaller than the number of variables. Here we generalise this

utilise quantum computers significantly smaller than the problem size. Given an
arbitrarily small ratio of the quantum computer to the instance size, we
achieve polynomial speedups for classical divide-and-conquer algorithms,
provided that certain criteria on the time- and space-efficiency are met. We
demonstrate how this approach can be used to enhance Eppstein's algorithm for
the cubic Hamiltonian cycle problem, and achieve a polynomial speedup for any
ratio of the number of qubits to the size of the graph.

    <title>Geometric Crossing-Minimization -- A Scalable Randomized Approach</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1562112000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Radermacher:Marcel.html">Marcel Radermacher</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rutter:Ignaz.html">Ignaz Rutter</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01243">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the minimization of edge-crossings in geometric drawings of
graphs $G=(V, E)$, i.e., in drawings where each edge is depicted as a line
segment. The respective decision problem is NP-hard [Bienstock, '91]. In
contrast to theory and the topological setting, the geometric setting did not
receive a lot of attention in practice. Prior work [Radermacher et al.,
ALENEX'18] is limited to the crossing-minimization in geometric graphs with
less than $200$ edges. The described heuristics base on the primitive operation
of moving a single vertex $v$ to its crossing-minimal position, i.e., the
position in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that minimizes the number of crossings on edges
incident to $v$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a technique to speed-up the computation by a
factor of $20$. This is necessary but not sufficient to cope with graphs with a
few thousand edges. In order to handle larger graphs, we drop the condition
that each vertex $v$ has to be moved to its crossing-minimal position and
compute a position that is only optimal with respect to a small random subset
of the edges. In our theoretical contribution, we consider drawings that
contain for each edge $uv \in E$ and each position $p \in \mathbb{R}^2$ for $v$
$o(|E|)$ crossings. In this case, we prove that with a random subset of the
edges of size $\Theta(k \log k)$ the co-crossing number of a degree-$k$ vertex
$v$, i.e., the number of edge pairs $uv \in E, e \in E$ that do not cross, can
be approximated by an arbitrary but fixed factor $\delta$ with high
probability. In our experimental evaluation, we show that the randomized
approach reduces the number of crossings in graphs with up to $13\,000$ edges
considerably. The evaluation suggests that depending on the degree-distribution
different strategies result in the fewest number of crossings.

follows. Every subfamily $S'\subset S$ defines a hyperedge of $H$ if and only
if there exists a halfspace $h$ that fully contains $S'$, and no other set of
$S$ is fully contained in $h$. In this case, we say that $h$ realizes $S'$. We
say a set $S$ is shattered, if all its subsets are realized. The VC-dimension
of a hypergraph $H$ is the size of the largest shattered set. We show that the
VC-dimension for \emph{pairwise disjoint} convex sets in the plane is bounded
by $3$, and this is tight. In contrast, we show the VC-dimension of convex sets
in the plane (not necessarily disjoint) is unbounded. We also show that the
VC-dimension is unbounded for pairwise disjoint convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$,
for $d\geq 3$. We focus on, possibly intersecting, segments in the plane and
determine that the VC-dimension is always at most $5$. And this is tight, as we
construct a set of five segments that can be shattered. We give two exemplary
applications. One for a geometric set cover problem and one for a range-query

    <title>A Constant-Factor Approximation Algorithm for Vertex Guarding a WV-Polygon</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Stav Ashur, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/f/Filtser:Omrit.html">Omrit Filtser</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Katz:Matthew_J=.html">Matthew J. Katz</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01228">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The problem of vertex guarding a simple polygon was first studied by Subir K.
Ghosh (1987), who presented a polynomial-time $O(\log n)$-approximation
algorithm for placing as few guards as possible at vertices of a simple $n$-gon
$P$, such that every point in $P$ is visible to at least one of the guards.
Ghosh also conjectured that this problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm
with constant approximation ratio. Due to the centrality of guarding problems
in the field of computational geometry, much effort has been invested
throughout the years in trying to resolve this conjecture. Despite some
progress (surveyed below), the conjecture remains unresolved to date. In this
paper, we confirm the conjecture for the important case of weakly visible
polygons, by presenting a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
guarding such a polygon using vertex guards. A simple polygon $P$ is weakly
visible if it has an edge $e$, such that every point in $P$ is visible from
some point on $e$. We also present a $(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for guarding a weakly visible polygon $P$, where guards may be placed anywhere
on $P$'s boundary (except in the interior of the edge $e$). Finally, we present
a $3c$-approximation algorithm for vertex guarding a polygon $P$ that is weakly
visible from a chord, given a subset $G$ of $P$'s vertices that guards $P$'s
boundary whose size is bounded by $c$ times the size of a minimum such subset.
</p>
<p>Our algorithms are based on an in-depth analysis of the geometric properties
of the regions that remain unguarded after placing guards at the vertices to
guard the polygon's boundary. It is plausible that our results will enable
Bhattacharya et al. to complete their grand attempt to prove the original
conjecture, as their approach is based on partitioning the underlying simple
polygon into a hierarchy of weakly visible polygons.

to model biological evolution, but the performance of local search algorithms
on different kinds of fitness landscapes is poorly understood. Here we
introduce a natural approach to modelling fitness landscapes using valued
constraints. This allows us to investigate minimal representations (normal
forms) and to consider the effects of the structure of the constraint graph on
the tractability of local search. First, we show that for fitness landscapes
representable by binary Boolean valued constraints there is a minimal necessary
constraint graph that can be easily computed. Second, we consider landscapes as
equivalent if they allow the same (improving) local search moves; we show that
a minimal normal form still exists, but is NP-hard to compute. Next we consider
the complexity of local search on fitness landscapes modelled by valued
constraints with restricted forms of constraint graph. In the binary Boolean
case, we prove that a tree-structured constraint graph gives a tight quadratic
bound on the number of improving moves made by any local search; hence, any
landscape that can be represented by such a model will be tractable for local
search. We build two families of examples to show that both the conditions in
our tractability result are essential. With domain size three, even just a path
of binary constraints can model a landscape with an exponentially long sequence
of improving moves. With a treewidth two constraint graph, even with a maximum
degree of three, binary Boolean constraints can model a landscape with an
exponentially long sequence of improving moves.

to be deleted from the input tables in order to make the query false. A
solution to this problem immediately translates into a solution for the more
widely known problem of deletion propagation with source-side effects. In this
paper, we give several novel results on the hardness of the resilience problem
for $\textit{binary conjunctive queries with self-joins}$ (i.e. conjunctive
queries with relations of maximal arity 2) with one repeated relation. Unlike
in the self-join free case, the concept of triad is not enough to fully
characterize the complexity of resilience. We identify new structural
properties, namely chains, confluences and permutations, which lead to various
$NP$-hardness results. We also give novel involved reductions to network flow
to show certain cases are in $P$. Overall, we give a dichotomy result for the
restricted setting when one relation is repeated at most 2 times, and we cover
many of the cases for 3. Although restricted, our results provide important
insights into the problem of self-joins that we hope can help solve the general
case of all conjunctive queries with self-joins in the future.

satisfy kinematics- and physics-based requirements. We present a classification
of constraints and solvers to enable postponing optimization as far down the
design workflow as possible. The solvers are organized into two broad classes
of design space 'pruning' and 'exploration' by considering the types of
constraints they can satisfy. We show that pointwise constraints define
feasible design subspaces that can be represented and computed as first-class
entities by their maximal feasible elements. The design space is pruned upfront
by intersecting maximal elements, without premature optimization. To solve for
other constraints, we apply topology optimization (TO), starting from the
pruned feasible space. The optimization is steered by a topological sensitivity
field (TSF) that measures the global changes in violation of constraints with
respect to local topological punctures. The TSF for global objective functions
is augmented with TSF for global constraints, and penalized/filtered to
incorporate local constraints, including set constraints converted to
differentiable (in)equality constraints. We demonstrate application of the
proposed workflow to nontrivial examples in design and manufacturing. Among
other examples, we show how to explore pruned design spaces via TO to
simultaneously satisfy physics-based constraints (e.g., minimize compliance and
mass) as well as kinematics-based constraints (e.g., maximize accessibility for
machining).

    <title>The Polynomial Complexity of Vector Addition Systems with States</title>

science and have been used in a variety of areas. In this paper, we consider
vector addition systems with states over a parameterized initial configuration.
For these systems, we are interested in the standard notion of computational
complexity, i.e., we want to understand the length of the longest trace for a
fixed vector addition system with states depending on the size of the initial
configuration. We show that the asymptotic complexity of a given vector
addition system with states is either $\Theta(N^k)$ for some computable integer
$k$, where $N$ is the size of the initial configuration, or at least
exponential. We further show that $k$ can be computed in polynomial time in the
size of the considered vector addition system. Finally, we show that $1 \le k
\le 2^n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the considered vector addition system.

    <title>On Slicing Sorted Integer Sequences</title>

large-scale retrieval systems such as Web search engines. Efficient query
resolution, e.g., intersection or random access, is achieved by carefully
partitioning the sequences. In this work we describe and compare two different
partitioning paradigms: partitioning by cardinality and partitioning by
universe. Although the ideas behind such paradigms have been known in the
coding and algorithmic community since many years, inverted index compression
has extensively adopted the former paradigm, whereas the latter has received
only little attention. As a result, an experimental comparison between these
two is missing for the setting of inverted index compression. We also propose
and implement a solution that recursively slices the universe of representation
of a sequence to achieve compact storage and attain to fast query execution.
Albeit larger than some state-of-the-art representations, this slicing approach
substantially improves the performance of list intersections and unions while
operating in compressed space, thus offering an excellent space/time trade-off
for the problem.

extensions of an argumentation framework. This task is equivalent to
enumerating all maximal semikernels of a directed graph. For directed graphs on
$n$ vertices, all preferred extensions can be enumerated in $O^*(3^{n/3})$ time
and there are directed graphs with $\Omega(3^{n/3})$ preferred extensions. We
give faster enumeration algorithms for directed graphs with at most
$0.8004\cdot n$ vertices occurring in $2$-cycles. In particular, for oriented
graphs (digraphs with no 2-cycles) one of our algorithms runs in time
$O(1.2321^n)$, and we show that there are oriented graphs with $\Omega(3^{n/6})
&gt; \Omega(1.2009^n)$ preferred extensions.
</p>
<p>A combination of three algorithms leads to the fastest enumeration times for
various proportions of the number of vertices in $2$-cycles. The most
innovative one is a new 2-stage sampling algorithm, combined with a new
parameterized enumeration algorithm, analyzed with a combination of the recent
monotone local search technique (STOC 2016) and an extension thereof (ICALP
2017).

$\mathcal O(M^3)$, where $M$ is the number of electrons. Various methods have
been proposed to address this issue and obtain linear scaling $\mathcal O(M)$.
One promising formulation is the direct minimization of energy. Such methods
take advantage of physical localization of the solution, namely that the
solution can be sought in terms of non-orthogonal orbitals with local support.
In this work a numerically efficient implementation of sparse parallel vectors
within the open-source finite element library deal.II is proposed. The main
algorithmic ingredient is the matrix-free evaluation of the Hamiltonian
operator by cell-wise quadrature. Based on an a-priori chosen support for each
vector we develop algorithms and data structures to perform (i) matrix-free
sparse matrix multivector products (SpMM), (ii) the projection of an operator
onto a sparse sub-space (inner products), and (iii) post-multiplication of a
sparse multivector with a square matrix. The node-level performance is analyzed
using a roofline model. Our matrix-free implementation of finite element
operators with sparse multivectors achieves the performance of 157 GFlop/s on
Intel Cascade Lake architecture. Strong and weak scaling results are reported
for a typical benchmark problem using quadratic and quartic finite element
bases.

butterflies and birds) and in man-made objects (from paintings and sculptures,
to manufactured objects and architectural design). Rotational, translational,
and especially reflectional symmetries, are also important in drawings of
graphs. Detecting and classifying symmetries can be very useful in algorithms
that aim to create symmetric graph drawings and in this paper we present a
machine learning approach for these tasks. Specifically, we show that deep
neural networks can be used to detect reflectional symmetries with 92%
accuracy. We also build a multi-class classifier to distinguish between
reflectional horizontal, reflectional vertical, rotational, and translational
symmetries. Finally, we make available a collection of images of graph drawings
with specific symmetric features that can be used in machine learning systems
for training, testing and validation purposes. Our datasets, best trained ML

<br/>
Huang, an assistant professor in the math department at Emory, settled an open question about the hypercube. The hypercube is a graph on N=2<sup>n</sup> vertices where each vertex corresponds to an n-bit string and their are edges between vertices corresponding to strings that differ in a single bit. Think of the set of the strings of odd parity, N/2 vertices with no edges between them. Add any other vertex and it would have n neighbors. Huang showed that no matter how you placed those N/2+1 vertices in the hypercube, some vertex will have at least n<sup>1/2</sup> neighbors. By an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0097-3165(92)90060-8">old result</a> of Gotsman and Linial, Huang's theorem implies the sensitivity conjecture.<br/>

    <title>Sensitivity conjecture proved!</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>In a recent breakthrough, <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/">Hao Huang</a> gave a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00847">6 page paper</a> proving the longstanding sensitivity conjecture. (Hat tip, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229">Scott Aaronson</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/07/02/amazing-hao-huang-proved-the-sensitivity-conjecture/">Gil Kalai</a>. See this <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/27714/sensitivity-block-sensitivity-conjecture-implications">stackexchange post</a> and <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2016/062/">this paper of Avishai</a> for some links to the literature on this.)</p>
<p>The proof is beautiful and simple. I will write a few words here, but it is probably easier for you to just read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00847">paper</a>. The sensitivity conjecture <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316592900608">was known</a> to follow from the following statement: let <img alt="G_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_n"/> be the <em>Boolean Cube</em> which is the degree <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> graph on <img alt="N=2^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%3D2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N=2^n"/> vertices identified with <img alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\{0,1\}^n"/> such that for every <img alt="x,y\in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x,y\in \{0,1\}^n"/>, <img alt="x \sim y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Csim+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="x \sim y"/> if their Hamming distance is one. Then, the maximum degree of every subgraph <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/> of <img alt="G_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_n"/> of size <img alt="&gt;N/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%3EN%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="&gt;N/2"/> is at least <img alt="\sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt{n}"/>.</p>
<p>Hao proves the above statement by showing that there is a <em>signing</em> of the <img alt="N\times N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ctimes+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N\times N"/> adjacency matrix of <img alt="G_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_n"/> that turns it into a matrix with <img alt="N/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N/2"/> eigenvalues equaling <img alt="+\sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="+\sqrt{n}"/> and <img alt="N/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N/2"/> eigenvalues equaling <img alt="-\sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="-\sqrt{n}"/>. That is, he shows (using a simple but clever inductive argument, see the 5 line proof of his Lemma 2.2) that there is an <img alt="N\times N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ctimes+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N\times N"/> matrix <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> with entries in <img alt="\{ 0, \pm 1 \}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B+0%2C+%5Cpm+1+%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\{ 0, \pm 1 \}"/> whose nonzero entries correspond to the edges of the Boolean cube, and such that all the <img alt="N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N"/> eigenvalues of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> are <img alt="\pm \sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\pm \sqrt{n}"/> and they sum up to zero. (Note that this makes sense since <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> should have the same <em>Frobenius norm</em> as  the adjacency matrix of <img alt="G_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_n"/>. The Frobenius norm squared is both the sum of squares of entries, which is <img alt="N\cdot n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N\cdot n"/> for <img alt="G_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_n"/> which is a degree <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> graph, and also equal to the sum of squares of the eigenvalues, which is <img alt="N\cdot n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N\cdot n"/> if all eigenvalues are <img alt="\pm \sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\pm \sqrt{n}"/>.)</p>
<p>Once you have such a signing, the result follows from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_theorem#Cauchy_interlacing_theorem">Cauchy’s Interlace Theorem</a> that says that for every <img alt="N\times N" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%5Ctimes+N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N\times N"/> matrix <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and any <img alt="M\times M" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%5Ctimes+M&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="M\times M"/> matrix <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="B"/> that is a principle sub-matrix of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/>,</p>
<p><img alt="\lambda_{1+N-M}(A) \leq \lambda_1(B) \leq \lambda_1(A)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_%7B1%2BN-M%7D%28A%29+%5Cleq+%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%5Cleq+%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_{1+N-M}(A) \leq \lambda_1(B) \leq \lambda_1(A)"/></p>
<p>where <img alt="\lambda_1(A) \geq \lambda_2(A) \cdots \geq \lambda_N(A)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28A%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_2%28A%29+%5Ccdots+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_N%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(A) \geq \lambda_2(A) \cdots \geq \lambda_N(A)"/> are the eigenvalues of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="\lambda_1(B)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(B)"/> is the maximum eigenvalue of <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="B"/>. A corollary of this (which is the only fact we need) is that if <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> has its top eigenvalue <img alt="\lambda_1(A)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(A)"/> with multiplicity <img alt="K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="K"/> (i.e., <img alt="\lambda_1(A)=\lambda_K(A)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28A%29%3D%5Clambda_K%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(A)=\lambda_K(A)"/>), then every principle sub-matrix <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="B"/> of order larger than <img alt="N-K" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N-K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N-K"/> will satisfy <img alt="\lambda_1(B) = \lambda_1(A)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%3D+%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(B) = \lambda_1(A)"/>. (In fact, we only need <img alt="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_1(A)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_1%28A%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_1(A)"/>.)</p>
<p>Indeed, suppose that <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/> is a subgraph of the Boolean cube of size <img alt="M&gt;N/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3EN%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="M&gt;N/2"/>. Then the principle submatrix <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="B"/> of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> corresponding to the vertices of <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/> satisfies <img alt="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_{1+N-M}(A) = \sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clambda_1%28B%29+%5Cgeq+%5Clambda_%7B1%2BN-M%7D%28A%29+%3D+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\lambda_1(B) \geq \lambda_{1+N-M}(A) = \sqrt{n}"/> (since <img alt="M&gt;N/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=M%3EN%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="M&gt;N/2"/> and the first <img alt="N/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="N/2"/> eigenvalues of <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="A"/> are <img alt="+\sqrt{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="+\sqrt{n}"/>).
But it’s easy to show that for every matrix <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="B"/> the maximum eigenvalue of <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="B"/> is upper bounded by the maximum <img alt="\ell_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ell_1"/> norm of its rows, which in our case is the maximum degree of the graph <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/>.</p>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">The Sensitivity Conjecture, which I blogged about here, says that, for every Boolean function f:{0,1}n→{0,1}, the sensitivity of f—that is, the maximum, over all 2n input strings x∈{0,1}n, of the number of input bits such that flipping them changes the value of f—is at most polynomially smaller than a bunch of other complexity measures of […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Sensitivity Conjecture, which I blogged about <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=453">here</a>, says that, for every Boolean function f:{0,1}<sup>n</sup>→{0,1}, the <em>sensitivity</em> of f—that is, the maximum, over all 2<sup>n</sup> input strings x∈{0,1}<sup>n</sup>, of the number of input bits such that flipping them changes the value of f—is at most polynomially smaller than a bunch of other complexity measures of f, including f’s block sensitivity, degree as a real polynomial, and classical and quantum query complexities.  (For more, see for example <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rocco/Teaching/S12/Readings/BdW.pdf">this survey</a> by Buhrman and de Wolf.  Or for quick definitions of the relevant concepts, <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19902/boolean-functions-where-sensitivity-equals-block-sensitivity">see here</a>.)</p>



<p>Ever since it was posed by Nisan and Szegedy in 1989, this conjecture has stood as one of the most frustrating and embarrassing open problems in all of combinatorics and theoretical computer science.  It seemed so easy, and so similar to other statements that had 5-line proofs.  But a lot of the best people in the field sank months into trying to prove it.  For whatever it’s worth, I also sank … well, at least weeks into it.</p>



<p>Now <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/">Hao Huang</a>, a mathematician at Emory University, has posted a <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf">6-page preprint</a> on his homepage that finally proves the Sensitivity Conjecture, in the form s(f)≥√deg(f).  (I thank Ryan O’Donnell for tipping me off to this.)  Within the preprint, the proof itself is about a page and a half.</p>



<p>Whenever there’s an announcement like this, ~99% of the time either the proof is wrong, or at any rate it’s way too complicated for outsiders to evaluate it quickly.  This is one of the remaining 1% of cases.  I’m rather confident that the proof is right.  Why?  Because I read and understood it.  It took me about half an hour.  If you’re comfortable with concepts like <em>induced subgraph</em> and <em>eigenvalue</em>, you can do the same.</p>



<p>From pioneering work by Gotsman and Linial in 1992, it was known that to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture, it suffices to prove the following even simpler combinatorial conjecture:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Let S be any subset of the n-dimensional Boolean hypercube, {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, which has size 2<sup>n-1</sup>+1.  Then there must be a point in S with at least ~n<sup>c</sup> neighbors in S.</p></blockquote>



<p>Here c&gt;0 is some constant (say 1/2), and two points in S are “neighbors” if and only they differ in a single coordinate.  Note that if S had size 2<sup>n-1</sup>, then the above statement would be false—as witnessed, for example, by the set of all n-bit strings with an even number of 1’s.</p>



<p>Huang proceeds by proving the Gotsman-Linial Conjecture.  And the way he proves Gotsman-Linial is … well, at this point maybe I should just let you <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf">read the damn preprint</a> yourself.  I can’t say it more simply than he does.</p>



<p>If I had to try anyway, I’d say: Huang constructs a 2<sup>n</sup>×2<sup>n</sup> matrix, called A<sub>n</sub>, that has 0’s where there are no edges between the corresponding vertices of the Boolean hypercube, and either 1’s or -1’s where there <em>are</em> edges—with a simple, weird pattern of 1’s and -1’s that magically makes everything work.  He then lets H be an induced subgraph of the Boolean hypercube of size 2<sup>n-1</sup>+1.  He lower-bounds the maximum degree of H by the largest eigenvalue of the corresponding (2<sup>n-1</sup>+1)×(2<sup>n-1</sup>+1) submatrix of A<sub>n</sub>.  Finally, he lower-bounds that largest eigenvalue by … no, I don’t want to spoil it!  Read it yourself!</p>



<p>Paul Erdös famously spoke of a book, maintained by God, in which was written the simplest, most beautiful proof of each theorem.  The highest compliment Erdös could give a proof was that it “came straight from the book.”  In this case, I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.</p>



<p>Indeed, the question is: how could such an elementary 1.5-page argument have been overlooked for 30 years?  I don’t have a compelling answer to that, besides noting that “short” and “elementary” often have little to do with “obvious.”  Once you start looking at the spectral properties of this matrix A<sub>n</sub>, the pieces snap together in precisely the right way—but how would you know to look at that?</p>



<p>By coincidence, earlier today I finished reading my first PG Wodehouse novel (<em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10554/10554-h/10554-h.htm">Right Ho, Jeeves!</a></em>), on the gushing recommendation of a friend.  I don’t know how I’d missed Wodehouse for 38 years.  His defining talent is his ability to tie together five or six plot threads in a way that feels perfect and inevitable even though you didn’t see it coming.  This produces a form of pleasure that’s nearly indistinguishable from the pleasure one feels in reading a “proof from the book.”  So my pleasure centers are pretty overloaded today—but in such depressing times for the world, I’ll take pleasure wherever I can get it.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to Hao!</p>



<p><strong>Added thought:</strong> What this really is, is one of the purest illustrations I’ve seen in my career of the power and glory of the P≠NP phenomenon.  We talk all the time about how proofs are easier to verify than to find.  In practice, though, it can be far from obvious that that’s true.  Consider your typical STOC/FOCS paper: writing it probably took the authors several months, while fully understanding the thing from scratch would probably take … <em>also</em> several months!  If there’s a gap, it’s only by a factor of 4 or 5 or something.  Whereas in this case, I don’t know how long Huang spent searching for the proof, but the combined search efforts of the community add up to years or decades.  The ratio of the difficulty of finding to the difficulty of completely grasping is in the hundreds of thousands or millions.</p>



<p><strong>Another added thought:</strong> Because Hao actually proves a stronger statement than the original Sensitivity Conjecture, it has additional implications, a few of which Hao mentions in his preprint.  Here’s one he didn’t mention: any randomized algorithm to guess the parity of an n-bit string, which succeeds with probability at least 2/3 on the majority of strings, must make at least ~√n queries to the string, while any such quantum algorithm must make at least ~n<sup>1/4</sup> queries.  For more, see the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.0036.pdf">Weak Parity</a> by me, Ambainis, Balodis, and Bavarian (Section 6).</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>In this paper, we show that every <img alt="2^{n-1}+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="2^{n-1}+1"/>-vertex induced subgraph of the <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-dimensional cube graph has maximum degree at least <img alt="\sqrt n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sqrt n"/>. This result is best possible, and improves a logarithmic lower bound shown by Chung, Füredi, Graham and Seymour in 1988. As a direct consequence, we prove that the sensitivity and degree of a boolean function are polynomially related, solving an outstanding foundational problem in theoretical computer science, the Sensitivity Conjecture of Nisan and Szegedy.</p>
<p>The proof relies on important relation between the two problems  by Gotsman and Linial. It uses beautifully Cauchy’s interlace theorem (for eigenvalues).</p>
<p>Thanks to Noga Alon for telling me about the breakthrough. For more on the conjecture and a polymath project devoted to solve it see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=453">this post</a> on Aaronson’s Shtetl Optimized (SO).  Updates: See also <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/05/congratulations-noam/">this post on GLL</a>, and this <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229">new lovely post on SO;</a> and <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/07/02/sensitivity-conjecture-proved/">this post by Boaz Barak </a>on WOT (Window on Theory), explains the main ingredient of Huang’s proof. Here is <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/local-kid-makes-history.html">a post by Lance Fortnow</a> on CC (Computational Complexity) mentioning a <a href="https://twitter.com/BooleanAnalysis/status/1145837576487612416">remarkable tweet</a> by Ryan O’Donnell (see below the fold).</p>

Sabine consulted with me by phone before doing the video and post, and despite what some might see as her negative stance, I agree with what she has to say substantially more than I disagree.</p>



<p>I do, however, have a few quibbles:</p>



<p> 1. We don’t know that millions of physical qubits will be needed for useful simulations of quantum chemistry.  It all depends on how much error correction is needed and how good the error-correcting codes and simulation algorithms become.  Like, sure, you can generate pessimistic forecasts by plugging numbers in to the best known codes and algorithms.  But “the best known” is a rapidly moving target—one where there have already been orders-of-magnitude improvements in the last decade.</p>



<p>2. To my mind, there’s a big conceptual difference between a single molecule that you can’t efficiently simulate classically, and a programmable computer that you can’t efficiently simulate classically.  The difference, in short, is that only for the computer, and not for the molecule, would it ever make sense to say it had given you a <strong>wrong</strong> answer!  In other words, a physical system becomes a “computer” when, and only when, you have sufficient understanding of, and control over, its state space and time evolution that you can ask the system to simulate something <em>other than itself</em>, and then judge whether it succeeded or failed at that goal.</p>



<p>3. The entire point of my recent work, on certified randomness generation (see for example <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/certrand2.ppt">here</a> or <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-to-turn-a-quantum-computer-into-the-ultimate-randomness-generator-20190619/">here</a>), is that sampling random bits with a NISQ-era device <em>could</em> have a practical application.  That application is … I hope you’re sitting down for this … sampling random bits!  And then, more importantly and nontrivially, <strong>proving</strong> to a faraway skeptic that the bits really were randomly generated.</p>



<p>4. While I was involved in some of the first proposals for NISQ quantum supremacy experiments (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling">BosonSampling</a>), I certainly can’t take sole credit for the idea of quantum supremacy!  The term, incidentally, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5813">was coined by John Preskill</a>.</p>



<p>5. The term “NISQ” (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) was also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862">coined by John Preskill</a>.  He had no intention of misleading investors—he just needed a term to discuss the quantum computers that will plausibly be available in the near future.  As readers of this blog know, there certainly <em>has</em> been some misleading of investors (and journalists, and the public…) about the applications of near-term QCs.  But I don’t think you can lay it at the feet of the term “NISQ.”</p></div>

    <title>A proof that 22/7 - pi &gt; 0 and more</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
My father was a High School English teacher who did not know much math. As I was going off to college, intending to major in math, he gave me the following sage advice:<br/>
<br/>
1) <i>Take Physics as well as Math since Physics and Math go well together.</i> This was good advice. I took the first year of Physics for Physics Majors, and I later took a senior course in Mechanics since that was my favorite part of the first year course. Kudos to Dad!<br/>
<br/>
2) π <i>is exactly </i>22/7. I knew this was not true, but I also keow that I had no easy way to show him this. In fact, I wonder if I could have proven it myself back then.<br/>
<br/>
I had not thought about this in many years when I came across the following:<br/>
<br/>
Problem A-1 on the 1968 Putnam exam:<br/>
<br/>
Prove 22/7 - π = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>1</sup> (x<sup>4</sup>(1-x)<sup>4</sup>)/(1+ x<sup>2</sup> )dx<br/>
<br/>
(I can easily do his by partial fractions and remembering that ∫ 1/(1+x^2) dx = tan<sup>-1</sup>x  which is tan inverse, not 1/tan. See <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pi.pdf">here</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
(ADDED LATER---I have added conjectures on getting integrals of the form above except with 4 replaced by any natural number. Be the first on your block to solve my conjectures! It has to be easier than the Sensitivity Conjecture!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let n &amp;in N which we will choose later. By looking at the circle that is inscribed in a regular n-polygon (n even) one finds that <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
n tan(π/n) &gt;  π <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we seek an even  value of n such that<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
n tan(π/n) &lt; 22/7<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using Wolfram alpha the smallest such n is 92.<br/>
<br/>
Would that convince Dad? Would he understand it? Probably not. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Some misc points.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1)  While working on this post I originally wanted to find tan(π/2<sup>7</sup>) by using the half-angle formula many times, and get an exact answer in terms of radicals,  rather than using Wolfram Alpha. <br/>
<br/>
a) While I have lots of combinatorics books, theory of comp books, and more Ramsey Theory books than one person should own in my house, I didn't have a SINGLE book with any trig in it.<br/>
<br/>
b) I easily found it on the web: <br/>
<br/>
tan(x/2) = sqrt( (1-cos x)/(1+cos x) ) = sin x/(1+cos x) = (1-cos x)/(sin x).<br/>
<br/>
None of these seems like it would get me a nice expression for tan(π/2<sup>7</sup>). But I don't know. Is there a nice expression for tan(π/2<sup>k</sup>) ? If you know of one then leave a polite comment.<br/>
<br/>
2) I assumed that there was a more clever and faster way to do the integral. I could not find old Putnam exams and their solutions  the web (I'm sure they are there someplace! --- if you know then comment politely with a pointer). So I got a book out of the library <i>The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition Problems and Solutions 1965--1984</i> by Alexanderson, Klosinski, and Larson. Here is the clever solution:<br/>
<br/>
<i>The standard approach from Elementary Calculus applies.<br/>
<br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
Not as clever as I as hoping for.<br/>
<br/>
3) I also looked at the integral with 4 replaced by 1,2,3,4,...,16. The results are in the writeup I pointed to before. It looks like I can use this sequence to get  upper and lower bound on i, ln(2), pi+2ln(2), and pi-2ln(2). I have not proven any of this. But take a look! And as noted above I have conjectures!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) When I looked up INSCRIBING a circle in a regular n-polygon, Google kept giving me CIRCUMSCRIBING. Why? I do not know but I can speculate. Archimedes had a very nice way of using circumscribed circles to approximate pi. Its on youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rJdkhlWZVQ">here</a>.  Hence people are used to using circumscribed rather than inscribed circles.<br/>

<p>
Michael Griffin, Ken Ono, Larry Rolen, and Don Zagier (GORZ) have recently published a paper on an old approach to the famous Riemann Hypothesis (RH).</p>
<p>
Today we will discuss their work and its connection to P=NP.</p>
<p>
Their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07321.pdf">paper</a> is titled, “Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function and other sequences.” The final <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1902572116">version</a> is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</p>
<p>
The RH is still open. We are not aware of any update on the status of Michael Atiyah’s claim to have solved it since this <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/blogonmathblogs/2018/10/01/on-michael-atiyah-and-the-riemann-hypothesis/">note</a> on an AMS blog and our own <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/26/reading-into-atiyahs-proof/">discussion</a> of his papers’ contents.</p>
<p>
Recall the RH is a central conjecture in number theory, and it has the following properties: </p>
<ul>
<li>
If true, it would greatly enhance our understanding of the structure of the primes: <img alt="{2,3,5,7,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2C3%2C5%2C7%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2,3,5,7,\dots}"/> <p/>
</li><li>
It has resisted attacks for 160 years and counting. <p/>
</li><li>
There are an immense number of statements equivalent to the RH.
</li></ul>
<p>See, for example, the survey <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.66.3584&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a>, “The Riemann Hypothesis,” by Brian Conrey. </p>
<p>
Complexity theory has the P=NP question; number theory has the RH. Both seem to be beyond reach, and both are fundamental questions. The recent work of GORZ has created buzz among number theorists—perhaps they are on the verge of a breakthrough? Is there hope that we might see progress on P=NP? Or must we wait 160 years? </p>
<p>
The buzz is reflected in a May 28 <a href="https://www.livescience.com/65577-riemann-hypothesis-big-step-math.html">story</a> in the online journal <i>LiveScience</i>. It quotes Enrico Bombieri, who wrote the official Clay Prize <a href="https://www.claymath.org/sites/default/files/official_problem_description.pdf">description</a> of RH, as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Although this remains far away from proving the Riemann hypothesis, it is a big step forward. There is no doubt that this paper will inspire further fundamental work in other areas of number theory as well as in mathematical physics.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Bombieri wrote an accompanying <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/22/1906804116">paper</a> in PNAS, in which the above quoted sentences also appear. We will try to explain what the excitement is about.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Approach and Results </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
RH is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function. Note: A real, polynomial <img alt="{p(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p(x)}"/> is <i>hyperbolic</i> if all its roots are real—a fancy name for a simple concept.</p>
<p>
There is an analytic function <img alt="{E(z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E(z)}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  RH \iff E(z) \text{ has all real roots}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++RH+%5Ciff+E%28z%29+%5Ctext%7B+has+all+real+roots%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  RH \iff E(z) \text{ has all real roots}. "/></p>
<p>Almost a hundred years ago, Johan Jensen and George Pólya created an approach to the RH based on <img alt="{E(z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E(z)}"/>. Rather than prove <img alt="{E(z)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E(z)}"/> has only real roots, they showed it is enough to show that a family of polynomials <img alt="{J(n, d)(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%28n%2C+d%29%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{J(n, d)(x)}"/> all are hyperbolic. The point is that polynomials are “simpler” than analytic functions—at least that is the hope.</p>
<p>
What GORZ prove is this: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> For each <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> and almost all <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, the polynomial <img alt="{J(n, d)(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%28n%2C+d%29%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{J(n, d)(x)}"/> is hyperbolic. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, “almost all” means that there at most a finite number of polynomials that are not hyperbolic. They also show that for degree <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d}"/> fixed, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} J(n, d)(x) = H_{d}(x). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clim_%7Bn+%5Crightarrow+%5Cinfty%7D+J%28n%2C+d%29%28x%29+%3D+H_%7Bd%7D%28x%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} J(n, d)(x) = H_{d}(x). "/></p>
<p>Where the polynomials <img alt="{H_{d}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH_%7Bd%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H_{d}(x)}"/> have only real roots.</p>
<p>
This is explained further in a <a href="http://people.oregonstate.edu/~petschec/ONTD/Talk1.pdf">talk</a> by Ono, which has this table showing how the polynomials converge:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/a-prime-breakthrough/hyper/" rel="attachment wp-att-16049"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16049" height="187" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/hyper.png?w=300&amp;h=187" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>Note: they use different notation for the polynomials.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Approximation Property </h2><p/>
<p>There are many equivalent formulations of the RH.  While all are equivalent, some are more equivalent than others.  Some seem to be a more plausible path toward a resolution of the RH. Of course to date none have worked. </p>
<p>There is a way to distinguish equivalent formulations of the RH. Suppose that <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S"/> depends on some parameter <img alt="\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta"/>. Suppose that as <img alt="\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta"/> increases the statement <img alt="S(\beta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S(\beta)"/> becomes a weaker version of the RH.<br/>
Then let us informally say that the formulation <img alt="S(\beta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S(\beta)"/> has the “Approximation Property” (AP). The point is that progress in proving caes of <img alt="S(\beta)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%28%5Cbeta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S(\beta)"/>—even as partial progress—is exciting. But if the equivalence only holds for <img alt="\beta=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta=0"/>, with no connections for higher <img alt="\beta" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\beta"/>, then the partial progress could be seen as morally useful—but it is not really mathematically useful.</p>
<p>There are equivalences of the RH that have AP and some that seem not to have it. The approximation for the RH is natural. The RH states that there is no zero <img alt="\sigma + it" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%2B+it&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sigma + it"/> of the Riemann zeta function with <img alt="\sigma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sigma"/> above <img alt="1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="1/2"/>. The weaker statement: If <img alt="\sigma + it" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%2B+it&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sigma + it"/> is a zero, then <img alt="\sigma &gt;  \alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma+%3E++%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\sigma &gt;  \alpha"/> is unknown for any <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha"/> in the open interval <img alt="(1/2,1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2F2%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(1/2,1)"/>. This can be used to get a property with the AP.</p>
<p>For example, this 2003 <a href="http://\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0307215}">paper</a> by Luis Baez-Duarte, titled “A new necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis,” has the AP. He notes, in our terminology, that his property is an AP.</p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Does the approach of GORZ have the AP? The issue is that while we get a universal statement in terms of <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/>, the “all but finitely many” condition on <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> works against its being an approximation—what if the finite sets of exceptions grow in terms of <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/> in ways that offset the purpose behind the equivalence?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long period of non blogging. There are a lot of things to report and  various other plans for posts and I hope to come back to it soon. But it is nice to break the silence with another sensational result by Annika Heckel. I first heard about it some time ago and Noam Lifshitz just informed be that the<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11808"> paper is on the arXive</a>!</p>
<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11808">Non-concentration of the chromatic number of a random graph</a></h2>
<p>And here is the <strong>abstract:</strong> We show that the chromatic number of $latex <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-3"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">G(</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-5"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-6"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-7">n</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-8">,</span><span class="mfrac" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-10">1/</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-11">2)$</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is not concentrated on fewer than <img alt="n^{1/4-\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2F4-%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1/4-\epsilon}"/>  consecutive values. This addresses a longstanding question raised by Erdős and several other authors.</p>
<p>The Introduction tells the history of the problem very nicely.</p></div>

I'm heading home from the <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/">2019 ACM Federated Computing Research Conference</a> in Phoenix, a collection of computer science meetings including <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/">STOC</a>, <a href="http://learningtheory.org/colt2019/">COLT</a> and <a href="http://www.sigecom.org/ec19/">EC</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun gave their Turing award lectures, their co-winner Yoshua Bengio not in attendance. Hinton talked about how machine learning triumphed over symbolic AI. LeCun argued that under uncertainty, one should learn the distribution instead of just the average. If you want more, just <a href="https://fcrc.acm.org/turing-lecture-at-fcrc-2019">watch it yourself</a>.<br/>
<div style="text-align: left;">

<div style="text-align: left;">
To get to the STOC lectures you go up and down escalators and pass through ISCA (Computer Architecture) and PLDI (Programming Languages). It's like you are going up the computing stack until you reach algorithms and complexity. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br/>
The conference center was just two blocks from Chase Field so we could take in a Diamondbacks baseball game. They opened the roof because the temperature dropped into the double digits. Last night, Paul McCartney played at an arena just a block from the conference center, but instead I hung out at an Uber reception for the EC conference.<br/>

<div style="text-align: left;">
Let me mention a best paper awardee, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3313276.3316369">The Reachability Problem for Petri Nets is Not Elementary</a> by Wojciech Czerwinski, Slawomir Lasota, Ranko Lazic, Jerome Leroux and Filip Mazowiecki. In a Petri net you have a list of vectors of integers and an initial and final vector. You start with the initial vector and can add any of the other vectors nondeterministically as often as you like as long as no coordinate goes negative. Can you get to the final vector? This problem was known to be computable in "Ackermannian" time and EXPSPACE-hard. This paper shows the problem is not elementary, i.e. not solvable in running time a tower of 2's to the n. A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08575">recent result</a> shows Petri Nets reachability is primitive recursive for fixed dimensions.<br/>

Avi Wigderson gave the Knuth Prize lecture exploring deep connections between mathematics and algorithms. Hopefully the video will be online soon.<br/>

    <title>TR19-090 |  Quasilinear time list-decodable codes for space bounded channels | 

	Ronen Shaltiel, 

	Swastik Kopparty, 

	Jad Silbak</title>
    <summary>We consider codes for space bounded channels. This is a model for communication under noise that was studied by Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) and lies between the Shannon (random) and Hamming (adversarial) models. In this model, a channel is a space bounded procedure that reads the codeword in one pass, and modifies at most a $p$ fraction of the bits of the codeword.

Guruswami and Smith, and later work by Shaltiel and Silbak (RANDOM 2016), gave constructions of list-decodable codes with rate approaching $1-H(p)$ against channels with space $s=c \log n$, with encoding/decoding time $\poly(2^s)=\poly(n^c)$.

In this paper we show that for every constant $0 \le p 0$, there are codes with rate $R \ge 1-H(p)-\epsilon$, list size $\poly(1/\epsilon)$, and furthermore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our codes can handle channels with space $s=n^{\Omega(1)}$, which is much larger than $O(\log n)$ achieved by previous work.
\item We give encoding and decoding algorithms that run in time $n \cdot \polylog(n)$. Previous work achieved large and unspecified $\poly(n)$ time (even for space $s=1 \cdot \log n$ channels).
\item We can handle space bounded channels that read the codeword in any order, whereas previous work considered channels that read the codeword in the standard order.
\end{itemize}
Our construction builds on the machinery of Guruswami and Smith (with some key modifications) replacing some nonconstructive codes and pseudorandom objects (that are found in exponential time by brute force) with efficient explicit constructions.
For this purpose we exploit recent results of Haramaty, Lee and Viola (SICOMP 2018) on pseudorandom properties of ``$t$-wise independence + low weight noise'' which we quantitatively improve using techniques by Forbes and Kelly (FOCS 2018).

To make use of such distributions, we give new explicit constructions of binary linear codes that have dual distance of $n^{\Omega(1)}$, and are also polynomial time list-decodable from relative distance $\half-\epsilon$, with list size $\poly(1/\epsilon)$. To the best of our knowledge, no such construction was previously known.

Somewhat surprisingly, we show that Reed-Solomon codes with dimension $k&lt;\sqrt{n}$, have this property if interpreted as binary codes (in some specific interpretation) which we term: ``Raw Reed-Solomon Codes''. A key idea is viewing Reed-Solomon codes as ``bundles'' of certain dual-BCH codewords.</summary>

If you stick your circuit of size <img alt="s(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="s(n)"/> and depth <img alt="O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="O(1)"/> at each node, the depth of the overall circuit would be obviously <img alt="O(\log _{f}n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clog+_%7Bf%7Dn%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="O(\log _{f}n)"/> and the overall size would be dominated by the input layer which is <img alt="s(f)\cdot n/f&lt;s(f)\cdot n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28f%29%5Ccdot+n%2Ff%3Cs%28f%29%5Ccdot+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="s(f)\cdot n/f&lt;s(f)\cdot n"/>. If you are aiming for overall depth <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/>, you need <img alt="f=n^{O(1/d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3Dn%5E%7BO%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f=n^{O(1/d)}"/>. This gives size <img alt="n^{1+O(1/d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2BO%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+O(1/d)}"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Hence we have shown that proving bounds <img alt="n^{1+\omega (1/d)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Comega+%281%2Fd%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\omega (1/d)}"/> for some depth <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/> suffices to prove <img alt="n^{10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{10}"/> lower bounds for depth <img alt="10" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="10"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>Chen and Tell.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The above is not the most efficient way to build a tree! I am writing this post following their paper to understand what they do. As they say, the idea is quite simple. While above the size will be dominated by the input layer, we want to balance things so that every layer has roughly the same contribution. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Let’s say we are aiming for size <img alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\epsilon }"/> and let’s see what depth we can get. Let’s say now the size is <img alt="s(n)=n^{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=s%28n%29%3Dn%5E%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="s(n)=n^{k}"/>. Let us denote by <img alt="n_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}"/> the number of nodes at level <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/> with <img alt="i=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i=0"/> being the root. The fan-in at level <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i"/> is <img alt="(n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D%2Fn_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}"/> so that the cost is <img alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\epsilon }"/> as desired. We have the recursion <img alt="n_{i+1}=n_{i}\cdot (n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%2B1%7D%3Dn_%7Bi%7D%5Ccdot+%28n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D%2Fn_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B1%2Fk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i+1}=n_{i}\cdot (n^{1+\epsilon }/n_{i})^{1/k}"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The solution to this recursion is <img alt="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-(1-1/k)^{i})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D%3Dn%5E%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon+%29%281-%281-1%2Fk%29%5E%7Bi%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-(1-1/k)^{i})}"/>, see below. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   So that’s it. We need to get to <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> nodes. So if you set <img alt="i=O(k\log (1/\epsilon ))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%3DO%28k%5Clog+%281%2F%5Cepsilon+%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="i=O(k\log (1/\epsilon ))"/> you get say <img alt="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-\epsilon ^{2})}&gt;n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D%3Dn%5E%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon+%29%281-%5Cepsilon+%5E%7B2%7D%29%7D%3En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}=n^{(1+\epsilon )(1-\epsilon ^{2})}&gt;n"/>. Going back to <img alt="k=10" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3D10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="k=10"/>, we have exhibited circuits of size <img alt="n^{1+\epsilon }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{1+\epsilon }"/> and depth just <img alt="O(\log 1/\epsilon )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Clog+1%2F%5Cepsilon+%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="O(\log 1/\epsilon )"/>. So proving stronger bounds than this would rule out circuits of size <img alt="n^{10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{10}"/> and depth <img alt="10" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="10"/>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>Added later: About the recurrence</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Letting <img alt="a_{i}:=\log _{n}n_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_%7Bi%7D%3A%3D%5Clog+_%7Bn%7Dn_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a_{i}:=\log _{n}n_{i}"/> we have the following recurrence for the exponents of <img alt="n_{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_{i}"/>. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">   <b>My two cents.</b>. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   I am not sure I need more evidence that making progress on long-standing bounds in complexity theory is hard, but I do find it interesting to prove these links; we have quite a few by now! The fact that we have been stuck forever just short of proving “the whole thing” makes me think that these long-sought bounds may in fact be false. Would love to be proved wrong, but it’s 2019, this connection is proved by balancing a tree better, and you feel confident that P <img alt="\ne " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cne+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ne "/> NP?    </p>

<p>On the Importance of Disciplinary Pride for Multidisciplinary Collaboration</p>
<p>I am a big fan of collaborations, even if they <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2014/07/01/collaboration-competition-and-competition-within-collaboration/">come with their own challenges</a>. I always got further and enjoyed research much more because of my collaborators. I’m forever indebted to so many colleagues and dear, dear friends. Each and every one of them was better than me in some ways. To contribute, I had to remember my own strengths and bring them to the table. The premise of this post is that the same holds for collaboration between fields. It should be read as a call for theoreticians to bring the tools and the powerful way of thinking of TOC into collaborations. We shouldn’t be blind to the limitation of our field but obsessing on those limitations is misguided and would only limit our impact. Instead we should bring our best and trust on the other disciplines we collaborate with to do the same (allowing each to complement and compensate for the other).</p>
<p>The context in which these thoughts came to my mind is Algorithmic Fairness. In this and other areas on the interface between society and computing, true <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/11/01/simons-cluster-on-algorithmic-fairness/">collaboration is vital</a>. Not surprisingly, attending multidisciplinary programs on Algorithm Fairness, is a major part of my professional activities these days. And I love it – I get to learn so much from people and disciplines that have been thinking about fairness for many decades and centuries. In addition, the Humanities are simply splendid. Multidisciplinary collaborations come with even more challenges than other collaborations: the language, tools and perspectives are different. But for exactly the same reasons they can be even more rewarding. Nevertheless, my fear and the reason for this post is that my less experienced TOC colleagues might come out from those interdisciplinary meetings frustrated and might lose confidence in what TOC can contribute. It feels to me that <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/PDF/toc-sp2.pdf">old lessons</a> about the value of TOC need to be learned again. There is a lot to be proud of, and holding to this pride would in fact make us better collaborators not worse.</p>
<p>In the context of Algorithmic Fairness, we should definitely acknowledge (as we often do) that science exists within political structures, that algorithms are not objective and that mathematical definitions cannot replace social norms as expressed by policy makers. But let’s not take these as excuses for inaction and let’s not withdraw to the role of spectators. In this era of algorithms, other disciplines need us just as much as we need them .</p>

    <link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/are-you-smarter-than-5th-grade-amoeba.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Are you smarter than a 5th grade amoeba?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(title of this blog is due to Henry Baker who posted an article about this elsewhere)<br/>
<br/>
Amoeba finds approx solution to TSP in linear time:<a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-12-amoeba-approximate-solutions-np-hard-problem.html">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years we have seen models of computation that claim to solve NPC or other hard problems quickly. I ask non-rhetorically and with and open mind how they have panned out.<br/>
<br/>
In no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
1) Parallelism. For solving problems faster YES. For speeding up how to solve NPC problems I think YES. For making P=NP somehow NO.  Even so, parallel computers have been a definite practical success.<br/>
<br/>
2) Quantum Computing. Will they factor large numbers anytime soon? Ever? Should we view the effort to build them as an awesome and insightful Physics experiment? Are there any problems that they are NOW doing faster? Is Quantum Crypto (I know, not the same thing) actually used? Will other things of interest come out of the study of quantum computing? It already has, see <a href="https://theoryofcomputing.org/articles/gs002/gs002.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
3) DNA computing. Did that lead to practical solutions to NPC problems? I do not think it did. Did that lead to interesting math? Interesting biology? Interesting science?  I do not know.<br/>
<br/>
4) Autistic  computing for finding primes: see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/09/possibly-recruits-for-polymath-primes.html">here</a>. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist ,claimed that two autistic twin brothers could generate large primes quickly. This story was never put to a rigorous test and may not be quite right.<br/>
<br/>
5) Amoeba computing: Too early to tell. The article seems to say it succeeded on 8 cities<br/>
<br/>
The problem with all of these non-standard models of computing is SCALE.  And the more powerful classic computers get, the harder it is for these nonstandard models to compete.<br/>
<br/>
Are these models interesting even if they don't end up getting us fast algorithms? They can be:<br/>
<br/>
1) Do they lead to mathematics of interest? (Quantum- Yes, Parallelism- Yes)<br/>
<br/>
2) Did they inspire algorithms for classical computers? (Quantum- Yes)<br/>
<br/>
3) Do they give insight into other fields? (Quantum for Physics yes, DNA-computing for bio-??)<br/>
<br/>
4) Have they ACTUALLY sped up  up computations in meaningful ways for problems we care about (Parallelism  has)<br/>
<br/>
If  you know of any result which I missed<br/>
<br/>
 (e.g.,<br/>
<br/>
 Amoeba-computing giving insight into evolution,<br/>
<br/>
Autistic computing being used by the NSA to find primes,<br/>
<br/>
 DNA computing  leading to interesting mathematics)<br/>
<br/>
 then leave polite comments!<br/>

<p>
Lucy Lu Wang is the lead author of a paper released this Friday on gender parity in computer science. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.07883.pdf">paper</a> is from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. The authors are Wang, Gabriel Stanovsky, Luca Weihs, and Oren Etzioni.  We will call them WSWE for short. </p>
<p>
Today we will discuss some of the issues this study raises.</p>
<p>
The paper was highlighted by the New York Times in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/technology/gender-gap-tech-computer-science.html">article</a> titled, “The Gender Gap in Computer Science Research Won’t Close for 100 Years.”  The news article begins with an equally sobering statement of this conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>Women will not reach parity with men in writing published computer science research in this century if current trends hold, according to a study released on Friday. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We are for gender-neutral opportunities and have always promoted this—see our earlier discussions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/10/29/absolute-firsts/">here</a>. We are for doing a better job in supporting women in computer science. The study by WSWE is an important paper that helps frame the problem. Quoting them:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The field has made more of an effort to reach a more balanced gender status. But the data seems to show that even with all the progress, we are still not making the change fast enough. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I suggest that you might wish to read the paper. Unfortunately there are many papers with similar conclusions—see <a href="https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1301">this</a> by Natalie Schluter, for example. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Main Points </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some points of the paper by WSWE:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>There is a measurable gap</i>. No one would, I believe, doubt this. But it is important to see that it is measurable. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The gap is shrinking, but slowly</i>. Again this seems correct, but whether it is shrinking in all relevant measures of publication weight is still an issue.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>The predictions</i>. Perhaps it will not be closed for over a century. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Modern technology allows such a study</i>. This is one aspect that we can all applaud. WSWE used automated tools that allowed this study to search millions of papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Issues </h2><p/>
<p>
WSWE filtered a corpus of <b>2.87 million</b> papers tagged as in computer science.  The volume constrained their approaches to handling several basic issues.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> How to tell the gender of an author?  They use first names and try to detect gender from that alone. This is not easy.  Not only can differently-gendered names in different nations or language groups have the same Romanized form, many names apply to both genders within those groups.  The names Taylor and Kelley are perfect examples pf the latter. </p>
<p>
WSWE used a statistical weighing method. So “Taylor,” for example, would be weighted as 55 percent female, 45 percent male.  The weightings come from a large database called <i>Gender API</i> compiled from government and social agencies not directly related to computer science. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> Another issue concerns the prediction part of their paper. They attempt to extrapolate and guess when there will be parity between female and male authorship. </p>
<p>
As all predictions this is not easy. It is my main complaint with this and other papers on the gender-gap issue. They predict that parity will not be reached until 2167, in 168 years. An earlier <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/640548/gender-parity-computer-science-could-take-280-years/">study</a> puts the parity point at 280 years away.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I believe that a major issue is hiring by computer science departments and other institutions. A major CS department just hired <img alt="{N&gt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N&gt;1}"/> assistant professors, of which <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> were male. This is a problem. </p>
<p>
Should studies on the gender gap count all papers? Perhaps they should weight the papers by some citation indices. Are women writing more impactful papers? What percent of papers by gender have citations rate above X?—you get the idea. </p>
<p>
Finally I wonder if parity is the right goal? <b>How about aiming for more women papers than men</b>? Why not?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Spring semester is over, yay! To celebrate summer, I’ve compiled lecture notes from the graduate course COS 598D, a.k.a. “<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/optimization4machinelearning/home">optimization for machine learning</a>“.</p>
<p>The course is an aftermath of a few lectures and summer school tutorials given in various locations, in which  lectures goal of the course was to present the most useful methods and ideas in a rigorous-but-not-tedious way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suitable for a mathematically-prepared undergraduate student, and/or researcher beginning their endeavor into machine learning.</li>
<li>Focus on the important: we start with stochastic gradient descent for training deep neural networks.</li>
<li>Bring out the main ideas: i.e. projection-free methods, second-order optimization, the three main acceleration techniques, qualitatively discuss the advantages and applicability of each.</li>
<li>*short* proofs, that everyone can follow and extend in their future research. I prefer being off by a constant/log factor from the best known bound with a more insightful proof.</li>
<li>Not loose track of the goal: generalization/regret, rather than final accuracy. This means we talked about online learning, generalization and precision issues in ML.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent version can be downloaded here:<br/>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO" title="OPTtutorial">OPTtutorial</a></p>
<p>This is still work in progress, please feel free to send me typos/corrections, as well as other topics you’d like to see (on my todos already: lower bounds, quasi-convexity, and the homotopy method).</p>
<p>Note: zero-order/bandit optimization is an obvious topic that’s not address. The reason is purely subjective – it appears as a chapter in <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/">this textbook</a> (that also started as lecture notes!).</p>
