Emil Faber is the pretend founder of the pretend Faber College. The 1978 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_House">Animal House</a> starts with a close-up of Faber’s statue, which has the inscription, <b>Knowledge Is Good</b>.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we might talk about knowledge, science, mathematics, proofs, and more.</p>
<p>
The phrase on Faber’s pedestal is meant to be a joke, as is the subtitle we added saying the same about science. But there is some truth to both of them. From the cause of climate change to the best response to the current pandemic to sports predictions there is much interest in science. Science is good, indeed.</p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Science </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What is science and what are methods of creating knowledge via science? There is a whole world on the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>. The central questions are: What is science? What methods are used to create new science? Is science good?—just kidding. </p>
<p>
We are not experts on the philosophy of science. But there seem to be three main ways to create scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Experiments:</i> This is the classic one. Think about the testing of a candidate vaccine to stop the pandemic. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Computational Experiments:</i> This is relatively new. Think computer simulations of how climate change is effected by the methods of creating energy—for example. wind vs. coal. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Mathematical Proofs:</i> This is the one we focus on here at GLL. Think proofs that some algorithm works or that there is no algorithm that can work unless… </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Mathematical Proofs </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are interested in creating knowledge via proving new theorems. This is how we try to create knowledge. Our science is based not on experiments and not on simulations but mostly on the theorem-proof method. Well not exactly. We do use experiments and simulations. For example, the field of quantum algorithms uses both of these.</p>
<p>
However, math proofs are the basis of complexity theory. This means that we need to create proofs and then check that they are correct. The difficulty of checking a proof is based on who created them: </p>
<ul>
<li>
You did—checking your own work. <p/>
</li><li>
Someone else did—refereeing for a journal. <p/>
</li><li>
Someone in your class did—grading exams. <p/>
</li><li>
Some graduate student did—mentoring. <p/>
</li><li>
Someone on the web who claims a major result like <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> did—debugging. <p/>
</li><li>
And so on.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> My Favorite Checking Method </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My favorite tool for checking is this trick: Suppose that we have a proof <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/> that demonstrates <img alt="{A \implies X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A \implies X}"/> is true. Sometimes it is possible to show that there is a proof <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Q}"/> that proves <img alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A \implies Y}"/> where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The proof <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Q}"/> is based on changing the claimed proof <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
The proof <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Q}"/> demonstrates <img alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A \implies Y}"/>, and; <p/>
</li><li>
The statement <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/> does not follow from <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
One way this commonly arises is when <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/> as a proof did not use all of the assumptions in <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A}"/>. Thus <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{P}"/> really proves more that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{X}"/> and it proves <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/>. But we note that <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{Y}"/> is not a consequence of <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{A}"/>.</p>
<p>
For example, consider the Riemann hypothesis. Suppose that we claim that we have a proof that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%5Cneq+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 "/></p>
<p>follows from the usual axioms of math plus <img alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}"/>. Sounds great. But suppose this is based on an argument that assumes that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 "/></p>
<p>and manipulates the summation, eventually yielding a contradiction, without using the condition <img alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}"/>. This is a problem, since there are <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{s}"/> with <img alt="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3D+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\Re(s) = 1/2}"/> so that the sum is zero. This is an example of the above method of checking. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A New Checking Method </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
From time to time claims are made of resolutions to famous conjectures. Think <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. These claims have all been wrong to date. So most researchers are reluctant to take time to check any new claims. Why would you take the effort to try and find the bug that is likely there? </p>
<p>
I wonder if there could be a method that is based on competition. For concreteness, suppose Alice and Bob are two researchers who both claim a resolution to the <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> problem. Alice has a lower bound argument that <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> and Bob has an upper bound that <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. Could we have them play a “game”? </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Give their papers to each other. Have them try to find a flaw in each other’s paper. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
They are highly motivated. Could we argue that if they cannot find any flaw then we would be slightly more motivated to look at the papers? </p>
<p>
This might work even if they both claim <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>. Ken and I, personally, have had more claims of <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/> brought to our attention. Even in this case they would be highly motivated: the awards, the prizes, the praise will go to the one who is correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Possible Extensions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One difference in our situation from classic empirical science is the nature of gaps in knowledge. For example, one of the big current controversies in physics is over the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>. The Wikipedia article we just linked seems to date mostly to years around 2012 when dark matter was more widely accepted than <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/doubting-dark-matter-f3e400c7dcd7">strikes</a> us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-dark-matter-real/">today</a> (see also <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/dark-matter-nightmare-what-if-we-just.html">this</a> and <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/are-dark-energy-and-dark-matter.html">this</a>). There are cases where two competing theories are incompatible yet the available data do not suffice to find a fault in either. </p>
<p>
Whereas, with claimed proofs of incompatible statements, such as <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}"/> and <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>, at least one must have a demonstrable error. The statements themselves may have barriers all the way up to undecidability, but that does not matter to judging the proffered proofs.</p>
<p>
The method may be more applicable in life sciences where the gap is gathering sufficient field or lab observations. For a topical example, consider claims about the risk or safety of human gatherings amid the pandemic. One extreme is represented by the extraordinary <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13670.pdf">claim</a>, which is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-do-crowds-contribute-to-covid-its-complicated/">evidently</a> quite <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/09/14/sturgis-bike-rally-paper-impact-on-covid-19-coronavirus-cases/">excessive</a>, that the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August led to over 250,000 Covid-19 cases. The other extreme would be analyses used to justify gatherings with minimal precautions. The extremes cannot coexist. The means to arbitrate between them are available in principle but require costly social effort for contact tracing and testing as well as resolving mathematical issues between epidemiological models.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What do you think of our new checking method? Should it be more widely employed for evaluating claims and hypotheses?</p>

satisfies the submodularity conditions with an additive error. Approximate
submodularity arises in many settings, especially in machine learning, where
the function evaluation might not be exact. In this paper we study how close
such approximately submodular functions are to truly submodular functions.
</p>
<p>We show that an approximately submodular function defined on a ground set of
$n$ elements is $O(n^2)$ pointwise-close to a submodular function. This result
also provides an algorithmic tool that can be used to adapt existing submodular
optimization algorithms to approximately submodular functions. To complement,
we show an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound on the distance to submodularity.
</p>
<p>These results stand in contrast to the case of approximate modularity, where
the distance to modularity is a constant, and approximate convexity, where the
distance to convexity is logarithmic.

    <title>On Euclidean Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-Spanners</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1602028800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bhore:Sujoy.html">Sujoy Bhore</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/T=oacute=th:Csaba_D=.html">Csaba D. Tóth</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02908">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Lightness and sparsity are two natural parameters for Euclidean
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners. Classical results show that, when the dimension $d\in
\mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$ are constant, every set $S$ of $n$ points in
$d$-space admits an $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners with $O(n)$ edges and weight
proportional to that of the Euclidean MST of $S$. Tight bounds on the
dependence on $\epsilon&gt;0$ for constant $d\in \mathbb{N}$ have been established
only recently. Le and Solomon (FOCS 2019) showed that Steiner points can
substantially improve the lightness and sparsity of a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner.
They gave upper bounds of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d+1)/2})$ for the minimum
lightness in dimensions $d\geq 3$, and $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-(d-1))/2})$ for
the minimum sparsity in $d$-space for all $d\geq 1$. They obtained lower bounds
only in the plane ($d=2$). Le and Solomon (ESA 2020) also constructed Steiner
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners of lightness $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log\Delta)$ in the plane,
where $\Delta\in \Omega(\log n)$ is the \emph{spread} of $S$, defined as the
ratio between the maximum and minimum distance between a pair of points.

<p>In this work, we improve several bounds on the lightness and sparsity of
Euclidean Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners. Using a new geometric analysis, we
establish lower bounds of $\Omega(\epsilon^{-d/2})$ for the lightness and
$\Omega(\epsilon^{-(d-1)/2})$ for the sparsity of such spanners in Euclidean
$d$-space for all $d\geq 2$. We use the geometric insight from our lower bound
analysis to construct Steiner $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners of lightness
$O(\epsilon^{-1}\log n)$ for $n$ points in Euclidean plane.

(GNNs), we propose the first method that exploits vector flows over graphs to
develop globally consistent directional and asymmetric aggregation functions.
We show that our directional graph networks (DGNs) generalize convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) when applied on a grid. Whereas recent theoretical works
focus on understanding local neighbourhoods, local structures and local
isomorphism with no global information flow, our novel theoretical framework
allows directional convolutional kernels in any graph. First, by defining a
vector field in the graph, we develop a method of applying directional
derivatives and smoothing by projecting node-specific messages into the field.
Then we propose the use of the Laplacian eigenvectors as such vector field, and
we show that the method generalizes CNNs on an n-dimensional grid. Finally, we
bring the power of CNN data augmentation to graphs by providing a means of
doing reflection, rotation and distortion on the underlying directional field.
We evaluate our method on different standard benchmarks and see a relative
error reduction of 8% on the CIFAR10 graph dataset and 11% to 32% on the
molecular ZINC dataset. An important outcome of this work is that it enables to
translate any physical or biological problems with intrinsic directional axes
into a graph network formalism with an embedded directional field.

$\mathbb{F}_2^n$. The goal is to recover the individual subspaces, given
samples from a (weighted) mixture of samples drawn uniformly from the two
subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$.
</p>
<p>This problem is computationally challenging, as it captures the notorious
problem of "learning parities with noise" in the degenerate setting when $A_1
\subseteq A_0$. This is in contrast to the analogous problem over the reals
that can be solved in polynomial time (Vidal'03). This leads to the following
natural question: is Learning Parities with Noise the only computational
barrier in obtaining efficient algorithms for learning mixtures of subspaces
over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$?
</p>
<p>The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above question.
Namely, we show the following results: 1. When the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$
are incomparable, i.e., $A_0$ and $A_1$ are not contained inside each other,
then there is a polynomial time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$. 2. In the case when $A_1$ is a subspace of $A_0$ with a significant gap
in the dimension i.e., $dim(A_1) \le \alpha dim(A_1)$ for $\alpha&lt;1$, there is
a $n^{O(1/(1-\alpha))}$ time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$.
</p>
<p>Thus, our algorithms imply computational tractability of the problem of
learning mixtures of two subspaces, except in the degenerate setting captured
by learning parities with noise.

    <title>Efficiently Approximating Vertex Cover on Scale-Free Networks with Underlying Hyperbolic Geometry</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bl=auml=sius:Thomas.html">Thomas Bläsius</a>, Tobias Friedrich, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Katzmann:Maximilian.html">Maximilian Katzmann</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02787">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Finding a minimum vertex cover in a network is a fundamental NP-complete
graph problem. One way to deal with its computational hardness, is to trade the
qualitative performance of an algorithm (allowing non-optimal outputs) for an
improved running time. For the vertex cover problem, there is a gap between
theory and practice when it comes to understanding this tradeoff. On the one
hand, it is known that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum vertex cover
within a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. On the other hand, a simple greedy algorithm
yields close to optimal approximations in practice.
</p>
<p>A promising approach towards understanding this discrepancy is to recognize
the differences between theoretical worst-case instances and real-world
networks. Following this direction, we close the gap between theory and
practice by providing an algorithm that efficiently computes close to optimal
vertex cover approximations on hyperbolic random graphs; a network model that
closely resembles real-world networks in terms of degree distribution,
clustering, and the small-world property. More precisely, our algorithm
computes a $(1 + o(1))$-approximation, asymptotically almost surely, and has a
running time of $\mathcal{O}(m \log(n))$.
</p>
<p>The proposed algorithm is an adaption of the successful greedy approach,
enhanced with a procedure that improves on parts of the graph where greedy is
not optimal. This makes it possible to introduce a parameter that can be used
to tune the tradeoff between approximation performance and running time. Our
empirical evaluation on real-world networks shows that this allows for
improving over the near-optimal results of the greedy approach.

InstaHide, a simple encryption of training images, which can be plugged into

<p>InstaHide encrypts each training image with a "one-time secret key" which

security. (b) Experimental results to show effectiveness in preserving privacy
against known attacks with only minor effects on accuracy. (c) Theoretical
analysis showing that successfully attacking privacy requires attackers to

insecure to some some efficient attacks. (e) Release of a challenge dataset

been a growing interest in neural architectures that are invariant or
equivariant to all three shape-preserving transformations of point clouds:
translation, rotation, and permutation.

<p>In this paper, we present a first study of the approximation power of these
architectures. We first derive two sufficient conditions for an equivariant
architecture to have the universal approximation property, based on a novel

devising two other novel universal architectures.

    <title>A Parallel Batch-Dynamic Data Structure for the Closest Pair Problem</title>

data structure for the closest pair problem. Our solution is based on a serial
dynamic closest pair data structure by Golin et al. [SIAM J.\ on Computing,
1998], and supports batches of insertions and deletions in parallel. For a data
set of size $n$, our data structure supports a batch of insertions or deletions
of size $m$ in $O(m\log (1+(n+m)/m))$ expected work and $O(\log
(n+m)\log^*(n+m))$ depth with high probability, and takes linear space. The key
techniques for achieving these bounds are a new work-efficient parallel
batch-dynamic binary heap, and careful management of the computation across
multiple points to minimize work and depth.
</p>
<p>We provide an optimized multicore implementation of our data structure using
dynamic hash tables, parallel heaps, and dynamic $k$-d trees. Our experiments
on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets show that it achieves a
parallel speedup of up to 38.57x (15.10x on average) on 48 cores with
hyper-threading. In addition, we also implement and compare four parallel
algorithms for static closest pair problem, for which no practical
implementations exist in the literature. On 48 cores with hyper-threading, the
algorithms achieve up to 51.45x (29.42x on average) speedup, and Rabin's
algorithm performs the best on average. Comparing our dynamic algorithm to the
fastest static algorithm, we find that it is advantageous to use the dynamic
algorithm for batch sizes of up to 70\% of the data set. As far as we know, our
work is the first to experimentally evaluate parallel algorithms for the
closest pair problem, in both the static and the dynamic settings.

    <title>How to send a real number using a single bit (and some shared randomness)</title>

number $x\in[0,1]$ using a single bit. A sender that knows $x$ chooses a value
$X\in\set{0,1}$ to transmit. In turn, a receiver estimates $x$ based on the
value of $X$. We consider both the biased and unbiased estimation problems and
aim to minimize the cost. For the biased case, the cost is the worst-case (over
the choice of $x$) expected squared error, which coincides with the variance if
the algorithm is required to be unbiased.
</p>
<p>We first overview common biased and unbiased estimation approaches and prove
their optimality when no shared randomness is allowed. We then show how a small
amount of shared randomness, which can be as low as a single bit, reduces the
cost in both cases. Specifically, we derive lower bounds on the cost attainable
by any algorithm with unrestricted use of shared randomness and propose
near-optimal solutions that use a small number of shared random bits. Finally,
we discuss open problems and future directions.

our algorithm makes $O(n^{7/4})$ queries in the matrix model and
$O(n^{3/4}m^{1/2})$ queries in the list model. Our approach combines Gabow's
classical maximum matching algorithm [Gabow, Fundamenta Informaticae, '17] with
the guessing tree method of Beigi and Taghavi [Beigi and Taghavi, Quantum,

<p>At that time, still the early days of online convex optimization, we were contemplating everything from adaptive gradient methods to bandit convex optimization. Blackwell’s famed approachability theorem was looming in the background, considered to be one of the strongest theorems in the ML-theorists toolkit. </p>



<p>I’ve recently added a new draft chapter to to V2.0 of <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu">Introduction to Online Convex Optimization</a>, about the connection between OCO and Blackwell approachability: they are algorithmically equivalent! More precisely, an efficient algorithm for approachability gives rise to an efficient algorithm for OCO with sublinear regret, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Details are in the chapter draft, and  I recommend this music for reading it: (the song is called “together we won despite everything”, dedicated to music and science)</p>

requirement for a deterministic demand, multi-item inventory system where each
item has a given reorder size and cycle length. The reorders can only take
place at integer time units within the cycle. This problem was shown to be
weakly NP-hard for constant joint cycle length (the least common multiple of
the lengths of all individual cycles). When all items have the same constant
cycle length, there exists a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme
(FPTAS), but no FPTAS has been known for the case when the individual cycles
are different. Here we devise the first known FPTAS for the RSP with different
individual cycles and constant joint cycle length.

    <title>Distributed Constructions of Dual-Failure Fault-Tolerant Distance Preservers</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1601942400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parter:Merav.html">Merav Parter</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01503">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Fault tolerant distance preservers (spanners) are sparse subgraphs that
preserve (approximate) distances between given pairs of vertices under edge or
vertex failures. So-far, these structures have been studied mainly from a
centralized viewpoint. Despite the fact fault tolerant preservers are mainly
motivated by the error-prone nature of distributed networks, not much is known
on the distributed computational aspects of these structures.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present distributed algorithms for constructing fault
tolerant distance preservers and $+2$ additive spanners that are resilient to
at most \emph{two edge} faults. Prior to our work, the only non-trivial
constructions known were for the \emph{single} fault and \emph{single source}
setting by [Ghaffari and Parter SPAA'16].
</p>
<p>Our key technical contribution is a distributed algorithm for computing
distance preservers w.r.t. a subset $S$ of source vertices, resilient to two
edge faults. The output structure contains a BFS tree $BFS(s,G \setminus
\{e_1,e_2\})$ for every $s \in S$ and every $e_1,e_2 \in G$. The distributed
construction of this structure is based on a delicate balance between the edge
congestion (formed by running multiple BFS trees simultaneously) and the
sparsity of the output subgraph. No sublinear-round algorithms for constructing
these structures have been known before.

queries about a database with $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. We
give a mechanism such that if the true answers to the queries are the vector
$d$, the mechanism outputs answers $\tilde{d}$ with the $\ell_\infty$-error
guarantee:

<p>$$\mathcal{E}\left[||\tilde{d} - d||_\infty\right] = O\left(\frac{\sqrt{k

</p>
<p>This reduces the multiplicative gap between the best known upper and lower
bounds on $\ell_\infty$-error from $O(\sqrt{\log \log k})$ to $O(\sqrt{\log
\log \log k})$. Our main technical contribution is an analysis of the family of
mechanisms of the following form for answering counting queries: Sample $x$
from a \textit{Generalized Gaussian}, i.e. with probability proportional to
$\exp(-(||x||_p/\sigma)^p)$, and output $\tilde{d} = d + x$. This family of
mechanisms offers a tradeoff between $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$-error
guarantees and may be of independent interest. For $p = O(\log \log k)$, this
mechanism already matches the previous best known $\ell_\infty$-error bound. We
arrive at our main result by composing this mechanism for $p = O(\log \log \log
k)$ with the sparse vector mechanism, generalizing a technique of Steinke and
Ullman.

modelling of spread of an alarm, a social contagion, or a social influence or
emotion on graphs and networks.
</p>
<p>Graph burning runs on discrete time-steps (or rounds). At each step $t$,
first (a) an unburned vertex is burned (as a \textit{fire source}) from
"outside", and then (b) the fire spreads to vertices adjacent to the vertices
which are burned till step $t-1$. This process stops after all the vertices of
$G$ have been burned. The aim is to burn all the vertices in a given graph in
minimum time-steps. The least number of time-steps required to burn a graph is
called its \textit{burning number}. The less the burning number is, the faster
a graph can be burned.
</p>
<p>Burning a general graph optimally is an NP-Complete problem. It has been
proved that optimal burning of path forests, spider graphs, and trees with
maximum degree three is NP-Complete. We study the \textit{graph burning
problem} on several sub-classes of \textit{geometric graphs}.
</p>
<p>We show that burning interval graphs (Section 7.1, Theorem 7.1), permutation
graphs (Section 7.2, Theorem 7.2) and disk graphs (Section 7.3, Theorem 7.3)
optimally is NP-Complete. In addition, we opine that optimal burning of general
graphs (Section 9.2, Conjecture 9.1) cannot be approximated better than
3-approximation factor.

auctions with subadditive bidders that achieves an
$O((\log\!\log{m})^3)$-approximation to the maximum welfare in expectation
using $O(n)$ demand queries; here $m$ and $n$ are the number of items and

problem dating back to the $O(\log{m}\cdot\log\!\log{m})$-approximation
mechanism of Dobzinski from 2007. Along the way, we also improve and
considerably simplify the state-of-the-art mechanisms for submodular bidders.

circuits computing explicit polynomials is a very important and challenging
task in algebraic complexity theory. We study representation of polynomials as
sums of weaker models such as read once formulas (ROFs) and read once oblivious
algebraic branching programs (ROABPs). We prove:
</p>
<p>(1) An exponential separation between sum of ROFs and read-$k$ formulas for
some constant $k$. (2) A sub-exponential separation between sum of ROABPs and
syntactic multilinear ABPs.
</p>
<p>Our results are based on analysis of the partial derivative matrix under
different distributions. These results highlight richness of bounded read
restrictions in arithmetic formulas and ABPs.
</p>
<p>Finally, we consider a generalization of multilinear ROABPs known as
strict-interval ABPs defined in [Ramya-Rao, MFCS2019]. We show that
strict-interval ABPs are equivalent to ROABPs upto a polynomial size blow up.
In contrast, we show that interval formulas are different from ROFs and also
admit depth reduction which is not known in the case of strict-interval ABPs.

    <title>On the monophonic rank of graphs</title>

O. da Silva <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01365">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A set of vertices $S$ of a graph $G$ is {\em monophonically convex} if every
induced path joining two vertices of $S$ is contained in $S$. The {\em
monophonic convex hull of $S$}, $\langle S \rangle$, is the smallest
monophonically convex set containing $S$. A set $S$ is {\em monophonic convexly
independent} if $v \not\in \langle S - \{v\} \rangle$ for every $v \in S$. The
{\em monophonic rank} of $G$ is the size of the largest monophonic convexly
independent set of $G$. We present a characterization of the monophonic
convexly independent sets. Using this result, we show how to determine the
monophonic rank of graph classes like bipartite, cactus, triangle-free, and
line graphs in polynomial time. Furthermore, we show that this parameter can
computed in polynomial time for $1$-starlike graphs, i.e., for split graphs,
and that its determination is $\NP$-complete for $k$-starlike graphs for any
fixed $k \ge 2$, a subclass of chordal graphs. We also consider this problem on
the graphs whose intersection graph of the maximal prime subgraphs is a tree.

offering discounts to influential users (called seeding). In many applications,
due to user's privacy concern, overwhelming network scale etc., it is hard to
target any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small subset of
users is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly
impair the influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree
users, which are particularly rare in such a small subset due to the power-law
structure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the limited IM
in real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion
uncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and
assume users accept the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is
depicted by the independent cascade model. To overcome the access limitation,
we prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon that neighbors have
higher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the FP
embedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we
formulate the non-adaptive case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard.
In the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated to users all at once. We show
the monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and design a
two-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In
the adaptive case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of
existing seeding and diffusion results. We prove the adaptive submodularity and
submodularity of the influence spread function in two stages. Then, a series of
adaptive greedy algorithms are proposed with constant approximation ratio.

Melo</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01306">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the uncapacitated three-level lot-sizing and replenishment
problem with a distribution structure. In this NP-hard problem, a single
production plant sends the produced items to replenish warehouses from where
they are dispatched to the retailers in order to satisfy their demands over a
finite planning horizon. The goal of the problem is to determine an integrated
production and distribution plan minimizing the total costs, which comprehends
fixed production and transportation setup as well as variable inventory holding
costs. We describe new valid inequalities both in the space of a standard mixed
integer programming (MIP) formulation and in that of a new alternative extended
MIP formulation. We show that using such extended formulation, valid
inequalities having similar structures to those in the standard one allow
achieving tighter linear relaxation bounds. Furthermore, we propose a
preprocessing approach to reduce the size of a multi-commodity MIP formulation
and a multi-start randomized bottom-up dynamic programming based heuristic.
Computational experiments indicate that the use of the valid inequalities in a
branch-and-cut approach significantly increase the ability of a MIP solver to
solve instances to optimality. Additionally, the valid inequalities for the
extended formulation outperform those for the standard one in terms of number
of solved instances, running time and number of enumerated nodes. Moreover, the
proposed heuristic is able to generate solutions with considerably low
optimality gaps within very short computational times even for large instances.
Combining the preprocessing approach with the heuristic, one can achieve an
increase in the number of solutions solved to optimality within the time limit
together with significant reductions on the average times for solving them.

modeling clustering tasks in a metric space. In practice and historically,
k-means is thought of in a continuous setting, namely where the centers can be
located anywhere in the metric space. For example, the popular Lloyd's
heuristic locates a center at the mean of each cluster.
</p>
<p>Despite persistent efforts on understanding the approximability of k-means,
and other classic clustering problems such as k-median and k-minsum, our
knowledge of the hardness of approximation factors of these problems remains
quite poor. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of
approximation factors known in the literature for these objectives. We show
that if the input lies in a general metric space, it is NP-hard to approximate:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Continuous k-median to a factor of $2-o(1)$; this improves upon the
previous inapproximability factor of 1.36 shown by Guha and Khuller (J.
Algorithms '99).
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ Continuous k-means to a factor of $4- o(1)$; this improves upon the
previous inapproximability factor of 2.10 shown by Guha and Khuller (J.
Algorithms '99).
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ k-minsum to a factor of $1.415$; this improves upon the
APX-hardness shown by Guruswami and Indyk (SODA '03).
</p>
<p>Our results shed new and perhaps counter-intuitive light on the differences
between clustering problems in the continuous setting versus the discrete
setting (where the candidate centers are given as part of the input).

    <title>MIP* = RE Redux</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Everything pre-covid seems at least five years ago to me, so it's hard to believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> is a 2020 result. To remind you, consider the model where we have two powerful provers put in separate rooms where they can't communicate (think suspects of a crime put in separate interrogation rooms). An computationally efficient verifier can ask them questions based on random coins. Thirty years ago, Laszlo Babai, Carsten Lund and myself <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01200056">showed</a> that every language in nondeterministic exponential time has proofs in this model.<div><br/></div><div>Now suppose the provers have entangled quantum bits. This question has a long history that culminates in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE paper</a> earlier this year by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, Henry Yuen showing that every proof of any length can be proven in this model. Incredible!</div><div><br/></div><div>But wait, why is there a new version 2 dated last week? Turns out the MIP* = RE paper relied on a 2016 paper by Vidick which was later discovered to have a bug. No worries, as the authors of the MIP* = RE paper got around this issue by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">quantum analysis</a> of a low-degree test from that old Babai-Fortnow-Lund paper.</div><div><br/></div><div>Vidick's <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">blog post</a> explains it all, including the angst of a major result falling apart temporarily.

After all, only the most gifted athletes participate.  There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.<br/>—Carl Sagan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"><em>The Demon-Haunted World</em></a> (1996)</p></blockquote>



<p>I’d like you to feel about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">impending destruction</a> of Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan">Bamyan Buddhas</a>, and then days later actually did blow them up.  Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape.  For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected.  I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the <em>avoidability</em>, and yet the finality, of the loss.</p>



<p>For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline.  Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but<em> totally within your control</em>—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system.  Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.</p>



<p>When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so <em>this</em> is the teenagerhood—the ironically <em>normal</em> teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else.  I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country.  I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html">Stuyvesant and Bronx Science</a> in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now.  The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.</p>



<p>Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening.  As the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s Jay Matthews <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646">explains</a>, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school <em>also</em> happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).</p>



<p>You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does?  It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/">they did in the 1990s</a>, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged.  But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it.  Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.</p>



<p>The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS.  More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity.  And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, <em>still</em> it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.</p>



<p>So yes, the district is <strong>embarrassed</strong>—note that the<em> Washington Post</em> writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni.  To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.</p>



<p>In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to <strong>drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically <em>increasing</em> (!!!) the number of White students</strong>.  The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small.  Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be<strong> overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant</strong>; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.</p>



<p>In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">protesting in front of TJHS</a> to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction.  But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed.  The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.</p>



<p>Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff <em>weigh</em> on you so heavily?  This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in <em>one</em> case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared.  On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me.  With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?</p>



<p>If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them.  You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.</p>



<p>I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of <em>resentment</em> toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity,  “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong.  And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?  Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept <em>you</em>, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow?  And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.</p>

<p>As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: <strong>I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison</strong>.  (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)</p>

    <title>Open Problem - Avoiding the Union Bound for Multiple Queries</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

A very recent work by Ganesh and Zhao [<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arunganesh/papers/generalizedgaussians.pdf">GZ20</a>] improves the best upper bound from \(c\sqrt{k \log \log k}\) to \(c\sqrt{k \log \log \log k}\).</p>

<p><strong>The reason for answer 1 is</strong>: Since the ratio of boys/girls is 50/50, and you don’t count yourself in the answer, boys will tend to have more sisters and girls will tend to have more brothers</p>

<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: Lifting theorems in complexity theory are a method of transferring lower bounds in a weak computational model into lower bounds for a more powerful computational model, via function composition. There has been an explosion of lifting theorems in the last ten years, essentially reducing communication lower bounds to query complexity lower bounds. These theorems only hold for composition with very specific “gadgets” such as indexing and inner product. <br/><br/> In this talk, we will present a generalization of the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as equality and greater-than. We will then explain how to apply our generalized theorem to solve three open problems: <br/>– We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded coefficients. Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.<br/>– We give the strongest separation to-date between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone Boolean circuits. Namely, we show that the classical GEN problem, which has polynomial-size monotone Boolean circuits, requires monotone Boolean formulas of size <img alt="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5COmega%28n+%2F+%5Ctextrm%7Bpolylog%7D+n%29%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="2^{\Omega(n / \textrm{polylog} n)}"/>.<br/>– We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Namely, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.<br/><br/>This talk is based on joint work with Or Meir, Jakob Nordström, Toniann Pitassi, Robert Robere, and Marc Vinyals, available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02144</a> </p></div>

    <title>TR20-149 |  Robustly Self-Ordered Graphs: Constructions and Applications to Property Testing | 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Avi Wigderson</title>
    <summary>A graph $G$ is called {\em self-ordered}\/ (a.k.a asymmetric) if the identity permutation is its only automorphism.
Equivalently, there is a unique isomorphism from $G$ to any graph that is isomorphic to $G$. 
We say that $G=(V,E)$ is {\em robustly self-ordered}\/ if the size of the symmetric difference between $E$ and the edge-set of the graph obtained by permuting $V$ using any permutation $\pi:V\to V$ is proportional to the number of non-fixed-points of $\pi$.

We show that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs exist (in abundance), and that they can be constructed efficiently, in a strong sense.
Specifically, given the index of a vertex in such a graph, it is possible to find all its neighbors in polynomial-time (i.e., in time that is poly-logarithmic in the size of the graph).

We provide two very different constructions, in tools and structure. 
The first, a direct construction, is based on proving a sufficient condition for robust self-ordering, 
which requires that an auxiliary graph, on {\em pairs|}\/ of vertices of the original graph, is expanding. 
In this case the original graph is (not only robustly self-ordered but) also expanding.
The second construction proceeds in three steps: It boosts the mere existence of robustly self-ordered graphs, 
which provides explicit graphs of sublogarithmic size, to an efficient construction of polynomial-size graphs, 
and then, repeating it again, to exponential-size(robustly self-ordered) graphs that are locally constructible.
This construction can yield robustly self-ordered graphs that are either expanders or highly disconnected, having logarithmic size connected components. 

We also consider graphs of unbounded degree, seeking correspondingly unbounded robustness parameters.
We again demonstrate that such graphs (of linear degree) exist (in abundance), and give an explicit construction. 
This turns out to require very different tools, and the definition and constructions of new pseudo-random objects. 
Specifically, we show that the construction of such graphs reduces to the construction of non-malleable two-source extractors 
with very weak parameters but with an additional natural feature. 
Next, we reduce the construction of such non-malleable two-source extractors to the construction of ``relocation-detecting'' codes. Loosely speaking, in such code permuting arbitrarily the coordinates of a random codeword yields a string that is far any other codeword. We conclude by showing how to construct relocation-detecting codes (of various types, including ones with constant rate).  

We demonstrate that robustly self-ordered bounded-degree graphs are useful towards obtaining lower bounds on the query complexity of testing graph properties both in the bounded-degree and the dense graph models.  
Indeed, their robustness offers efficient, local and distance preserving reductions from testing problems on ordered structures (like sequences) to the unordered (effectively unlabeled) graphs. 
One of the results that we obtain, via such a reduction, is a subexponential separation 
between the complexity of testing and tolerant testing of graph properties in the bounded-degree graph model.</summary>
