Avrim Blum is the CAO for TTIC. That is he is the Chief Academic Officer at the Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago. Avrim has and continues to make key contributions to many areas of theory—including machine learning, approximation algorithms, on-line algorithms, algorithmic game theory, the theory of database privacy, and non-worst-case analysis of algorithms. </p>
<p>
Today I want to discuss a suggestion of Avrim for research on self-play.</p>
<p>
Self-play is the key to many recent AI results on playing games. These results include essentially solving the games Chess, Go, Shogi, forms of poker, and many others. They were solved by algorithms that start with no knowledge of the game, save the rules. The algorithm then learn the secrets of playing the game by self-play: by playing games against itself. For example, the AI chess programs did not know that “a rook is worth more than a pawn.” But they discover that by playing the game over and over. Impressive. </p>
<p>
For example, David Sweet on his hacker <a href="https://hackernoon.com/self-play-1f69ceb06a4d">site</a> says referring to self-play: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This is mysterious to me. If it only played against itself, where did new information come from? How did it know if it was doing well? If I play a game of chess against myself, should I say I did well if I beat myself? But when I beat myself, I also lose to myself. And how could I ever know if I’d do well against someone else? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Planted Clique Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I was at TTIC last month and over lunch we discussed self-play possibilities for theory problems. I suggested that the planted clique <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planted_clique">problem</a> might be a potential example. Recall the planted clique problem is the task of distinguishing two types of graphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Random graphs on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vertices generated with <img alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p=1/2}"/>, the probability that there is an edge between each pair of nodes; <p/>
</li><li>
Random graphs on <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vertices generated with <img alt="{p=1/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3D1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p=1/2}"/>, with a clique of size <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> added, the planted clique.
</li></ul>
<p>
If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> is large, it is easy to tell these apart—just count the number of edges. If <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> is small enough, it is open if one can tell them apart. The largest clique in a random graph typically has size near <img alt="{k=2\log_{2} n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D2%5Clog_%7B2%7D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k=2\log_{2} n}"/>. This implies that there is a quasi-polynomial time average-case algorithm: just try all subsets of size around <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>.</p>
<p>
My intuition was that a program might be able to exploit self-play to solve planted clique problems. The point is that it is easy, by definition, to generate “yes” and “no” examples for this problem. Note, this is not known for SAT problems—generating hard instances there is not clear. This was my point. Could the AI methods somehow divine the planted clique version of “a rook is worth more than a pawn”? Could they use self-play to solve planted clique problems?</p>
<p>
I wondered to the lunch group about all this. It left the group unexcited. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ramsey Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Then Avrim asked a better question. He wondered if self-play methods could be used to solve a long standing problem concerning Ramsey numbers. Recall the Ramsey number <img alt="{R(s,s)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28s%2Cs%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(s,s)}"/> is defined as the smallest <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> such every red-green coloring of the edges of the complete graph <img alt="{K_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{n}}"/> has either a red or a green subgraph of size at least <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/>.</p>
<p>
The exact value of <img alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5, 5)}"/> is unknown, although it is known to lie between <img alt="{43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{43}"/> and <img alt="{48}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B48%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{48}"/>. See a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">post</a> by Gil Kalai on his blog for some discussions. Joel Spencer quotes Paul Erdős: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Erdős asks us to imagine an alien force, vastly more powerful than us, landing on Earth and demanding the value of <img alt="{R(5, 5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C+5%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5, 5)}"/> or they will destroy our planet. In that case, he claims, we should marshal all our computers and all our mathematicians and attempt to find the value. But suppose, instead, that they ask for <img alt="{R(6, 6)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%286%2C+6%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(6, 6)}"/>. In that case, he believes, we should attempt to destroy the aliens.	 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Aliens are not attacking currently, but Avrim’s idea is that perhaps we could organize a self-play attack on the <img alt="{R(5,5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%285%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(5,5)}"/> problem. The idea would be to try to build a “game” version of this question. The algorithm would try to create a strategy that finds a red/green coloring for the complete graph so that no <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/>-clique is all red or all green. </p>
<p>
We need to arrange the computation of the Ramsey number as the result of some type of game. The paradox to me is that the play of a game suggests <img alt="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BPSPACE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{PSPACE}}"/>, while the Ramsey calculation is clearly of complexity <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/>. So how do we make the Ramsey calculation into a game? Ken and I wonder if there is a natural game <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> so that playing the game well yields insight into the value of a Ramsey number.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is there a game <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> with simple rules so that playing it well yields bounds on general Ramsey numbers?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Attacks on Ramsey Numbers </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There have been several attempts to use non-standard methods to compute Ramsey numbers. See the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
In this <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-013-0541-9">article</a>, quantum methods studied for the future, when hopefully quantum computers will be available. <p/>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://themusegarden.wordpress.com/2013/05/11/a-genetic-algorithm-approach-to-ramsey-theory/">project</a> genetic methods are used on related Ramsey numbers. <p/>
</li><li>
In this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01613.pdf">approach</a>, AI methods are used on related Ramsey numbers.
</li></ul>
<p>
See also this <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0662/893d7e04745a0709b3f1a092574f9dd3bf7b.pdf">survey</a> on computational methods in general.</p>
<p>
The asymmetry between the upper and lower bounds shapes approaches. The lower bound of 43 was proved by finding a two-coloring of the edges of <img alt="{K_{42}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B42%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{42}}"/> without a green or red <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/>-clique. Once a single coloring is guessed its property is easy to prove. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08768">improvement</a> of the upper bound from 49 to 48 two years ago <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/03/29/r55">needed</a> checking two trillion cases in order to fence-away all possible colorings. This has led to a common belief that 43 is the answer—if it were higher then a coloring of <img alt="{K_{43}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_%7B43%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{K_{43}}"/> would have been found by now.</p>
<p>
Can we use self-play to turn this belief into something more concrete? The training would begin on running self-play on the known cases <img alt="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots+38%2C39%2C40%2C41%2C42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots 38,39,40,41,42}"/>. This should create a neural net that is highly skilled at finding colorings that are free of small monochrome cliques. The question is how to leverage its presumed failure once we hit size <img alt="{43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{43}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perhaps someone should take Avrim’s suggestion and try it out. A natural idea would be to see if this approach could compute the known smaller Ramsey numbers—getting their exact upper bounds. </p>

    <title>Happy New Academic Year:  Teaching Randomized Algorithms</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It seems I haven't written on this blog for a while.<br/><br/>Today was the start of a new semester.  I'll be teaching Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis, using the new edition of my book with Eli Upfal as a base, and throwing in other material.  (Everyone should buy the book!  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/110715488X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=michaelmitzen-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=110715488X&amp;linkId=d598fb636637ebb656410099e7042a7c">Here's a link</a>.)  <br/><br/>It's a graduate level class, but generally designed for first year graduate students, and there were a lot of undergrads "shopping" it today.  (We don't do pre-registration at Harvard, and students get the first week to choose classes, known as shopping.)  So many that people were standing out the doors of the room.  But because we have a bit of a shortage of classes this semester, I'm guessing there's a good fraction of students just checking it out.  We'll see Thursday, but for now I'll predict we'll fit in the classroom, and wait to see if I'm wrong.  (If I'm wrong, that's wonderful too.)    <br/><br/>It's been four years since I last taught the course, so this time I'm trying something new.  When I've previously taught the course, I tried to make the class inviting and friendly by telling the class we'd begin without assuming the class knew probability, and so the first couple of weeks would be reviewing basics (like, say, linearity of expectations and union bounds), albeit in a CS algorithms context.  This time, I let the class know I'm assuming they know (or will pick up) basic probability, and so they should read chapters 1-4 on their own, and we'll start with Chapter 5, Balls and Bins models.  Over the last decade, I've seen a huge shift in probability knowledge -- Stat 110, Harvard's probability course, has become one of Harvard's biggest classes.  Many students have already taking AI or ML or even data science courses where they've done some (further) probability.  It feels appropriate (and safe) to assume people entering in the class know probability, or can review what they need on their own, and start the class further along.<br/><br/>Now finally, a request.  It's actually hard for me to teach when using this book, because I don't want to just read the book to the students.  That's boring.  On the other hand, if I thought something was important, I most likely already put it in the book.  We have to mix up the standard lecturing format a bit.  So two things we'll be doing are<br/><br/>1)  doing some "puzzle problems" at the beginning of most classes, so people can try to solve problems.  (Kind of a flipped classroom approach, but not a full commitment.)<br/>2)  reading papers, related to the class topics.<br/><br/>So if you have any good suggestions of probability puzzle problems, or readable papers (particularly application papers) that use relatively basic probabilistic analysis in neat ways, send them over.  I've got a semester to fill.<br/><br/>For curious people, here's one of today's starting problems, which I first learned about in graduate school.  (I'm pretty sure I owe thanks to Claire Kenyon for teaching it.  I'll link to the corresponding Wikipedia page on the problem maybe later.)<br/><br/>After lunch, Bob suggests the following game to see who pays.  Alice and Bob will each choose a different sequence of three flips.  (So they could choose "Heads-Tails-Heads'', or "Tails-Tails-Tails'' for example.)  After they choose, a fair coin will be tossed until one of their sequences appears as a consecutive subsequence of the coin tosses.  The player whose sequence appears first wins. (Note that if they choose the above sequences, and if the flips come up Heads-Tails-Tails-Tails, the player that chose Tails-Tails-Tails would win as soon as their subsequence appears;  it's not three flips, then start over again.)  Bob politely says that Alice can choose first, and after she chooses and tells him her sequence he'll choose a different sequence.  What should Alice choose?</div>

    <title>Can Mathematicians Fix Iphones? Can anyone?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
In my last post I noted that if I am asked (since I am a CS prof)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Can you fix my iphone</i><br/>
<br/>
is<br/>
<br/>
<i>No, I work on the math side of CS</i><br/>
<br/>
Some readers emailed me (I told them to comment instead but they were worried that other readers would argue with them) that NO, this is a tired and incorrect stereotype.  Here are some samples:<br/>
<br/>
1) People in Mathematics are no better or worse at fixing iphones, fixing cars, programming their VCR's, etc than the public.<br/>
<br/>
2) For that matter, people in academica, even in practical sounding fields like Systems, are no better.<br/>
<br/>
3) Is your nephew Jason who used to fix forklifts for a living  better at these things then the general public? I asked him. Answer: No, though he is better at fixing forklifts.<br/>
<br/>
I think something else is going on here. Lets look at fixing your own car. I think this is the sort of thing that some people used to be able to do but now very few can do it. Cars have gotten more complicated. <br/>
<br/>
Iphones are not quite there yet but its getting that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course somethings have gotten easier--- programming a DVR is much easier than programming a VCR.   And people can easily use WORD or write programs without having to know any hardware.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, after all these random thoughts, here is the question: What do you think? <br/>
<br/>
Are people in CS or Math or CS theory better at X than the general public where X is NOT CS, Math or CS theory, but something like fixing their cars?<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
What has gotten harder? What has gotten easier?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>TR19-112 |  Agreement testing theorems on layered set systems | 

	Yotam Dikstein, 

	Irit Dinur</title>
    <summary>We introduce a framework of layered subsets, and give a sufficient condition for when a set system supports an agreement test. Agreement testing is a certain type of property testing that generalizes PCP tests such as the plane vs. plane test. 

Previous work has shown that high dimensional expansion is useful for agreement tests. We extend these results to more general families of subsets, beyond simplicial complexes. These include

* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are faces of high dimensional expanders. Our new tests apply to all dimensions of complexes both in case of two-sided expansion and in the case of one-sided partite expansion.  This improves and extends an earlier work of Dinur and Kaufman (FOCS 2017) and applies to matroids, and potentially many additional complexes.
* Agreement tests for set systems whose sets are neighborhoods of vertices in a high dimensional expander. This family resembles the expander neighborhood family used in the gap-amplification proof of the PCP theorem. This set system is quite natural yet does not sit in a simplicial complex, and demonstrates some versatility in our proof technique. %It could potentially be useful towards new and more efficient constructions of locally testable codes and PCPs.
* Agreement tests on families of subspaces (also known as the Grassmann poset). This extends the classical low degree agreement tests beyond the setting of low degree polynomials.

Our analysis relies on a new random walk on simplicial complexes which we call the ``complement random walk'' and which may be of independent interest. This random walk generalizes the non-lazy random walk on a graph to higher dimensions, and has significantly better expansion than previously-studied random walks on simplicial complexes.</summary>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Richard Ehrenborg with a polyhedron</span></p>
<p>In the Problem session last Thursday in Oberwolfach, Steve Klee presented a beautiful problem of Richard Ehrenborg regarding the number of spanning trees in bipartite graphs.</p>
<p>Let <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G"/> be a bipartite graph with <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m"/> vertices on one side and <img alt="n " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n "/> vertices on the other side, and with vertex-degrees <img alt="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_1%2Cd_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Cd_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d_1,d_2,\dots ,d_m"/> and <img alt="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e_1%2Ce_2%2C%5Cdots+e_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="e_1,e_2,\dots e_n"/>.</p>
<p><strong>Ehrenborg’s problem:</strong> Is it the case that the number of spanning trees of <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G"/> is at most</p>
<p><img alt="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%5E%7B-1%7Dn%5E%7B-1%7D+%5Cprod_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Em+d_i+%5Cprod_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5En+e_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="m^{-1}n^{-1} \prod_{i=1}^m d_i \prod_{j=1}^n e_j"/>.</p>
<p>In words, the number of spanning trees is at most the product of the vertex degrees divided by the sizes of the two sides.</p>
<p>For example for the complete bipartite graph the number of the spanning trees is <img alt="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bm-1%7Dm%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n^{m-1}m^{n-1}"/> so equality hold.  More genarally,  equality holds for <strong>Ferrer’s graphs</strong>. Those are graphs where the vertices on the two sides are ordered and if <img alt="(a,b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a,b)"/> is an edge so are <img alt="(a',b)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%27%2Cb%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a',b)"/> and <img alt="(a,b')" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Cb%27%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="(a,b')"/> for <img alt="a'&lt;a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%27%3Ca&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a'&lt;a"/> and <img alt="b'&lt;b" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b%27%3Cb&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="b'&lt;b"/>. See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.2918"> this paper of Richard Ehrenborg and Stephanie van Willigenburg</a>.</p>
<p>Steve Klee and Matthiew Stamps  found a new point of view for both the weighted and unweighted settings. (See<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03575"> this paper</a> by Klee and Stamps and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04973">this paper</a>.) <span id="more-17923"/></p>
<p>There is an analogous problem for general graphs where threshold graphs replace Ferrer’s graphs. This is related to a conjecture by Grone and Merris. (There are importat related works by Kelmans.) See <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2002-354-11/S0002-9947-02-03082-9/home.html">this paper</a> by Duval and Reiner and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0302213">this paper</a> by Martin and Reiner for related results and conjectures on spectrum of Laplacians for general simplicial complexes and shifted simplicial complexes.</p>
<p>I have learned that the Crone-Merris conjecture itself was <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/2011-363-08/S0002-9947-2011-05393-6/home.html">settled by Hua Bai in 2012</a>.

How should one visualize the order-type of a set of points (which triples are clockwise, which counterclockwise, and which collinear)? Aichholzer et al consider points without collinear triples, and draw a graph over the points so that as points move the order-type changes only as points cross edges. Their graph’s embedding determines the order type and has at most a third as many edges as the complete graph.</p>

As <em>Quanta</em> describes, one possible resolution is to add a third black hole to the mix, and get a (significantly less stable) three-body problem.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[Guest post by Sandy Irani; see also the new website <a href="http://safetoc.org">http://safetoc.org</a> for more information on this initiative. –Boaz ]</em></p>



<p>Update and follow-up on the Safe ToC initiative:  </p>



<p>Last year, a group of us served on an ad hoc committee to combat harassment and discrimination in the Theory of Computing community.  In our report, we suggested a number of measures that the various theory conferences could adopt to help in this effort.  At a minimum, we wanted conferences to adopt a code of conduct and to appoint volunteers to serve as ToC Advocates whose role will be to provide support to any individual who has experienced harassment at a conference.  Our full final report is now available here:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf">https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/ToC_SH_report.pdf</a></p>



<p>A small subset of the original committee along with Yuval Rabani in his capacity as IEEE TCMF chair are working on implementing some of the recommendations in the recent report. We have now launched a web site for the SafeToC Initiative: <a href="http://safetoc.org">safetoc.org</a><br/></p>



<p>So far, the support from the broader community has been strong. Quite a few conferences have passed resolutions to adopt the recommended practices in our report. The new web site lists all the participating conferences as well as the names of volunteers who have signed on to be ToC Advocates. The web site also provides information for ToC Advocates, conference organizers, and members of the ToC community. <br/></p>



<p>Participating conferences all have codes of conduct and are ensuring that participants agree to abide by the code as part of their registration process. In addition, some of these conferences are adopting new mechanisms for author-declared conflicts of interests. This is especially important if an author feels that he or she may receive an unfair review due to a previous harassment-related incident. <br/></p>



<p>Of course, the work is not done, and this important effort needs to continue. What can everyone do from here?<br/></p>



<ul><li>First, we are in need of trained ToC Advocates, to spread this important service around!  An advocate would be a designated conference attendee who would be available to provide support and information to anyone who has observed or experienced harassment at the conference The work is not difficult. Right now the training consists of an hour-long webinar sponsored by the ACM. We are envisioning one or two group Skype meetings per year to share experiences and best practices. If you are interested in serving as a ToC Advocate for a conference, you can contact someone on the steering committee for that conference.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Second, even if you are not serving as an Advocate, please familiarize yourself with the various codes of conduct, and perhaps even listen to a training video!  A larger community of invested bystanders who are aware of these issues and prepared to support and/or intervene as needed is critical.  This does not have to mean formal reporting – even helping to diffuse a problematic situation or checking in on a colleague to be sure they are ok after a difficult conversation can make a big difference to someone involved in an incident.</li></ul>



<p>We will continue to update the web page as participation in this effort grows. Thank you to everyone for helping to make our community a safe and welcoming place for everyone.<br/></p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Recently, my Facebook wall was full of discussion about instituting an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/16/mathematicians-need-doctor-style-hippocratic-oath-says-academic-hannah-fry?fbclid=IwAR1yvNyv8P4UJWhiAH_kshgXjjs_MZ2aVsfmLxrEv4d2sKAIzf2q3TtS4PQ">oath for STEM workers</a>, analogous to the Hippocratic oath for doctors.  Perhaps some of the motivation for this comes from a worldview I can’t get behind—one that holds STEM nerds almost uniquely responsible for the world’s evils.  Nevertheless, on reflection, I find myself in broad support of the idea.</p>



<p>But I prefer writing the oath myself.  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<p>1. I will never allow anyone else to make me a cog.  I will never do what is stupid or horrible because “that’s what the regulations say” or “that’s what my supervisor said,” and then sleep soundly at night.  I’ll never do my part for a project unless I’m satisfied that the project’s broader goals are, at worst, morally neutral.  There’s no one on earth who gets to say: “I just solve technical problems.  Moral implications are outside my scope.”  </p>



<p>2. If I build or supply tools that are used to do evil or cause suffering, I’ll be horrified as soon as I learn about it.  Yes, I might judge that the good of the tools outweighs the bad, that the bad can’t be prevented, etc.  But I’ll be hyper-alert to the possibility of self-serving bias in such reflections, and will choose a different course of action whenever the reflections are no longer persuasive to my highest self.</p>



<p>3. I will pursue the truth, and hold the sharing of truth and exposing of falsehoods among my highest moral values.</p>



<p>4. I will make a stink, resign, leak to the press, sabotage, rather than go along quietly with decisions inimical to my values.</p>



<p>5. I will put everything on the line for my students, advisees, employees—my time, funds, reputation, and credibility.  And not only because it can somewhat make up for failings in the other areas.</p>



<p>6. Black, white, male, female, trans, gay, straight, Israeli, Palestinian, young, old.  Whatever ideologies I might subscribe to about which groups are advantaged and which disadvantaged in which aspects of life—when it comes time interact with a person, I will throw ideology into the ocean and treat them solely as an individual, not as a representative of a group.</p>



<p>7. I will not be Jeffrey Epstein—and not just in the narrow sense of not collecting underage girls on a private sex island.  I’ll see myself always as accountable to the moral judgment of history.  Whenever I’m publicly accused of wrongdoing, I’ll consider only two options: (a) if guilty, then confess, offer restitution, beg for forgiveness, or (b) if innocent, then mount a full public defense.  Finding some escape that avoids the need for either of these—from legal maneuvering to suicide—will never be on the table for me.</p>



<p>8. I’m under no obligation to blog or tweet every detail of my private life.  Yet even in my most private moments, I’ll act in such a way that, <em>if</em> my actions were made public, I’d have a defense of which I was unashamed.</p>



<p>9. To whatever extent I was gifted at birth with a greater-than-average ability to prove theorems or write code or whatever, I’ll treat it as just that—a gift, which I didn’t earn or deserve.  It doesn’t make me inherently worthier than anyone else, but it <em>does</em> give me a moral obligation to use the gift for good.  And whenever I’m tempted to be jealous of various non-nerds—of their ease in social or romantic situations, wealth, looks, power, athletic ability, or anything else about them—I’ll remember the gift, and that all in all, I made out better than I had a right to expect.</p>



<p>10. I’ll be conscious always of living in a universe where catastrophes—genocides, destructions of civilizations, extinctions of magnificent species—have happened and will happen again.  The burning of the Amazon, the deaths of children, the bleaching of coral reefs, will weigh on me daily, to the maximum extent consistent with being able to get out of bed in the morning, live, and work.  While it’s not obvious that <em>any</em> of these problems are open to a STEM-nerd solution, of the sort I could plausibly think of or implement—nevertheless, I’ll keep asking myself whether any of them are.  And if I ever <em>do</em> find myself before one of the levers of history, I’ll pull with all my strength to try to prevent these catastrophes.</p></div>

    <title>Grid majors</title>
    <summary>I’ve written here about grid minors before, more than once. These are grid graphs that you can get from a given graph as a minor (that is, by removing edges or vertices from and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of must be a grid graph that has as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (arXiv:1908.05706, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/12/16/grid-minors-in.html">written here about grid minors</a> before, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/03/05/more-on-grid.html">more than once</a>. These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_graph">grid graphs</a> that you can get from a given graph  as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_minor">minor</a> (that is, by removing edges or vertices from  and contracting others of its edges). So, in the other direction, a “grid major” of  must be a grid graph that has  as a minor. These are the subject of my new preprint, “Homotopy height, grid-major height and graph-drawing height” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05706">arXiv:1908.05706</a>, with Therese Biedl, Erin Chambers, Arnaud De Mesmay, and Tim Ophelders, to appear at Graph Drawing).</p>

<p>You can define the terms in the paper’s title for any planar graph, but our results are cleanest for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_planar_graph">maximal planar graphs</a>. If we define the height of a grid to be the smaller of its two dimensions, then the grid-major height of a graph  is just the smallest height of a grid that has  as a minor. The detailed definition of homotopy height is trickier to explain, but the rough idea is that (after choosing one face of your graph to be the outer one) you should sweep a path from one edge of the outer face, across the graph, to another edge of the outer face, trying as you do to keep the path as short as possible. Paths can move across triangular faces (changing the number of vertices by ) or path vertices can “slide” along edges  (leaving the total number unchanged. The smallest length  such that you can do this sweep and always maintain length at most  turns out to equal the grid-major height, and both are lower bounds on the height of a conventional drawing of the graph (with its vertices at grid points and its edges as straight line segments).</p>

<p>For instance, the following drawing shows a height- grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, a sequence of  paths of length at most  sweeping from the left to the right edge of the graph, and the subsets of vertices to contract in a  grid to produce the graph as a minor. Each column of the grid has the same vertices as the corresponding path in the walk. For this graph, the drawing height, homotopy height, and grid-major height are all equal, but it is possible for the drawing height to be much larger than the other two quantities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Grid drawing of a maximal planar graph, homotopy sequence for the graph, and grid major representation of the graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/grid-majors.svg"/></p>

<p>Both homotopy height and grid-major height come in simple and non-simple variations. They are equal for both variations, and both variations give a valid lower bound on graph drawing height. In simple homotopy height the swept path is required to stay simple (as it is in the example here) while more generally we allow walks that can repeat vertices. (In particular they can have “spikes”, parts of paths that double back along a single edge.) Correspondingly, non-simple grid-major height does not restrict how  is formed as a minor of a grid while the simple variant requires the parts of the grid corresponding to a single vertex of  to be contiguous within each column of the grid (as they are in the example here).</p>

<p>Because grid-major height behaves nicely under graph minor operations, it is automatically fixed-parameter tractable, but in a non-uniform way. What this means is that for each  there are finitely many graphs that, when they are a minor of , prevent  from having grid-major height . We can find the grid-major height of  by looking for these “obstacles” and returning the smallest  for which no obstacles are found. And, whenever  is bounded, the time of the resulting algorithm is a polynomial whose exponent is independent of the size of . So an algorithm exists for any fixed , but we don’t know how to actually write it down as a program because we don’t know what the obstacles are or even whether the number of obstacles is computable.</p>

<p>Simple grid-major height is nicer from the algorithmic point of view, but still not entirely satisfactory. Our paper describes the existence of a simple grid major using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a>. When  is bounded this gives us a linear-time algorithm via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcelle%27s_theorem">Courcelle’s theorem</a>. The algorithm could in principle be written out explicitly as a program,
with  given as an input to the program rather than hardcoded into it. There is no problem with unknown lists of obstacles. But the logical description is huge and the dependence of Courcelle’s theorem on the size of the logical description is very high, so although the time is linear in the size of the graph it gets multiplied by a very quickly growing function <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of .</span></p>

Danny Cohen was a pioneer who advanced many areas of computer science. He made contributions to computer graphics, networking, and flight simulation, and much more.</p>
<p>
Today I want to remember him and his work.</p>
<p><span id="more-16208"/></p>
<p>
Danny is hard to label. Leonard Kleinrock, said that Cohen “had the uncanny ability to employ his deep mathematical intellect and insight to real world challenges, with enormous impact.” Indeed. This is quoted in last week’s New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/obituaries/danny-cohen-who-helped-set-the-stage-for-a-digital-era-dies-at-81.html">obit</a>. The Los Angeles Times <a href="https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2019-08-20/danny-cohen-computer-scientist-dead">obit</a> noted his 1981 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1667115">paper</a> addressed to warring “Big Endian” and “Little Endian” camps.</p>
<p>
Obituaries for Danny do not, in my opinion, explain why Danny was so remarkable. For example, he impacted theory even though he never worked in it. Let me explain in a moment. But first <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Danny—isms </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I worked with Danny. I was on a government committee that he chaired, years ago. He was an excellent leader, a tough chair, and ran a tight ship. He had been a fighter pilot, perhaps that is why he was such a great leader. On that committee—I will not identify it—he once fired a new committee member as he left the first meeting. Really as he walked out the door, while the rest of us were still meeting. He immediately said that he would not be staying on the committee. Tough. Yes. But Danny knew how to run a meeting.</p>
<p>
Danny had a clever wit. One of his favorite jokes was based on a form he had printed out:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The_____________________________technology is a promising technology and always will be.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He then would fill in the blank with whatever you thought was a great technology and hand it to you. Today perhaps we might fill in “quantum computing”—or is that wrong to say?</p>
<p>
Danny loved irony. His son revealed that Danny had joined the Flat Earth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_flat_Earth_societies">Society</a>. Danny was initially rejected—no scientists allowed. After he got in—this time he did not list his profession—he framed the certificate of membership, the rejection letter and the Flat Earth Society’s map of the world, complete with an emblazoned “Australia Not Down Under..”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> MOSIS </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A key contribution that seems to be missed in obits I’ve seen is that he helped create the VLSI revolution. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSIS">MOSIS</a> is the <i>Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service</i>. Danny created it, <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9412602.pdf">styling</a> it after the earlier work of the pioneer Lynn Conway. Ten points if you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a> stands for.</p>
<p>
MOSIS allowed researchers to actually fabricate their designs: to convert digital plans into chips that worked. You designed the chips yourself, encoded in a strange digital file format. Then you sent the files to MOSIS. They then placed you design along with other designs onto one wafer. A wafer held many designs. The wafer files were finally sent to a commercial foundry. There they were converted from digital into silicon. When MOSIS got them back they broke the wafers up and sent you the chips that you designed. </p>
<p>
This was magical. The beauty was we could make working chips without having to have our own foundry. At that time frame many companies in the computer business would boast that they had they own <i>captive foundry</i>. Few could afford the huge cost of having their own fabrication foundry. Danny liked to say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A captive foundry was one that captured you. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>His point was that if you had your own foundry, you probably would be forced to use it, even if it was not the right type for your needs. Captive indeed.</p>
<p>
Since 1981, when it started, countless projects have been fabricated. MOSIS was a brilliant idea that made it possible for many to build working VLSI chips. We did that more that once while I was at Princeton University. While at Princeton my students and I sent several designs to MOSIS. For example, Dan Lopresti sent in a design that we discussed before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/nsf-workshop-on-design-automation-and-theory/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/29/danny-cohen-passed-away/lop/" rel="attachment wp-att-16217"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16217" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/lop.png?w=140&amp;h=300" width="140"/></a></p>
<p>
The ability to make chips was a terrific motivator. I believe that the excitement of being able to make your own devices helped move the field forward. Without MOSIS, without Danny, the field would have advanced much slower. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perhaps the lesson of MOSIS is not lost on us. Today there are “MOSIS” like systems that allow even theorists to execute physically real quantum computations. This is indirectly thanks to Danny. We owe him much.</p>

    <title>Congratulations, Dr. Besa!</title>
    <summary>Juan Besa’s successful dissertation defense was last Thursday, but I’ve been holding off posting about it here because one of his committee members took ill and couldn’t sign off on it until today.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="http://sites.uci.edu/juanbesa/">Juan Besa’s</a> successful dissertation defense was last Thursday, but I’ve been holding off posting about it here because one of his committee members took ill and couldn’t sign off on it until today.</p>

<p>Juan started his graduate work in embedded systems, but for the last several years he has been one of the theory students at UCI, advised by Mike Goodrich. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-besa.html">My joint papers with him</a> have included <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/09/16/directing-traffic.html">algorithms for scheduling traffic signals to allow groups of vehicles to move through them quickly</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/05/09/sorting-when-sorted.html">maintaining an approximately sorted list</a> of items whose sorted order is changing dynamically in a context where comparisons are expensive.</p>

<p>He also has papers on which I was not involved, on chess knights’ tours with few crossings or bends (mentioned briefly with links <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/31/linkage.html">here</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01630">embedding planar digraphs so each vertex has few alternations between incoming and outgoing edges</a> (to appear at ESA), and another one on low-width tree drawing that has yet to appear publicly as a paper but forms part of his dissertation.</p>

<p>Juan has dual Chilean and Spanish citizenship, and (having the usual double-barreled Spanish surname “Besa Vial”) had to deal with the difficulties of getting that name format understood in non-Spanish-speaking countries; he ended up choosing to truncate it to “Besa” in his recent publications. He is heading to England to work at a machine learning company there. With Brexit coming up quickly, I worry about how that will work out, but I hope it does work well for him.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Juan!</p>

<p>
James Oxley and Geoff Whittle are mathematicians at LSU and Victoria University (Wellington, New Zealand), respectively. They have written many joint papers on matroid theory, but none on quantum computing.</p>
<p>
Today we observe that they really have <i>indirectly</i> written a paper on quantum computing.</p>
<p><span id="more-16196"/></p>
<p>
Their <a href="http://homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~whittle/pubs/Tutte_invariants_of_2-polymatroids.pdf">paper</a>, “A Characterization of Tutte Invariants of 2-Polymatroids,” has implications for quantum complexity theory. It introduced a polynomial <img alt="{S_G(u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G(u,v)}"/> where <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is a graph and <img alt="{u,v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%2Cv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u,v}"/> are numbers. Like many polynomials defined on graphs this one is in general hard to compute—it is <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/>-hard, so if it is polynomial time computable, then surprising stuff happens. </p>
<p>
The same paper observes that <img alt="{S_G(u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G(u,v)}"/> is easy to compute when 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  uv = 1 \text{ for rational } u,v. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++uv+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+for+rational+%7D+u%2Cv.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  uv = 1 \text{ for rational } u,v. "/></p>
<p>However, a 2006 <a href="https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/818/1/polymatroid.pdf">paper</a> by Steve Noble proves that <em>all</em> other rational cases are <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/>-hard. Our work finds easy cases in another family where <img alt="{v = \pm \sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv+%3D+%5Cpm+%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v = \pm \sqrt{2}i}"/> and <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> is a rational multiple of <img alt="{\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{2}i}"/>. This result goes through quantum complexity theory. </p>
<p>
It is interesting to note that quantum computations welcome complex numbers such as <img alt="{\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{2}i}"/>. In mathematics insights to behavior of real functions are often found when we extend them to the complex functions. A beautiful example to compare is that the behavior of 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^{2}} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1+%2B+x%5E%7B2%7D%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^{2}} "/></p>
<p>is best understood by noting that <img alt="{1+x^{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Bx%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+x^{2}}"/> can be zero at <img alt="{x=i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x=i}"/>. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Matroids and Polymatroids </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In order to best understand the above results it is helpful to look at matroids and generalizations. Matroids are a bit scary, since they seem quite abstract. But that is wrong. The matroid concept is a natural generalization of the notion of rank in an ordinary vector space. </p>
<p>
Let’s take a look. A <em>matroid</em> is defined by a set <img alt="{U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{U}"/> and a function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> from finite subsets of <img alt="{U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{U}"/> to <img alt="{\mathbb{N}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BN%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{N}}"/> that obeys the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<img alt="{f(\emptyset) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5Cemptyset%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\emptyset) = 0}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>

The notion of <em>rank</em> in an ordinary vector space obeys these axioms. The rules are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The empty set has rank <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
Each vector has rank at most <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>; <p/>
</li><li>
The rank of a set of vectors can increase only by adding more vectors; <p/>
</li><li>
Suppose that adding <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> to a set <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> increases the rank. Then <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> also increases the rank of any subset of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. Or if <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is independent of a set of vectors <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>, then it is independent of any subset of <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>.
</li></ol>
<p>
The definition of a <em>polymatroid</em> simply wipes out rule 2. OK, a <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>-polymatroid replaces it by the rule that for all singleton sets <img alt="{\{a\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{a\}}"/> have <img alt="{f(\{a\}) \leq k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28%5C%7Ba%5C%7D%29+%5Cleq+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(\{a\}) \leq k}"/>. An important kind of 2-polymatroid springs from the following idea:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The “<img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>-rank” of a subset <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> of the <b>edges</b> in a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is the number of vertices collectively touched by edges in <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In a simple undirected graph, every edge has <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>-rank 2. In graphs with self-loops, however, the loops have rank <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. We can also allow the universe <img alt="{U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{U}"/> to include members of <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>-rank <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>. Those are visualized as loops without a vertex and called <em>circles</em>. We could also visualize edges of rank <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> that stick out from a vertex <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> into empty space, but those are formally the same as loops at <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>. This defines a <em>graphic(al) 2-polymatroid</em> <img alt="{M = (U,f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%3D+%28U%2Cf%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M = (U,f)}"/>. </p>
<p>
The theory of polymatroids ignores the notion of “vertex” apart from the definition of the rank function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>. Hence all graphs composed of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> isolated vertices define the empty 2-polymatroid. To preserve the distinction, we define an <em>m-graph</em> to be a graph with circles allowed. The empty m-graph is denoted by <img alt="{\oslash}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Coslash%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\oslash}"/> and called a “wisp.” Every m-graph specializes to a unique graphical polymatroid but we can include isolated nodes when thinking of it as a graph (plus circles).</p>

</p><p/><h2> Explosion and Contraction Again </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We revisit the definition of “exploding” an edge <img alt="{e = (u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be+%3D+%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e = (u,v)}"/> in a graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> from the previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">post</a> in this series:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If there are an odd number of edges incident only to <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and/or <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>, then <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> become a circle and a wisp, else they become two wisps. <p/>
</li><li>
Any other edge incident to <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> or <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> from another vertex <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> becomes a loop at <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>.
</li></ul>
<p>
If we ignore vertices, then the rank function <img alt="{f'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'}"/> of the resulting m-graph <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G'}"/> is such that for all subsets <img alt="{A'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A'}"/> of its edge set <img alt="{E' = E \setminus \{e\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%27+%3D+E+%5Csetminus+%5C%7Be%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E' = E \setminus \{e\}}"/>, <a name="contract"/></p><a name="contract">

</a><p><a name="contract"/> One can verify that the “explosion” description obeys (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#contract">1</a>). Glancing at our picture helps—we have varied the one in the previous post by showing how one exploded node becomes a wisp while the loop at the other leaves a circle:</p>

<p/><p><br/>
The equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#contract">1</a>), however, is more fundamentally natural. The simple extension </p>

<p/><p>
In a previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/17/contraction-and-explosion/">post</a> we derived a recurrence for the <em>amplitude</em> <img alt="{a(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a(G)}"/> in terms of explosion. The presence of circles and use of the function <img alt="{f(e)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28e%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(e)}"/> now allows us to write it as: </p>

<p>
If we have a single node <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/> with <em>two</em> loops, something portentous happens. Exploding one of the loops <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> leaves a circle. Removing <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> still leaves one loop. So we get: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_{loop}(x) - Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x - 1 - (-1) = x. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++Q_%7BG%7D%28x%29+%3D+Q_%7Bloop%7D%28x%29+-+Q_%7B%5Cbigcirc%7D%28x%29+%3D+x+-+1+-+%28-1%29+%3D+x.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_{loop}(x) - Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x - 1 - (-1) = x. "/></p>
<p>This agrees with the value on one isolated node. Similarly, if <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> has just a double edge between two nodes <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> and <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v}"/>, then one edge <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> becomes a circle upon exploding the other edge, so recursing on the other edge makes </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_e(x) - \frac{1}{2}Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = x^2. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++Q_%7BG%7D%28x%29+%3D+Q_e%28x%29+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DQ_%7B%5Cbigcirc%7D%28x%29+%3D+x%5E2+-+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+x%5E2.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  Q_{G}(x) = Q_e(x) - \frac{1}{2}Q_{\bigcirc}(x) = x^2 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = x^2. "/></p>
<p>Thus the double edge gives the same result as having two isolated nodes. The upshot is that equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#recurse">2</a>) naturally treats edges modulo two. We can recurse on a <em>non</em>-edge as if it were a double-edge, and the circle left by the explosion (i.e., by the matroid contraction) becomes a <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1}"/> multiplier on the entire remainder of that branch of the recursion. The <em>circle</em> thus becomes a placeholder for calculating phase flips and cancellations, which is why we believe the matroid notions are useful in analyzing quantum processes.</p>
<p>
It may not be obvious, however, that <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> is well-defined when <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> has more than one edge. That is, does it come out the same for any order of choosing edges <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> for the recursion?

Every connected graph other than those we put in our basis has an edge <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/> that falls into one of these three cases. So we can prove (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#specialize">4</a>) by induction on them. The details convey why we need to use the particular value <img alt="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+-%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}"/> but are otherwise straightforward and tedious, so we’ve put them in a longer PDF <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/GLL/wmatroids.pdf">version</a>. Since the equation (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#rankgen">3</a>) for <img alt="{S_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G}"/> involves no recursion, this also proves that the recursive definition of <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> is confluent. <img alt="\Box" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\Box"/></p>
<p>
Note how the sum in the case (c) echoes the sum defining the Tutte polynomial, but with “explosion” in place of ordinary graph contraction. A more salient difference is that whereas the Tutte polynomial is the same on all <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-vertex trees, <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> differs on them. </p>

Also interesting is that if <img alt="{\ell = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell = 0}"/> and we delete each of the <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> edges independently with probability <img alt="{(1-p)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281-p%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(1-p)}"/>, then the probability that the deletions did not cause any isolated vertices is </p>

<p>Of course, this is classical probability. What interests us here is the import of <img alt="{S_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_G}"/> for quantum amplitude and probability. We have already observed in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/04/a-quantum-connection-for-matrix-rank/">previous</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">posts</a> that <img alt="{Q_{G}(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_%7BG%7D%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_{G}(1)}"/> gives the amplitude for an outcome in a special kind of quantum circuit. This means that <img alt="{S_{G}(\alpha,-\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_%7BG%7D%28%5Calpha%2C-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_{G}(\alpha,-\alpha)}"/> gives the same information, where <img alt="{\alpha^2 = -2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%5E2+%3D+-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha^2 = -2}"/>. </p>
<p>
We are curious about is the significance of <img alt="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_%7BG%7D%28%5Calpha+x%2C-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}"/> for other values of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> besides <img alt="{x = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x = 1}"/>. The complex value <img alt="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+-%5Csqrt%7B2%7Di%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = -\sqrt{2}i}"/> takes us outside the real-valued domain of Noble’s paper. His proof that most real cases are <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/>-hard to compute does not extend because <img alt="{\alpha^2 = -2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%5E2+%3D+-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha^2 = -2}"/>, which causes a denominator in his proof to vanish. Thus <img alt="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS_%7BG%7D%28%5Calpha+x%2C-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S_{G}(\alpha x,-\alpha)}"/> and hence <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> may be polynomial-time computable for various other real <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>.</p>
<p>
The specialization <img alt="{Q_G(x) = S_G(\alpha x, -\alpha)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29+%3D+S_G%28%5Calpha+x%2C+-%5Calpha%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x) = S_G(\alpha x, -\alpha)}"/> (times other easily-computed factors) does not seem to intersect with any of the above cases. Hence the field is wide open for finding new interpretations of it. Whatever we find, however, is bound to relate to the analysis of quantum circuits. It might help fulfill the aim in our <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/10/net-zero-graphs/">post</a> drawing analogy to Gustav Kirchhoff’s laws for electrical circuits.</p>

The conditions for this recursion to be confluent, however, essentially leave something equivalent to <img alt="{Q_G(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_G%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_G(x)}"/> with <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> as a homogenizing variable.

    <title>`Are you a math genius?' `Can you fix my Iphone?' `What do you think about Facebook and Privacy?'</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
When I meet non-math people and tell them I am a computer science professor I get a range of responses. Here are some and my responses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) <i>Are you a math genius?</i><br/>
<br/>
Here is the answer I give:<br/>
<br/>
<i>I know some things in math, frankly obscure things, that most people in math don't know. On the other hand, I probably can't help your teenage daughter with her trigonometry homework.  Academics, like most people, forget what they don't use, and there are some things in math I rarely use, so I've forgotten them.</i><br/>
<br/>
I wonder how a Fields' Medal winner would answer the question.<br/>
<br/>
Although the above is the answer I give I really think its an ill defined and pointless question. Its very hard to measure genius or even define what it means (there are exceptions). After a certain age, what you've done is more important than how smart you allegedly are.  <br/>
<br/>
2)<i> Can you fix my iPhone?</i><br/>
<br/>
That's an easy one: <i>No. I work on the math end of computer science.</i> I don't elaborate.<br/>
<br/>
3) <i>What do you think of Facebook and  privacy?</i><br/>
<br/>
This is an odd one. I DO have opinions on this but they are NOT better informed just because I'm a comp sci professor. Since I don't have a Facebook account my opinions might be worse informed. So how do I respond? I show them<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqggW08BWO0">this Onion News Network Video about how the CIA created Facebook </a><br/>
<br/>
Some think it's real. They may be right.<br/>

    <title>TR19-111 |  Noisy Beeps | 

	Klim Efremenko, 

	Gillat Kol, 

	Raghuvansh Saxena</title>
    <summary>We study the effect of noise on the $n$-party beeping model. In this model, in every round, each party may decide to either `beep' or not. All parties hear a beep if and only if at least one party beeps. The beeping model is becoming increasingly popular, as it offers a very  simple abstraction of wireless networks and is very well suited for studying biological phenomena. Still, the noise resilience of the beeping model is yet to be understood.

Our main result is a lower bound, showing that making protocols in the beeping model resilient to noise may have a large performance overhead. Specifically, we give a protocol that works over the (noiseless) beeping model, and prove that any scheme that simulates this protocol over the beeping model with correlated stochastic noise will blow up the number of rounds by an $\Omega(\log n)$ multiplicative factor.

We complement this result by a matching upper bound, constructing a noise-resilient simulation scheme with $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ overhead for any noiseless beeping protocol.</summary>

    <title>TR19-110 |  Improved bounds for the sunflower lemma | 

	Jiapeng Zhang, 

	Shachar Lovett, 

	Ryan Alweiss, 

	Kewen Wu</title>
    <summary>A sunflower with $r$ petals is a collection of $r$ sets so that the
intersection of each pair is equal to the intersection of all. Erd\H{o}s and Rado proved the sunflower lemma: for any fixed $r$, any family of sets of size $w$, with at least about $w^w$ sets, must contain a sunflower. The famous sunflower conjecture is that the bound on the number of sets can be improved to $c^w$ for some constant $c$. In this paper, we improve the bound to about $(\log w)^w$. In fact, we prove the result for a robust notion of sunflowers, for which the bound we obtain is tight up to lower order terms.</summary>

    <summary>In a recent paper, Kim and Kopparty (Theory of Computing, 2017) gave a deterministic algorithm for the unique decoding problem for polynomials of bounded total degree over a general grid $S_1\times\cdots \times S_m.$ We show that their algorithm can be adapted to solve the unique decoding problem for the general family of Downset codes. Here, a downset code is specified by a family $\mathcal{D}$ of monomials closed under taking factors: the corresponding code is the space of evaluations of all polynomials that can be written as linear combinations of monomials from $\mathcal{D}.$</summary>

    <title>TR19-108 |  Beating the probabilistic lower bound on perfect hashing | 

	Chaoping Xing, 

	chen yuan</title>
    <summary>For an interger $q\ge 2$, a perfect $q$-hash code $C$  is a  block code over $\ZZ_q:=\ZZ/ q\ZZ$ of length $n$ in which every subset $\{\bc_1,\bc_2,\dots,\bc_q\}$ of $q$ elements is separated, i.e., there exists $i\in[n]$ such that $\{\proj_i(\bc_1),\proj_i(\bc_2),\dots,\proj_i(\bc_q)\}=\ZZ_q$, where $\proj_i(\bc_j)$ denotes the $i$th position of $\bc_j$. Finding the maximum size $M(n,q)$ of  perfect $q$-hash codes of length $n$, for given $q$ and $n$, is  a fundamental problem in combinatorics, information theory, and computer science. In this paper, we are interested in asymptotical behavior of this problem. More precisely speaking, we will focus on the quantity $R_q:=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\log_2 M(n,q)}n$.

A well-known probabilistic argument shows an existence lower bound on $R_q$, namely $R_q\ge\frac1{q-1}\log_2\left(\frac1{1-q!/q^q}\right)$ \cite{FK,K86}.  This is still the best-known lower bound till now except for the case $q=3$  for which K\"{o}rner and Matron \cite{KM} found that the concatenation technique could lead to a perfect $3$-hash code beating this the probabilistic lower bound. The improvement on the lower bound on $R_3$ was discovered in 1988 and there has been no any progress on lower bound on $R_q$ for more than 30 years despite of some work on upper bounds on $R_q$.
 In this paper we show that this  probabilistic lower bound can be improved for $q=4,8$ and all odd integers between $3$ and $25$, and \emph{every sufficiently large odd} $q$. Our idea is based on a modified concatenation which is different from the classical concatenation for which both the inner and outer codes are separated. However, for our concatenation we do not require that the inner code is a perfect $q$-hash code. This gives  a more flexible choice of inner codes and hence we are able to beat the  probabilistic  existence lower bound on $R_q$.</summary>

The new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483</a> improved bounds for the sunflower lemma gives the most dramatic progress on the sunflower conjecture since it was asked. Congratulations to Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu, Jiapeng Zhang.</p>
<p>(Written on my smartphone will expand it when reconnected to my laptop.)  (Reconnected) Rather, I will write about it again in a few weeks. Let me mention now that while the old difficult and ingenious improvements stayed in the neighborhood of Erdos and Rado <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/09/28/extremal-combinatorics-iii-some-basic-theorems/">initial upper bound</a> the new result is in the neighborhood of the conjecture! (And is tight for a certain robust version of the problem!)</p>
<p>Let me also mention that we <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/?s=sunflower+conjecture">discussed</a> the sunflower conjecture here many times and polymath10 (<a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=The_Erdos-Rado_sunflower_lemma">wiki page</a>,  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/polymath10-the-erdos-rado-delta-system-conjecture">first post</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/01/17/polymath10-conclusion/">last post</a>) was devoted to the problem.)</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Let me mention an important progress on the sunflower conjecture from 2018 by Junichiro Fukuyama in his paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.10318">Improved Bound on Sets Including No Sunflower with Three Petals</a>. I missed Fukuyama’s paper at the time and I thank Sasha Kostochka and Andrew Thomason for telling me about it now.</p></div>

    <title>Serpentine belts</title>
    <summary>Many car engines use a serpentine belt, passing across multiple pulleys and tensioner wheels, to transmit mechanical power and timing information from the car’s crankshaft to its alternator, engine fan, water pump, air conditioning, steering pump, and other systems. Another (usually separate) belt, the timing belt, similarly connects the crankshaft to the camshaft, which controls and drives the timing of the engine’s valves. The Volvo bus engine below shows both of these belts:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many car engines use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpentine_belt">serpentine belt</a>, passing across multiple pulleys and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensioner">tensioner wheels</a>, to transmit mechanical power and timing information from the car’s crankshaft to its alternator, engine fan, water pump, air conditioning, steering pump, and other systems. Another (usually separate) belt, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_belt_(camshaft)">timing belt</a>, similarly connects the crankshaft to the camshaft, which controls and drives the timing of the engine’s valves.
The <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Belt_drive_systen_01.JPG">Volvo bus engine</a> below shows both of these belts:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Timing and serpentine belts of a Volvo bus engine; CC-BY-SA photo by Miya.m from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Belt_drive_systen_01.JPG" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/Volvo-bus-engine-belts.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" width="60%"/></p>

<p>But suppose you encounter such an engine with its belt removed. How can you tell where to run the belt to connect it all back together again? There may be many different orderings in which you can connect a given set of wheels by a belt. On a real engine (such as the one in a Ford Escort on which I loosely modeled the top image below), you might get a little more information from which of the wheels are ribbed (inside the belt) and which are smooth (outside the belt) but even that extra information won’t always give you a unique solution:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Two serpentine belts for the Ford Escort" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/escort.svg"/></p>

<p>Connecting wheels with belts like this is the topic of my latest preprint, “Existence and hardness of conveyor belts” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07668">arXiv:1908.07668</a>, with a large group of co-authors merging groups from the University of Washington and the Bellairs workshops). The name isn’t really accurate, because most conveyor belts have simpler geometry, but that’s what the question was called in past work. At least we managed to avoid the misspelling “conveyer” of some of that work.</p>

<p>To be tight, a belt for a system of disjoint disks (representing the pulleys and wheels) must be a smooth simple closed curve, made by connecting arcs of the disks with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_lines_to_circles#Tangent_lines_to_two_circles">bitangents</a> between pairs of disks. It was already known that some systems of disks have no belt, and conjectured that unit disks always have one. Our work shows that it’s -complete to tell whether a belt exists, that they do exist for certain special systems of disks (e.g. when no vertical line crosses multiple disks), and that by adding a linear number of extra disks one can always make a belt exist.</p>

<p>The question of how many different belts can connect the same system of disks (posed to me by co-author Sara Billey) was to a large extent the inspiration for <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/counting-polygon-triangulations.html">my earlier paper on counting triangulations</a>. If counting simple polygons through a set of points is hard, then so is counting belts for tiny disks. And when I couldn’t prove that counting simple polygons is hard, I turned to other problems for which the proof was easier.</p>

<p>As part of this project I wrote <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/drawbelts.py">a little Python program to draw systems of disks and their belts</a>, used for the image above and for some of the images in the paper. It doesn’t find which belts are possible itself; instead, you have to specify the belt by listing the disks that it touches in order (allowing repetitions although some of the versions of the problem that we studied do not) and specifying for each disk which direction it turns when the belt touches it (equivalently, whether it is inside or outside the belt). To use it, you’ll need my <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/">PADS Python library</a>, or at least <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/SVG.py">the package in it for generating SVG files</a>.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I uploaded to the arXive a new paper with the same title “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">The argument against quantum computers</a>“. The paper will appear in the volume: Quantum, Probability, Logic: Itamar Pitowsky’s Work and Influence, Springer, Nature (2019), edited by Meir Hemmo and Orly Shenker. A short abstract for the lecture and the paper is:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><strong><span style="color: #008080;">We give a computational complexity argument against the feasibility of quantum computers. We identify a very low complexity class of probability distributions described by noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, and explain why it will allow neither good-quality quantum error-correction nor a demonstration of “quantum supremacy.”  Some general principles governing the behavior of noisy quantum systems are derived.</span></strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The new paper and lecture have the same title as my 2018 <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/">interview</a> with Katia Moskvitch at Quanta Magazine (see also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/02/08/my-argument-against-quantum-computers-an-interview-with-katia-moskvitch-on-quanta-magazine/">this post</a>).  Note that Christopher Monroe has recently <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/#comment-4559220424">contributed a very interesting comment</a> to the Quanta article.

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">A slide from a lecture by Scott Aaronson where he explains why soap bubble computers cannot solve the NP-complete Steiner-tree problem.

Kathryn Farley is my dear wife. She and I are currently on a cruise through the Mediterranean. Our trip started in Barcelona and is stopping daily at various cities as we journey to Rome. “Tough duty,” but we are trying to enjoy it. </p>
<p>
Today I wish to talk about our visit to Monte Carlo.<br/>
<span id="more-16180"/></p>
<p>
Our ship, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Seabourn_Encore">Encore</a>, just docked there Sunday. The day was warm and clear, and we spent some time exploring the city. We did manage to avoid losing any money at the famous casino. Our secret was simple: do not play, do not gamble, do not lose.</p>
<p>
Over lunch I started to explain to Kathryn why Monte Carlo is an important city for complexity theorists. I felt a bit like we were at a theory shrine.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why Randomness Helps </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Indeed. I realized that it is not so simple to explain why randomness helps. Kathryn has a Ph.D in theatre. She is smart, is a member of Mensa, but is not a complexity theorist. How do I explain that randomness is powerful? Indeed.</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/randkinmontecarlo2.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16186" height="251" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/randkinmontecarlo2.png?w=300&amp;h=251" width="300"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
I started to explain, but my examples were lame. I think she got the main idea, but I also think that I did not do a great job. Russell Impagliazzo has a nice <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/6119/doesrandomnesshelp.pdf">explanation</a> on the role of randomness—I wish Russell had been there to help explain randomness to Kathryn. </p>
<p>
After lunch I started to think more about the role of randomness. I looked at our friends over at Wikipedia and discovered they had a pretty good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_randomness">page</a>. Some reasons are:</p>

<p>
Randomness was first investigated in the context of gambling. Dice, playing cards, roulette wheels, all have been studied by those interested in gambling. Clearly, betting on the roll of dice, deal of cards, or spin of the wheel, only makes sense when these actions are unpredictable. Random. </p>

Randomness is often used to create “fairness”. For example, in the US and UK, juror selection is done by a lottery. </p>

Random keys for encryption algorithms should be unpredictable. Random. Otherwise, they can be guessed by others. The password “password” is usually not allowed.</p>

<p>
Kathryn is interested in the arts: in plays and in painting and other fine arts. Some theories of art claim that all art is random. One thinks of artists like Jackson Pollock with his famous drip paintings. He was a major player in the abstract expressionist movement.</p>

<p/><h2> Pseudo or True? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken has been paying intensive devotions at the same shrine. As he wrote in the previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/predicting-chess-and-horses/">post</a>, he has been conducting millions of randomized tests of his new chess model. </p>
<p>
Why random? What he needs to do is show that his model will not tend to “cry wolf” by giving a too-high <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z}"/>-score to a set of games in a tournament by an honest player. He wants to show that his model is equally tempered no matter the rating of the player. So he runs trials at different rating levels ranging from Elo 1000 for novice players to Elo 2800 which is championship level. To show that the <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z}"/>-scores given by his model conform to a normal bell curve, he needs to do 10,000s or 100,000s of tests at each level. </p>
<p>
The problem is there just don’t exist enough games. Most large tournaments give only the games played on their “top boards” which use special auto-recording equipment, and the losers on those boards in one round may play on lower boards in the next round. Thus out of about 60,000 player-tournament pairs Ken can track each year, most are only partial samples. So what Ken does is generate “synthetic players” by randomly taking subsets of (say) 9 games—from his data set of 1,000 or so games for each level—and randomly choosing white or black for each game. This is a common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)#Subsampling">resampling</a> technique, and it uses Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>
Ken uses pseudo-random generators (PRGs). He starts a C++ library PRG on a seed <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/> based on the current time. The fact that the choices are deterministic once <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/> is given might allow him to reproduce an entire run exactly (after a model tweak) by preserving the <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/> it used. This is a paradox: we might want our “random” bits to be deterministic. Monte Carlo with predestined loaded dice.</p>
<p>
From time to time on this blog we have mused about what a world <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/08/23/a-world-without-randomness/">without</a> randomness or with <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/the-entropy-of-baseball/">reduced</a> entropy would be like. We were struck a few weeks ago when the noted physics blogger Sabine Hossenfelder wrote about “<a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/07/the-forgotten-solution-superdeterminism.html">superdeterminism</a>.” That post provoked a few hundred comments in her blog, as did her <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/08/the-problem-with-quantum-measurements.html">post</a> last week on the quantum measurement problem—including long exchanges with Peter Shor. Ken and I don’t know which side to take, but I can say that the side of a ship is a great place to think about possible real effects of these differences.</p>

<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12466">Equiangular lines with a fixed angle</a></h2>
<h3>by Zilin Jiang, Jonathan Tidor, Yuan Yao, Shengtong Zhang and Yufei Zhao.</h3>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12466">Paper </a>; <a href="https://yufeizhao.wordpress.com/2019/07/29/equiangular-lines-with-a-fixed-angle/">blog post</a> (end of July, 2019)</p>
<p>A collection of equiangular lines is a collection of lines so that the angles between every pair of lines in the same?</p>
<p>Here are two classical questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the maximum number of equiangular lines in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/>?</li>
<li>Given an angle <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha"/> what is the maximum number of equiangular lines in <img alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb R^d"/>? so that the angle between every two lines is <img alt="\alpha?" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha%3F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha?"/></li>
</ol>
<p>In 2000 Dom de Caen found for the first time an equiangular set of lines in <img alt="d" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d"/> space of size <img alt="cd^2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=cd%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="cd^2"/>. (The crucial observation that one of the graphs in the Cameron–Seidel association scheme has a certain eigenvalue of large multiplicity.  Prior to this construction, the largest sets had sizes of order <img alt="d^{3/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="d^{3/2}"/>.  In de Caen’s example the lines have angles approaching 90 degrees, and question 2 for a fixed value of <img alt="\alpha" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\alpha"/> led to very different bounds. (For another result by Dom, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2011/06/15/the-combinatorics-of-cocycles-and-borsuks-problem/">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>There were some important progress on this problem by Igor Balla, Felix Dräxler, Peter Keevash, and Benny Sudakov, as featured in this  <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-path-to-equal-angle-lines-20170411/">Quanta Magazine article</a> written by Kevin Hartnett. Zilin, Jonathan, Yuan, Shengtong, and Yufei  finished off the problem in a clean and crisp manner, in a 10-page paper with a self-contained proof. On the way they proved the following very interesting theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> A bounded degree graph must have sublinear second eigenvalue multiplicity.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10482">Paper</a>, <a href="https://yufeizhao.wordpress.com/2019/06/27/impartial-digraphs/">blog post</a> (end of June 2019)</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We prove a conjecture of Fox, Huang, and Lee that characterizes directed graphs <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/> that have constant density in all tournaments: they are disjoint unions of trees that are each constructed in a certain recursive way.</p>
<p>“Constant density in all tournaments” means that for some <img alt="n_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n_0"/> (and hence for all <img alt="n \ge n_0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Cge+n_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n \ge n_0"/>, every tournament with <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="n"/> vertices has the same number of copies of <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/>. (On the nose!)</p>
<p>This result is related to the famous Sidorenko’s conjecture. Let me copy its description from the paper:</p>
<p>For undirected graphs, conjectures of Sidorenko and Erdős–Simonovits (commonly referred to as Sidorenko’s conjecture) say that for every bipartite graph <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/>, the <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/>-density in a graph of fixed density is minimized asymptotically by a random graph. Lately the conjecture has been proved for many families of <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H"/> though the conjecture remains open in general. In particular, the case <img alt="H = K_{5,5}\backslash C_{10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%3D+K_%7B5%2C5%7D%5Cbackslash+C_%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="H = K_{5,5}\backslash C_{10}"/> is open.</p>

<h2>More</h2>
<p>Let me describe briefly three additional posts on Yufei’s blog with two results from 2018 and one result from 2014.</p>
<h3>Ashwin Sah, Mehtaab Sawhney, David Stoner, and Yufei Zhao  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09462">A reverse Sidorenko inequality</a>; (<a href="https://yufeizhao.wordpress.com/2018/09/25/a-reverse-sidorenko-inequality/">blog post</a>) ; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04021">The number of independent sets in an irregular graph</a>; <a href="https://yufeizhao.wordpress.com/2018/05/12/the-number-of-independent-sets-in-an-irregular-graph/">blog post</a>.</h3>
<p>These are two remarkable papers by the same team of researchers. The paper  on the number of independent sets in a regular graph settled a famous 2001 conjecture by Jeff Kahn. An earlier breakthrough on the problem was made by Zhao in 2009 when he was an undergraduate student.</p>
<h3><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/eyal/">Eyal Lubetzky</a> and Yufei Zhao,  <em><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6011">On the variational problem for upper tails of triangle counts in sparse random graphs</a></em>. <a href="https://yufeizhao.wordpress.com/2014/02/25/upper-tail/">Blog post</a>.</h3>
<p>Recently  I wrote a post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/07/23/matan-harel-frank-mousset-and-wojciech-samotij-and-the-the-infamous-upper-tail-problem/" rel="bookmark">Matan Harel, Frank Mousset, and Wojciech Samotij and the “the infamous upper tail” problem</a> describing a major breakthrough on the infamous upper tail problem. Over the years I heard a lot of lectures and private explanation on upper tails and the remarkable related mathematics. I remember lectures by Kim and Vu from the early 2000’s and by Varadhan from ICM 2010 describing (among other things) the fundamental paper by  <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2825532">Chatterjee and Varadhan</a>,  and later works by  <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2925307">DeMarco and Kahn, </a> and by  <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3495">Chatterjee and Dembo</a>  and Lubetzky and Zhao and others. But when I wrote the post I realized my knowledge is too sparse for giving a thorough description, and I decided not to wait and write a short post. This post by Yufei describes some of the history very nicely as well as the major papers by Eyal and Yufei from 2012 and 2014.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-107 |  The Power of a Single Qubit: Two-way Quantum/Classical Finite Automata and the Word Problem for Linear Groups | 

	Zachary Remscrim</title>
    <summary>The two-way quantum/classical finite automaton (2QCFA), defined by Ambainis and Watrous, is a model of quantum computation whose quantum part is extremely limited; however, as they showed, 2QCFA are surprisingly powerful: a 2QCFA, with a single qubit, can recognize, with one-sided bounded-error, the language $L_{eq}=\{a^m b^m |m \in \mathbb{N}\}$ in expected polynomial time and the language $L_{pal}=\{w \in \{a,b\}^*|w \text{ is a palindrome}\}$ in expected exponential time.  

We further demonstrate the power of 2QCFA by showing that they can recognize the word problems of a broad class of groups. In particular, we first restrict our attention to 2QCFA that: $(1)$ have a single qubit, $(2)$ recognize their language with one-sided bounded-error, and $(3)$ have transition amplitudes which are algebraic numbers. We show that such 2QCFA can recognize the word problem of any finitely-generated virtually abelian group in expected polynomial time, as well as the word problem of a large class of linear groups in expected exponential time. This latter class includes all groups whose word problem is a context-free language as well as all groups whose word problem is known to be the intersection of finitely many context-free languages. As a corollary, we obtain a direct improvement on the original Ambainis and Watrous result by showing that $L_{eq}$ can be recognized by a 2QCFA with better parameters. 

We also consider those word problems which a 2QCFA can recognize with one-sided unbounded-error, and show that this class includes the word problem of more exotic groups such as the free product of any finite collection of finitely-generated free abelian groups. As a corollary of this result, we demonstrate that a new class of group word problems are co-stochastic languages. Lastly, we exhibit analogous results for 2QCFA with any finite number of qubits or with more general transition amplitudes, as well as results for other classic QFA models.</summary>

    <title>TR19-106 |  Semialgebraic Proofs and Efficient Algorithm Design | 

	Noah Fleming, 

	Pravesh Kothari, 

	Toniann Pitassi</title>
    <summary>Over the last twenty years, an exciting interplay has emerged between proof systems and algorithms. Some natural families of algorithms can be viewed as a generic translation from a proof that a solution exists into an algorithm for finding the solution itself. This connection has perhaps been the most consequential in the context of semi-algebraic proof systems and basic primitives in algorithm design such as linear and semidefinite programming. The proof system perspective, in this context, has provided fundamentally new tools for both algorithm design and analysis. These news tools have helped in both designing better algorithms for well-studied problems and proving tight lower bounds on such techniques.

This monograph is aimed at expositing this interplay between proof systems and efficient algorithm design and surveying the state-of-the-art for two of the most important semi-algebraic proof systems: Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares.

We rigorously develop and survey the state-of-the-art for Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares both as proof systems, as well as a general family of optimization algorithms, stressing that  these perspectives are formal duals to one-another. Our treatment relies on interpreting the outputs of the Sum-of-Squares and Sherali-Adams algorithms as generalized expectation functions -- a viewpoint that has been essential in obtaining both algorithmic results and lower bounds. The emphasis is on illustrating the main ideas by presenting a small fraction of representative results with detailed intuition and commentary. The monograph is self-contained and includes a review of the necessary mathematical background including basic theory of linear and semi-definite programming.</summary>

    <summary>A few weeks ago I read Malcolm Gladwell’s book The Tipping Point. The book doesn’t really deal with mathematics, but it does contain one math-related anecdote. This anecdote demonstrates an interesting principle of learning mathematics, so I wanted to share it. Problem 1. We have a deck of cards, such that each card contains a […]</summary>

    <summary>Given an abstract optimization problem with multiple solutions, how much partial information about a solution do you have to know in order to uniquely identify that solution? That has been the topic of some of my earlier research, on how many creases of an origami folding pattern you have to force to be mountain or valley folds in order to cause the remaining folds to go the way you want.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Given an abstract optimization problem with multiple solutions, how much partial information about a solution do you have to know in order to uniquely identify that solution? That has been the topic of some of my earlier research, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2014/10/08/forced-creases-in.html">how many creases of an origami folding pattern you have to force to be mountain or valley folds in order to cause the remaining folds to go the way you want</a>. And it’s the topic of my new preprint “Tracking paths in planar graphs” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05445">arXiv:1908.05445</a>, with Mike Goodrich, James Liu, and Pedro Matias).</p>

<p>There’s an old story about how to design the footpaths on a college campus: wait for it to snow, see where the heaviest sets of footprints cross the snow from building to building, and then once the snow melts place paths in those same places. But what if you live somewhere like Irvine where it never snows? Or what if you want to perform some other type of data analysis on a data set of the paths that people take? For instance, in order to design improvements to the road networks used by commuter traffic, it would be helpful to figure out where all the traffic actually goes each day. How can you collect that data?</p>

<p>Our paper takes the point of view that you can attach sensors to the network that record the times and identities of people passing by them, but that these sensors are expensive. The goal is (for a given network with designated start and destination vertices  and ) to place as few of these sensors as possible at graph vertices, in such a way that every simple -path is uniquely identified by the sequence of sensors that it passes through.</p>

<p>The problem turns out to be -complete, even on planar networks. But there’s a simple approximation ratio based on the idea that the optimal number of sensors is always going to be proportional to the number of faces in the network. Each face (in the sequence of biconnected components between  and ) has to have at least one sensor, to distinguish paths that go one way around the face from paths that go the other way around. It turns out that placing one sensor at a vertex shared by many faces doesn’t work — those faces still need a proportional number of additional sensors. And our approximation algorithm ensures that the number of sensors is at most proportional to the number of faces.</p>

<p>We also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courcelle%27s_theorem">Courcelle’s theorem</a> to prove that the exact solution is fixed-parameter tractable in the clique-width of the graph. Like most or all uses of Courcelle’s theorem, the resulting algorithm is impractical, so it would be of interest to find a more direct algorithm, perhaps for a weaker parameter.</p>

    <title>TR19-105 |  A note on the relation between XOR and Selective XOR Lemmas | 

	Ragesh Jaiswal</title>
    <summary>Given an unpredictable Boolean function $f: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$, the standard Yao's XOR lemma is a statement about the unpredictability of computing $\oplus_{i \in [k]}f(x_i)$ given $x_1, ..., x_k \in \{0, 1\}^n$, whereas the Selective XOR lemma is a statement about the unpredictability of computing $\oplus_{i \in S}f(x_i)$ given $x_1, ..., x_k \in \{0, 1\}^n$ and $S \subseteq \{1, ..., k\}$. We give a reduction from the Selective XOR lemma to the standard XOR lemma. Our reduction gives better quantitative bounds for certain choice of parameters and does not require the assumption of being able to sample $(x, f(x))$ pairs.</summary>

Patrice Miller and Jeff Seder look under the hide of horses. Their company <a href="https://www.eqb.com/">EQB</a> does predictive modeling for horse racing based on biometric data. They are famous for having <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/sports/american-pharoah-cant-erase-all-of-ahmed-zayats-missteps.html">advised</a> the owner of American Pharoah not to sell because the horse had a powerful heart. In 2015, American Pharoah became the first Triple Crown winner since the also-hearty Secretariat in 1978.</p>
<p>
Today I am happy to announce an extended version of my predictive model for chess and discuss how it gains accuracy by looking under the hood of chess positions.<br/>
<span id="more-16160"/></p>
<p>
I had thought to credit Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace for being the first to envision computational predictive modeling, but the evidence connected to her design of betting schemes for horse racing is scant and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1998-99/babbage/bio.htm">secondhand</a> <a href="https://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace/">accounts</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RUDdYIL5TG0C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=charles+babbage+horse+races&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VxqMznLIj0&amp;sig=ACfU3U0d6jICkDy2sSZ0MVlPyLQT_rGj6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5iNLB_ITkAhUB2VkKHYMyAoA4ChDoATAEegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=charles babbage horse races&amp;f=false">differ</a>. It is known that Babbage compiled voluminous data on the medical fitness and diet of animals, including heart function by taking their pulse. We have discussed their computing work <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/its-ada-lovelace-day/">here</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/ada-the-amplifier/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
I will use horse racing as a device for explaining the main new ingredient of my model. It sharpens the prediction of moves—and the results of cheating tests—by using deeper information to “beat the bookie” as Lovelace tried to do. I have described the basic form of my model—and previous efforts to extend it—in <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/london-calling/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/depth-of-satisficing/">previous</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/unskewing-the-election/">posts</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/05/23/stopped-watches-and-data-analytics/">on</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/when-is-a-law-natural/">this</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/littlewoods-law/">blog</a>. Last month, besides being involved in <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/sport/sonst/schach-wie-der-weltverband-betrueger-erwischt-a-1277439.html">several</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/chess-grandmaster-caught-using-phone-inside-bathroom-during-a-tournament">media</a> <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/igors-rausis-58-under-investigation-of-cheating">stories</a> involving a grandmaster caught in the act of cheating in France, I was invited to discuss this work by Ben Johnson for his “Perpetual Chess” <a href="https://www.perpetualchesspod.com/new-blog/2019/7/23/episode-136-im-kenneth-regan">podcast</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Betting the Favorite </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My chess model does the same thing to a chess position—given information about the skill set of the player deciding on a move—that a bookie does to a horse race. It sets odds on each legal move <img alt="{m_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_i}"/> to “win” by being played in the game. The probabilities <img alt="{p_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_i}"/> need to be accurate for the same reason bookmakers need their “initial betting lines” to be close to how bets will ultimately balance, so they can preserve their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigorish">margin</a>. A horse with highest <img alt="{p_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_i}"/>—perhaps a tie—is the bookie’s <em>favorite</em>. The favorite might be “odds-on,” meaning <img alt="{p_i \gg 0.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_i+%5Cgg+0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_i \gg 0.5}"/>, or might be a “narrow favorite” among several horses with near-equal chances.</p>
<p>
Suppose you don’t care how much money you might win but just want to maximize your chance of being right—of winning something. Unless you have reason to doubt the bookie, you should bet on the favorite. That is what my basic chess model does. Whichever move is given the highest value by the computer at the end of its search is declared the favorite, regardless of the player’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating</a> or other skill factors. </p>
<p>
That the best move—we’ll label it <img alt="{m_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_1}"/>—should <em>always</em> be most likely even for the weakest players runs counter to sense. Aren’t weaker players weaker because they prefer weaker moves? When the right move is obvious, say a forced recapture or a checkmate in one, of course we expect any player to find it. But when <img alt="{m_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_1}"/> is subtle, what then? </p>
<p/><p><br/>
My basic model still makes it the favorite. This doesn’t mean its probability <img alt="{p_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_1}"/> is greater than half. My model might make <img alt="{p_1 \gg 0.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1+%5Cgg+0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_1 \gg 0.5}"/> for world champion level players but only, say, <img alt="{p_1 = 0.25}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1+%3D+0.25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_1 = 0.25}"/> for beginning players. Thus it will still say the beginner is 75% likely to play an inferior move. What my base model shies away from is saying any other particular move—any other horse—is more likely to win than <img alt="{m_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_1}"/>. As the rating gets lower it bunches up the probabilities so that while <img alt="{p_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_1}"/> is lower, no other probability passes it.</p>
<p>
This is borne out in practice. The lowest Elo rating used by the World Chess Federation (FIDE) is 1000. Let’s take ratings between that and 1200 (which used to be the lowest rating) as denoting the novice class. Consider only those positions that have many reasonable choices—say at least ten moves valued within 0.25 (figuratively, a quarter of a pawn) of optimal. My main training set has 6.082 such positions in games between evenly-matched players of this level. Here are the frequencies of their playing the best through the tenth-best move in such <em>many-choice positions</em>:</p>

<p>
Both my basic model and the new one, when fitted over the entire training set for this class but then restricted to the many-choices subset, give projections close to these actual values. The basic model, always betting the favorite, is right on under 18% of its projections. Can we do better? That is, can we “beat the bookie” at chess? </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Predicting Inferior Moves </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
It is almost four years since the idea for improving predictions was <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/depth-of-satisficing/">described</a> on this blog. In place of “weaker players prefer weaker moves,” it advanced a hypothesis that we can state as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Weaker players are more likely to be diverted by shiny objects. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Most in particular, they will fall for moves that look attractive early on, but which are revealed (by the computer) to be inferior after deeper consideration. The computer programs output values for each depth of search, and when these moves’ values are graphed against the depth, they start high but “swing down” at higher depths. Weaker players are more likely to be satisfied by the early flash and not think deeper. The old <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/10/06/depth-of-satisficing/">post</a> has a great example of such a move from the pivotal game in the 2008 world championship match, where Viswanathan Anand set a deep trap that caught the previous world champion, Vladimir Kramnik. </p>
<p>
The flip side are moves that look poor at low depths but whose high value emerges at high depths. My basic model, which uses only the final values of moves, gives too high a projection on these cases, and too low a likelihood of falling into traps. I have figured that these two kinds of ‘misses’ offset over a few dozen positions. Moreover, in both kinds of misses, the player is given express benefit of doubt by the projections. It is edgier, after all, to project that a player is more likely to fall into a trap than to find the safest and best move.</p>
<p>
The effect of lower-depth values is still too powerful to ignore in identifiable cases. Including them, however, makes the whole model edgier, as I have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/11/08/unskewing-the-election/">described</a> here <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/05/23/stopped-watches-and-data-analytics/">before</a>. Simply put, the lower-depth values are subject to more noise, from which we are trying to extract greater information. It has been like trying to catch lightning—or <a href="https://www.pppl.gov/news/2019/08/improving-magnetic-bottle-controls-fusion-power-earth">fusion</a>—in a bottle.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Modest But Effective Success </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
My new model implements the “swing” feature without adding any more free parameters for fitting. It has new parameters but those are set “by hand” after an initial fitting of the free parameters under the “sliding-scale” regime I <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/sliding-scale-problems/">described</a> last September, which is followed by a second round of re-fitting. It required heavy clamps on the weighting of lower-depth values and more-intense conditioning of inputs overall. It required a solution to the “firewall at zero” <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/01/21/a-chess-firewall-at-zero/">phenomenon</a> that was the exact opposite of what I’d envisioned.</p>
<p>
After all this, here is what it delivers in the above case—and quite generally:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It improves the prediction success rate—for the weakest players in the most difficult kind of positions to forecast—from 17.76% to <b>20.04%</b>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
For the elite class—2600 to 2800—in the same kind of many-choice positions, the new model does even better. Much more data on elite players is available, so I have 49,793 such positions faced by them: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Whereas elite players found the best move in 30.85% of these difficult positions, my new model finds <b>their</b> move in <b>34.64%</b> of them. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Over all positions, the average <em>prediction gain</em> ranges from about 1 percentage point for the lowest players to over 2% for masters. These gains may not sound like much, but for cheating tests they give prime value. The reasons are twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The gained predictions are all <em>against</em> their finding the computer’s move, so the act of finding the best move is more exposed. <p/>
</li><li>
The standard deviation is typically 3–5 percentage points depending on the volume of moves. Thus the prediction gain can enhance the measured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score">z-score</a> by upwards of 0.5 or more.
</li></ul>
<p>
Initial applications in recent cases seem to prove this out more often than not. Of course, the larger purpose is to have a better model of human chess play overall.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Cross-Checks and Caveats </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
In recent years, several new dimensions of quality and safety with predictive models have emerged. They supplement the two classic ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Avoiding false positives.</em> In particular, over a natural population (such as the mass of honest players), the rate of outlier scores generated by the model must stay within the bounds of natural frequency for the population. Call this “natural safety.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Avoiding false negatives</em>. The model should provide enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(statistics)">statistical power</a> to flag unnatural outliers without becoming unsafe.
</li></ul>
<p>
I vetted my model’s natural safety by processing tens of millions of generated z-scores under resampling after my final design tweaks earlier this month. This was over a link between departmental machines and UB’s Center for Computational Research (<a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html">CCR</a>) where my data is generated. The previous discussion has all been about greater power. The first new factor updates the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibration_(statistics)#In_prediction_and_forecasting">calibration</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Non-bias and fairness.</em> More general than the societal context, which we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/11/20/a-magic-madison-visit/">here</a>, this means avoiding bias along functional lines that the model is not intended to distinguish.
</li></ul>
<p>
I have a suite of cross-checking measures besides those tests that are expressly fitted to be unbiased estimators. They include checking how my model performs on various different types of positions, such as those with many choices as above, or the opposite: those having one standout move. For example, the model’s best-move projection in the many-choice positions by elite players, using the general settings for 2700 rating, is 31.07%. That’s within 0.28%. Another check is figuratively how much “probability money” my model wagered to get its 34.64% hit rate. The sum of <img alt="{p_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_i}"/> it projected on its own most-likely moves, in the 68.4% of the many-choice positions where it agreed with the computer’s favorite plus 31.6% where it did not, was 35.00%. If I fit all 282,060 positions by these players, rather than use “2700,” and then re-select the subset, the model comes within <b>0.01%</b> on the first-move projection and <b>0.11%</b> on its own betting forecasts. I will say more about the cross-checks, use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">prediction</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)">scoring</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule">metrics</a>, and conformance to normal distribution at a later time. The relevant point is to ask:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How well does your model perform on pertinent tests besides those it was expressly trained for? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Beyond fairness, good <em>wide-range</em> calibration alleviates dangers of “mission creep.” </p>
<p>
The second newer factor is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning">Adversarial</a> performance.</em> This is apart from “natural safety.” Simply put: how resistant is the model to being deceived? Can it be gamed?
</li></ul>
<p>
My impressions over the long haul of this work is that the new model’s more-powerful heart inevitably brings greater “springiness.” By dint of its being more sensitive to moves whose high value emerges only after deep search, it is possible to create shorter sequences of such moves that make it jump to conclusions. The z-score vetting turned up a few games that were agreed drawn after some “book” moves—openings known by heart to many professional players—whose entirety the model would flag, except for the standard procedure of identifying and removing book moves from cheating tests. These outliers came from over a hundred thousand games between evenly-matched players, so they still conformed to the natural rate, but one can be concerned about the “unnatural rate.” On the flip side, I believe my more-intensive conditioning of values has made the model more robust against being gamed by cheaters playing a few inferior moves to cover their tracks. </p>
<p>
In general, and especially with nonlinear models, the caveat is that amplifying statistical power brings greater susceptibility to adversarial conditions. Trying to “beat the bookie” requires more model introspection. My model retains its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainability</a> and ability to provide audits for its determinations. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What lessons from similar situations with other predictive models can be identified and brought to bear on this one?</p>
<p>
<b>Update 8/24:</b> Here is a timely <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/chess/computer/ModelTradeoffs.png">example</a> of the tradeoff between amplifying the prediction accuracy and the overall stability of the model.</p></font></font></div>

Brendan Lucier and Csaba Szepesvári were consecutive speakers at this week’s <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/AutoAlg2019/">workshop</a> at the Toyota Technological Institute in Chicago on “Automated Algorithm Design.”</p>
<p>
Today I will discuss their talks, which I enjoyed greatly at the workshop.<br/>
<span id="more-16151"/></p>
<p>
The workshop’s general theme was the use of machine-learning techniques to improve the tuning of algorithms. Indeed, the goal is to have the algorithm tune itself by selecting strategies from a collection of possible ones. Besides better performance with less human work, this promises better logical reliability than with hand-tuning programs and debugging. </p>
<p>
A common component of this work used in both talks is an interesting oracle model. Since oracles are familiar to many of us theorists this will give us an avenue into the talks and the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0dce/10ed863423e2e9b1b77a0becfc23111578be.pdf">two</a> recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00755.pdf">papers</a> they were based on.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Runtime Oracles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The oracle has a nonnegative matrix <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> of shape <img alt="{n \times M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \times M}"/>. Think of the entry <img alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(i,j)}"/> as the <i>runtime</i> of the <img alt="{i^{th}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%5E%7Bth%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i^{th}}"/> program on the <img alt="{j^{th}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%5E%7Bth%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j^{th}}"/> input. You know <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> and <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>, but must ask the oracle for information about <img alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(i,j)}"/>. You may ask the oracle a question <img alt="{(i,j,t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(i,j,t)}"/>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is the entry <img alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(i,j)}"/> less than or equal to <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Here <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> is a time bound. Further they assume that the oracle charges you 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \min(R(i,j),t). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmin%28R%28i%2Cj%29%2Ct%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \min(R(i,j),t). "/></p>
<p>Thus an algorithm is charged in total 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{t} \min(R(i,j),t), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+%5Cmin%28R%28i%2Cj%29%2Ct%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{t} \min(R(i,j),t), "/></p>
<p>where the sum is over all questions <img alt="{(i,j,t)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(i,j,t)}"/> you asked. 	 The rationale is that the oracle can run a program <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> on a task <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j}"/> and stop after at most <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> steps. Thus returning the minimum is realistic. Since their research is motivated by practical problems, this is a useful model for studying questions about program performance. </p>
<p>
In passing I believe the reason this oracle model is new is that theorists do not often think about running arbitrary programs. Well those in recursion type did, but those designing classic algorithms do not. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Selection Problem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This model to used to study a selection problem. Assume <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> is as above. The task is to find the row with the smallest row sum <img alt="{s_{i}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_{i}}"/>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  s_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{M} R(i,j). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++s_%7Bi%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7BM%7D+R%28i%2Cj%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  s_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{M} R(i,j). "/></p>
<p>That is to find the program that takes the least total time on the inputs—hence the least average time.</p>
<p>
The trouble is that in the worst case this can require examining all the entries. So they introduce approximations to make the problem doable, but still useful in practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The rows need only be a <img alt="{(1+\epsilon)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(1+\epsilon)}"/> approximation to the smallest row. <p/>
</li><li>
The entries can be assumed to be truncated by a value <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\tau}"/>. That is you can assume that 	<p/>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  R(i,j) \le \tau. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++R%28i%2Cj%29+%5Cle+%5Ctau.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  R(i,j) \le \tau. "/></p>
</li><li>
The governing algorithm can be randomized and need only meet the performance goal with high probability.
</li></ol>

Now we can state the problem formally. It is parameterized by <img alt="{(\epsilon, \tau)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cepsilon%2C+%5Ctau%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\epsilon, \tau)}"/>:</p>

<p>The talks gave a variety of randomized algorithms that solve such problems for various parameter assumptions. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Fast and Slow </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
See their papers for details on the results. The algorithms they have are interesting not only from a theory viewpoint but also in practice. Indeed, they not only prove theorems but also give experimental timings.</p>
<p>
In order to establish some intuition, let’s look at the following simple case. Assume that all entries <img alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(i,j)}"/> are either <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> or some <img alt="{\alpha \gg 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha \gg 1}"/>. This is the “fast-or-slow” running time stipulation. As theorists we often are drawn to binary values, so this might be a good case to look at initially.</p>
<p>
The first observation is that we will always ask questions of the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (i, j, 1.0001). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28i%2C+j%2C+1.0001%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (i, j, 1.0001). "/></p>
<p>This gives us the value of the entry <img alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(i,j)}"/> for almost unit cost: if it is the <img alt="{R(i,j) \gg 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29+%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R(i,j) \gg 1}"/> case then we are only charged <img alt="{1.0001}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.0001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1.0001}"/>. Thus, we have reduced the original problem to a classic oracle problem. There is no complicated oracle cost measure: the cost is just the number of entries we read. Well okay the cost is slightly higher, but we can make it as close as we wish.</p>
<p>
The selection problem then comes down to this: </p>
<ul>
<li>
We have a <img alt="{n \times M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n \times M}"/> nonnegative matrix <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{R}"/> whose entries are all either <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> or <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha}"/>. <p/>
</li><li>
We must find a row sum that is within a factor of <img alt="{1+\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+\epsilon}"/> of the smallest.
</li></ul>
<p>
I believe that the analysis of this problem should be generally known. In any event it seems clear that randomly sampling each row is a good start.</p>
<p>

Are there other natural problems where the runtime cost oracle is useful?</p>

    <title>TR19-104 |  Reconstruction of Depth-$4$ Multilinear Circuits | 

	Vishwas Bhargava, 

	Shubhangi Saraf, 

	Ilya Volkovich</title>
    <summary>We present a deterministic algorithm for reconstructing multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuits, i.e. multilinear depth-$4$ circuits with fan-in $k$ at the top $+$ gate. For any fixed $k$, given black-box access to a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}]$ computable by a multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuit of size $s$, the algorithm runs in time quasi-poly($n,s,{|\mathbb{F}|}$) and outputs a multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuit of size quasi-poly($n,s$) that computes $f$. 

Our result solves an open problem posed in \cite{GKL12} (STOC, 2012). Indeed, prior to our work, efficient reconstruction algorithms for multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuits were known only for the case of $k=2$ \cite{GKL12, Volkovich17}.</summary>
