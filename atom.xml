    <title>TR21-108 |  Limitations of the Impagliazzo--Nisan--Wigderson Pseudorandom Generator against Permutation Branching Programs | 

	Edward Pyne, 

	Salil Vadhan</title>
    <summary>The classic Impagliazzo--Nisan--Wigderson (INW) psesudorandom generator (PRG) (STOC `94) for space-bounded computation uses a seed of length $O(\log n \cdot \log(nwd/\varepsilon))$ to fool ordered branching programs of length $n$, width $w$, and alphabet size $d$ to within error $\varepsilon$. A series of works have shown that the analysis of the INW generator can be improved for the class of $\textit{permutation}$ branching programs or the more general $\textit{regular}$ branching programs, improving the $O(\log^2 n)$ dependence on the length $n$ to $O(\log n)$ or $\tilde{O}(\log n)$.  However, when also considering the dependence on the other parameters, these analyses still fall short of the optimal PRG seed length $O(\log(nwd/\varepsilon))$.
    
    In this paper, we prove that any ``spectral analysis'' of the INW generator requires seed length $$\Omega\left(\log n\cdot \log\log(\min\{n,d\})+\log n\cdot \log(w/\varepsilon)+\log d\right)$$ to fool ordered permutation branching programs of length $n$, width $w$, and alphabet size $d$ to within error $\varepsilon$.  By ``spectral analysis'' we mean an analysis of the INW generator that relies only on the spectral expansion of the graphs used to construct the generator; this encompasses all prior analyses of the INW generator.  Our lower bound matches the upper bound of Braverman--Rao--Raz--Yehudayoff (FOCS 2010, SICOMP 2014) for regular branching programs of alphabet size $d=2$ except for a gap between their $O(\log n \cdot \log\log n)$ term and our $O(\log n \cdot \log\log \min\{n,d\})$ term.  It also matches the upper bounds of Koucky--Nimbhorkar--Pudlak (STOC 2011), De (CCC 2011), and Steinke (ECCC 2012) for constant-width ($w=O(1)$) permutation branching programs of alphabet size $d=2$ to within a constant factor.  
    
    To fool permutation branching programs in the stronger measure of $\textit{spectral norm}$, we prove that any spectral analysis of the INW generator requires a seed of length $\Omega(\log n\cdot \log\log n+\log n\cdot\log(1/\varepsilon)+\log d)$ when the width is at least polynomial in $n$ ($w=n^{\Omega(1)}$), matching the recent upper bound of Hoza--Pyne--Vadhan (ITCS `21) to within a constant factor.</summary>

    <title>TR21-107 |  Classification of OBDD size for monotone 2-CNFs | 

	igor razgon</title>
    <summary>We introduce a new graph parameter called linear upper maximum induced
matching width \textsc{lu-mim width}, denoted for a graph $G$ by $lu(G)$.
We prove that the smallest size of the \textsc{obdd} for $\varphi$,
the monotone 2-\textsc{cnf} corresponding to $G$, is sandwiched 
between $2^{lu(G)}$ and $n^{O(lu(G))}$. 
The upper bound is based on a combinatorial statement that might 
be of an independent interest.
We show that the bounds in terms of this parameter are best possible.

The new parameter is closely related to two existing parameters:
linear maximum induced matching width (\textsc{lmim width}) and linear symmetric induced matching width 
(\textsc{lsim width}). We prove that \textsc{lu-mim width} lies strictly in between these two
parameters, being dominated by \textsc{lsim width} and dominating \textsc{lmim width}.
We conclude that neither of the two existing parameters can be used instead of \textsc{lu-mim width}
to characterize the size of \textsc{obdd}s for monotone $2$-\textsc{cnf}s and this justifies introduction
of the new parameter.</summary>

    <title>TR21-106 |  The Space Complexity of Sampling | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jesse Goodman, 

	David Zuckerman</title>
    <summary>Recently, there has been exciting progress in understanding the complexity of distributions. Here, the goal is to quantify the resources required to generate (or sample) a distribution. Proving lower bounds in this new setting is more challenging than in the classical setting, and has yielded interesting new techniques and surprising applications. In this work, we initiate a study of the complexity of sampling with limited memory, and prove small-space analogs of several results previously known only for sampling in AC$^0$.

1. We exhibit an explicit boolean function $b:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ that cannot be computed by width $2^{\Omega(n)}$ read-once branching programs (ROBPs), even on average, but such that $(\mathbf{U}_n,b(\mathbf{U}_n))$ can be exactly sampled by ROBPs of width $O(n)$.

2. We exhibit an explicit boolean function $b:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ such that any distribution sampled by an ROBP of width $2^{\Omega(n)}$ has statistical distance $\frac{1}{2}-2^{-\Omega(n)}$ from $(\mathbf{U}_n,b(\mathbf{U}_n))$. We show that any such $b$ witnesses exponentially small correlation bounds against ROBPs, and we extend these results to hold for the unknown-order setting.

3. We show that any distribution sampled by an ROBP of width $2^{\Omega(n)}$ has statistical distance $1-2^{-\Omega(n)}$ from any distribution that is uniform over a good code. More generally, we obtain sampling lower bounds for any list decodable code, which are nearly tight. Using a known connection, we also obtain data structure lower bounds for storing codewords.

Along the way, we prove a direct product theorem and several equivalence theorems. These tools offer a generic method to construct distributions with strong sampling lower bounds, and translate these lower bounds into correlation bounds against ROBPs. As an application of our direct product theorem, we show a strong complexity separation between sampling with AC$^0$ circuits and sampling with ROBPs.</summary>

<p>
Andrey Bulatov, Martin Dyer and David Richerby, and Jin-Yi Cai and Xi Chen are the authors of three papers awarded the 2021 Gödel Prize. The citations by the <a href="https://sigact.org/prizes/g&#xF6;del/citation2021.html">ACM</a> and <a href="https://eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2885-2021-05-07-21-20-13">EATCS</a> say clearly that the papers not the people win the prize, but our “blog invariant” is to show photos of people at the top, so there they are.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate the people—not the papers—and tell some of the technical story behind this richly deserved award.</p>
<p>
Dick and I have intended to write about this since the prize was announced in early May. Travel and personal events have slowed the blog, plus in my case, June was by far the most pressing month of the “chess cheating pandemic” since chess moved online, and that carried into July. The award to our friend Jin-Yi—who has been a faculty colleague of both of us—is the “something else about UW Madison on our mind” that was mentioned in the June 20 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/">post</a>, during which chess cases arrived in real time. I am thankful that this month, to judge by the weekly roundups of games by <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/">ChessBase</a> and <a href="https://theweekinchess.com/">The Week in Chess</a>, most major tournaments are back to being played in-person—where the yearly volume of cases coming to my attention has been on either side of ten, rather than in middle triple digits.</p>
<p>
That the papers win the award calls something else to mind: We can no longer point to an “original manuscript” with papers being electronic. Perhaps the continued rise of <em>non-fungible tokens</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a>) will restore this distinction. Tim Berners-Lee recently <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/tim-berners-lee-nft-auction/index.html">created</a> and auctioned off an NFT of his original code for the World Wide Web. This may be done to prize-winning papers in the future. Then the prize money could create an inherent base value, such as we discussed for “semi-fungible tokens” at the end of this <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/01/computer-science-gets-noted/">post</a>, so that the prize really would go to the papers. </p>

</p><p/><h2> The Beginning of Dichotomy </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The term “dichotomy” in complexity theory first became prominent with Thomas Schaefer’s 1978 <a href="http://aleteya.cs.buap.mx/~jlavalle/papers/complexity/p216-schaefer.pdf">paper</a> about <img alt="{\mathrm{SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BSAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-like problems. For a large and natural class <img alt="{\mathcal{S}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of such problems, he proved that either the problem is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete like <img alt="{\mathrm{SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BSAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> itself or it is in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—never <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">intermediate</a> between them. The famous 1975 <a href="https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/2272652">theorem</a> of Richard Ladner showed that if <img alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then plenty of intermediate languages exist, but no problem in <img alt="{\mathcal{S}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be among them. That is the dichotomy: everything in <img alt="{\mathcal{S}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is either easy or maximally hard. A similar project was taken up for <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by Nadia Creignou and Nicolas (Miki) Hermann in a 1996 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540196900164">paper</a> showing that every <img alt="{\mathrm{\#SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7B%5C%23SAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-like counting problem is either in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or is <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. </p>

What does “<img alt="{\mathrm{SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BSAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-like” mean? Consider the clause <img alt="{(\bar{x}_i \vee \bar{x}_j \vee x_k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_i+%5Cvee+%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_j+%5Cvee+x_k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

Note that if we had the clause <img alt="{(\bar{x}_i \vee x_j \vee \bar{x}_k)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_i+%5Cvee+x_j+%5Cvee+%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> instead, we could re-use <img alt="{R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by switching <img alt="{x_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{x_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the given sequence of variables. Putting negated literals first, if we instead want to require exactly one literal to be true we could apply one of the following relations to each clause, depending on how many negated variables it has: </p>

Question: Is there an assignment <img alt="{\alpha: X \rightarrow D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%3A+X+%5Crightarrow+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that makes <img alt="{\alpha(C_j) \in R_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28C_j%29+%5Cin+R_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for each <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? For the counting version, called <img alt="{\mathsf{\#CSP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23CSP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, how many such assignments are there?
</li></ul>
<p/><p><br/>
Here <img alt="{\alpha(C_j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28C_j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> means the ordered tuple of values <img alt="{\alpha(x_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%28x_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the variables <img alt="{x_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in <img alt="{C_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are considered part of the instance—where they must be finite—the problem is <em>uniform</em>, but if they are fixed (and possibly infinite), it is <em>nonuniform</em>. For a simple analogy: for every fixed context-free grammar <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, its language <img alt="{L(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> belongs to <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but a much stronger fact is that the uniform acceptance problem <img alt="{A_{CFG} = \{\langle G,x\rangle: x \in L(G)\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_%7BCFG%7D+%3D+%5C%7B%5Clangle+G%2Cx%5Crangle%3A+x+%5Cin+L%28G%29%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> also belongs to <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Another relaxation is to allow different domains <img alt="{D_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for different variables <img alt="{x_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
In the Boolean case, <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is fixed to be <img alt="{\{0,1\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We can now say what Schaefer and Creignou-Hermann proved. Schaefer showed that every nonuniform Boolean CSP with finite <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is either in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. He showed the former holds only when <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> falls into one of six explicit cases, where which case is also decidable in polynomial time given <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Creignou and Hermann gave a similar result for Boolean #CSP but with a smaller list of cases—because there are cases where the decision problem is in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> but the counting problem remains <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. A simple such case is where <img alt="{\Gamma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CGamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has only the relation <img alt="{R = \{(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+%5C%7B%281%2C0%29%2C%280%2C1%29%2C%281%2C1%29%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which defines monotone <img alt="{\mathrm{2SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7B2SAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>

</p><p/><h2> Extending the Reach </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Also in the 1990s, Tomás Feder and Moshe Vardi wrote <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/167088.167245">two</a> <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539794266766?journalCode=smjcat">papers</a> on extending Schaefer’s dichotomy to a wider class of problems. To quote the first sentence of the latter’s abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This paper starts with the project of finding a large subclass of <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which exhibits a dichotomy. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The first step was to go to larger domains <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. For example, consider <img alt="{D = \{1,2,3\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD+%3D+%5C%7B1%2C2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Take <img alt="{R = \{(1,2),(2,3),(1,3)\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+%5C%7B%281%2C2%29%2C%282%2C3%29%2C%281%2C3%29%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is simply the relation <img alt="{\neq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Given an undirected graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, its edges become the tuples. The resulting CSP is satisfiable if and only if <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is 3-colorable. Of course, this is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete. Feder and Vardi arrived at this by going down from large subclasses of <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> defined by logic in which Ladner-type constructions can still be expressed, so that dichotomy does <em>not</em> hold. When they imposed all of their conditions, they were left with nonuniform CSPs, and conjectured dichotomy for their decision problems.</p>
<p>
The corresponding question for counting problems was solved <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~abulatov/papers/counting-acm.pdf">first</a>, by Bulatov. Dyer and Richerby <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.3879.pdf">followed</a> by simplifying Bulatov’s proof in a way that also allows deciding whether a given finite <img alt="{(\Gamma,D)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5CGamma%2CD%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> falls into one of the polynomial-time cases (assuming <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P \neq P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to begin with). The latter task runs in polynomial time with an oracle for testing what they call <em>strong balance</em>, which in turn polynomial-time mapping-reduces to Graph Isomorphism—so by Laci Babai’s celebrated theorem they can decide in time quasi-polynomial in <img alt="{|\Gamma|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5CGamma%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whether it is a hard or easy case.</p>
<p>
Finally—and not awarded any of this prize money—a 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03021">paper</a> by Bulatov proved dichotomy for the decision case of nonuniform CSPs. Independently, so did a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01914">paper</a> by Dmitriy Zhuk. We will explore just a few of the underlying ideas in the next section. </p>

Indeed, we long ago <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/07/08/grilling-quantum-circuits/">discussed</a> various efficient ways to convert quantum circuits <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> into polynomials <img alt="{f_C(x_1,\dots,x_n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_C%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> so that, with <img alt="{D = \{0,1\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD+%3D+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> depending only on <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{Z(f_C)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%28f_C%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> gives the acceptance amplitude of <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

Thus, the dichotomy theorems that Jin-Yi and Xi have obtained for complex weighted CSPs take matters into the quantum realm. What this may say about the class <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (bounded-error quantum polynomial time) we leave to the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some of the Ideas </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One key idea can be approached as generalizing a familiar feature of linear algebra. Suppose we take some number <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of vectors of length <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that belong to a linear subspace <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We can arrange them into an <img alt="{\ell \times k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%5Ctimes+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> matrix <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now let us multiply <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on the left by a row vector <img alt="{a = (a_1,\dots,a_\ell)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+%28a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_%5Cell%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then <img alt="{aM}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BaM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is another vector of length <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This vector belongs to <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> because it is just a linear combination of our <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-many vectors in <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
The insight for abstraction is that we can regard <img alt="{a}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as having been applied individually to each of the <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> columns of <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We got one new <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-tuple from this application, but it still belonged to <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. So now, let us consider “multiplying” <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on the left by an arbitrary <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-ary function <img alt="{h(x_1,\dots,x_\ell)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%5Cell%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so that <img alt="{hM}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BhM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is always a <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-tuple. And let us relax <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be any (finite) set <img alt="{R \subseteq D^k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%5Csubseteq+D%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is our (finite) domain. </p>

<p/><p>

The case of <img alt="{\mathrm{2SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7B2SAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is trickier.

<p>Is there an <img alt="{h}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is simultaneously a polymorphism of each one? Neither <em>and</em> nor <em>or</em> works: the former fails on <img alt="{R^0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> because the component-wise <em>and</em> of <img alt="{(1,0)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2C0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{(0,1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%280%2C1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the excluded <img alt="{(0,0)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%280%2C0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and <em>or</em> similarly fails on <img alt="{R^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In fact, <em>none</em> of the sixteen binary Boolean functions is a homomorphism of all three. But when we go up to <img alt="{\ell = 3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, however, it turns out that the <em>majority-of-3</em> function is a polymorphism: any duplicated tuple rules, so only the three instances of three separate tuples need to be checked.</p>
<p>
Going back to the linear dependence idea, the ternary function <img alt="{h(x_1,x_2,x_3) = x_1 + x_2 + x_3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x_1%2Cx_2%2Cx_3%29+%3D+x_1+%2B+x_2+%2B+x_3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a polymorphism of <em>affine</em> relations. For <img alt="{D = \{0,1\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD+%3D+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> where <img alt="{+}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the same as exclusive-or, it has the property that <img alt="{h(x,y,y) = h(y,y,x) = x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x%2Cy%2Cy%29+%3D+h%28y%2Cy%2Cx%29+%3D+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This property is named for Anatoly Maltsev, who used it long before any of this complexity work began. It turned out to be a key to demarcating the easy cases for the dichotomy in higher dimensions. Affine relations were already the lone easy case in Creignou-Hermann for Boolean #CSP, while we can now crisply state Schaefer’s original dichotomy for decision CSP: affine, majority-of-3, <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, plus two trivial cases where the all-zero or all-one assignment always works, are the polymorphisms that characterize the SAT-like problems in <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p>
A second basic idea is to re-cast the counting problems as ones of counting <em>homomorphisms</em> between relational structures. For instance, let <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be any graph and <img alt="{K_r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> the complete graph on <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> nodes. A homomorphism <img alt="{h}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has the property that when <img alt="{(u,v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28u%2Cv%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an edge of <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{(h(u),h(v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28h%28u%29%2Ch%28v%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is an edge of <img alt="{K_r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—in particular, <img alt="{h(u) \neq h(v)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28u%29+%5Cneq+h%28v%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This is possible if and only if <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is <img alt="{r}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-colorable. This approach was greatly enhanced in a 1998 <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.40.2693">paper</a> by Peter Jeavons and its follow-ups with other authors. It was particularly useful to the decidability part of Dyer and Richerby’s paper.</p>
<p>
A third idea used by Cai and Chen originated in a 2010 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.5659.pdf">paper</a> of theirs with Pinyan Lu for the case of non-negative weights.

<p>
A big extra challenge in the complex-weights case is how to handle cancellations, as begun in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4728">paper</a> by Cai, Chen, and Lu. Implementing the oracle efficiently requires the Maltsev property, a kind of “proto-unitarity” condition on <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (under which <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> has at most <img alt="{d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> pairwise linearly independent rows and every two such rows are orthogonal), and a third property they call the “Type Partition” condition to avert blowup in the number of queries. Whether the classification they get is decidable remains open.</p>
<p>
Here is where we say to go to the papers for details, but we hope we have expressed ideas and their motivation as a guide. We have a little more to say about interpretation and making further progress on the dichotomy.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Taking Dichotomy Further </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Progress on the counting dichotomy increases the “internal evidence” for <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P \neq P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which of course is implied by <img alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. To paraphrase how our blogging friends Scott and Lance and Bill have often put it:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Why would all this finely filigreed structure with sharp demarcation between hard and easy cases exist if <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> were a false illusion? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
At the very least, this puts the onus on a believer in <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to give an alternative explanation of how such structure could arise. </p>
<p>
It strikes us, however, that this also puts a squeeze on <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> under the conventional wisdom that it is intermediate between <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, without being <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard in particular. This is not in technical conflict with the Cai-Chen dichotomy because exactly computing the acceptance probabilities of a class of quantum circuits (on inputs built into the circuits) can be <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-complete while the circuits use only a gap in probabilities to solve problems that are easy or intermediate. But we suspect that this still limits possible ways to capture <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> “naturally” by descriptive logic.</p>
<p>
The prize paper with Chen is just one part of a long-term project by Jin-Yi and co-workers on classifying counting problems and showing where dichotomy applies. A 2010 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.0803">paper</a> of Jin-Yi with Lu and Sangxia Huang bridged from #CSP and a subcase of counting homomorphisms between graphs to a wider kind of sum-over-products formula originally called a <b>holant</b> <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jyc/papers/LAA-journalversion.pdf">here</a>. Recent progress on dichotomy for holants is represented by this FOCS 2020 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07906">paper</a> with Shuai Shao. This is also both directly relevant to quantum computation and maps out progress that is still out there to make. The paper has a one-page prologue that summons characters from legendary fantasy (and <em>Star Wars</em>) to conquer quantum issues.</p>

    <title>TR21-105 |  Functional lower bounds for restricted arithmetic circuits of depth four | 

	Suryajith Chillara</title>
    <summary>Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d} \in VNP$ such that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.

The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a $2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ "functional" lower bound for an explicit polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a lower bound for the "corresponding Boolean function" of $Q$ against non-uniform $ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.

In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\Omega(\log^2{n})\leq d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of bounded individual degree at most $O(\frac{d}{k^2})$ that functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$ ($\in VP$) over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in $GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.

For the sake of completeness, we also show a syntactic size lower bound against any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit computing $IMM_{n,d}$ (for the same regime of $d$) which is tight over large fields. Like Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016], we too prove lower bounds against circuits of bounded formal degree which functionally compute $IMM_{n,d}$, for a slightly larger range of individual degree.</summary>

unknown depth-2 feedforward neural network with general ReLU activations, under
mild non-degeneracy assumptions. In particular, we consider learning an unknown
network of the form $f(x) = {a}^{\mathsf{T}}\sigma({W}^\mathsf{T}x+b)$, where
$x$ is drawn from the Gaussian distribution, and $\sigma(t) := \max(t,0)$ is
the ReLU activation. Prior works for learning networks with ReLU activations
assume that the bias $b$ is zero. In order to deal with the presence of the
bias terms, our proposed algorithm consists of robustly decomposing multiple
higher order tensors arising from the Hermite expansion of the function $f(x)$.
Using these ideas we also establish identifiability of the network parameters
under minimal assumptions.

that come from using Shor's algorithm to reduce the complexity of prime
factorization. However, this promise hast not yet been realized due to noisy
qubits and lack of robust error correction schemes. Here we explore a
promising, alternative method for prime factorization that uses
well-established techniques from variational imaginary time evolution. We
create a Hamiltonian whose ground state encodes the solution to the problem and
use variational techniques to evolve a state iteratively towards these prime
factors. We show that the number of circuits evaluated in each iteration scales
as O(n^{5}d), where n is the bit-length of the number to be factorized and $d$
is the depth of the circuit. We use a single layer of entangling gates to
factorize several numbers represented using 7, 8, and 9-qubit Hamiltonians. We
also verify the method's performance by implementing it on the IBMQ Lima
hardware.

minimax lower bounds that hold even when interactive protocols are allowed.
Interestingly, while our wavelet-based estimator is almost rate-optimal for
Sobolev spaces as well, it is unclear whether the standard Fourier basis, which
arise naturally for those spaces, can be used to achieve the same performance.

-a special case of liveness-guarantees, which ensure the termination of
individual method calls under system fairness assumptions. Liveness properties
have been proposed for concurrent objects. Typical liveness properties
includelock-freedom,wait-freedom,deadlock-freedom,starvation-freedom and
obstruction-freedom. It is known that the five liveness properties above are
decidable on the Sequential Consistency (SC) memory model for a bounded number
of processes. However, the problem of decidability of liveness for finite state
concurrent programs running on relaxed memory models remains open. In this
paper we address this problem for the Total Store Order (TSO) memory model,as
found in the x86 architecture. We prove that lock-freedom,
wait-freedom,deadlock-freedom and starvation-freedom are undecidable on TSO for
a bounded number of processes, while obstruction-freedom is decidable.

    <title>On Reconfigurability of Target Sets</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1626912000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/o/Ohsaka:Naoto.html">Naoto Ohsaka</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09885">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the problem of deciding reconfigurability of target sets of a graph.
Given a graph $G$ with vertex thresholds $\tau$, consider a dynamic process in
which vertex $v$ becomes activated once at least $\tau(v)$ of its neighbors are
activated. A vertex set $S$ is called a target set if all vertices of $G$ would
be activated when initially activating vertices of $S$. In the Target Set
Reconfiguration problem, given two target sets $X$ and $Y$ of the same size, we
are required to determine whether $X$ can be transformed into $Y$ by repeatedly
swapping one vertex in the current set with another vertex not in the current
set preserving every intermediate set as a target set. In this paper, we
investigate the complexity of Target Set Reconfiguration in restricted cases.
On the hardness side, we prove that Target Set Reconfiguration is
PSPACE-complete on bipartite planar graphs of degree $3$ or $4$ and of
threshold $2$, bipartite $3$-regular graphs of threshold $1$ or $2$, and split
graphs, which is in contrast to the fact that a special case called Vertex
Cover Reconfiguration is in P for the last graph class. On the positive side,
we present a polynomial-time algorithm for Target Set Reconfiguration on graphs
of maximum degree $2$ and trees. The latter result can be thought of as a
generalization of that for Vertex Cover Reconfiguration.

tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Manual investigations by human contact tracers
remain a dominant way in which this is carried out. This process is limited by
the number of contact tracers available, who are often overburdened during an
outbreak or epidemic. As a result, a crucial decision in any contact tracing
strategy is, given a set of contacts, which person should a tracer trace next?
In this work, we develop a formal model that articulates these questions and
provides a framework for comparing contact tracing strategies. Through
analyzing our model, we give provably optimal prioritization policies via a
clean connection to a tool from operations research called a "branching
bandit". Examining these policies gives qualitative insight into trade-offs in
contact tracing applications.

machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has
revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular
success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question
of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been
unexplored.
</p>
<p>We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of
machine-learned predictions with the idea of "warm-starting" primal-dual
algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial
optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to
$b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual
variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible,
so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to
nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be
optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.
Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show
that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We
validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and
synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically
effective method to compute bipartite matchings.

Monotone" framework, a special case of Topkis's monotonic optimization
framework, which implies that the parametric min cuts are nested. When there is
a single parameter, this property implies that the number of distinct min cuts
is linear in the number of nodes, which is quite useful for constructing
algorithms to identify all possible min cuts.

training. Collecting this data at scale inevitably causes label noise.Hence,the
need to develop learning algorithms that are robust to label noise. In recent
years, k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) emerged as a viable solution to this problem.
Despite its success, kNN is not without its problems. Mainly, it requires a
huge memory footprint to store all the training samples and it needs an
advanced data structure to allow for fast retrieval of the relevant examples,
given a query sample. We propose a neural network, termed kNet, that learns to
perform kNN. Once trained, we no longer need to store the training data, and
processing a query sample is a simple matter of inference. To use kNet, we
first train a preliminary network on the data set, and then train kNet on the
penultimate layer of the preliminary network.We find that kNet gives a smooth
approximation of kNN,and cannot handle the sharp label changes between samples
that kNN can exhibit. This indicates that currently kNet is best suited to
approximate kNN with a fairly large k. Experiments on two data sets show that
this is the regime in which kNN works best,and can therefore be replaced by
kNet.In practice, kNet consistently improve the results of all preliminary
networks, in all label noise regimes, by up to 3%.

an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d}\in VNP$ such
that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes
a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally
equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.
</p>
<p>The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on
a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and
Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that
functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic
$\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums
of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a
$2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ "functional" lower bound for an explicit
polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a
lower bound for the "corresponding Boolean function" of $Q$ against non-uniform
$ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to
$\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.
</p>
<p>In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq
d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of
bounded individual degree at most $O\left(\frac{d}{k^2}\right)$ that
functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$
($\in VP$) over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated
Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in
$GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for
quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained
separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.

<ol><li>Victor Galitski has an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quantum-computing-hype-bad-science-victor-galitski-1c?trk=public_post-content_share-article_title">impassioned rant against out-of-control quantum computing hype</a>, which I enjoyed and enthusiastically recommend, although I wished Galitski had engaged a bit more with the strongest arguments for optimism (e.g., the recent sampling-based supremacy experiments, the extrapolations that show gate fidelities crossing the fault-tolerance threshold within the next decade).  Even if I’ve been saying similar things on this blog for 15 years, I clearly haven’t been doing so in a style that works for everyone.  Quantum information needs as many people as possible who will tell the truth as best they see it, unencumbered by any competing interests, and has nothing legitimate to fear from that.  The modern intersection of quantum theory and computer science has raised profound scientific questions that will be with us for decades to come.  It’s a lily that need not be gilded with hype.<br/></li><li>Last month Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas posted <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/081/">an exciting preprint to ECCC</a>, which apparently proves the first (slightly) superpolynomial lower bound on the size of constant-depth arithmetic circuits, over fields of characteristic 0.  Assuming it’s correct, this is another small victory in the generations-long war against the P vs. NP problem.<br/></li><li>I’m grateful to the Texas Democratic legislators who fled the state to prevent the legislature, a couple miles from my house, having a quorum to enact new voting restrictions, and who thereby drew national attention to the enormity of what’s at stake.  It should go without saying that, if a minority gets to rule indefinitely by forcing through laws to suppress the votes of a majority that would otherwise unseat it, thereby giving itself the power to force through more such laws, etc., then we no longer live in a democracy but in a banana republic.  And there’s no symmetry to the situation: no matter how terrified you (or I) might feel about wokeists and their denunciation campaigns, the Democrats have no comparable effort to suppress Republican votes.  Alas, I don’t know of any solutions beyond the obvious one, of trying to deal the conspiracy-addled grievance party crushing defeats in 2022 and 2024.</li></ol></div>

<p>This is the sixth and final post in the series, on trends in machine learning theory, written by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~mglasgow/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Margalit Glasgow</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/michal-moshkovitz" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Michal Moshkovitz</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cyrusrashtchian/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cyrus Rashtchian</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>Throughout the last few decades, we have witnessed unprecedented growth of machine learning. Originally a topic formalized by a small group of computer scientists, machine learning now impacts many areas: the physical sciences, medicine, commerce, finance, urban planning, and more. The rapid growth of machine learning can be partially attributed to the availability of large amounts of data and the development of powerful computing devices. Another important factor is that machine learning has foundations in many other fields, such as theoretical computer science, algorithms, applied mathematics, statistics, and optimization. </p>



<p>If machine learning is already mathematically rooted in many existing research areas, why do we need a field solely dedicated to learning theory? According to <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~djhsu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Daniel Hsu</a>, “Learning theory serves (at least) two purposes: to help make sense of machine learning, and also to explore the capabilities and limitations of learning algorithms.” Besides finding innovative applications for existing tools, learning theorists also provide answers to long-standing problems and ask new fundamental questions. </p>



<p>Modern learning theory goes beyond classical statistical and computer science paradigms by: </p>



<ul><li>developing insights about specific computational models (e.g., neural networks) </li><li>analyzing popular learning algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent)</li><li>taking into account data distributions (e.g., margin bounds or manifold assumptions)</li><li>adding auxiliary goals (e.g., robustness or privacy), and </li><li>rethinking how algorithms interact with and access data (e.g., online or reinforcement learning).</li></ul>



<p>By digging deep into the basic questions, researchers generate new concepts and models that change the way we solve problems and help us understand emerging phenomena.</p>



<p>This article provides a brief overview of three key areas in machine learning theory: new learning paradigms, trustworthy machine learning, and reinforcement learning. We describe the main thrust of each of these areas, as well as point to a few papers from <a href="http://algorithmiclearningtheory.org/alt2021/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">ALT 2021</a> (the 32nd International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory) that touch each of these topics. To share a broader view, we also asked experts in the areas to comment on the field and on their recent papers. Needless to say, this article only scratches the surface. At the end, we point to places to learn more about learning theory.</p>



<span id="more-304"/>



<p><strong>New Machine Learning Paradigms</strong><br/>The traditional learning theory framework, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, defines what it means to learn a ground-truth classifier from a candidate class of possible classifiers. Alongside PAC learning is Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory, which characterizes the number of samples needed and sufficient to learn a classifier from a given class. The generalization analysis from VC theory is restricted to guarantees that hold independently of the data distribution — that is, even for worst-case distributions. Additionally, the VC/PAC learning paradigm suggests that whenever learning is possible, it can be accomplished by choosing the classifier that minimizes loss on the training data, called the empirical risk minimizer (ERM). </p>



<p>This classical framework unfortunately fails to explain the empirical success of machine learning (ML). “The distribution-free setting, while it comes with the elegant VC theory, turned out to be unsatisfactory,” says Csaba Szepesvári. “Due to the oversimplified setting, the theory could not contribute meaningfully to understanding all kinds of learning methods such as learning with trees, boosting, neural networks, SVMs, or using any other nonparametric methods.” Researchers posit that stronger guarantees should be possible if we leverage natural assumptions about the data distribution, though identifying the right “natural assumptions” is a challenging task. Similarly, understanding which of many possible ERM solutions a learning algorithm chooses may yield better generalization results than those yielded by VC theory. </p>



<p>Methods that provide <em>distribution-specific </em>guarantees aren’t new to learning theory. A canonical example is known as a margin bound, where the test error of a classifier is analyzed in terms of the margin that separates the different prediction categories. In <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/hanneke21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one</a> of the ALT best papers, Steve Hanneke and Aryeh Kontorovich prove generalization guarantees in terms of the size of the margin for two popular classification algorithms: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">support vector machines</a> (SVMs) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">perceptron</a> algorithm. The authors answer a core open question, showing that SVMs achieve the optimal margin bound!</p>



<p>Further work at ALT uses an assumption that data lies on a low-dimensional manifold to prove guarantees for generative models. Generative models synthesize <em>original</em> samples, such as images or text, that resemble training data, but without copying the data directly. While so-called <em>generative adversarial networks</em> work well in practice, few guarantees exist because it is challenging to statistically formulate the requirement of generating original samples. Nicolas Schreuder, Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, and Arnak S. Dalalyan consider a new framework in their <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/schreuder21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>, in which they guarantee originality by outputting a continuous distribution, which ensures that it is very unlikely to output training examples. If the training data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold, they show that it is possible to learn a good generator, which outputs a smooth transformation of a random point.</p>



<p>In another <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/tosh21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>, Christopher Tosh, Akshay Krishnamurthy, and Daniel Hsu use distributional assumptions to show when unsupervised methods can use unlabeled data to learn useful <em>representations </em>of data. A linear function trained on these representations and some labeled data can then be used for downstream prediction of the labels. The key idea is to look at when data has <em>multiview redundancy (MVR), </em>which arises, for instance, when data is augmented: Under MVR, each data point can be viewed as a pair (<em>X,</em> <em>Z</em>), and the label <em>Y</em> can be predicted almost as well from <em>X</em> or <em>Z</em> as from the full pair. For instance, each pair might be two halves of an article, or two rotations of an image. The authors show how a theoretical approach called <em>landmark embedding </em>can produce a representation that enables low-error linear classification. Additionally, they analyze when the representations are learned implicitly while training a model to predict whether two views <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em> correspond to the same example, which is close to what is done in practice. </p>



<p>Another new paradigm considers how the specific<em> training algorithm</em> affects which of many candidate ERM solutions are chosen. This is called the <em>implicit bias </em>of a training algorithm: If there are multiple equally good solutions, then why does an algorithm choose one over the other? This is particularly relevant when studying neural networks, which are typically<em> overparameterized</em> and can be trained to find many solutions with zero empirical risk. In one <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/ji21a/ji21a.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>, Ziwei Ji and Matus Telgarsky characterize the implicit bias of using gradient descent to train a linear classifier with a general loss function. They show that the solution relates to the optimizer of a particular smoothed margin function. While this paper does not yield generalization guarantees, this type of implicit bias analysis can sometimes lead to generalization guarantees via margin bounds.</p>



<p>The goal of this area is to go beyond traditional learning theory paradigms by leveraging distributional and algorithmic properties. But a major open question is designing a more general mathematical theory that exploits such properties. <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaymrn/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Shay Moran</a> offers a standard for new theory: “I hope that in the next 10 years we will develop more realistic models of learning, but I will insist that they still be mathematically clean.”</p>



<p><strong>Trustworthy ML</strong><br/>Machine learning has inspired many new areas and technologies: personalized health care, drug discovery, advertising, résumé screening, credit loans, and more. However, these critical and user-centered applications require a higher standard of testing and verification because mistakes may deeply affect many people. Addressing these challenges has inspired a new field of research centered on making machine learning more trustworthy and reliable, which is the motivation for many of the ALT papers this year as well. An expert in the area, <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kamalika/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kamalika Chaudhuri</a>, says, “For my field, which is trustworthy ML, the theoretical goal and challenge remains modeling and frameworks.” She elaborates: “Coming up with new conceptual frameworks for learning has always been one of the core challenges in learning theory since its early days, and it is doubly important now.” Researchers have been exploring this direction in many areas, including privacy, data deletion, robustness, fairness, interpretability, and causality. </p>



<p>Several ALT 2021 papers cover questions in privacy. The general goal is to understand how to modify existing learning methods to take into account privacy constraints. One of the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/wang21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">papers</a>, by Di Wang, Huanyu Zhang, Marco Gaboardi, and Jinhui Xu, considers generalized linear models in a differential privacy model. A central motivation is to understand the role of public, unlabeled data in improving the learnability of these problems in a private setting. Summarizing another direction, <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gautam Kamath</a> comments on his <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/aden-ali21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> with co-authors Ishaq Aden-Ali and Hassan Ashtiani, “This paper focuses on a very simple but surprisingly challenging question: Can we learn a general multivariate Gaussian under the constraint of differential privacy? Prior works focused on restricted settings — for example, with bounded parameters or known covariance. We gave the first finite sample complexity bound for this problem, which evidence suggests is near optimal. The next question is to design a computationally efficient algorithm for this problem.” Another <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/cesar21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> on privacy, by Mark Cesar and Ryan Rogers, studies the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">composition</a> of various privacy mechanisms in the context of real-world data analytics pipelines.</p>



<p>Another aspect of respecting user privacy is allowing people to choose to stop sharing their data. Concretely, this means removing their data from data sets and ensuring that existing and future models do not make use of their data in any way. One name for this process is <em>machine unlearning</em>, and the main challenge is removing the data efficiently without retraining all models from scratch. One <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/neel21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>, by Seth Neel, Aaron Roth, and Saeed Sharifi-Malvajerdi, addresses this challenge. They propose ways to strategically update the model by using modified gradient descent methods. They also analyze this approach, and prove new upper and lower bounds for updating models after data deletion with their new optimization algorithm. </p>



<p>Robust methods for machine learning and statistics aim to provide rigorous guarantees in the presence of outliers or adversarially modified data points. The field of robustness has been steadily growing as researchers uncover more and more models where deviations in the data can lead to unexpected and dramatic changes in model behavior. In ALT 2021, a <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/shen21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a> by Jie Shen and Chicheng Zhang covers learning half-spaces nearly optimally even in the presence of malicious noise.</p>



<p>As a final and thought-provoking direction in trustworthy ML, <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Omer Reingold</a> points out that we need to better understand “the meaning of individual probabilities/risk scores,” which are common ways that ML systems summarize or justify decisions. Ideally, the output of a model should be something that people can interpret directly and use to potentially modify their future actions. He elaborates that it is important to think about “the individual quantities (which imply important decisions) that ML is trying to approximate” and to answer “what does fitting the parameters of a model on the entire population imply for individuals and subcommunities?” This question brings to the forefront the fact that ML systems affect both individuals and groups of people, which is an important consideration when formulating rigorous definitions of fairness (e.g., see <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this book</a> or <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this one</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong><br/>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a framework for interactive learning where an agent interacts with an environment, and the agent’s actions govern the rewards it receives from the environment. Part of the motivation for studying RL is that relevant problems are everywhere. Sometimes the agents are autonomous vehicles. Other times, they are programs playing games like chess or go. People interact more and more with ML models, and hence, living our lives is actually being a part of a multiagent game where we, humans, and the ML models are the agents. “The most exciting direction in learning theory of recent years,” says <a href="https://www.ehazan.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Elad Hazan</a>, “is adding rigorous theoretical guarantees to reinforcement learning.” </p>



<p>The RL environment is typically modeled as a <em>Markov decision process (MDP)</em>: a set of states, actions, and transition probabilities that determine the next state and reward given the agent’s current state and action. The agent uses a <em>policy</em> to choose its action from each state with the goal of maximizing its cumulative reward over time. A central challenge is balancing<em> exploration</em> (learning about the environment) and <em>exploitation</em> (spending time choosing actions in states where they can collect high rewards).</p>



<p>In the most basic setting, <em>multi-armed bandits</em>, there is a single state, and each action (or “arm”) leads to a stochastic reward. “Here, the theory is quite mature, though interesting problems remain in connection to the limits of how structure can be exploited,” <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Csaba Szepesvári</a> says. In two works at ALT, by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/jourdan21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Marc Jourdan, Mojmír Mutný, Johannes Kirschner, and Andreas Krause</a> and by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/cuvelier21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Thibaut Cuvelier, Richard Combes, and Eric Gourdin</a>, the authors show that efficient exploration is possible in a <em>combinatorial semi-bandit </em>setting. Here, the agent can choose an allowed <em>set</em> of arms in each step, and it receives a distinct reward for each chosen arm. While the number of action choices for the agent is larger, this more detailed feedback makes the problem tractable.</p>



<p>Beyond the stateless bandit setting, ML theorists are still figuring out how fast agents can learn how to play optimally in MDPs with <em>finite</em> state spaces and action spaces. Recent progress on this front has given lower bounds on the sample complexity required for agents to learn the best policy. In one ALT <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/domingues21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">paper</a>, the authors give a unified view of lower bounds for three distinct, but related, problems in RL. The hard MDP instances they construct to show lower bounds are based on hard instances for multi-armed bandit problems.</p>



<p>In the more challenging setting where the state space is infinite, a central question is whether the agent can learn from exploring a finite number of states, and generalize<em> </em>to perform well on unknown areas of the environment. For certain MDPs, generalizing is impossible, but some assumptions on the structure of the MDP may enable generalization. “While algorithm independent problem formulations existed and have been studied in the finite case, a quite recent development is to extend these to the case of ‘large’ environments where the use of <em>function approximation </em>techniques becomes crucial for achieving nontrivial results,” explains Csaba Szepesvári. </p>



<p>Function approximation has to do with the optimal <em>action-value function, </em>which captures the long-term reward of playing a certain action from a given state. This function can sometimes be approximated by some simple class of functions. One of the strongest such assumptions is <em>linear realizability, </em>where the optimal action-value function<em> </em>is a linear function of some representation of the action and state. In one of the <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/weisz21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">papers</a> receiving a best paper award in ALT, Gellert Weisz, Philip Amortila, and Csaba Szepesvári show that even under this strong assumption of linear realizability, the agent needs a number of samples exponential in the length of the episode or the dimension of the representation in order to generalize. Looking forward, the goal is to follow the lead of these papers and better understand the landscape of sample complexity: When can we learn models with a polynomial number of samples, and when is an exponential number necessary?</p>



<p>Nearly every offline learning problem can be studied in an interactive setting, where inputs arrive in an online fashion and need to be processed immediately, which is common in many real-world settings. Models for interactive machine learning provide a framework for studying problems and algorithms in this more challenging setting. Beyond the MDP setting, interactive learning spans online learning (e.g., <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/moshkovitz21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">no-substitution</a> <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v132/bhattacharjee21a.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">clustering</a>), nonstochastic control theory (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12178" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">robust controllers for dynamical systems</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05207" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">online convex optimization</a>, and many more domains. </p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>We hope this provides a fairly broad view on some of the topics that people are researching right now in learning theory. Of course, there are many more areas that we don’t have space to describe: theory of deep neural networks, quantum algorithms for machine learning problems, human-centered considerations, learning with strategic agents and multiplayer games, convex/nonconvex optimization, federated and distributed learning algorithms, and many more. In general, as Gautam Kamath observes, “A lot of important questions in learning theory arise through interplay between the theoretical and applied machine learning communities.” To have a greater impact, it is important to collaborate with people doing empirical research, and to learn from the front lines about the most interesting phenomena to explain, or the challenges that do not seem surmountable by combining existing tools.</p>



<p>To learn more and to get more involved, we have listed a variety of resources (blogs, workshops, videos, etc.) that can help you get started in this area. As a final motivation for writing this article, we remark that people in the area are keenly aware that we need more young talent to help uncover truth and contribute groundbreaking ideas. As Gautam Kamath puts it, “There are far more interesting questions in learning theory than there are researchers to solve them.”</p>

    <title>Political Intersections: Trump honors Antifa member who was shot dead by police</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> 1) Trump and other reps have said the following about the Jan 6 event at various times:</p><p>a) The Jan 6 event was freedom fighters who were fighting the noble fight to overturn a fraudulent election. Rah Rah!</p><p>b) The Jan 6 event was a peaceful protest to overturn a fraudulent election. </p><p>c) The Jan 6 event was democrats trying to make republicans look bad.</p><p>d) The Jan 6 event was Antifa. (See <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump/trump-privately-blamed-antifa-people-for-storming-u-s-capitol-axios-idUSKBN29H0DR">here</a>)</p><p>e) Ashli Babbitt (a protestor who was shot by police at the Jan 6 event) should have been honored by flying the flag at half-mast (see <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/trump/trump-reportedly-regrets-not-lowering-american-flag-at-the-white-house-to-honor-ashli-babbitt/">here</a>) </p><p>If we take the intersection of d and e we find that Trump wants to honor a member of Antifa who was shot by police. </p><p>To be fair, Trump is entitled to change his mind. But I wonder- did he ever really think it was Antifa or was that a talking point? If he really thought so then  when did he change his mind? I ask non rhetorically---  NOT a `gotcha question'</p><p>(NOTE: I wrote this post a while back. Since then Trump and some other republicans are tending towards the Freedom Fighters narrative.) </p><p>2) Vaccines:</p><p>a) Some people think that the vaccines are bad to take. I suspect they would give some (incorrect) health reasons, while the real reason may be political. (One reason is that the vaccine make you magnetic. That sounds awesome! Others think that there is a microchip in the vaccine so that Bill Gates can track our movements. Gee, Mark Zuckerberg can already do that. Some thing it will rewrite our DNA. A bio major I know  tells me that such people are confusing messenger RNA with DNA. Great- we can now have a nice conversation and point out where they are wrong.) </p><p>b) Some people think we should NOT give vaccines to poor countries that need them, or to people in prison,  since Americans should have priority. (NOTE- from a purely health-viewpoint this is not correct since a pandemic does not respect boundaries- if there is an outbreak in a diff country or in a prison it will affect people not in those countries and not in prison.) </p><p>Are there people who believe a and b? I ask non-rhetorically. </p><p><br/></p><p>I am not surprised when people hold contradictory thoughts in their heads, but these two cases just struck me as particularly strange. Not sure why.</p><p> </p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR21-103 |  Elliptic Curve Fast Fourier Transform (ECFFT) Part I: Fast Polynomial Algorithms over all Finite Fields | 

	Eli Ben-Sasson, 

	Dan Carmon, 

	Swastik Kopparty, 

	David Levit</title>
    <summary>Over finite fields $F_q$ containing a root of unity of smooth order $n$ (smoothness means $n$ is the product of small primes), the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) leads to the fastest known algebraic algorithms for many basic polynomial operations, such as multiplication, division, interpolation and multi-point evaluation. These operations can be computed by constant fan-in arithmetic circuits over $F_q$ of quasi-linear size; specifically, $O(n \log n)$ for multiplication and division, and $O(n \log^2 n)$ for interpolation and evaluation.

However, the same operations over fields with no smooth order root of unity suffer from an asymptotic slowdown, typically due to the need to introduce “synthetic” roots of unity to enable the FFT. The classical algorithm of Schönhage and Strassen incurred a multiplicative slowdown factor of $\log \log n$ on top of the smooth case. Recent remarkable results of Harvey, van der Hoeven and Lecerf dramatically reduced this multiplicative overhead to $\exp(\log^* (n))$.

We introduce a new approach to fast algorithms for polynomial operations over all large finite fields. The key idea is to replace the group of roots of unity with a set of points $L \subset F_q$ suitably related to a well-chosen elliptic curve group over $F_q$ (the set L itself is not a group). The key advantage of this approach is that elliptic curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse–Weil interval $[q + 1 \pm 2\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have subgroups of large, smooth order, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare this with multiplicative subgroups over $F_q$ whose order must divide $q-1$. By analogy, our method extends the standard, multiplicative FFT in a similar way to how Lenstra’s elliptic curve method extended Pollard’s $p-1$ algorithm for factoring integers.

For polynomials represented by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show that  multiplication, division, degree-computation, interpolation, evaluation and Reed–Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with fixed evaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar to what is achievable with the classical FFTs when the field size $q$ is special. For several problems, this yields the asymptotically smallest known arithmetic circuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.

The efficiency of the classical FFT follows from using the 2-to-1 squaring map to reduce the evaluation set of roots of unity of order $2^k$ to similar groups of size $2^{k?i}$, $i &gt; 0$. Our algorithms operate similarly, using isogenies of elliptic curves with kernel size 2 as 2-to-1 maps to reduce $L$ of size $2^k$ to sets of size $2^{k?i}$ that are, like $L$, suitably related to elliptic curves, albeit different ones.</summary>

    <title>Linkage with many Wikipedia Good Articles</title>
    <summary>There are two reasons for the large number of Good Articles in this set. First, I had previously been trying to keep my nominations and reviews in balance, but there were too few nominations to review on topics of interest to me, and the inability to find things to review was preventing me from nominating other articles when they were ready. So I started nominating more often.

First, I had previously been trying to keep my nominations and reviews in balance, but there were too few nominations to review on topics of interest to me, and the inability to find things to review was preventing me from nominating other articles when they were ready. So I started nominating more often. And second, the Wikipedia Good Articles editors are having a drive this month to clean out old nominations, as they tend to do a couple of times per year.</p>

<p>
José Altuve hit a game-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth against the Yankees on Sunday. He thereby reproduced the conditions and the outcome of baseball’s most dramatic cheating accusation of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today, at baseball’s All-Star break, we review this and other social experiments that have quite a bit more data.<br/>
<span id="more-18952"/></p>
<p>
Altuve won the 2019 American League Championship series with a pinch-hit homer in the bottom of the ninth against the Yankees’ closer, Aroldis Chapman. As he approached home plate, he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTNBnk1dz6g">seen</a> telling his teammates waiting to mob him at the plate not to rip off his jersey in celebration. He subsequently <a href="https://youtu.be/-ryvOya4PoE?t=247">scooted</a> into the corridor behind the dugout, then re-emerged into the on-field celebration. This fed accusations that he had been wired with a buzzer to know what kind of pitch was coming from Chapman, in line with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal">sign-stealing</a> by other means from the Astros’ 2017 championship season and 2018 that was proven and punished by Major League Baseball. </p>
<p>
Almost the same scenario was reproduced Sunday: Houston down 7-5 against the Yankees with two out and two on base in the ninth, Altuve up against the Yankees’ closer (Chad Green recently supplanting Chapman). Altuve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHrc6OdYOpo">socked</a> a homer to the same part of the ballpark to complete a shocking six-run comeback. Immediately upon touching home, he had his shirt ripped off to reveal nothing but the top half of his birthday suit. This was the most direct way possible to witness that he could have hit the other homer without illegal information.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Examples and Non-Examples </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I have dealt with chess-cheating cases in which electronic buzzing has been specifically alleged, including the two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borislav_Ivanov#Retirement_from_competitive_chess_and_brief_return_to_chess-related_activities">most</a> prominent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/crosswords/chess/a-master-is-disqualified-over-suspicions-of-cheating.html">cases</a> of 2013. I will not take this post further in this direction, however, but rather to pose this question:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What is considered a “social proof” of an assertion—especially when there are elements of scientific control and reproduction? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A simple example is a police lineup. This tries to control for whether a witness has previously seen the accused by including the accused among usually four or five similarly represented people. Picking the right person is considered to prove the previous encounter. Statistically, however, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-value</a> of only 0.20 or 0.167, which are not considered significant at even the weakest level of “statistical proof.” Allowing <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug04/lineups">null</a> lineups does not change the statistics much.</p>
<p>
Baseball gives a non-example that surprises me. One of the bad performances that cost Chapman his closer role was losing an 8-4 lead against the Los Angeles Angels on June 30. As a fantasy-baseball player, I’ve regularly observed poor pitching (by the closers on my “fantasy team”) when the lead is too large to earn credit for a coveted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)">save</a>. Does the data reproduce a phenomenon of closers bearing down less when way ahead, with no “save” to gain? A <a href="https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2014/1/27/5344580/the-closer-mentality-part-1-closers-in-non-save-situations">study</a> after the 2013 season, which cleverly represented performances by the same <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-scores I use in chess, found none. “Meltdowns” like Chapman’s are offset by cases where closers pitched better. The <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-scores in the study are all in the range -1.25 to +1.50 anyway, which count as statistically random.</p>
<p>
This study used a reasonably large data set, one that is well-defined and admits controlling factors such as normalizing for game circumstances and the quality of the opposing hitters. At least it is more than the two instances of Altuve. In-between would be an attempt to determine whether certain national soccer teams are consistently worse at penalty-kick tiebreaks. England’s and Italy’s teams brought their long tortured histories together in the tiebreak of Sunday’s European Cup final. The Italians missed two of five kicks, a score that often spells doom, but the English missed three.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Larger Scale </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dick and I are really interested in “experiments” that have spilled into society, with minimal controls but large data. One sphere of this is cybersecurity. </p>
<p>
It seems to us that only in the past decade have security experts begun formalizing their research as experimental science with repeatability and reproducibility as explicit criteria. The NSA devoted a special 2012 <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/resources/everyone/digital-media-center/publications/the-next-wave/TNW-19-2.pdf">issue</a> of their <em>Next Wave</em> series to what they titled as “Developing a blueprint for a science of cybersecurity.” Among the contents are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
An introductory essay by Carl Landwehr titled, “Cybersecurity: From engineering to science.” <p/>
</li><li>
A linchpin <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~ccpalmer/teaching/cs55/Resources/Papers/TNW_19_2_BlueprintScienceCybersecurity_Schneider.pdf">paper</a> by Fred Schneider titled, “Blueprint for a science of cybersecurity.” <p/>
</li><li>
A <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxion/pubs/Maxion12.pdf">paper</a> by Roy Maxion titled, “Making experiments dependable,” which came from a 2011 Springer LNCS <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-24541-1">Festschrift</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
Maxion’s main example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics">keystroke biometrics</a>. This covers inferences made from typing style on a computer keyboard or mouse or similar handheld input device. This can be used to verify identity or screen for malfeasant activities. Online chess playing platforms collect data of this nature—okay we could not resist adding chess example. </p>
<p>
Another area is experiments designed to simulate attacks and test defenses against them. Schneider’s paper begins with a contrast between <em>predictive</em> modeling versus <em>reactive</em> handling of them. About the latter, he draws an analogy with health care:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some health problems are best handled in a reactive manner. We know what to do when somebody breaks a finger, and each year we create a new influenza vaccine in anticipation of the flu season to come. But only after making significant investments in basic medical sciences are we starting to understand the mechanisms by which cancers grow, and a cure seems to require that kind of deep understanding.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
He goes on to outline the kind of scientific foundation that could hopefully underlie a ‘cure’ for intrusion and malware and the like. </p>
<p>
What we have seen happen especially in the past months, however—in both health and security—is uncontrolled experiments with society as the domain. Large-scale ransomware attacks are becoming as frequent as hurricanes and heat waves. And of course, the pandemic. These share with Altuve the property of being one-off instances, but have large data on the receiving end.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Summer Pandemic Update </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The following chart updates our June 20 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/">post</a> on the state of the pandemic and its projection for the summer—for Florida and the United Kingdom in particular:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/07/13/socially-reproduced-experiments/flukcases071321/" rel="attachment wp-att-18955"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18955" height="440" src="https://i2.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FLUKCases071321.png?resize=450%2C440&amp;ssl=1" width="450"/></a></p>
<p>
The vertical line shows about where the charts were on June 20. The past few days are the first where we can point to a significant rise in Florida, though Missouri had a similar rise last week and it is showing up in some other states.  The charts are taken from the <em>Worldometer</em> coronavirus <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">pages</a>. </p>
<p>
The UK rise looks ghastly. It was a subtext of our previous post to worry that allowing the large dense soccer crowds at London’s Wembley Stadium for the semis and final—and anything similar in baseball—would stoke the rise in our respective countries even more. However, the rate of hospitalizations in the UK has remained largely flat. This Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/08/kids-vulnerable-covid-delta-variant-vaccinated-europe/">article</a> last week is one of several attesting that the new cases are mostly in children or in vaccinated people with enough immunity to contain the “breakthrough” positive. The UK is going ahead with large-scale re-openings later this month, with the portion of those 18 and older who have had one dose approaching 90% and those fully vaccinated coming past 70%. The latter number in relation to the whole population is about 52%.</p>
<p>
The US looks like becoming an experiment in how the local vaccination rate affects the numbers. The rates of those fully vaccinated by state are currently eerily <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/politics/electoral-map-vaccine-map-covid-19/index.html">similar</a> to Joe Biden’s vote percentage in the state. One aspect of scientific reproducibility is the size of the simplest classifier of the results. For a presidential vote to have simpler explaining power than any factors of biology or other life circumstances would make a strange experiment indeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dick and I tried to come up with other examples—from computer security in particular—to sustain what has been occupying our thoughts about standards of proof for policy. We would welcome some examples from you, our readers. </p>
<p>
And of course, we have been concerned about the present course of the pandemic amid re-openings since the referenced post last month. In the meantime, if it is your taste, please enjoy the All-Star Game, which Altuve is, ironically, <a href="https://calltothepen.com/2021/07/11/houston-astros-officially-skipping-star-game/">skipping</a>.</p>

    <title>TR21-102 |  Tight bounds on the Fourier growth of bounded functions on the hypercube | 

	Siddharth Iyer, 

	Anup Rao, 

	Victor Reis, 

	Thomas Rothvoss, 

	Amir Yehudayoff</title>
    <summary>We give tight bounds on the degree $\ell$  homogenous parts $f_\ell$ of a bounded function $f$ on the cube. We show that if $f: \{\pm 1\}^n \rightarrow [-1,1]$ has degree $d$, then $\| f_\ell \|_\infty$ is bounded by $d^\ell/\ell!$, and $\| \hat{f}_\ell \|_1$ is bounded by $d^\ell e^{{\ell+1 \choose 2}} n^{\frac{\ell-1}{2}}$. We describe applications to pseudorandomness and learning theory. We use similar methods to generalize the classical Pisier's inequality from convex analysis. Our analysis  involves properties of real-rooted polynomials that may be useful elsewhere.</summary>

    <title>TR21-101 |  A Parallel Repetition Theorem for the GHZ Game: A Simpler Proof | 

	Uma Girish, 

	Justin Holmgren, 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Ran Raz, 

	Wei Zhan</title>
    <summary>We give a new proof of the fact that the parallel repetition of the (3-player) GHZ game reduces the value of the game to zero polynomially quickly. That is, we show that the value of the $n$-fold GHZ game is at most $n^{-\Omega(1)}$. This was first established by Holmgren and Raz [HR20]. We present a new proof of this theorem that we believe to be simpler and more direct. Unlike most previous works on parallel repetition, our proof makes no use of information theory, and relies on the use of Fourier analysis.

The GHZ game [GHZ89] has played a foundational role in the understanding of quantum information theory, due in part to the fact that quantum strategies can win the GHZ game with probability $1$. It is possible that improved parallel repetition bounds may find applications in this setting.

Recently, Dinur, Harsha, Venkat, and Yuen [DHVY17] highlighted the GHZ game as a simple three-player game, which is in some sense maximally far from the class of multi-player games whose behavior under parallel repetition is well understood. Dinur et al. conjectured that parallel repetition decreases the value of the GHZ game exponentially quickly, and speculated that progress on proving this would shed light on parallel repetition for general multi-player (multi-prover) games.</summary>

    <title>A Better Privacy Analysis of the Exponential Mechanism</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A basic and frequent task in data analysis is <em>selection</em> – given a set of options \(\mathcal{Y}\), output the (approximately) best one, where “best” is defined by some loss function \(\ell : \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathbb{R}\) and a dataset \(x \in \mathcal{X}^n\). That is, we want to output some \(y \in \mathcal{Y}\) that approximately minimizes \(\ell(y,x)\). Naturally, we are interested in <em>private selection</em> – i.e., the output should be differentially private in terms of the dataset \(x\).
This post discusses algorithms for private selection – in particular, we give an improved privacy analysis of the popular exponential mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="the-exponential-mechanism">The Exponential Mechanism</h2>

<p>The most well-known algorithm for private selection is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_mechanism_(differential_privacy)"><em>exponential mechanism</em></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCS.2007.66" title="Frank McSherry, Kunal Talwar. Mechanism Design via Differential Privacy. FOCS 2007."><strong>[MT07]</strong></a>. The exponential mechanism \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y} \) is a randomized algorithm given by \[\forall x \in \mathcal{X}^n ~ \forall y \in \mathcal{Y} ~~~~~ \mathbb{P}[M(x) = y] = \frac{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y,x))}{\sum_{y’ \in \mathcal{Y}} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x)) }, \tag{1}\] where \(\Delta\) is the sensitivity of the loss function \(\ell\) given by \[\Delta = \sup_{x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n : d(x,x’) \le 1} \max_{y\in\mathcal{Y}} |\ell(y,x) - \ell(y,x’)|,\tag{2}\] where the supremum is taken over all datasets \(x\) and \(x’\) differing on the data of a single individual (which we denote by \(d(x,x’)\le 1\)).</p>

<p>In terms of utility, we can easily show that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02513" title="Raef Bassily, Kobbi Nissim, Adam Smith, Thomas Steinke, Uri Stemmer, Jonathan Ullman. Algorithmic Stability for Adaptive Data Analysis. STOC 2016."><strong>[BNSSSU16]</strong></a> \[\mathbb{E}[\ell(M(x),x)] \le \min_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \ell(y,x) + \frac{2\Delta}{\varepsilon} \log |\mathcal{Y}|\] for all \(x \in \mathcal{X}^n\) (and we can also give high probability bounds).</p>

<p>It is easy to show that the exponential mechanism satisfies \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy.
But there is more to this story! We’re going to look at a more refined privacy analysis.</p>

<h2 id="bounded-range">Bounded Range</h2>

<p>The privacy guarantee of the exponential mechanism is more precisely characterized by <em>bounded range</em>. This was observed and defined by David Durfee and Ryan Rogers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04273" title="David Durfee, Ryan Rogers. Practical Differentially Private Top-k Selection with Pay-what-you-get Composition. NeurIPS 2019"><strong>[DR19]</strong></a> and further analyzed later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13830" title="Jinshuo Dong, David Durfee, Ryan Rogers. Optimal Differential Privacy Composition for Exponential Mechanisms. ICML 2020."><strong>[DDR20]</strong></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition 1 (Bounded Range).</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> 
A randomized algorithm \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\) satisfies \(\eta\)-bounded range if, for all pairs of inputs \(x, x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing only on the data of a single individual, there exists some \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \[\forall y \in \mathcal{Y} ~~~~~ \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]}\right) \in [t, t+\eta].\] Here \(t\) may depend on the pair of input datasets \(x,x’\), but not on the output \(y\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To interpret this definition, we <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/flavoursofdelta/">recall the definition of the privacy loss random variable</a>: Define \(f : \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}\) by \[f(y) = \log\left(\frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]}\right).\] Then the privacy loss random variable \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) is given by \(Z = f(M(x))\).</p>

<p>Pure \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy is equivalent to demanding that the privacy loss is bounded by \(\varepsilon\) – i.e., \(\mathbb{P}[|Z|\le\varepsilon]=1\). Approximate \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-differential privacy is, roughly, equivalent to demanding that \(\mathbb{P}[Z\le\varepsilon]\ge1-\delta\).<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Now \(\eta\)-bounded range is simply demanding that the privacy loss \(Z\) is supported on some interval of length \(\eta\). This interval \([t,t+\eta]\) may depend on the pair \(x,x’\).</p>

<p>Bounded range and pure differential privacy are equivalent up to a factor of 2 in the parameters:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 2 (Bounded Range versus Pure Differential Privacy).</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>\(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\eta\)-bounded range with \(\eta \le 2\varepsilon\).</li>
    <li>\(\eta\)-bounded range implies \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy with \(\varepsilon \le \eta\).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em> The first part of the equivalence follows from the fact that pure \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies the privacy loss is supported on the interval \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\). Thus, if we set \(t=-\varepsilon\) and \(\eta=2\varepsilon\), then \([t,t+\eta] = [-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\).
The second part follows from the fact that the support of the privacy loss \([t,t+\eta]\) must straddle \(0\). That is, the privacy loss cannot be always positive nor always negative, so \(0 \in [t,t+\eta]\) and, hence, \([t,t+\eta] \subseteq [-\eta,\eta]\). Otherwise \(\forall y ~ f(y)&gt;0\) or \(\forall y ~ f(y)&lt;0\)  would imply \(\forall y ~ \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]&gt;\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]\) or \(\forall y ~ \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]&lt;\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]\), contradicting the fact that \(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \mathbb{P}[M(x)=y] = 1\) and \(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y] = 1\). ∎</p>

<p>OK, back to the exponential mechanism:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 3 (The Exponential Mechanism is Bounded Range).</strong>
The exponential mechanism (given in Equation 1 above) satisfies \(\varepsilon\)-bounded range .<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em>
We have \[e^{f(y)} = \frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x)=y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)=y]} = \frac{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta}\ell(y,x))}{\exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta}\ell(y,x’))} \cdot \frac{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x’))}{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x))}.\]
Setting \(t = \log\left(\frac{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x’))}{\sum_{y’} \exp(-\frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} \ell(y’,x))}\right) - \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\), we have \[ f(y) = \frac{\varepsilon}{2\Delta} (\ell(y,x’)-\ell(y,x)+\Delta) + t.\]
By the definition of sensitivity (given in Equation 2), we have \( 0 \le \ell(y,x’)-\ell(y,x)+\Delta \le 2\Delta\), whence \(t \le f(y) \le t + \varepsilon\). ∎</p>

<p>Bounded range is not really a useful privacy definition on its own. Thus we’re going to relate it to a relaxed version of differential privacy next.</p>

<h2 id="concentrated-differential-privacy">Concentrated Differential Privacy</h2>

<p>Concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a> and its variants <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01887" title="Cynthia Dwork, Guy N. Rothblum. Concentrated Differential Privacy. 2016."><strong>[DR16]</strong></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476" title="Ilya Mironov. R&#xE9;nyi Differential Privacy. CCS 2017."><strong>[M17]</strong></a> are relaxations of pure differential privacy with many nice properties. In particular, it composes very cleanly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition 4 (Concentrated Differential Privacy).</strong>
A randomized algorithm \(M : \mathcal{X}^n \to \mathcal{Y}\) satisfies \(\rho\)-concentrated differential privacy if, for all pairs of inputs \(x, x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing only on the data of a single individual, 
\[\forall \lambda &gt; 0 ~~~~~ \mathbb{E}[\exp( \lambda Z)] \le \exp(\lambda(\lambda+1)\rho),\tag{3}\]
where \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) is the privacy loss random variable.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, concentrated differential privacy requires that the privacy loss is subgaussian. Specifically, the bound on the moment generating function of \(\rho\)-concentrated differential privacy is tight if the privacy loss \(Z\) follows the distribution \(\mathcal{N}(\rho,2\rho)\). Indeed, the privacy loss random variable of the Gaussian mechanism has such a distribution.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>OK, back to the exponential mechanism:
We know that \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a>.
This, of course, applies to the exponential mechaism. A cool fact – that we want to draw more attention to – is that we can do better! 
Specifically, \(\eta\)-bounded range implies \(\frac18 \eta^2\)-concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07223" title="Mark Cesar, Ryan Rogers. Bounding, Concentrating, and Truncating: Unifying Privacy Loss Composition for Data Analytics. ALT 2021."><strong>[CR21]</strong></a>.
What follows is a proof of this fact following that of Mark Cesar and Ryan Rogers, but with some simplification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 5 (Bounded Range implies Concentrated Differential Privacy).</strong>
If \(M\) is \(\eta\)-bounded range, then it is \(\frac18\eta^2\)-concentrated differentially private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Proof.</em>
Fix datasets \(x,x’ \in \mathcal{X}^n\) differing on a single individual’s data.
Let \(Z \gets \mathsf{PrivLoss}(M(x)\|M(x’))\) be the privacy loss random variable of the mechanism \(M\) on this pair of datasets.
By the definition of bounded range (Definition 1), there exists some \(t \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(Z \in [t, t+\eta]\) with probability 1.
Now we employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_lemma">Hoeffding’s Lemma</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080%2F01621459.1963.10500830" title="Wassily Hoeffding. Probability inequalities for sums of bounded random variables. JASA 1963."><strong>[H63]</strong></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Lemma 6 (Hoeffding’s Lemma).</strong>
Let \(X\) be a random variable supported on the interval \([a,b]\). Then, for all \(\lambda \in \mathbb{R}\), we have \[\mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda X)] \le \exp \left( \mathbb{E}[X] \cdot \lambda + \frac{(b-a)^2}{8} \cdot \lambda^2 \right).\]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying the lemma to the privacy loss gives \[\forall \lambda \in \mathbb{R} ~~~~~  \mathbb{E}[\exp(\lambda Z)] \le \exp \left( \mathbb{E}[Z] \cdot \lambda + \frac{\eta^2}{8} \cdot \lambda^2 \right).\]
The only remaining thing we need is to show is that \(\mathbb{E}[Z] \le \frac18 \eta^2\).<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>If we set \(\lambda = -1 \), then we get \( \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)] \le \exp \left( -\mathbb{E}[Z] + \frac{\eta^2}{8} \right)\), which rearranges to \(\mathbb{E}[Z] \le \frac18 \eta^2 - \log \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)]\). 
Now we have \[ \mathbb{E}[\exp( - Z)] \!=\! \sum_y \mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y] \exp(-f(y)) \!=\! \sum_y \mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y]  \!\cdot\! \frac{\mathbb{P}[M(x’)\!=\!y]}{\mathbb{P}[M(x)\!=\!y]} \!=\! 1.\]
∎</p>

<p>This brings us to the TL;DR of this post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Corollary 7.</strong> The exponential mechanism (given by Equation 1) is \(\frac18 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differentially private.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is great news. The standard analysis only gives \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy. Constants matter when applying differential privacy, and we save a factor of 4 in the concentrated differential privacy analysis of the exponential mechanism for free with this improved analysis.</p>

<p>Combining Lemma 2 with Theorem 5 also gives a simpler proof of the conversion from pure differential privacy to concentrated differential privacy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun, Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016."><strong>[BS16]</strong></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Corollary 8.</strong> \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy implies \(\frac12 \varepsilon^2\)-concentrated differential privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="beyond-the-exponential-mechanism">Beyond the Exponential Mechanism</h2>

<p>The exponential mechanism is not the only algorithm for private selection. A closely-related algorithm is <em>report noisy max/min</em>:<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Draw independent noise \(\xi_y\) from some distribution for each \(y \in \mathcal{Y}\) then output \[M(x) = \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\mathrm{argmin}} ~ \ell(y,x) - \xi_y.\]</p>

<p>If the noise distribution is an appropriate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbel_distribution">Gumbel distribution</a>, then report noisy max is exactly the exponential mechanism. (This equivalence is known as the “Gumbel max trick.”)</p>

<p>We can also use the Laplace distribution or the exponential distribution. Report noisy max with the exponential distribution is equivalent to the <em>permute and flip</em> algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12603" title="Ryan McKenna, Daniel Sheldon. Permute-and-Flip: A new mechanism for differentially private selection . NeurIPS 2020."><strong>[MS20]</strong></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07260" title="Zeyu Ding, Daniel Kifer, Sayed M. Saghaian N. E., Thomas Steinke, Yuxin Wang, Yingtai Xiao, Danfeng Zhang. The Permute-and-Flip Mechanism is Identical to Report-Noisy-Max with Exponential Noise. 2021."><strong>[DKSSWXZ21]</strong></a>. However, these algorithms don’t enjoy the same improved bounded range and concentrated differential privacy guarantees as the exponential mechanism.</p>

<p>There are also other variants of the selection problem. For example, in some cases we can assume that only a few options have low loss and the rest of the options have high loss – i.e., there is a gap between the minimum loss and the second-lowest loss (or, more generally, the \(k\)-th lowest loss). In this case there are algorithms that attain better accuracy than the exponential mechanism under relaxed privacy definitions <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2177" title="Kamalika Chaudhuri, Daniel Hsu, Shuang Song. The Large Margin Mechanism for Differentially Private Maximization.

<p>There are a lot of interesting aspects of private selection, including questions for further research! We hope to have further posts about some of these topics.</p>

    <title>TR21-100 |  Karchmer-Wigderson Games for Hazard-free Computation | 

	Christian Ikenmeyer, 

	Balagopal Komarath, 

	Nitin Saurabh</title>
    <summary>We present a Karchmer-Wigderson game to study the complexity of hazard-free formulas. This new game is both a generalization of the monotone Karchmer-Wigderson game and an analog of the classical Boolean Karchmer-Wigderson game. Therefore, it acts as a bridge between the existing monotone and general games.

Using this game, we prove hazard-free formula size and depth lower bounds that are provably stronger than those possible by the standard technique of transferring results from monotone complexity in a black-box fashion.
For the multiplexer function
we give (1) a hazard-free formula of optimal size and (2) an improved low-depth hazard-free formula of almost optimal size and (3) a hazard-free formula with alternation depth $2$ that has optimal depth.
We then use our optimal constructions to obtain an improved universal worst-case hazard-free formula size upper bound.
We see our results as a significant step towards establishing hazard-free computation as an independent missing link between Boolean complexity and monotone complexity.</summary>

    <title>Would you take this bet (Part 2) ?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Recall from my last post (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/07/would-you-take-this-bet-part-1.html">here</a>)</p><p><br/></p><p>I offer you the following bet: </p><p>I will flip a coin.</p><p>If  HEADS you get 1 dollar and we end there.</p><p>If TAILS I flip again</p><p><br/></p><p>If  HEADS you get 2 dollars and we end there.</p><p>If  TAILS I flip again</p><p><br/></p><p>If HEADS you get 4 dollars and we end there.</p><p>If TAILS I flip again</p><p><br/></p><p>The expected value is infinity.</p><p><br/></p><p>Would you pay $1000 to play this game?</p><p>Everyone who responded said NO. Most gave reasons similar to what I have below. </p><p>This is called The St Petersburg Paradox. Not sure it's a paradox, but it is odd. The concrete question of <i>would you pay $1000 to play</i> might be a paradox since most people would say NO even though the expected value is infinity.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">here</a> for more background.</p><p>Shapley (see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022053177901429">here</a>) gives a good reason why you would not  pay $1000 to play the game, and also how much you should pay to play the game (spoiler alert: not much). I will summarize his argument and then add to it. </p><p><br/></p><p>1) Shapley's argument: Lets say the game goes for 40 rounds. Then you are owed 2^{40} dollars. </p><p>The amount of money in the world is, according to <a href="https://bibloteka.com/how-much-money-is-there-in-the-world/#:~:text=Short%20Answer%3A%20Money%20in%20circulation%20in%20the%20world,the%20medium%20of%20trade%20for%20goods%20and%20services.">this article</a> around 1.2 quadrillion dollars  which is roughly 2^{40} dollars. </p><p>So the expected value calculation has to be capped at (say) 40 rounds. This means you expect to get 20 dollars! So pay 19 to play. </p><p><br/></p><p>2) My angle which is very similar: at what point is more money not going to change your life at all? For me it is way less than 2^{40} dollars. Hence I would not pay 1000. Or even 20. </p><p><i>Exercise</i>: If you think the game will go at most R rounds and you only wand D dollars, how much should you pay to play? You can also juggle more parameters - the bias of the coin, how much they pay out when you win. </p><p>Does Shapley's discussions  <i>resolve</i> the paradox? It depends on what you consider paradoxical. If the paradox is that people would NOT pay 1000 even though the expected value is infinity, then Shapley  resolves the paradox  by contrasting the real world to the math world. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR21-099 |  Improved Product-Based High-Dimensional Expanders | 

	Louis Golowich</title>
    <summary>High-dimensional expanders generalize the notion of expander graphs to higher-dimensional simplicial complexes. In contrast to expander graphs, only a handful of high-dimensional expander constructions have been proposed, and no elementary combinatorial construction with near-optimal expansion is known. In this paper, we introduce an improved combinatorial high-dimensional expander construction, by modifying a previous construction of Liu, Mohanty, and Yang (ITCS 2020), which is based on a high-dimensional variant of a tensor product. Our construction achieves a spectral gap of $\Omega(\frac{1}{k^2})$ for random walks on the $k$-dimensional faces, which is only quadratically worse than the optimal bound of $\Theta(\frac{1}{k})$. Previous combinatorial constructions, including that of Liu, Mohanty, and Yang, only achieved a spectral gap that is exponentially small in $k$. We also present reasoning that suggests our construction is optimal among similar product-based constructions.</summary>

    <title>TR21-098 |  On the Probabilistic Degree of an $n$-variate Boolean Function | 

	Srikanth Srinivasan, 

	S Venkitesh</title>
    <summary>Nisan and Szegedy (CC 1994) showed that any Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ that depends on all its input variables, when represented as a real-valued multivariate polynomial $P(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$, has degree at least $\log n - O(\log \log n)$. This was improved to a tight $(\log n - O(1))$ bound by Chiarelli, Hatami and Saks (Combinatorica 2020). Similar statements are also known for other Boolean function complexity measures such as Sensitivity (Simon (FCT 1983)), Quantum query complexity, and Approximate degree (Ambainis and de Wolf (CC 2014)). 

In this paper, we address this question for \emph{Probabilistic degree}. The function $f$ has probabilistic degree at most $d$ if there is a random real-valued polynomial of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each input with high probability. Our understanding of this complexity measure is significantly weaker than those above: for instance, we do not even know the probabilistic degree of the OR function, the best-known bounds put it between $(\log n)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $O(\log n)$ (Beigel, Reingold, Spielman (STOC 1991); Tarui (TCS 1993); Harsha, Srinivasan (RSA 2019)).

Here we can give a near-optimal understanding of the probabilistic degree of $n$-variate functions $f$, \emph{modulo} our lack of understanding of the probabilistic degree of OR. We show that if the probabilistic degree of OR is $(\log n)^c$, then the minimum possible probabilistic degree of such an $f$ is at least $(\log n)^{c/(c+1)-o(1)}$, and we show this is tight up to $(\log n)^{o(1)}$ factors.</summary>

    <title>Angles of arc-triangles</title>
    <summary>Piecewise-circular curves or, if you like, arc-polygons are a very old topic in mathematics. Archimedes and Pappus studied the arbelos, a curved triangle formed from three semicircles, and Hippocrates of Chios found that the lune of Hippocrates, a two-sided figure bounded by a semicircle and a quarter-circle, has the same area as an isosceles right triangle stretched between the same two points. The history of the Reuleaux triangle, bounded by three sixths of circles, stretches back well past Reuleaux to the shapes of of Gothic church windows and its use by Leonardo da Vinci for fortress floor plans and world map projections. But despite their long history and frequent use (for instance in the design of machined parts), there are some basic properties of arc-polygons that seem to have been unexplored so far.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Piecewise-circular curves or, if you like, arc-polygons are a very old topic in mathematics.

The history of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangle</a>, bounded by three sixths of circles, stretches back well past Reuleaux to the shapes of of Gothic church windows and its use by Leonardo da Vinci for fortress floor plans and world map projections. But despite their long history and frequent use (for instance in the design of machined parts), there are some basic properties of arc-polygons that seem to have been unexplored so far.</p>

<p>I looked at one of these properties, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/05/09/arc-triangle-tilings.html">the ability of arc-triangles to tile the plane</a>, in an earlier post. Another of these properties involves the feasible combinations of angles of these shapes. As is well known, in a straight-sided triangle in the plane, the three interior angles always sum to exactly \(\pi\), and any three positive angles summing to \(\pi\) are possible. Let \(T\) be the set of triples of angles \((\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)\) from triangles, and reinterpret these triples as coordinates of points in Euclidean space. Then \(T\) is itself an equilateral triangle, with corners at the three points \((\pi,0,0)\), \((0,\pi,0)\), and \((0,0\pi)\). (More precisely, it’s the relative interior of this triangle.)</p>

<p>What about arc-triangles? Are their angles similarly constrained? What shape do their triples of angles make? First of all, their angles don’t have a fixed sum (except for the tilers, for which this sum is again \(\pi\)). The arbelos has three interior angles that are all zero, summing to zero. The Reuleux triangle has three angles of \(2\pi/3\), summing to \(2\pi\). <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/05/15/linkage.html">Boscovitch’s cardioid</a>, below, uses three semicircles like the arbelos, but with one interior angle of \(2\pi\) and two others equal to \(\pi\), summing to \(4\pi\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil">trefoil</a>, a common architectural motif, bulges outward from its three corners, forming interior angles that are much larger, up to \(2\pi\) each for a trefoil made from three \(5/6\)-circle arcs, for a total interior angle of \(6\pi\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Boscovich's cardioid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/boscovich.svg"/></p>

<p>Nevertheless, for a non-self-crossing arc-triangle, not all combinations of angles are possible. For instance, it’s not possible to have one angle that is zero and two that are \(2\pi\). My new preprint, “Angles of arc-polygons and lombardi drawings of cacti” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03615">arXiv:2107.03615
</a>, with UCI students Daniel Frishberg and Martha Osegueda, to appear at CCCG) proves a precise characterization: beyond the obvious requirement that each angle \(\theta_i\) be in the range \(0\le\theta_i\le 2\pi\), we have only the additional inequalities</p>

\[-\pi &lt; \frac{\pi - \theta_i + \theta_{i+1} - \theta_{i+2}}{2} &lt; \pi\]

<p>where the index arithmetic is done modulo three. The formula in the middle of each of these inequalities is itself an angle, the angle of incidence between one of the circular arcs of the arc-triangle and the circle through its three corners. Where the straight triangles had an equilateral-triangle feasible region, the arc-triangles have a more complicated shape. The obvious constraints \(0\le\theta_i\le 2\pi\) would produce a cubical feasible region \([0,2\pi]^3\), but the additional inequalities above cut off six corners of the cube, leaving a feasible region looking like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The feasible region for triples of angles of arc-triangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/feasible-arc-triangles.svg"/></p>

<p>The motivating application for all of this is graph drawing, and more specifically Lombardi drawing, in which edges are circular arcs meeting at equal angles at each vertex. Using our new understanding of arc-polygons, we prove that every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_graph">cactus graph</a> has a planar Lombardi drawing for its natural embedding (the one in which each cycle of the cactus forms a face) but might not for some other embeddings, including the one below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="An embedded cactus that has no planar Lombardi drawing" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/badhat.svg"/></p>

<p>But beyond graph drawing, I think that the long history and many applications of arc-polygons justifies more study of their general properties. For instance, what about arc-polygons with more than three sides? What can their angles be? Our paper has a partial answer, enough to answer the questions we asked in our Lombardi drawing application, but a complete characterization for arc-polygons of more than three sides is still open.</p>

    <title>TR21-097 |  Number of Variables for Graph Identification and the Resolution of GI Formulas | 

	Jacobo Toran, 

	Florian Wörz</title>
    <summary>We show that the number of variables and the quantifier depth needed to distinguish a pair of graphs by first-order logic sentences exactly match the complexity measures of clause width and positive depth needed to refute the corresponding graph isomorphism formula in propositional narrow resolution. 

Using this connection, we obtain upper and lower bounds for refuting graph  isomorphism formulas in (normal) resolution. In particular, we show that if $k$ is the minimum number of variables needed to distinguish two graphs with $n$ vertices each, then there is an $n^{\mathrm{O}(k)}$ resolution refutation size upper bound for the corresponding isomorphism formula, as well as lower bounds of $2^{k-1}$ and $k$ for the tree-like resolution size and resolution clause space for this formula. We also show a resolution size lower bound of ${\exp} \big( \Omega(k^2/n) \big)$ for the case of colored graphs with constant color class size.

Applying these results, we prove the first exponential lower bound for graph isomorphism formulas in the proof system SRC-1, a system that extends resolution with a global symmetry rule, thereby answering an open question posed by Schweitzer and Seebach.</summary>

    <title>Spanners for unit ball graphs in doubling spaces</title>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_space">Doubling metrics</a> are a generalization of Euclidean spaces. Like Euclidean spaces, they have a dimension, the <em>doubling dimension</em>, but it might not be an integer. Even the doubling dimension of the Euclidean plane itself is \(\log_2 7\approx 2.807355\); this means that every circular disk of radius \(r\) in the plane can be covered by seven closed disks of radius \(r/2\).</p>

<p>Analogously, the <em>doubling constant</em> of a metric space (if it exists) is the smallest number \(c\) such that every closed metric ball (the set of points within some radius \(r\) of a fixed point) can be covered by \(c\) balls of half the radius. The <em>doubling dimension</em> is the binary logarithm of the doubling constant. A metric space is a <em>doubling metric</em> or <em>doubling space</em> if it has a doubling constant and doubling dimension. This is true for all Euclidean spaces: for instance, if you cover a ball with a grid of hypercubes, sized small enough that their long diagonal has length at most the radius of the ball, you obtain doubling constant at most \(\lceil 2\sqrt{d}\rceil^d\), although it seems difficult to compute the precise doubling constant in general.</p>

<p>The hyperbolic plane provides a natural example of a space that is not a doubling space: arbitrarily large-radius disks require arbitrarily many half-radius disks to cover them.</p>

<p>Many results in computational geometry can be generalized to doubling metrics, but not always, and sometimes with difficulty. That includes results on spanners, as we consider in our paper. A spanner of a weighted graph is a subgraph whose shortest path distances approximate the distances in the full graph, and often for spanners of metric spaces one uses the complete graph, weighted by the metric distance between each pair of points. But here, we are using a different graph, the unit ball graph. The unit ball graph, for points in a continuous space, has an edge whenever two unit balls centered at two of the points have a nonempty intersection, and it can be extended to discrete point sets by instead including an edge whenever two points are at distance at most 2 (or, as in our paper, distance at most 1; scaling doesn’t really change anything). The weights are the same as in the complete graph. If a spanner accurately approximates all edge weights, it approximates all paths.</p>

<p>The unit ball graph has fewer edges to approximate than the complete graph. But that actually makes it harder to approximate, because by the same token there are fewer edges that can be used in the spanner. Despite that, the greedy spanner algorithm still produces a spanner, but one of its key properties is lost when going from Euclidean to doubling spaces: Euclidean greedy spanners have bounded degree, but greedy spanners in doubling spaces do not. Instead, our paper provides different spanner algorithms that apply to unit ball graphs, approximate paths in these graphs arbitrarily well, have bounded degree, have total weight a constant times that of the minimum spanning tree, and can be constructed efficiently in a distributed model of computing. I think the details are too technical to go into here, so see the paper for more.</p>
