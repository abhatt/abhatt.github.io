    <title>The World of Publishing</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bill is out for blogging for a couple of weeks on injured-reserve (he’ll be fine). I put together a quick blog post on what’s happening in the world of publications. <br/>
<br/>
The Trump administration has suggested requiring publishers to make all papers based on US federally-funded publicly available immediately instead of after one year. The Association of American Publishers sent an <a href="https://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1508/lettertothepresidentfrom140researchandpublishingorgs-2.pdf?10000">open letter</a>--how do we maintain the organizations and the people who work there if we give up a major revenue source. The ACM joined the letter which caused quite a backlash forcing the ACM to <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/january/message-from-the-acm-president-regarding-open-access">explain itself</a>, write another <a href="https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-letter-to-ostp.pdf">letter</a>, and run some <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2020/january/oa-webinars">webinars</a> about open access the last of which is tomorrow. In the end, this is leading to some good discussions about open access and the financial models of academic societies. <br/>
<br/>
The ACM also has a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author-name-changes">new policy</a>, three options for what happens when an author changes their name: Maintain separate identities, have the two identities link to each other, or retroactively change the name on all previous papers. I can see good reasons for all three options.<br/>
<br/>
Finally Moshe Vardi writes in his <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">CACM column</a> about the ecological cost of conferences and suggests that conferences allow authors to (video)phone it in. Emmanuel Viola offers <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/01/01/publish-and-perish/">his own thoughts</a>. Most Conferences will continue to require authors to show up, with only occasional exceptions as needed, believing these policies will keep their conference healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I believe conferences should exist because researchers want to attend, not because they have to. We still need conferences so our community can get together and I don’t believe we can do that via the Internet no matter how good the VR experience gets. But we can have more videos and less conferences and reduce the costs: time, financial and environmental.</div>

    <title>AMSNP: a tame fragment of existential second-order logic</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bodirsky:Manuel.html">Manuel Bodirsky</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kn=auml=uer:Simon.html">Simon Knäuer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Starke:Florian.html">Florian Starke</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08190">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Amalgamation monotone SNP (AMSNP) is a fragment of existential second-order
logic that strictly contains the logics (connected) MMSNP of Feder and Vardi
and guarded monotone SNP of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter; it is a
promising candidate for an expressive subclass of NP that exhibits a complexity
dichotomy. We show that AMSNP has a complexity dichotomy if and only if
Constraint Satisfaction Problems for reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous
structures have a complexity dichotomy. For such CSPs, powerful
universal-algebraic hardness conditions are known that are conjectured to
describe the border between NP-hard and polynomial-time tractable CSPs. The
connection to CSPs also implies that every AMSNP sentence can be evaluated in
polynomial time on classes of finite structures of bounded treewidth. We show
that the syntax of AMSNP is decidable. The proof relies on the following fact,
which we believe is of independent interest in model theory: for classes of
finite structures given by finitely many forbidden substructures, the
amalgamation property is decidable.

parametrized by {measures that are restrictions of} clique-width, such as
modular-width and neighborhood diversity. The main contribution of this paper
is to introduce a novel parameter, called iterated type partition, that can be
computed in polynomial time and nicely places between modular-width and
neighborhood diversity. We prove that the Equitable Coloring problem is
W[1]-hard when parametrized by the iterated type partition. This result extends
to modular-width, answering an open question about the possibility to have FPT
algorithms for Equitable Coloring when parametrized by modular-width. Moreover,
we show that the Equitable Coloring problem is instead FTP when parameterized
by neighborhood diversity. Furthermore, we present simple and fast FPT
algorithms parameterized by iterated type partition that provide optimal
solutions for several graph problems; in particular, this paper presents
algorithms for the Dominating Set, the Vertex Coloring and the Vertex Cover
problems. While the above problems are already known to be FPT with respect to
modular-width, the novel algorithms are both simpler and more efficient: For
the Dominating set and Vertex Cover problems, our algorithms output an optimal
set in time $O(2^t+poly(n))$, while for the Vertex Coloring problem, our
algorithm outputs an optimal set in time $O(t^{2.5t+o(t)}\log n+poly(n))$,
where $n$ and $t$ are the size and the iterated type partition of the input
graph, respectively.

    <title>Chirotopes of Random Points in Space are Realizable on a Small Integer Grid</title>

convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be rounded to points on a grid of step size
proportional to $1/n^{d+1+\epsilon}$ without changing the underlying chirotope
(oriented matroid). Therefore, chirotopes of random point sets can be encoded
with $O(n\log n)$ bits. This is in stark contrast to the worst case, where the
grid may be forced to have step size $1/2^{2^{\Omega(n)}}$ even for $d=2$.

learning and geometric inference from point clouds. This paper relates the
reach of a submanifold to its convexity defect function. Using the stability
properties of convexity defect functions, along with some new bounds and the
recent submanifold estimator of Aamari and Levrard [Ann. Statist. 47 177-204
(2019)], an estimator for the reach is given. A uniform expected loss bound
over a C^k model is found. Lower bounds for the minimax rate for estimating the
reach over these models are also provided. The estimator almost achieves these
rates in the C^3 and C^4 cases, with a gap given by a logarithmic factor.

problems that are nonconvex in one variable and strongly-concave in the other
variable. Such minimax optimization problems have attracted significant
attention lately due to their applications in modern machine learning tasks. We
first design and analyze the Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent Ascent
(\texttt{ZO-GDA}) algorithm, and provide improved results compared to existing
works, in terms of oracle complexity. Next, we propose the Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent Multi-Step Ascent (\texttt{ZO-GDMSA}) algorithm that
significantly improves the oracle complexity of \texttt{ZO-GDA}. We also
provide stochastic version of \texttt{ZO-GDA} and \texttt{ZO-GDMSA} to handle
stochastic nonconvex minimax problems, and provide oracle complexity results.

    <title>Lower Bounds Against Sparse Symmetric Functions of ACC Circuits: Expanding the Reach of $\#$SAT Algorithms</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1579737600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/v/Vyas:Nikhil.html">Nikhil Vyas</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Williams:Ryan.html">Ryan Williams</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07788">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We continue the program of proving circuit lower bounds via circuit
satisfiability algorithms. So far, this program has yielded several concrete
results, proving that functions in $\text{Quasi-NP} = \text{NTIME}[n^{(\log
n)^{O(1)}}]$ and $\text{NEXP}$ do not have small circuits from various circuit
classes ${\cal C}$, by showing that ${\cal C}$ admits non-trivial
satisfiability and/or $\#$SAT algorithms which beat exhaustive search by a
minor amount.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new strong lower bound consequence of non-trivial
$\#$SAT algorithm for a circuit class ${\mathcal C}$. Say a symmetric Boolean
function $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is sparse if it outputs $1$ on $O(1)$ values of
$\sum_i x_i$. We show that for every sparse $f$, and for all "typical" ${\cal
C}$, faster $\#$SAT algorithms for ${\cal C}$ circuits actually imply lower
bounds against the circuit class $f \circ {\cal C}$, which may be stronger than
${\cal C}$ itself. In particular:
</p>
<p>$\#$SAT algorithms for $n^k$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in $2^n/n^k$
time (for all $k$) imply $\text{NEXP}$ does not have $f \circ {\cal
C}$-circuits of polynomial size.
</p>
<p>$\#$SAT algorithms for $2^{n^{\epsilon}}$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in
$2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ time (for some $\epsilon &gt; 0$) imply $\text{Quasi-NP}$
does not have $f \circ {\cal C}$-circuits of polynomial size.
</p>
<p>Applying $\#$SAT algorithms from the literature, one immediate corollary of
our results is that $\text{Quasi-NP}$ does not have $\text{EMAJ} \circ
\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ circuits of polynomial size, where $\text{EMAJ}$
is the "exact majority" function, improving previous lower bounds against
$\text{ACC}^0$ [Williams JACM'14] and $\text{ACC}^0 \circ \text{THR}$ [Williams
STOC'14], [Murray-Williams STOC'18]. This is the first nontrivial lower bound
against such a circuit class.

    <title>Scheduling for Weighted Flow and Completion Times in Reconfigurable Networks</title>

dynamically, rather than setting them once and for all. This is true in both
optical wide area networks (optical WANs) and in datacenters, despite the many
differences between these two settings. Because of these new technologies,
there has been a surge of both practical and theoretical research on algorithms
to take advantage of them. In particular, Jia et al. [INFOCOM '17] designed
online scheduling algorithms for dynamically reconfigurable topologies for both
the makespan and sum of completion times objectives. In this paper, we work in
the same setting but study an objective that is more meaningful in an online
setting: the sum of flow times. The flow time of a job is the total amount of
time that it spends in the system, which may be considerably smaller than its
completion time if it is released late. We provide competitive algorithms for
the online setting with speed augmentation, and also give a lower bound proving
that speed augmentation is in fact necessary. As a side effect of our
techniques, we also improve and generalize the results of Jia et al. on
completion times by giving an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for arbitrary sizes
and release times even when nodes have different degree bounds, and moreover
allow for the weighted sum of completion times (or flow times).

completion of an arbitrary graph into a cograph. The first one is able to do so
while providing an additional property which is crucial in practice to obtain
inclusion-minimal completions using as few edges as possible : it is able to
compute a minimum-cardinality completion of the neighbourhood of the new vertex
introduced at each incremental step. It runs in $O(n+m')$ time, where $m'$ is
the number of edges in the completed graph. This matches the complexity of the
algorithm in [Lokshtanov, Mancini and Papadopoulos 2010] and positively answers
one of their open questions. Our second algorithm improves the complexity of
inclusion-minimal completion to $O(n+m\log^2 n)$ when the additional property
above is not required. Moreover, we prove that many very sparse graphs, having
only $O(n)$ edges, require $\Omega(n^2)$ edges in any of their cograph
completions. For these graphs, which include many of those encountered in
applications, the improvement we obtain on the complexity scales as $O(n/\log^2
n)$.

    <title>Closed form distance formula for the balanced multiple travelling salesmen</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1579737600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Garn:Wolfgang.html">Wolfgang Garn</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07749">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>As a first contribution the mTSP is solved using an exact method and two
heuristics, where the number of nodes per route is balanced. The first
heuristic uses a nearest node approach and the second assigns the closest
vehicle (salesman). A comparison of heuristics with test-instances being in the
Euclidean plane showed similar solution quality and runtime. On average, the
nearest node solutions are approximately one percent better. The closest
vehicle heuristic is especially important when the nodes (customers) are not
known in advance, e.g. for online routing. Whilst the nearest node is
preferable when one vehicle has to be used multiple times to service all
customers. The second contribution is a closed form formula that describes the
mTSP distance dependent on the number of vehicles and customers. Increasing the
number of salesman results in an approximately linear distance growth for
uniformly distributed nodes in a Euclidean grid plane. The distance growth is
almost proportional to the square root of number of customers (nodes). These
two insights are combined in a single formula. The minimum distance of a node
to $n$ uniformly distributed random (real and integer) points was derived and
expressed as functional relationship dependent on the number of vehicles. This
gives theoretical underpinnings and is in agreement with the distances found
via the previous mTSP heuristics. Hence, this allows to compute all expected
mTSP distances without the need of running the heuristics.

much graphs can be sparsified while faithfully preserving their properties.
Examples include spanners, distance preservers, reachability preservers, etc.
We introduce an abstraction that captures all of the above, and then we prove a
couple simple structural lemmas about this abstraction. These imply unified
proofs of some state-of-the-art results in the area, and they improve the size
of Chechik's $+4$ additive spanner [SODA '13] from $\widetilde{O}(n^{7/5})$ to
$O(n^{7/5})$.

<p>Title: The lower tail for triangles in random graphs</p>
<p>Abstract:<br/>
Let <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X"/> denote the number of triangles in the random graph <img alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}"/>. The problem of determining the asymptotics of the logarithmic lower tail probability of~<img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="X"/>, that is, the function <img alt="f_c(n,p) = - \log Pr(X \le c \mathbb E [X])" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29+%3D+-+%5Clog+Pr%28X+%5Cle+c+%5Cmathbb+E+%5BX%5D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_c(n,p) = - \log Pr(X \le c \mathbb E [X])"/>, for <img alt="c \in [0,1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%5Cin+%5B0%2C1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="c \in [0,1)"/>, has attracted considerable attention of both the combinatorics and the probability communities. In this talk, we explain how one can bound <img alt="f_c(n,p)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_c(n,p)"/> from above by solving a natural combinatorial optimisation problem that generalises Mantel’s / Turán’s theorem. Moreover, we will prove a matching lower bound on <img alt="f_c(n,p)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_c%28n%2Cp%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_c(n,p)"/> in the case <img alt="p = 1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3D+1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p = 1/2"/>. Our argument, which employs ideas from an earlier joint work with Gady Kozma, Tom Meyerovitch, and Ron Peled, exploits connections between entropy and independence.</p>
<p>This is joint work with Gady Kozma.</p></div>

<p>They are looking for applications from students, postdocs, and young researchers in physics &amp; math, as well computer scientists. While I am biased (I will be lecturing there too) I think the combination of lecturers, speakers, and audience members will yield a very unique opportunity for interaction across communities, and strongly encourage theoretical computer scientists to apply (which you can from the <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/">website</a>). Let me also use this opportunity to remind people again of <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/03/30/physics-computation-blog-post-round-up/">Tselil Schramm’s blog post</a> where she collected some of the lecture notes from the seminar we ran on physics &amp; computation.</p>



<p><strong>More information about the summer school:</strong></p>



<p>The “Les Houches school of physics”, situated close to Chamonix and the Mont Blanc in the French Alps, has a long history of forming generations of young researchers on the frontiers of their fields. Our school is aimed primarily at the growing audience of theoretical physicists and applied mathematicians interested in machine learning and high-dimensional data analysis, as well as to <strong>colleagues from other fields</strong> interested in this interface. <em>[my emphasis –Boaz]</em> We will cover basics and frontiers of high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, the theory of computing and learning, and probability theory. We will focus in particular on methods of statistical physics and their results in the context of current questions and theories related to machine learning and neural networks. The school will also cover examples of applications of machine learning methods in physics research, as well as other emerging applications of wide interest. Open questions and directions will be presented as well.</p>



<p>Students, postdocs and young researchers interested to participate in the event are invited to apply on the website <a href="http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/" rel="nofollow">http://leshouches2020.krzakala.org/</a> before March 15, 2020. The capacity of the school is limited, and due to this constraint participants will be selected from the applicants and participants will be required to attend the whole event.</p>



<p><strong>Lecturers:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Boaz Barak (Harvard): Computational hardness perspectives</li><li>Giulio Biroli (ENS, Paris): High-dimensional dynamics</li><li>Michael Jordan (UC Berkeley): Optimization, diffusion &amp; economics</li><li>Marc Mézard (ENS, Paris): Message-Passing algorithms</li><li>Yann LeCun (Facebook AI, NYU).

<p>
Claire Cameron is the senior science editor at an online publication called <a href="https://www.inverse.com/"><i>Inverse</i></a>. She has written an incomplete <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61364-2020-science-and-tech-predictions">article</a> titled, “The 2020s: 20 science and tech predictions for the new decade.” She has posted 12 of the predictions, but the top 8 will be revealed on Wednesday, January 22.  <b>Update 1/22</b>: The predictions will be revealed over the coming week.  <b>Update 1/23</b>: Or not…#8 has not yet been posted.</p>
<p>
Today we offer a game of predicting: what will she predict? We also make some predictions for this year, including some that have already come true—the best kind.</p>
<p>
Here are her 12 predictions. See if you can guess her other 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>
20. In the 2020s, human-level A.I. will arrive and finally pass the Turing test. <p/>
</li><li>
19. In the 2020s, tiny biosensors could make a 911 phone call from Mars. <p/>
</li><li>
18. Hyperloop, Elon Musk’s vacuum-sealed transit system, may get a speed boost. <p/>
</li><li>
17. In the 2020s, we will have a real Robot Olympics. (And it’ll be a lot cooler than the regular Olympics.) <p/>
</li><li>
16. A woeful prediction: Air pollution levels will remain constant in the ’20s. <p/>
</li><li>
15. Solar panels will continue to decline in price in the 2020s. <p/>
</li><li>
14. Humans return to the Moon. <p/>
</li><li>
13. Killer robots may roam the Earth. (That is, autonomous weapons will become reality.) <p/>
</li><li>
12. We’re gonna live a whole lot longer. (The linked description muses about 1,000-year lifespans beginning this decade.) <p/>
</li><li>
11. If you hope to see a self-driving car this decade, keep dreaming. <p/>
</li><li>
10. We’ll witness CRISPR gene-editing trials on humans. <p/>
</li><li>
9. We’ll be doing experiments on lab-grown brains.
</li></ul>
<p>
There are already some clear big ones: yes to the Turing test and long lifespans and gene+brain editing but nix to self-driving cars. There may be some logical entailments, e.g., if 11 is false—so that self-driving cars are released—does that make 13 true? </p>
<p>
None of these predictions is out-of-the-blue: they all connect to initiatives already underway. So there should be some basis for inferring the missing eight. Quantum computing is one obvious area. Reviewing last year’s predictions will bring us there.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Last Year’s Predictions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We made 5 perennial predictions and 5 new ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>No circuit lower bound of <img alt="{1000n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1000n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1000n}"/> or better will be proved for <img alt="{\mathrm{SAT}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathrm%7BSAT%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathrm{SAT}}"/>.</em> Check. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A “provably” secure crypto-system will be broken.</em> No need to check—happens all the time. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>At least five claims that <img alt="{\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}}"/> and five that <img alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}"/> will be made.</em> The <img alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NP}}"/> claims <a href="https://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm">page</a> has stopped being updated, but we can just count from comments on this blog. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A computer scientist will win a Nobel Prize.</em> Again, not close—unless you count how vital lithium-ion batteries are to laptop computers. Two physicists won for discovering exoplanets in Earth-Sun type contexts, a question we retired last year. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>A Clay problem will be solved, or at least notable progress made.</em> A year ago we said this did not happen in 2018, but now for 2019 we’ll say <em>yes</em> based on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07321.pdf">paper</a> by Michael Griffin, Ken Ono, Larry Rolen, and Don Zagier (GORZ), which we covered <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/a-prime-breakthrough/">here</a> with progress on the Riemann Hypothesis.
</li></ul>
<p>
The GORZ paper was #1 on this <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/g30346822/biggest-math-breakthroughs-2019/">list</a> of “The 10 Biggest Math Breakthroughs of 2019” by <em>Popular Mechanics</em>. We also covered the list’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/30/writing-33-as-a-sum-of-cubes/">#2</a>, <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/quantum-switch-em/">#3</a> (in one subsection), <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/tools-and-sensitivity/">#4</a> (with a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/25/discrepancy-games-and-sensitivity/">followup</a>), and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/21/the-shortest-path-to-the-abel-prize/">#10</a> items—not too bad. </p>
<p>
The five non-perennial predictions from last year were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Deep learning methods will be found able to solve integer factoring. This will place current cryptography is trouble.</em> We had guessed a followup to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03768.pdf">this</a> or <a href="https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/factoring-massive-numbers-a-new-machine-learning-approach">this</a>, but we do not see one from 2019. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Deep learning methods will be found to help prove that factoring is hard.</em> See above. Instead, there was <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/poor-mans-qubit-can-solve-quantum-problems-without-going-quantum.html">this</a> (or see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">this</a>). <p/>
</li><li>
<em>The lines between heuristically solvable and really hard problems will become clearer—or more simply, SAT-solvers will hit a wall.</em> Well hey, the best papers in the <a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/program.html">program</a> for the SAT 2019 conference in Lisbon included <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/On_Super_Strong_ETH.pdf">this</a> by Nikhil Vyas and Ryan Williams. It refutes a “super-strong ETH” statement for random <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>-SAT instances with a fixed clause-to-variable ratio. So we guess a wall got broken thru instead. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>An algorithm originating in a theoretical model will be enshrined in law.</em> The Supreme Court cases on gerrymandering which we thought could do this instead nixed the algorithmic model—for now. Differential privacy was formally <a href="https://www2.census.gov/about/policies/2019-11-paper-differential-privacy.pdf">adopted</a> for the 2020 Census, but apparently at the level of memoranda pursuant to the long-existing Title 13 rather than to new legislation. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Quantum supremacy will be proved—finally.</em>  This needs its own subsection to evaluate.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Quantum Supremacy </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Last year, if we had written “claimed” or even “achieved,” we would now say <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">bingo</a>. But writing “proved” sets a higher standard. To judge from <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4447">this</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/ibm-edges-closer-to-quantum-supremacy-with-50qubit-processor">this</a>, it appears the Google-led team is upping their qubit count from 53 to 57 in order to shore up their quantum supremacy claim. </p>
<p>
However, we look back at what we called the “three planks” of a quantum supremacy claim:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Build a physical device capable of a nontrivial sampling task. <p/>
</li><li>
Prove that it gains advantage over known classical approaches. <p/>
</li><li>
Prove that comparable classical hardware cannot gain such advantage.
</li></ol>
<p>
We don’t think IBM’s 2.5-day simulation that would run on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(supercomputer)">Summit</a> supercomputer is “comparable hardware” enough to count as a “known classical approach.” So we claim part credit even with the “proved” wording based on plank 2 surviving IBM’s challenge and any other as far as we know. There is still our friend Gil Kalai’s now-detailed <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/the-google-quantum-supremacy-demo/">critique</a> of the modeling that the Google team’s analysis leans on. </p>
<p>
The level of plank 2 is what we meant a year ago anyway. See how we flip things in our last prediction below.  Incidentally, in regard to the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">argument</a> over the terms quantum “supremacy” and “advantage,” we stand by the different definitions toward the end of our predictions <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/06/predictions-for-2019/">post</a> a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Five Predictions for 2020 </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
For our five predictions—besides the five perennial ones—we start with something easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The power of multiple quantum entangled provers will be resolved, with repercussions for other areas of mathematics.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
This isn’t a total gimme: the proof could be wrong. The idea and connections, however, already seem clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Resolving the Sunflower Conjecture will run up against mainstream complexity theory issues.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
This may be more a stretch. We note this new <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~anuprao/pubs/sunflower.pdf">paper</a> by Anup Rao simplifying some aspects of the proof of last year’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483">advance</a> on the problem by Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu, and Jiapeng Zhang. Sunflower bounds are known to impact some complexity problems that seem more specialized, but neither paper mentions widening the contingencies. But talking about “mainstream” complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>A previously overlooked contingency involving two pairs of complexity classes will be found that can be taught in an intro theory course.</em> We mean something like <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P = P \implies PSPACE = X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P+%3D+P+%5Cimplies+PSPACE+%3D+X%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P = P \implies PSPACE = X}}"/>, where of course we don’t know what <img alt="{\mathsf{X}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{X}}"/> is. <p/>
</li><li>
<em>The fourth-power upper bound given by Hao Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture will be improved to <img alt="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^4)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%3D+o%28s%28f%29%5E4%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^4)}"/> but not to <img alt="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^{4-\delta})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%3D+o%28s%28f%29%5E%7B4-%5Cdelta%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f) = o(s(f)^{4-\delta})}"/> for any fixed <img alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\delta &gt; 0}"/>.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
We don’t have a concrete reason to think this, only the thought that if this were false in either direction then that might have been found already in the half-year since Huang’s paper. We note this <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.05406.pdf">survey</a> from two weeks ago. </p>
<p>
Now to get back to quantum. Instead of refining what we wrote a year ago, we do the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>The statistical test underlying the quantum supremacy claim will not be tied to a mainstream complexity collapse.</em>
</li></ul>
<p>
That is, the coming year will <em>not</em> see a result of the form: if polynomial-sized classical hardware can achieve the same statistical separation as modeled for the quantum hardware (under either the linear or logarithmic “cross-entropy benchmark”) then counting and hence the polynomial hierarchy collapses to <img alt="{\Sigma_3^p \cap \Pi_3^p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CSigma_3%5Ep+%5Ccap+%5CPi_3%5Ep%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Sigma_3^p \cap \Pi_3^p}"/>. Thus we expect to still be talking about all this a year from now.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Poem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Talking about talking about quantum supremacy, I wrote a short poem on its larger significances:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘It From Bit’ we once proclaimed,<br/>
but now the Bit has bit the dust<br/>
from whizzing quantum chips that gamed<br/>
coherence to evade the trust<br/>
that the Word drove creation’s hour:<br/>
Mother Nature fully lexical.<br/>
Why don’t our brains then have this power?<br/>
It is a status most perplexical. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The import of the <em>polynomial-time Church-Turing thesis</em> is that symbolic computation, our brains, our computing devices whose programs execute at the level of machine <em>language</em>, and natural processes on which any computing device can be based, are equivalent under broad notions of efficiency not just in computability. If this <em>fails</em>, then we can ask a question like the one about illusions quoted at the end of last week’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/our-thoughts-on-pnp/">post</a> on <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}"/>: why would so many smart people have had the illusion that the universe is based on classical information? This may have quick answers: the theory of quantum information wasn’t yet appreciated; it shares many similarities with classical information theory; classical information <a href="https://www.informationphilosopher.com/introduction/physics/quantum_to_classical.html">remains</a> in the <a href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-02-5769">picture</a>.  Note that the Simons <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~phayden/simons/overview.pdf">initiative</a> <i>It From Qubit</i> has existed for some time.</p>
<p>
But then comes a second question. Richard Dawkins <a href="https://www.skeptics.com.au/resources/articles/the-information-challenge/">speaks</a> for many biologists in underscoring that the major open issues in the genesis of life concern the processing of information to build complex structures. If nature affords capability <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> to this processing, one would expect complex biological structures—in particular, our brains—to evolve to avail it. Well, Roger Penrose spearheaded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mind">effort</a> to show that our brains employ distinctive quantum processes, but the physical side of his argument has been blunted by evidence. It could be that “quantum advantage” is not a life advantage. The classical falling-short of our grey matter would still be curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>

What are your predictions for 2020? What are your <em>meta</em>-predictions for the coming decade—that is, which 8 predictions do you think Claire Cameron will post on Wednesday? It may help you to know that last month she wrote a science <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61863-science-explain-cats-movie-creepy">article</a> on the movie <em>Cats</em>.</p>

    <title>TR20-005 |  Hardness Characterisations and Size-Width Lower Bounds for QBF Resolution | 

	Olaf Beyersdorff, 

	Joshua Blinkhorn, 

	Meena Mahajan</title>
    <summary>We provide a tight characterisation of proof size in resolution for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) by circuit complexity. Such a characterisation was previously obtained for a hierarchy of QBF Frege systems (Beyersdorff &amp; Pich, LICS 2016), but leaving open the most important case of QBF resolution. Different from the Frege case, our characterisation uses a new version of decision lists as its circuit model, which is stronger than the CNFs the system works with. Our decision list model is well suited to compute countermodels for QBFs.

Our characterisation works for both Q-Resolution and QU-Resolution, which we show to be polynomially equivalent for QBFs of bounded quantifier alternation.

Using our characterisation we obtain a size-width relation for QBF resolution in the spirit of the celebrated result for propositional resolution (Ben-Sasson &amp; Wigderson, J. ACM 2001). However, our result is not just a replication of the propositional relation - intriguingly ruled out  for QBF  in previous research (Beyersdorff et al., ACM ToCL 2018) - but shows a different dependence between size, width, and quantifier complexity.

We demonstrate that our new technique elegantly reproves known QBF hardness results and unifies previous lower-bound techniques in the QBF domain.</summary>

    <title>When does 2SAT have an integral relaxation?</title>
    <summary>In the 2-satisfiability problem, or 2SAT, the input is a system of constraints between pairs of Boolean variables, and the problem is to find a truth assignment satisfying all the constraints. Although the usual formulation writes the constraints as disjunctions (Boolean or), it’s convenient and equivalent to use implications instead, where each side of an implication can be either one of the variables or its negation. If you encode the variables as numbers, with for true and for false, then the negation of a variable is and the implication can be encoded as the linear inequality . If we forget the restriction that the values are or , this system of inequalities defines a convex polytope, which can be thought of as a relaxation of the given 2SAT problem. Each solution to the 2SAT problem corresponds to a vertex of this polytope but there might be other vertices as well, with fractional coordinates. We don’t want those; it’s more useful to have a polytope all of whose coordinates are integers, coming from solutions to the underlying 2SAT problem. When does this happen (without adding extra inequalities)?</summary>

We don’t want those; it’s more useful to have a polytope <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_polytope">all of whose coordinates are integers</a>, coming from solutions to the underlying 2SAT problem. When does this happen (without adding extra inequalities)?</p>

<p>I’m pretty sure the answer has been known, at least implicitly, for a long time, and that there are no new ideas in the rest of this post. See e.g. the answer to <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/a/46188/95">this very closely related question on relaxations of the vertex cover problem</a> and note that vertex cover can be formulated as 2SAT, with a variable per vertex and two constraints per edge of the input graph. But when I looked for it, I found it difficult to find references that give the answer explicitly. So here it is. The following conditions are equivalent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The given 2SAT instance has an integral relaxation.</li>
  <li>The given 2SAT instance has two solutions that are the complements of each other (each variable is true in one of the solutions and false in the other).</li>
  <li>The compatibility graph of the given 2SAT instance is bipartite.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, the compatibility graph is an undirected graph defined by Feder in “Network Flow and 2-Satisfiability” (<em>Algorithmica</em> 1994). It has a vertex for each literal (a variable or its negation). The two vertices for a variable and its negation are connected by an edge, called a “trivial edge”. Additionally,
for each implication , the two literals  and  cannot both be true, and we add an edge between them.</p>

<p>If the compatibility graph is bipartite, two-color it, make the vertices of one color be true, and make the vertices of the other color be false. Then this gives a solution to the 2SAT instance whose complement is also a solution. So the third condition implies the second condition.</p>

<p>The relaxation of any 2SAT instance contains the point whose coordinates all equal , and if the given instance has an integral relaxation then this point can be represented as a weighted average of integer solutions. An odd cycle in the compatibility graph would prevent that from being possible. For any point in the relaxation, and any literal, we consider the value of the literal to be either its coordinate value (if it represents a variable) or one minus that value (if it represents a negated variable). If some cycle has odd length , then each integer point in the weighted average could only have total value at most  on the literals of the cycle, so their weighted average would also be at most , less than the cycle’s total value of  in the all- solution. So the first condition implies the third condition.</p>

<p>Finally, suppose that there are two complementary solutions, and flip the variables if necessary so that these are the all-false and all-true assignments to the variables. (This flipping simplifies the problem without changing any of the three conditions.) Consider any fractional solution , and construct from it a probability distribution on truth assignments as follows: choose a uniformly random number , set to true the variables whose coordinate value is at least , and set to false the remaining variables.
All truth assignments generated in this way solve the 2SAT problem, because any violation of an implication constraint in the 2SAT problem would translate to a violation of the corresponding coordinate inequality constraint in the relaxation. The given fractional solution  is a weighted average of the resulting collection of 2SAT solutions, where the weight of a solution is the probability of generating it. Therefore, the second condition implies the first condition.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Newer Update for Thursday:</strong></p>



<p>Tonight I went to a Davos reception hosted by the government of Canada (<img alt="&#x1F1E8;&#x1F1E6;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f1e8-1f1e6.png" style="height: 1em;"/>).  I’m not sure why exactly they invited me, although I have of course enjoyed a couple years of life “up north” (well, in Waterloo, so actually further south than a decent chunk of the US … you see that I do have a tiny speck of a Canadian in me?).</p>



<p>I didn’t recognize a single person at the reception.  So I just ate the food, drank beer, and answered emails.  But then a few people did introduce themselves (two who recognized me, one who didn’t).  As they gathered around, they started asking me questions about quantum computing: is it true that QCs could crack the classically impossible Traveling Salesman Problem?  That they try all possible answers in parallel?  Are they going to go commercial in 2-5 years, or have they already?</p>



<p>It might have been the beer, but for some reason I decided to launch an all-out assault of truth bombs, one after the next, with what they might have considered a somewhat emotional delivery.</p>



<p>OK fine, it wasn’t the beer.  That’s just who I am.</p>



<p>And then, improbably, I was a sort of localized “life of the party” — although possibly for the amusement / novelty value of my rant more than for the manifest truth of my assertions.   One person afterward told me that it was by far the most useful conversation he’d had at Davos.</p>



<p>And I replied: I’m flattered by your surely inflated praise, but in truth I should also thank you.   You caught me at a moment when I’d been thinking to myself that, if only I could make one or two people’s eyes light up with comprehension about the fallacy of a QC simply trying all possible answers in parallel and then magically picking the best one, or about the central role of <em>amplitudes</em> and <em>interference</em>, or about the “merely” quadratic nature of the Grover speedup, or about the specialized nature of the most dramatic known applications for QCs, or about the gap between where the experimentalists are now and what’s needed for error correction and hence true scalability, or about the fact that “quantum supremacy” is obviously not a sufficient condition for a QC to be useful, but it’s equally obviously a <em>necessary</em> condition, or about the fact that doing something “practical” with a QC is of very little interest unless the task in question is <em>actually harder for classical computers</em>, which is a question of great subtlety … I say, if I could make only two or four eyes light up with comprehension of these things, then on that basis alone I could declare that the whole trip to Davos was worth it.</p>



<p>And then one of the people hugged me … and that was the coolest thing that happened to me today.</p>



<p><strong>Short Update for Thursday:</strong></p>



<p>I attended a panel discussion on quantum computing hosted by IBM.  The participants were Thomas Friedman (the New York Times columnist), Arvind Krishna (a senior Vice President at IBM), Raoul Klingner (director of  a European research organization), and Alison Snyder (the managing editor of Axios magazine).  There were about 100 people in the audience, more than at all of my Davos quantum computing sessions combined.  I sat right in front, although I don’t think anyone on the panel recognized me.</p>



<p>Ginni Rometty, the CEO of IBM, gave an introduction.  She said that quantum will change the world by speeding up supply-chain and other optimization problems.  I assume she was talking about the Grover speedup?  She also said that IBM is committed to delivering value for its customers, rather than “things you can do in two seconds that are not commercially valid” (I assume she meant Google’s supremacy experiment).  She asked for a show of hands of who knows absolutely nothing about the science behind quantum computing.  She then quipped, “well, that’s all of you!”  She may have missed two hands that hadn’t gone up (both belonging to the same person).</p>



<p>I accepted an invitation to this session firstly for the free lunch (which turned out to be delicious), and secondly because I was truly, genuinely curious to hear what Thomas Friedman, many of whose columns I’ve liked, had to teach me about quantum computing.  The answer turns out to be this: in his travels around the world over the past 6 years, Friedman has witnessed firsthand how the old dichotomy between right-wing parties and left-wing parties is breaking down everywhere (I assume he means, as both sides get taken over by populist movements?).  And this is just like how a qubit breaks down the binary dichotomy between 0’s and 1’s!  Also, the way a quantum computer can be in multiple states at once, is like how the US now has to be in multiple states at once in its relationship with China.</p>



<p>Friedman opened his remarks by joking about how he never took a single physics course, and had no idea why he was on a quantum computing panel at all.  He quickly added, though, that he toured IBM’s QC labs, where he found IBM’s leaders to be wonderful explainers of what it all means.</p>



<p>I’ll note that Friedman, the politics and Middle East affairs writer — not the two panelists serving the role of quantum experts — was the only one who mentioned, even in passing, the idea that the advantage of QCs depends on something called “constructive interference.”</p>



<p>Krishna, the IBM Vice President, explained why IBM rejects the entire concept of “quantum supremacy”: because it’s an irrelevant curiosity, and creating value for customers in the marketplace (for example by solving their supply-chain optimization problems) is the only test that matters.  No one on the panel expressed a contrary view.</p>



<p>Later, Krishna explained why quantum computers will never replace classical computers: because if you stored your bank balance on a quantum computer, one day you’d have $1, the next day $1000, the day after that $1 again, and so forth!  He explained how, where current supercomputers use the same amount of energy needed to power all of Davos to train machine learning models, quantum computers would use less than the energy needed to power a single house.  New algorithms do need to be designed to run neural networks quantumly, but fortunately that’s all being done as we speak.</p>



<p>I got the feeling that the businesspeople who came to this session felt like they got a lot more out of it than the businesspeople who came to my and Jeremy O’Brien’s session felt like they got out of ours.  After all, this session got across some big real-world takeaways—e.g., that if you don’t quantum, your business will be left in the dust, stuck with a single value at a time rather than exploring all values in parallel, and IBM can help you rather than your competitors win the quantum race.  It didn’t muddy the message with all the incomprehensible technicalities about how QCs only give exponential speedups for problems with special structure.</p>

<p>It would be great to know whether anyone’s actually reading the later updates, so I know whether to continue putting effort into them!</p>



<h2><a name="jan18">Saturday January 18</a></h2>



<p>Today I’m headed to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020">50th World Economic Forum in Davos</a>, where on Tuesday I’ll participate in a <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/the-quantum-potential">panel discussion</a> on “The Quantum Potential” with Jeremy O’Brien of the quantum computing startup <a href="https://psiquantum.com/">PsiQuantum</a>, and will also host an ask-me-anything session about quantum computational supremacy and Google’s claim to have achieved it.</p>



<p>I’m well aware that this will be unlike any other conference I’ve ever attended: STOC or FOCS it ain’t.  As one example, also speaking on Tuesday—although not conflicting with my QC sessions—will be a real-estate swindler and reality-TV star who’s somehow (alas) the current President of the United States.  Yes, even while his impeachment trial in the Senate gets underway.  <em>Also</em> speaking on Tuesday, a mere hour and a half after him, will be TIME’s Person of the Year, 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg.</p>



<p>In short, this Davos is shaping up to be an epic showdown between two diametrically opposed visions for the future of life on Earth.  And your humble blogger will be right there in the middle of it, to … uhh … explain how quantum computers can sample probability distributions that are classically intractable unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.  I feel appropriately sheepish.</p>



<p>Since the experience will be so unusual for me, I’m planning to <strong>“live-blog Davos”</strong>: I’ll be updating this post, all week, with any strange new things that I see or learn.  As a sign of my devotion to you, my loyal readers, I’ll even clothespin my nose and attend Trump’s speech so I can write about it.</p>



<p>And Greta: on the off chance that you happen to read <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, let me treat you to a vegan lunch or dinner!  I’d like to try to persuade you of just how essential nuclear power will be to a carbon-free future.  Oh, and if it’s not too much trouble, I’d also like a selfie with you for this blog.  (Alas, a friend pointed out to me that it would probably be easier to meet Trump: unlike Greta, he won’t be swarmed with thousands of fans!)</p>



<p>Anyway, check back here throughout the week for updates.  And if you’re in Davos and would like to meet, please shoot me an email.  And please use the comment section to give me your advice, suggestions, well-wishes, requests, or important messages for me to fail to deliver to the “Davoisie” who run the world.</p>



<h2><a name="jan19">Sunday January 19</a></h2>



<p>So I’ve arrived in Klosters, a village in the Swiss Alps close to Davos where I’ll be staying.  (All the hotels in Davos itself were booked by the time I checked.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4543" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png"/></figure>



<p>I’d braced myself for the challenge of navigating three different trains through the Alps not knowing German.  In reality, it was like a hundred times easier than public transportation at home.  Every train arrived at the exact right second at the exact platform that was listed, bearing the exact right number, and there were clear visible signs strategically placed at exactly the places where anyone could get confused.  I’d entered Bizarro Opposite World.  I’m surely one of the more absentminded people on earth, as well as one of the more neurotic about being judged by bystanders if I ever admit to being lost, and it was nothing.</p>



<p>Snow!  Once a regular part of my life, now the first I’d seen in several years.  Partly because I now live in Texas, but also because even when we take the kids back to Pennsylvania for ChanuChrismaNewYears, it no longer snows like it did when I was a kid.  If you show my 2-year-old, Daniel, a picture of snow-covered wilderness, he calls it a “beach.”  Daniel’s soon-to-be 7-year-old sister still remembers snow from Boston, but the memory is rapidly fading.  I wonder for how many of the children of the 21st century will snow just be a thing from old books and movies, like typewriters of rotary phones.</p>



<p>The World Economic Forum starts tomorrow afternoon.  In the meantime, though, I thought I’d give an update not on the WEF itself, but on the inflight movie that I watched on my way here.</p>



<p>I watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2066051/">Rocketman</a>, the recent biopic/hagiography about Elton John, though as I watched I found that I kept making comparisons between Elton John and Greta Thunberg.</p>



<p>On the surface, these two <em>might</em> not seem to have a great deal of similarity.</p>



<p>But I gathered that they had this in common: while still teenagers, they saw a chance and they seized it.  And doing so involved taking inner turmoil and then succesfully externalizing it to the whole planet.  Making hundreds of millions of people feel the same emotions that they had felt.  If I’m being painfully honest (how often am I not?), that’s something I’ve always wanted to achieve and haven’t.</p>



<p>Of course, when some of the most intense and distinctive emotions you’ve ever felt revolved around the discovery of quantum query complexity lower bounds … yeah, it might be tough to find more people than could fill a room to relive <em>those</em> emotional journeys with you.  But a child’s joy at discovering numbers like Ackerman(100) (to say nothing of BB(100)), which are so incomprehensibly bigger than \( 9^{9^{9^{9^9}}} \) that I didn’t need to think twice about how many 9’s I put there?  Or the exasperation at those who, yeah, totally get that quantum computers aren’t known to give exponential speedups for NP-complete problems, that’s a really important clarification coming from the theory side, but still, let’s continue to base our entire business or talk or article around the presupposition that quantum computers <strong>do</strong> give exponential speedups for NP-complete problems?  Or even just the type of crush that comes with a ceaseless monologue about what an objectifying, misogynist pig you must be to experience it?  Maybe I could someday make people vicariously experience and understand <em>those</em> emotions–if I could only find the right words.</p>



<p>My point is, this is precisely what Greta did for the burgeoning emotion of existential terror about the Anthropocene—another emotion that’s characterized my over life since childhood.  Not that I ever figured out anything to do about it, with the exception of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=278">Gore/Nader vote-swapping</a>.  By the standards of existential terrors, I consider this terror to be extraordinarily well-grounded.  If Steven Weinberg is scared, who among us has the right to be calm?</p>



<p>The obvious objection to Greta—why should anyone care what a histrionic teenager thinks about a complicated scientific field that thousands of people get PhDs in?—calls for a substantive answer.  So here’s mine.  Like many concerned citizens, I try to absorb some of the research on ocean warming or the collapse of ice sheets and the melting permafrost leading to even more warming or the collapse of ecosystems due to changes in rainfall or bushfires or climate migrations or whatever.  And whenever I do, I’m reminded of Richard Feynman’s remark, during the investigation of the Challenger disaster, that maybe it wasn’t all that interesting for the commission to spend its time reconstructing the exact details of which system caused which other system to malfunction at which millisecond, <strong>after the Space Shuttle had already started exploding.</strong>  The thing was hosed at that point.</p>



<p>Still, even after the 80s and 90s, there remained deep open questions about the eventual shape of the climate crisis, and foremost among them was: how do you get people to stop talking about this crisis in the language of intellectual hypotheticals and meaningless virtue-signalling gestures and “those crazy scientists, who knows what they’ll say tomorrow”?  How does one get people to revert to a more ancient language, the one that was used to win WWII for example, which speaks of courage and duty and heroism and defiance in the jaws of death?</p>



<p>Greta’s origin story—the one where the autistic girl spends months so depressed over climate inaction that she can’t eat or leave her room, until finally, no longer able to bear the psychic burden, she ditches school and carries a handmade protest sign to the front of the Swedish parliament—is not merely a prerequisite to a real contribution.  It <em>is</em> Greta’s real contribution (so far anyway), and by that I don’t mean to diminish it.  The idea was “trivial,” yes, but only in the sense that the wheel, Arabic numerals, or “personal computers will be important” were trivial ideas.  Greta modeled for the rest of the world how they, too, would probably feel about climate change were they able to sync up their lizard brains with their higher brains … and crucially, a substantial segment of the world was already primed to agree with her.  But it needed to see <em>one successful example</em> of a succesful sync between the science and the emotions appropriate to the science, as a crystal needs a seed.</p>



<p>The thesis of Rocketman is that Elton John’s great achievement was not only to invent a new character, but <em>actually to become that character</em>, since only by succesfully fusing the two could he touch the emotions of the masses.  In a similar way, Greta Thunberg’s great accomplishment of her short life has been to make herself into the human race’s first Greta Thunberg.</p>

<p>Happy 7th birthday to my daughter Lily!  (No, I didn’t miss her birthday party.  We did it on the 18th, right before I flew out.)</p>



<p>I think my goals for Davos have been downgraded from delivering a message of peace and nerd liberation to the world’s powerful, or even getting a selfie with Greta, to simply taking in a week in an environment that’s so alien to me.</p>



<p>Everything in Davos is based on a tiered system of badges, which determine which buildings you can get into to participate in the sessions.  I have a white badge, the highest tier, which would’ve set me back around <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/costs-of-davos-2011-1?r=US&amp;IR=T">$71,000</a> had WEF not thankfully waived its fees for academics.  I should mention that I’m also extremely underdressed compared to most of the people here, and that I spent much of my time today looking for free food.  It turns out that there’s pretty copious and excellent free food, although the sponsors sometimes ask you to leave your business card before you take any.  I don’t have a business card.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4546" src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-2.png"/></figure>



<p>The above, for me, represents the true spirit of Davos: a conference at a Swiss ski resort that costs $71,000 to attend, held on behalf of the ideal of human equality.</p>



<p>But maybe I shouldn’t scoff.  I learned today about a war between Greece and Turkey that was averted only because the heads of the two countries talked it over at Davos, so that’s cool.  At the opening ceremony today, besides a beautiful orchestral rendition of “Ode to Joy,” there were a bunch of speeches about how Davos pioneered the entire concept of corporate social responsibility.  I suppose the critics might say instead that Davos pioneered the concept of corporate <em>whitewashing</em>—as with the wall-sized posters that I saw this afternoon, wherein a financial services corporation showcased a diverse cast of people each above their preferred pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them).  Amazing how pronouns make everything woke and social-justicey!  I imagine that the truth is somewhere between these visions.  Just like the easiest way for NASA to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4267">fake</a> a moon landing was actually to send humans to the moon, sometimes the easiest way to virtue-signal is actually to become more virtuous.</p>



<p>Tonight I went to a reception specifically for the academics at Davos.  There, for the first time since my arrival, I saw people who I knew (Shafi Goldwasser, Neha Narula…), and met someone who I’d known by reputation (Brian Schmidt, who shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of dark energy).  But even the people who I didn’t know were clearly “my people,” with familiar nerdy mannerisms and interests, and in some cases even a thorough knowledge of SlateStarCodex references.  Imagine visiting a foreign country where no one spoke your language, then suddenly stumbling on the first ones who did.  I found it a hundred times easier than at the main conference to strike up conversations.</p>



<p>Oh yeah, quantum computing.  This afternoon I hosted three roundtable discussions about  quantum computing, which were fun and stress-free — I spent <em>much</em> more of my mental energy today figuring out the shuttle buses.  If you’re a regular reader of this blog or my popular articles, or a watcher of my talks on YouTube, etc., then congratulations: you’ve gotten the same explanations of quantum computing for free that others may have paid $71,000 apiece to hear!  Tomorrow are my two “real” quantum computing sessions, as well as the speeches by both the Donald and the Greta (the latter being the much hotter ticket).  So it’s a big day, which I’ll tell you about after it’s happened.  Stay tuned!</p>



<h2><a name="jan21">Tuesday January 21</a></h2>



<p>PsiQuantum’s Jeremy O’Brien and I did the Davos quantum computing panel this morning (moderated by Jennifer Schenker).  You can watch our 45-minute panel <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/the-quantum-potential">here</a>.  For regular readers of this blog, the territory will be familiar, but I dunno, I hope someone enjoys it anyway!</p>



<p>I’m now in the Congress Hall, in a seat near the front, waiting for Trump to arrive.  I will listen to the President of the United States and not attract the Secret Service’s attention by loudly booing, but I have no intention to stand or applaud either.</p>



<p>Alas, getting a seat at Greta’s talk is looking like it will be difficult or impossible.</p>



<p>I was struck by the long runup to Trump’s address: the President of Switzerland gave a searing speech about the existential threats of climate change and ecosystem destruction, and “the politicians in many nations who appeal to fear and bigotry”—never mentioning Trump by name but making clear that she despised the entire ideology of the man people had come to hear.  I thought it was a nice touch.  Then some technicians spent 15 minutes adjusting Trump’s podium, then nothing happened for 20 minutes as we all waited for a tardy Trump, then some traditional Swiss singers did a performance on stage (!), and finally Klaus Schwab, director of the WEF, gave Trump a brief and coldly cordial introduction, joking about the weather in Davos. </p>



<p>And … now Trump is finally speaking.  Once he starts, I suddenly realize that I have no idea what new insight I expected from this.  He’s giving his standard stump speech, America has regained its footing after the disaster of the previous administration, winning like it’s never won before, unemployment is the lowest in recorded history, blah blah blah.  I estimate that less than half of the audience applauded Trump’s entrance; the rest sat in stony silence.  Meanwhile, some people were passing out flyers to the audience documenting all the egregious errors in Trump’s economic statistics.</p>



<p>Given the small and childish nature of the remarks (“we’re the best!  ain’t no one gonna push us around!”), it feels somehow right to be looking down at my phone, blogging, rather than giving my undivided attention to the President of the United States speaking 75 feet in front of me.</p>



<p>Ok, I admit I just looked up, when Trump mentioned America’s commitment to developing new technologies like “5G and quantum computing” (he slowly drew out the word “quantum”).</p>



<p>His whole delivery is strangely lethargic, as if he didn’t sleep well last night (I didn’t either).</p>



<p>Trump announced that the US would be joining the WEF’s “1 trillion trees” environmental initiative, garnering the only applause in his speech.  But he then immediately pivoted to a denunciation of the “doomsayers and pessimists and socialists who want to control our lives and take away our liberty” (he presumably meant people worried about climate change).</p>



<p>Now, I kid you not, Trump is expanding on his “optimism” theme by going on and on about the architectural achievements of Renaissance Florence.</p>



<p>You can watch Trump’s speech for yourself <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/special-address-by-donald-j-trump-president-of-the-united-states-of-america-5e6010c5e7">here</a>.</p>



<p>While I wasn’t able to get in to see Greta Thunberg in person, you can watch her (along with others) <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/averting-a-climate-apocalypse">here</a>.  I learned that her name is pronounced “toon-berg.”</p>


<p><!--EndFragment-->Having now listened to Greta’s remarks, I confess that I disagree with the content of what she says.  She explicitly advocates a sort of purity-based carbon absolutism—demanding that companies and governments immediately implement, not merely <em>net</em> zero emissions (i.e. offsetting their emissions by paying to plant trees and so forth), but zero emissions <em>period.  </em>Since she can’t possibly mean <em>literally</em> zero, I’ll interpret her to mean close to zero.  Even so, it seems to me that the resulting economic upheavals would provoke a massive backlash against whoever tried to enforce such a policy.  Greta also dismisses the idea of technological solutions to climate change, saying that we don’t have time to invent such solutions.  But of course, some of the solutions already exist—a prime example being nuclear power.  And if we no longer have time to nuclearize the world, then to a great extent, that’s the fault of the antinuclear activists—an unbelievable moral and strategic failure that may have doomed our civilization, and for which there’s never been a reckoning.</p>


<p>Despite all my disagreements, <em>if</em> Greta’s strident, uncompromising rhetoric helps push the world toward cutting emissions, then she’ll have to be counted as one of the greatest people who ever lived.  Of course, another possibility is the world’s leaders will applaud her and celebrate her moral courage, while not taking anything beyond token actions.</p>



<h2><a name="jan22">Wednesday January 22</a></h2>



<p>Alas, I’ve come down with a nasty cold (is there any other kind?).  So I’m paring back my participation in the rest of Davos to the stuff that really interests me.  The good news is that my quantum computing sessions are already finished!</p>



<p>This morning, as I sat in the lobby of the Congress Centre checking my email and blowing my nose, I noticed some guy playing a cello nearby.  Dozens were gathered around him — so many that I could barely see the guy, only hear the music.  After he was finished, I worked up the courage to ask someone what the fuss was about.  Turns out that the guy was Yo-Yo Ma.</p>



<p>The Prince Regent of Liechtenstein was explaining to one of my quantum computing colleagues that Liechtenstein does not have much in the way of quantum.</p>



<p>Speaking of princes, I’m now at a cybersecurity session with Shafi Goldwasser and others, at which the attendance might be slightly depressed because it’s up against Prince Charles.  That’s right: Davos is the conference where the heir apparent to the British throne <em>speaks in a parallel session</em>.</p>



<p>I’ve realized these past few days that I’m not very good at schmoozing with powerful people.  On the other hand, it’s possible that my being bad at it is a sort of mental defense mechanism.  The issue is that, the more I became a powerful “thought leader” who unironically used phrases like “Fourth Industrial Revolution” or “disruptive innovation,” the more I used business cards and LinkedIn to expand my network of contacts or checked my social media metrics … well, the less I’d be able to do the research that led to stuff like being invited here in the first place.  I imagine that many Davos regulars started out as nerds like me, and that today, coming to Davos to talk about “disruptive innovation” is a fun kind of semi-retirement.  If so, though, I’m not ready to retire just yet!  I still want to do things that are new enough that they don’t need to be described using multiple synonyms for newness.</p>



<p>Apparently one of the hottest tickets at Davos is a post-Forum Shabbat dinner, which used to be frequented by Shimon Peres, Elie Wiesel, etc.  Alas, not having known about it, I already planned my travel in a way that won’t let me attend it.  I feel a little like the guy in <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/local.theonion.com/local-jew-feels-left-out-of-worldwide-jewish-conspiracy-1819564292/amp">this Onion article</a>.</p>



<p>I had signed up for a session entitled What’s At Stake: The Arctic, featuring Al Gore.  As I waited for them to start letting people in, I suddenly realized that Al Gore was standing right next to me.  However, he was engrossed in conversation with a young woman, and even though I assumed she was just some random fan like I was, I didn’t work up the courage to interrupt them.  Only once the panel had started, with the woman on it two seats from Gore, did I realize that she was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanna_Marin">Sanna Marin</a>, the new Prime Minister of Finland (and at 34, the world’s second-youngest head of state).</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2020/sessions/whats-at-stake-the-arctic">watch the panel here</a>.  Briefly, the Arctic has lost about half of its ice cover, not merely since preindustrial times but since a few decades ago.  And this is not only a problem for polar bears.  It’s increasing the earth’s absorption of sunlight and hence significantly accelerating global warming, and it’s also screwing up weather patterns all across the northern hemisphere.  Of course, the Siberian permafrost is also thawing and releasing greenhouse gases that are even worse than CO2, further accelerating the wonderful feedback loop of doom.</p>



<p>I thought that Gore gave a masterful performance.  He was in total command of the facts—discoursing clearly and at length on the relative roles of CO2, SO2, and methane in the permafrost as well as the economics of oil extraction, less in the manner of thundering (or ‘thunberging’?) prophet than in the manner of an academic savoring all the non-obvious twists as he explains something to a colleague—and his every response to the other panelists was completely on point.</p>



<p>In 2000, there was indeed a bifurcation of the universe, and we ended up in a freakishly horrible branch.  Instead of something close to the best, most fact-driven US president one could conjure in one’s mind, we got something close to the worst, and then, after an 8-year interregnum just to lull us into complacency, we got something even worse than the worst.</p>



<p>The other panelists were good too.  Gail Whiteman (the scientist) had the annoying tic of starting sentence after sentence with “the science says…,” but then did a good job of summarizing what the science <em>does</em> say about the melting of the Arctic and the permafrost.</p>



<p>Alas, rather than trying to talk to Gore, immediately after the session ended, I headed back to my hotel to go to sleep.  Why?  Partly because of my cold.  But partly also because of incident immediately before the panel.  I was sitting in the front row, next to an empty seat, when a woman who wanted to occupy that seat hissed at me that I was “manspreading.”</p>



<p>If, on these narrow seats packed so tightly together that they were basically a bench, my left leg had strayed an inch over the line, I would’ve addressed the situation differently: for example, “oh hello, may I sit here?”  (At which point I would’ve immediately squeezed in.)  Amazingly, the woman didn’t seem to didn’t care that a different woman, the one to my right, <em>kept her pocketbook and other items on the seat next to her throughout the panel</em>, preventing anyone else from using the seat in what was otherwise a packed house.  (Is that “womanspreading”?)</p>



<p>Anyway, the effect of her comment was to transform the way I related to the panel.  I looked around at the audience and thought: “these activists, who came to hear a panel on climate change, are fighting for a better world.  And in their minds, one of the main ways that the world will be better is that it won’t contain sexist, entitled ‘manspreaders’ like me.”</p>



<p>In case any SneerClubbers are reading, I should clarify that I recognize an element of the irrational in these thoughts.  I’m simply reporting, truthfully, that they’re what bubbled up outside the arena of conscious control.  But furthermore, I feel like the fact that my brain works this way might give me some insight into the psychology of Trump support that few Democrats share—so much that I wonder if I could provide useful service as a Democratic political consultant!</p>



<p>I understand the mindset that howls: “better that every tree burn to the ground, every fish get trawled from the ocean, every coastal city get flooded out of existence, than that these sanctimonious hypocrites ‘on the right side of history,’ singing of their own universal compassion even as they build a utopia with no place for me in it, should get to enjoy even a second of smug self-satisfaction.”  I hasten to add that I’ve learned how to <em>override</em> that mindset with a broader, better mindset: I can jump into the abyss, but I can also climb back out, and I can even look down at the abyss from above and report what’s there.  It’s as if I’d captured some virulent strain of Ebola in a microbiology lab of the soul.  And if nearly half of American voters (more in crucial swing states) have gotten infected with that Ebola strain, then maybe my lab work could have some broader interest.</p>



<p>I thought about Scott Minerd, the investor on the panel, who became a punching bag for the other panelists (except for Gore, a politician in a <em>good</em> sense, who went out of his way to find points of agreement).  In his clumsy way, Minerd was making the same point that climate activists themselves correctly make: namely, that the oil companies need to be <em>incentivized</em> (for example, through a carbon tax) to leave reserves in the ground, that we can’t just trust them to do the noble thing and write off their own assets.  But for some reason, Minerd presented himself as a greedy fat-cat, raining on the dreams of the hippies all around him for a carbon-free future, so then that’s how the other panelists duly treated him (except, again, for Gore).</p>



<p>But I looked at the audience, which was cheering attacks on Minerd, and the Ebola in my internal microbiology lab said: “the way these activists see Scott Minerd is not far from how they see Scott Aaronson.  You’ll never be good enough for them.  The people in this room might or might not succeed at saving the world, but in any case they don’t want your help.”</p>



<p>After all, what was the <em>pinnacle</em> of my contribution to saving the world?  It was surely when I was 19, and created a website to defend the practice of NaderTrading (i.e., Ralph Nader supporters in swing states voting for Al Gore, while Gore supporters in safe states pledged to vote Nader on their behalf).  Alas, we failed.  We did help arrange a few thousand swaps, including a few hundred swaps in Florida, but it was 538 too few.  We did too little, too late.</p>



<p>So what would I have talked to Gore about, anyway?  Would I have reminded him of the central tragedy of his life, which was also a central tragedy of recent American history, just in order to babble, or brag, about a NaderTrading website that I made half a lifetime ago?  Would I have made up a post-hoc rationalization for why I work on quantum computing, like that I hope it will lead to the discovery of new carbon-capture methods?  Immediately after Gore’s eloquent brief for the survival of the Arctic and all life on earth, would I have asked him for an autograph or a selfie?  No, better to just reflect on his words.  At a crucial pivot point in history, Gore failed by a mere 538 votes, and I also failed to prevent the failure.  But amazingly, Gore <em>never gave up-</em>–he just kept on fighting for what he knew civilization needed to do—and yesterday I sat a few feet away while he explained why the rest of us shouldn’t give up either.  And he’s right about this—if not in the sense of the outlook being especially hopeful or encouraging right now, then surely in the sense of which attitude is the <em>useful</em> one to adopt.  And my attitude, which you might call “Many-Worlds-inflected despair,” might be epistemically sound but it definitely wasn’t useful.  What further clarifications did I need?</p></div>

<p>And (thanks Mikael de la Salle!) a recent Book by Gilles Pisier:<br/>

<p>The assertion of Connes’ embedding conjecture refuted in the MIP*=RE paper would imply several (<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/350559/1532">outrageous</a> :)) stronger conjectures that are still open. One is the conjecture of Connes that every group is “hyperlinear.” Another famous conjecture (an affirmative answer to a question posed by Gromov) is  that every group is sofic. As sofic groups are hyperlinear we can now expect (ever more than before) that non-sofic and even non hyperlinear groups will be found. Here is a rough short explanation what these conjectures are about. <del>(Kirchberg’s conjecture, is another group theoretic question of this nature.)</del></p>
<p>Every finite group is a permutation group and is a linear group. This is not the case for infinite groups and there are various interesting notions of “approximately-permutation-group” (this is “sofic”) and “approximately linear” (this is called “hyperlinear”).</p>
<p>Given a group Γ we want to find a sequence of functions <img alt="f_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="f_n"/></p>
<ol>
<li>From Γ to symmetric groups <img alt="S_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S_n"/>,</li>
<li>or from Γ to the unitary groups <em>U(n).</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Such that asymptotically as <em>n</em> grows these functions are “almost homomorphisms” with respect to certain metrics <em>DIST</em> on <img alt="S_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="S_n"/> or <img alt="U(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="U(n)"/> respectively. This means that for every two elements</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="a,b \in \Gamma" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb+%5Cin+%5CGamma&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="a,b \in \Gamma"/>,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="DIST( f_n(ab), f_n(a)f_n(b))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=DIST%28+f_n%28ab%29%2C+f_n%28a%29f_n%28b%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="DIST( f_n(ab), f_n(a)f_n(b))"/> tends to zero when <em>n</em> tends to infinity.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sofic group</strong> refers to the normalized Hamming metric for symmetric groups.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperlinear group</strong> refers to metrics given by the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm on the unitary groups</li>
<li><strong>MF-groups, </strong>Again the unitary group but the operator norm this time.</li>
</ol>
<p>And there are various other metrics that were also considered. The assertion of the famous embedding conjecture by Connes on von-Neumann algebras (now refuted by the new result) implies that every group is hyperlinear.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">A remaining wish list: Find a non sofic group; find a non-hyperlinear group; <del>refute  Kirchberg’s conjecture (if it was not already refuted)</del>.</span></strong></p>
<h2>Interactive proofs and some computational complexity background.</h2>
<h3>P, NP, IP, MIP</h3>
<p><em>Links: here are slides of  a great talk by Yael Kalai: <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/the-evolution-of-proofs-in-computer-science-yael-kalai.pptx">The evolution of proof in computer science;</a> an a <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2012/09/18/the-evolution-of-proofs/">blog post on this topic</a> by Yael Kalai, and a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/01/06/yael-tauman-kalais-icm2018-paper-my-paper-and-cryptography/">post here</a> about Yael’s 2018 ICM paper and lecture.</em></p>
<p>A decision problem is in P if there is a polynomial time algorithm (in terms of the input size) to test if the answer is yes or no.  A decision problem is in NP if there is a proof for a YES answer that can be verified in a polynomial time.</p>
<p>Here are two examples: The question if  graph has a perfect matching is in P. The question if  graph has an Hamiltonian cycle  is in NP. If the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier a polynomial number of steps to verify.</p>
<p>IP is a complexity class based on a notion of interactive proof where, based on a protocol for questions and answers,  the prover can convince the verifier (with arbitrary high probability) that the answer is yes. Following a sequence of startling developments Adi Shamir proved that IP is quite a large complexity space P-space.  When we consider several non-interacting provers (two provers suffice) the computational power denoted by MIP is even larger: László Babai, Lance Fortnow, and Cartsen Lund proved that MIP=NEXP!  NEXP is the class of decision problems where if the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier (at most) an exponential number of steps to verify.</p>
<h3>Enters quantum computation and entanglement</h3>
<p>We replace the model of classical computation with quantum computation. Each of the two provers, Prover1 and Prover2, have access to separate sets of <em>m</em> qubits but they  can prepare in advance a complicated quantum state on those <em>2m</em> qubits. When we run the verification protocol each prover has access only to its <em>m</em> qubits and, like in the classical case,  the two provers cannot communicate. These types of verification protocols represent the complexity class MIP*.  In 2012 and Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick proved that MIP* contains NEXP. In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/some-updates/">this 2012 post</a> I reported an unusual seminar we ran on the problem.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Interactive quantum lecture:</strong> We had an unususal quantum seminar presentation by Michael Ben-Or on the work <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">A multi-prover interactive proof for NEXP sound against entangled provers</a> by Tsuyoshi Ito and Thomas Vidick. Michael ran Vidick’s videotaped recent talk on the matter and from time to time he and Dorit acted as a pair of prover and the other audience as verifier. (Michael was one of the authors of the very first paper introducing multi-prover interactive proofs.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me mention also a related 2014 paper by Yael Kalai, Ran Raz, and Ron Rothblum: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/delegate-computations-power-no-signaling-proofs/">How to delegate computations: the power of no-signaling proofs.</a> They considered two provers that are limited by the “non-signaling principle” and showed that the power of interactive proofs is exactly EXP . (Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FiroQt6yWc">videotaped lecture</a> by Ran Raz.)</p>
<p>In April 2019, Anand Natarajan and John Wright uploaded a paper with a proof that MIP* contain NEEXP. (NEEXP is the class of decision problems where if the answer is yes a prover can give a proof that requires the verifier (at most) doubly exponential number of steps to verify.)</p>
<p>Here is a nice quote from the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">Harnett’s  quanta paper</a> regarding the Natarajan-Wright breakthrough:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some problems are too hard to solve in any reasonable amount of time. But their solutions are easy to check. Given that, computer scientists want to know: How complicated can a problem be while still having a solution that can be verified?</p>
<p>Turns out, the answer is: Almost unimaginably complicated.</p>
<p>In a paper released in April, two computer scientists <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dramatically increased the number of problems</a> that fall into the hard-to-solve-but-easy-to-verify category. They describe a method that makes it possible to check answers to problems of almost incomprehensible complexity. “It seems insane,” said <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thomas Vidick</a>, a computer scientist at the California Institute of Technology who wasn’t involved in the new work.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Now with the new result, I wonder if this bold  philosophical interpretation is sensible:  There is a shared quantum state that will allow two non-interacting provers (with unlimited computational power) to convince  a mathematician if a given mathematical statement has a proof, and also to convince a historian or a futurist about any question regarding the past or future evolution of the universe.</em></p>
<h3>What is RE?</h3>
<p>(I forgot to explain what RE is. Here is the description from the paper itself.)</p>
<p>RE is the class of recursively enumerable languages, i.e. languages <em>L</em> such that there<br/>
exists a Turing machine <em>M</em> such that <em>x ∈ L</em> if and only if <em>M</em> halts and accepts on input <em>x</em>. Note that, in addition to containing all decidable languages, this class also contains undecidable problems such as the Halting problem, which is to decide whether a given Turing machine eventually halts</p>
<h3>A little more information and links</h3>
<p>The negative answer to Tsirelson problem asserts roughly that there are types of correlations  that can be produced by an infinite quantum systems, but that can’t even be approximated by a finite system. Connes’ 1976 embedding conjecture (now refuted) from the theory of von Neumann algebras asserts that “Every  type <img alt="\Pi_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\Pi_1"/> von Neumann factor embeds in an ultrapower of a hyperfinite <img alt="\Pi_1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPi_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\Pi_1"/> factor.”</p>
<p>The abstract of the new paper mentions a few other works that are important for the new proof.</p>

    <title>TR20-004 |  The Power of the Combined Basic LP and Affine Relaxation for Promise CSPs |

    <summary>In the field of constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), promise CSPs are an exciting new direction of study. In a promise CSP, each constraint comes in two forms: "strict" and "weak," and in the associated decision problem one must distinguish between being able to satisfy all the strict constraints versus not being able to satisfy all the weak constraints. The most commonly cited example of a promise CSP is the approximate graph coloring problem--which has recently seen exciting progress [BKO19, WZ20] benefiting from a systematic algebraic approach to promise CSPs based on "polymorphisms," operations that map tuples in the strict form of each constraint to tuples in the corresponding weak form.

In this work, we present a simple algorithm which in polynomial time solves the decision problem for all promise CSPs that admit infinitely many symmetric polymorphisms, that is the coordinates are permutation invariant. This generalizes previous work of the first two authors [BG19]. We also extend this algorithm to a more general class of block-symmetric polymorphisms. As a corollary, this single algorithm solves all polynomial-time tractable Boolean CSPs simultaneously. These results give a new perspective on Schaefer's classic dichotomy theorem and shed further light on how symmetries of polymorphisms enable algorithms. Finally, we show that block symmetric polymorphisms are not only sufficient but also necessary for this algorithm to work, thus establishing its precise power.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Scott’s preface:</strong> Imagine that every time you turned your blog over to a certain topic, you got denounced on Twitter and Reddit as a privileged douchebro, entitled STEMlord, counterrevolutionary bourgeoisie, etc. etc.  The sane response would simply be to quit blogging about that topic.  But there’s also an <em>in</em>sane (or masochistic?) response: the response that says, “but if everyone like me stopped talking, we’d cede the field by default to the loudest, angriest voices on all sides—thereby giving those voices exactly what they wanted.  To hell with that!”</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, while I was being attacked for sharing Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4476">guest post</a> about NIPS vs. NeurIPS, I received a beautiful message of support from a PhD student in physical chemistry and quantum computing named <a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/karen-morenz-189310112">Karen Morenz</a>.  Besides her strong words of encouragement, Karen wanted to share with me an <a href="https://medium.com/@kjmorenz/is-it-really-just-sexism-an-alternative-argument-for-why-women-leave-stem-cccdf066d8b1">essay</a> she had written on Medium about why too many women leave STEM.</p>



<p>Karen’s essay, I found, marshaled data, logic, and her own experience in support of an insight that strikes me as true and important and underappreciated—one that dovetails with what I’ve heard from many other women in STEM fields, including my wife <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~danama/">Dana</a>.  So I asked Karen for permission to reprint her essay on this blog, and she graciously agreed.</p>



<p>Briefly: anyone with a brain and a soul wants there to be many more women in STEM.  Karen outlines a realistic way to achieve this shared goal.  Crucially, Karen’s way is <em>not</em> about shaming male STEM nerds for their deep-seated misogyny, their arrogant mansplaining, or their gross, creepy, predatory sexual desires.  Yes, you can go the shaming route (God knows it’s being tried).  If you do, you’ll probably snare many guys who really do deserve to be shamed as creeps or misogynists, along with many more who don’t.  Yet for all your efforts, Karen predicts, you’ll no more solve the original problem of too few women in STEM, than arresting the kulaks solved the problem of lifting the masses out of poverty.</p>



<p>For you still won’t have made a dent in the real issue: namely that, the way we’ve set things up, pursuing an academic STEM career demands fanatical devotion, to the exclusion of nearly everything else in life, between the ages of roughly 18 and 35.  And as long as that’s true, Karen says, the majority of talented women are going to look at academic STEM, in light of all the other great options available to them, and say “no thanks.”  Solving this problem might look like more money for maternity leave and childcare.  It might also look like re-imagining the academic career trajectory itself, to make it easier to rejoin it after five or ten years away.  Way back in 2006, I tried to make this point in a blog post called <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=87">Nerdify the world, and the women will follow</a>.  I’m grateful to Karen for making it more cogently than I did.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here’s Karen’s essay. –SA</p>



<h3><strong>Is it really just sexism?  An alternative argument for why women leave STEM</strong></h3>



<p>by Karen Morenz</p>



<p>Everyone knows that you’re not supposed to start your argument with ‘everyone knows,’ but in this case, I think we ought to make an exception:</p>



<p>Everyone knows that STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) has a problem retaining women (see, for example <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283809613_Women_in_STEM_Family-Related_Challenges_and_Initiatives" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Jean, Payne, and Thompson 2015</a>). We pour money into attracting girls and women to STEM fields. We pour money into recruiting women, training women, and addressing sexism, both overt and subconscious. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5491652/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">In 2011</a>, the United States spent nearly $3 billion tax dollars on STEM education, of which roughly one third was spent supporting and encouraging underrepresented groups to enter STEM (including women). And yet, women are still leaving at alarming rates.</p>



<p>Alarming? Isn’t that a little, I don’t know, alarmist? Well, <strong>let’s look at some stats.</strong></p>



<p>A recent report by the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0894845313483003" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (2011)</a> found that women received 20.3% of the bachelor’s degrees and 18.6% of the PhD degrees in physics in 2008. In chemistry, women earned 49.95% of the bachelor’s degrees but only 36.1% of the doctoral degrees. By comparison, in biology women received 59.8% of the bachelor’s degrees and 50.6% of the doctoral degrees. A <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recent article</a> in Chemical and Engineering News showed a chart based on a survey of life sciences workers by Liftstream and MassBio demonstrating how women are vastly underrepresented in science leadership despite earning degrees at similar rates, which I’ve copied below. The story is the same in academia, as you can see on the <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">second chart</a> — from comparable or even larger number of women at the student level, we move towards a significantly larger proportion of men at the more and more advanced stages of an academic career.</p>

<p>Although 74% of women in STEM <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a> “loving their work,” half (56%, in fact) leave over the course of their career — largely at the “mid-level” point, when the loss of their talent is most costly as they have just completed training and begun to contribute maximally to the work force.</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01511" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">A study by Dr. Flaherty</a> found that women who obtain faculty position in astronomy spent on average 1 year less than their male counterparts between completing their PhD and obtaining their position — but he concluded that this is because <strong>women leave the field at a rate 3 to 4 times greater than men</strong>, and in particular, if they do not obtain a faculty position quickly, will simply move to another career. So, women and men are hired at about the same rate during the early years of their post docs, but women stop applying to academic positions and drop out of the field as time goes on, pulling down the average time to hiring for women.</p>



<p>There are many more studies to this effect. At this point, <strong>the assertion that women leave STEM at an alarming rate after obtaining PhDs is nothing short of an established fact</strong>. In fact, it’s actually a problem across all academic disciplines, as you can see in <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this matching chart</a> showing the same phenomenon in humanities, social sciences, and education. The phenomenon has been affectionately dubbed the “leaky pipeline.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/571/0*koOEWDCY2BBSvZCN"/></figure>



<p><strong>But hang on a second, maybe there just aren’t enough women qualified for the top levels of STEM? Maybe it’ll all get better in a few years if we just wait around doing nothing?</strong></p>



<p>Nope, sorry. This <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">study</a> says that 41% of highly qualified STEM people are female. And also, it’s clear from the previous charts and stats that a significantly larger number of women are getting PhDs than going on the be professors, in comparison to their male counterparts. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Laurie Glimcher</a>, when she started her professorship at Harvard University in the early 1980s, remembers seeing very few women in leadership positions. “I thought, ‘Oh, this is really going to change dramatically,’ ” she says. But 30 years later, “it’s not where I expected it to be.” Her experiences are similar to those of other leading female faculty.</p>



<p><strong>So what gives? Why are all the STEM women leaving?</strong></p>



<p>It is widely believed that sexism is the leading problem. A quick google search of “sexism in STEM” will turn up a veritable cornucopia of articles to that effect. And indeed, around 60% of women report experiencing some form of sexism in the last year (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Robnett 2016</a>). So, that’s clearly not good.</p>



<p>And yet, if you ask leading women researchers like Nobel Laureate in Physics 2018, Professor Donna Strickland, or Canada Research Chair in Advanced Functional Materials (Chemistry), Professor Eugenia Kumacheva, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p06mrmnt" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">they</a> <a href="https://www.intermissionmagazine.ca/features/the-scientist-and-the-artist-conversations-with-eugenia-kumacheva-and-fiona-reid/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">say</a> that sexism was not a barrier in their careers. Moreover, extensive research has shown that sexism has overall decreased since Professors Strickland and Kumacheva (for example) were starting their careers. Even more interestingly, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684315596162" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Rachael Robnett showed</a> that more mathematical fields such as Physics have a greater problem with sexism than less mathematical fields, such as Chemistry, a finding which rings true with the subjective experience of many women I know in Chemistry and Physics. However, as we saw above, women leave the field of Chemistry in greater proportions following their BSc than they leave Physics. On top of that, although 22% of women <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">report</a> experiencing sexual harassment at work, the proportion is the same among STEM and non-STEM careers, and yet women leave STEM careers at a much higher rate than non-STEM careers.</p>



<p>So,it seems that<strong> sexism can not fully explain why women with STEM PhDs are leaving STEM</strong>. At the point when women have earned a PhD, for the most part they have already survived the worst of the sexism. They’ve already proven themselves to be generally thick-skinned and, as anyone with a PhD can attest, very stubborn in the face of overwhelming difficulties. Sexism is frustrating, and it can limit advancement, but it doesn’t fully explain why we have so many women obtaining PhDs in STEM, and then leaving. In fact, at least in the U of T chemistry department, faculty hires are directly proportional to the applicant pool —although the exact number of applicants are not made public, from public information we can see that approximately one in four interview invitees are women, and approximately one in four hires are women. Our hiring committees have received bias training, and it seems that it has been largely successful. That’s not to say that we’re done, but it’s time to start looking elsewhere to explain why there are so few women sticking around.</p>



<p><strong>So why don’t more women apply?</strong></p>



<p>Well, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/14/many-women-in-stem-fields-expect-to-quit-within-five-years-survey-finds" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">one truly brilliant researcher</a> had the groundbreaking idea of asking women why they left the field. When you ask women why they left, the number one reason they cite is<strong> balancing work/life responsibilities</strong> — which as far as I can tell is a euphemism for family concerns.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The</a> <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">research</a> <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">is in</a> <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">on</a> <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">this</a>. Women who stay in academia expect to marry later, and delay or completely forego having children, and if they do have children, plan to have fewer than their non-STEM counterparts (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sassler et al 2016</a>, <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/11/leaky-pipelines-for-canadian-women-in-research.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Owens 2012</a>). Men in STEM have no such difference compared to their non-STEM counterparts; they marry and have children about the same ages and rates as their non-STEM counterparts (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5315093/#FN2" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sassler et al 2016</a>). Women leave STEM in droves in their early to mid thirties (<a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/women-and-men-in-stem-often-at-odds-over-workplace-equity/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Funk and Parker 2018</a>) — the time when women’s fertility begins to decrease, and risks of childbirth complications begin to skyrocket for both mother and child. Men don’t see an effect on their fertility until their mid forties. Of the 56% of women who leave STEM, 50% wind up self-employed or using their training in a not for profit or government, 30% leave to a non-STEM more ‘family friendly’ career, and 20% leave to be stay-at-home moms (<a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ashcraft and Blithe 2002</a>). Meanwhile, institutions with better childcare and maternity leave policies have twice(!) the number of female faculty in STEM (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jan/21/better-maternity-leave-could-help-universities-retain-women-study" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Troeger 2018</a>). In analogy to the affectionately named “leaky pipeline,” the challenge of balancing motherhood and career has been titled the “maternal wall.”</p>



<p><strong>To understand the so-called maternal wall better, let’s take a quick look at the sketch of a typical academic career.</strong></p>



<p>For the sake of this exercise, let’s all pretend to be me. I’m a talented 25 year old PhD candidate studying Physical Chemistry — I use laser spectroscopy to try to understand atypical energy transfer processes in innovative materials that I hope will one day be used to make vastly more efficient solar panels. I got my BSc in Chemistry and Mathematics at the age of 22, and have published 4 scientific papers in two different fields already (Astrophysics and Environmental Chemistry). I’ve got a big scholarship, and a lot of people supporting me to give me the best shot at an academic career — a career I dearly want. But, I also want a family — maybe two or three kids. Here’s what I can expect if I pursue an academic career:</p>



<p>With any luck, 2–3 years from now I’ll graduate with a PhD, at the age of 27. Academics are expected to travel a lot, and to move a lot, especially in their 20s and early 30s — all of the key childbearing years. I’m planning to go on exchange next year, and then the year after that I’ll need to work hard to wrap up research, write a thesis, and travel to several conferences to showcase my work. After I finish my PhD, I’ll need to undertake one or two post doctoral fellowships, lasting one or two years each, probably in completely different places. During that time, I’ll start to apply for professorships. In order to do this, I’ll travel around to conferences to advertise my work and to meet important leaders in my field, and then, if I am invited for interviews, I’ll travel around to different universities for two or three days at a time to undertake these interviews. This usually occurs in a person’s early 30s — our helpful astronomy guy, Dr. Flaherty, found the average time to hiring was 5 years, so let’s say I’m 32 at this point. If offered a position, I’ll spend the next year or two renovating and building a lab, buying equipment, recruiting talented graduate students, and designing and teaching courses. People work really, really hard during this time and have essentially no leisure time. Now I’m 34. Within usually 5 years I’ll need to apply for tenure. This means that by the time I’m 36, I’ll need to be making significant contributions in my field, and then in the final year before applying for tenure, I will once more need to travel to many conferences to promote my work, in order to secure tenure — if I fail to do so, my position at the university would probably be terminated. <strong>Although many universities offer a “tenure extension” in cases where an assistant professor has had a child, this does not solve all of the problems. </strong>Taking a year off during that critical 5 or 6 year period often means that the research “goes bad” — students flounder, projects that were promising get “scooped” by competitors at other institutions, and sometimes, in biology and chemistry especially, experiments literally go bad. You wind up needing to rebuild much more than just a year’s worth of effort.</p>



<p>At no point during this time do I appear stable enough, career-wise, to take even six months off to be pregnant and care for a newborn. Hypothetical future-me is travelling around, or even moving, conducting and promoting my own independent research and training students. As you’re likely aware, very pregnant people and newborns don’t travel well. And academia has a very individualistic and meritocratic culture. Starting at the graduate level, huge emphasis is based on independent research, and independent contributions, rather than valuing team efforts. This feature of academia is both a blessing and a curse. The individualistic culture means that people have the independence and the freedom to pursue whatever research interests them — in fact this is the main draw for me personally. But it also means that there is often no one to fall back on when you need extra support, and because of biological constraints, this winds up impacting women more than men.</p>



<p>At this point, I need to make sure that you’re aware of some basics of female reproductive biology. According to Wikipedia, the unquestionable source of all reliable knowledge, at age 25, my risk of conceiving a baby with chromosomal abnormalities (including Down’s Syndrome) is 1 in about 1400. By 35, that risk more than quadruples to 1 in 340. At 30, I have a 75% chance of a successful birth in one year, but by 35 it has dropped to 66%, and by 40 it’s down to 44%. Meanwhile, 87 to 94% of women report at least 1 health problem immediately after birth, and 1.5% of mothers have a severe health problem, while 31% have long-term persistent health problems as a result of pregnancy (defined as lasting more than six months after delivery). Furthermore, mothers over the age of 35 are at higher risk for pregnancy complications like preterm delivery, hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418963/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cavazos-Rehg et al 2016</a>). Because of factors like these, pregnancies in women over 35 are known as “geriatric pregnancies” due to the drastically increased risk of complications. This tight timeline for births is often called the “biological clock” — if women want a family, they basically need to start before 35. Now, that’s not to say it’s impossible to have a child later on, and in fact some studies show that it has positive impacts on the child’s mental health. But it is riskier.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/270/0*UnDt9Luls2Ic_4BD"/></figure>



<p>So, women with a PhD in STEM know that they have the capability to make interesting contributions to STEM, and to make plenty of money doing it. They usually marry someone who also has or expects to make a high salary as well. But this isn’t the only consideration. Such highly educated women are usually aware of the biological clock and the risks associated with pregnancy, and are confident in their understanding of statistical risks.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/report_final_version-1_0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Irish</a> say, “The common challenge facing young women is achieving a satisfactory work-life balance, especially when children are small. From a career perspective, this period of parenthood (which after all is relatively short compared to an entire working life) tends to coincide exactly with the critical point at which an individual’s career may or may not take off. […] All the evidence shows that it is at this point that women either drop out of the workforce altogether, switch to part-time working or move to more family-friendly jobs, which may be less demanding and which do not always utilise their full skillset.”</p>



<p>And in the <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Netherlands</a>, “The research project in Tilburg also showed that women academics have more often no children or fewer children than women outside academia.” Meanwhile in <a href="https://eige.europa.eu/sites/default/files/garcia_working_paper_5_academic_careers_gender_inequality.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Italy</a> “On a personal level, the data show that for a significant number of women there is a trade-off between family and work: a large share of female economists in Italy do not live with a partner and do not have children”</p>



<p>Most jobs available to women with STEM PhDs offer greater stability and a larger salary earlier in the career. Moreover, most non-academic careers have less emphasis on independent research, meaning that employees usually work within the scope of a larger team, and so if a person has to take some time off, there are others who can help cover their workload. <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>By and large</strong></a><strong>, women leave to go to a career where they will be stable, well funded, and well supported, even if it doesn’t fulfill their passion for STEM — or they leave to be stay-at-home moms or self-employed.</strong></p>



<p>I would presume that if we made academia a more feasible place for a woman with a family to work, we could keep almost all of those 20% of leavers who leave to just stay at home, almost all of the 30% who leave to self-employment, and all of those 30% who leave to more family friendly careers (after all, if academia were made to be as family friendly as other careers, there would be no incentive to leave). Of course, there is nothing wrong with being a stay at home parent — it’s an admirable choice and contributes greatly to our society. <a href="https://www.salary.com/articles/stay-at-home-mom/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">One estimate</a> valued the equivalent salary benefit of stay-at-home parenthood at about $160,000/year. <a href="https://www.ssb.no/forskning/discussion-papers/_attachment/113165?_ts=13ea1e1e480" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Moreover</a>, children with a stay-at-home parent show long term benefits such as better school performance — something that most academic women would want for their children. <strong>But a lot of people only choose it out of necessity — about half of stay-at-home moms would prefer to be working </strong>(<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10834-017-9534-7" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ciciolla, Curlee, &amp; Luthar 2017</a>). When the reality is that your salary is barely more than the cost of daycare, then a lot of people wind up giving up and staying home with their kids rather than paying for daycare. In a heterosexual couple it will usually be the woman that winds up staying home since she is the one who needs to do things like breast feed anyways. And so we lose these women from the workforce.</p>



<p>And yet, somehow, during this informal research adventure of mine, most scholars and policy makers seem to be advising that we try to encourage young girls to be interested in STEM, and to address sexism in the workplace, with the implication that this will fix the high attrition rate in STEM women. But from what I’ve found, <strong>the stats don’t back up sexism as the main reason women leave</strong>. There is sexism, and that is a problem, and women do leave STEM because of it — but it’s a problem that we’re already dealing with pretty successfully, and it’s not why the majority of women who have already obtained STEM PhDs opt to leave the field. The whole family planning thing is huge and for some reason, almost totally swept under the rug — mostly because we’re too shy to talk about it, I think.</p>



<p>In fact, I think that the plethora of articles suggesting that the problem is sexism actually contribute to our unwillingness to talk about the family planning problem, because it reinforces the perception that that men in power will not hire a woman for fear that she’ll get pregnant and take time off. <strong>Why would anyone talk about how they want to have a family when they keep hearing that even the mere suggestion of such a thing will limit their chances of being hired?</strong> I personally know women who have avoided bringing up the topic with colleagues or supervisors for fear of professional repercussions. So we spend all this time and energy talking about how sexism is really bad, and very little time trying to address the family planning challenge, because, I guess, as the stats show, if women are serious enough about science then they just give up on the family (except for the really, really exceptional ones who can handle the stresses of both simultaneously).</p>



<p>To be very clear, I’m not saying that sexism is not a problem. What I am saying is that, thanks to the sustained efforts of a large number of people over a long period of time, we’ve reduced the sexism problem to the point where, at least at the graduate level, it is no longer the largest major barrier to women’s advancement in STEM. <strong>Hurray! </strong>That does not mean that we should stop paying attention to the issue of sexism, but does mean that <strong>it’s time to start paying more attention to other issues</strong>, like how to properly support women who want to raise a family while also maintaining a career in STEM.</p>



<p><strong>So what can we do to better support STEM women who want families?</strong></p>



<p>A couple of solutions have been tentatively tested. From a study mentioned above, it’s clear that <strong>providing free and conveniently located childcare makes a colossal difference to women’s choices of whether or not to stay in STEM</strong>, alongside extended and paid maternity leave. <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/why-cant-the-drug-industry-solve-its-gender-diversity-problem.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Another</a> popular and successful strategy was implemented by a leading woman in STEM, Laurie Glimcher, a past Harvard Professor in Immunology and now CEO of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. While working at NIH, <strong>Dr. Glimcher designed a program to provide primary caregivers (usually women) with an assistant or lab technician to help manage their laboratories while they cared for children</strong>. Now, at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she has created a similar program to pay for a technician or postdoctoral researcher for assistant professors. In the academic setting, Dr. Glimcher’s strategies are key for helping to alleviate the challenges associated with the individualistic culture of academia without compromising women’s research and leadership potential.</p>



<p>For me personally, I’m in the ideal situation for an academic woman. I graduated my BSc with high honours in four years, and with many awards. I’ve already had success in research and have published several peer reviewed papers. I’ve faced some mild sexism from peers and a couple of TAs, but nothing that’s seriously held me back. My supervisors have all been extremely supportive and feminist, and all of the people that I work with on a daily basis are equally wonderful. Despite all of this support, I’m looking at the timelines of an academic career, and the time constraints of female reproduction, and honestly, I don’t see how I can feasible expect to stay in academia and have the family life I want. And since I’m in the privileged position of being surrounded by supportive and feminist colleagues, I can say it: I’m considering leaving academia, if something doesn’t change, because even though I love it, I don’t see how it can fit in to my family plans.</p>



<p><strong>But wait! All of these interventions are really expensive. Money doesn’t just grow on trees, you know!</strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t in general, but in this case it kind of does — well, actually, we already grew it. We spend billions of dollars training women in STEM. By not making full use of their skills, if we look at only the american economy, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0894845318784745" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">we are wasting about $1.5 billion USD per year</a> in economic benefits they would have produced if they stayed in STEM. So here’s a business proposal: let’s spend half of that on better family support and scientific assistants for primary caregivers, and keep the other half in profit. Heck, let’s spend 99% — $1.485 billion (in the states alone) on better support. That should put a dent in the support bill, and I’d sure pick up $15 million if I saw it lying around. Wouldn’t you?</p>



<p>By demonstrating that we will support women in STEM who choose to have a family, we will encourage more women with PhDs to apply for the academic positions that they are eminently qualified for. Our institutions will benefit from the wider applicant pool, and our whole society will benefit from having the skills of these highly trained and intelligent women put to use innovating new solutions to our modern day challenges.</p></div>

Yoking a classic undecidable problem to a polynomial-time task is not the only surprise. The proof refutes a conjecture in classical functional analysis that had apparently been widely believed. Thus this story continues the theme of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/09/27/surprises-in-mathematics-and-theory/">surprises</a> and possibly working the wrong way on conjectures, as we also just mentioned in our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/our-thoughts-on-pnp/">post</a>. The new work subsumes a major <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">paper</a> last year showing that <img alt="{\mathsf{MIP}^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BMIP%7D%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{MIP}^*}"/> contains nondeterministic double exponential time (<img alt="{\mathsf{NEEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNEEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NEEXP}}"/>), which proves it different from its classical counterpart <img alt="{\mathsf{MIP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BMIP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{MIP}}"/>, which László Babai, Lance Fortnow, and Carsten Lund <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/mip2.pdf">proved</a> equal to <img alt="{\mathsf{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NEXP}}"/>.</p>
<p>
The developments have been covered by Scott Aaronson <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512">here</a>, Lance <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/01/quantum-provers-to-infinity-and-beyond.html">here</a>, Boaz Barak <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/01/14/mipre-connes-embedding-conjecture-disproved/">here</a>, and in a personal way by Vidick <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/a-masters-project/">here</a>. The new paper weights in at 165 pages. We will give our own snap-summary and try to add a little from the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Halting Attempt to Explain </h2><p/>
<p>The refuted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connes_embedding_problem">conjecture</a> was made by the Fields Medalist Alain Connes in a context having no overt involvement of quantum mechanics. In these 2013 <a href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~daemi/soficworkshop/Course notes/Capraro Lecture 1.pdf">eight</a>–<a href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~daemi/soficworkshop/Course notes/Capraro Lecture 2.pdf">lecture</a> <a href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~daemi/soficworkshop/Course notes/Capraro Lecture 3-5.pdf">course</a> <a href="http://mtm.ufsc.br/~daemi/soficworkshop/Course notes/Capraro Lecture 5-8.pdf">notes</a> on the conjecture, the word “quantum” appears only once, to say on page 2 of lecture 1:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Other very recent discoveries include the fact that Connes’ embedding conjecture is related to an important problem in Quantum Information Theory, the so-called Tsirelson’s problem… </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4305.pdf">problem</a> of Boris Tsirelson ultimately harks back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_theorem">theorem</a> of John Bell about correlations that are physically realizable using quantum entanglement but not by any classical physical system. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality">CHSH game</a> form of Bell’s theorem, our old friends Alice and Bob can win the game over 85% of the time using quantum, only 75% otherwise. They can get this with just one pair of entangled qubits per trial. Tsirelson proved that the 85% (to wit, <img alt="{\cos^2(\pi/8) = 0.85355\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccos%5E2%28%5Cpi%2F8%29+%3D+0.85355%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cos^2(\pi/8) = 0.85355\dots}"/>) is optimal.  In extensions of these games to larger-size cases, the question becomes: what are the gaps between quantum and classical? </p>
<p>
Whether there is a gap of more than a fixed <img alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\epsilon}"/> then feeds into interactive protocols. We can have parties trying to prove these gaps using their own entanglement. Where it gets tricky is when you allow Alice and Bob to use larger and larger quantum states and ask, can they achieve the gap with some large enough state? The limiting behavior of the gaps is complex. What JNVWY proved is that this becomes like a halting problem. Not just a halting problem, <em>the</em> Halting Problem. Yet two quantum provers, working for a given gap that is achievable, can prove this to a polynomial-time classical verifier. This is the magic of the theorem.</p>
<p>
The reduction from halting to the problem about limits and gaps comes before introducing two-prover systems, as is reflected by JNVWY and also in the wonderful introduction of a 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.08618.pdf">paper</a> by William Slofstra which they reference. In advance of saying more about it, we’ll remark that the new work may provide a new dictionary for translating between (i) issues of finite/infinite precision and other continuous matters, and (ii) possible evolutions of a system of finite size <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> in discrete steps of time and size, where both are unbounded but (in positive cases) finite.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Flashback? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The results strikes Dick and me as shedding new light on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church-Turing-Deutsch_principle">principle</a> stated by David Deutsch in a 1985 <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall04/cos576/papers/deutsch85.pdf">paper</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Every finitely realisable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I was a student at Oxford alongside Deutsch in 1984–1985, and I remember more going on than the searchable record seems to reflect. Deutsch believed that his model of a quantum computer could solve the Halting problem in finite time. He gave at least one talk at the Oxford Mathematical Institute on that claim. As far as I know the claim stayed local to Oxford and generated intense discussion led by Robin Gandy, Roger Penrose, and (if I recall) Angus Macintyre and at least one other person who was versed in random physical processes. </p>
<p>
My recollection is that the nub of the technical argument turned on a property of infinite random sequences that, when hashed out, made some associated predicates decidable, so that Deutsch’s functions were classically total computable after all. Thus the hypercomputation claim was withdrawn. </p>
<p>
Now, however, I wonder whether the two-prover system constitutes the kind of “machine” that Deutsch was <em>intuitively</em> thinking of. As I recall, his claim was not deemed wrong from first principles but from how theorems about random sequences interacted with machine model definitions. The theory of interactive provers as computational systems was then in its infancy. Could Deutsch have had some inkling of it? </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Again we congratulate JNVWY on this achievement of a long-term research goal. Looking at the past, does it relate to the discussion of hypercomputation stemming from the 1980s? We mean a stronger connection than treated <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-quantcomp/#ChurTuriThesDeutPrin">here</a> or in this 2018 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0110136.pdf">paper</a>.  Is it much different from ones where “the mystery … vanishes when the level of precision is explicitly taken into account” (quoting <a href="https://egtheory.wordpress.com/2014/09/01/falsifiability-and-gandys-variant-of-the-church-turing-thesis/">this</a>). Looking ahead, are there any connection to the physical issues of infinity in finite time that we recently discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/31/hobgoblins-in-our-equations/">here</a>?</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<b>Updates 1/17:</b> Gil Kalai has a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/01/17/amazing-zhengfeng-ji-anand-natarajan-thomas-vidick-john-wright-and-henry-yuen-proved-that-mip-re-and-thus-disproved-connes-1976-embedding-conjecture-and-provided-a-negative-answer-to-tsirelso/">post</a> with background on further conjectures impacted by (the failure of) Connes’s conjecture and on quantum prover systems, plus a plethora of links.</p>
<p>
A new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00120-6">article</a> in <i>Nature</i> includes the following quotations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Alain Connes, after saying he was not (yet) able to digest all the material involved in the proof: “It is amazing that the [embedding] problem went so deep and I never foresaw that!”<p/>
</li><li>
Tony Cubitt, University College of London: “What’s amazing is that quantum complexity theory has been the key to the proof.”<p/>
</li><li>
Joseph Fitzsimons, Horizon Quantum Computing: “I thought it would turn out to be one of those complexity-theory questions that might take 100 years to answer.”
</li></ul>
<p>The article and comments on Scott’s blog include interpretations that seem to oppose rather than support Deutsch’s principle on the finiteness of nature.  The tandem of two unlimited provers may not qualify as a “finite machine.”</p>
<p>
There are comments below querying whether the theorem is in first-order arithmetic or how strong a choice axiom it may need.</p>

    <title>Intro TCS recap</title>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This semester I taught <a href="https://cs121.boazbarak.org/">another iteration</a> of my “Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science” course, based on my <a href="https://introtcs.org/">textbook in process</a>.  The book was also used in <a href="https://uvatoc.github.io/">University of Virgnia CS 3102</a> by David Evans and Nathan Brunelle.</p>



<p>The main differences I made in the text and course since its <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2017/07/27/rethinking-the-intro-theory-course/">original version </a>were to make it less “idiosyncratic”: while I still think using programming language terminology is the conceptually “right” way to teach this material, there is a lot to be said for sticking with well-established models. So, I used <strong>Boolean circuits</strong> as the standard model for finite-input non-uniform computation, and <strong>Turing Machines</strong>, as the standard model for unbounded-input uniform computation. (I do talk about the equivalent programming languages view of both models, which can be a more useful perspective for some results, and is also easier to <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcscode">work with in code</a>.)</p>



<p>In any course on intro to theoretical CS, there are always beautiful topics that are left on the “cutting room floor”. To partially compensate for that, we had an entirely optional “advanced section” where guest speakers talked about topics such as error correcting codes, circuit lower bounds,  communication complexity, interactive proofs, and more. The TA in charge of this section – amazing sophomore named <a href="https://singerng.github.io/">Noah Singer</a> – wrote <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/cs_121_5_notes_2019-2.pdf">very detailed lecture notes</a>  for this section.</p>



<p>This semester, students in CS 121 could also do an optional project. Many chose to do a video about topics related to the course, here are some examples:</p>



<ul><li>Helen Huang and Phil Labrum: <a href="https://youtu.be/28lsaX7vZho">“Is your brain Turing complete?”</a> </li><li>Dylan Zhou:  <a href="https://youtu.be/bpSBCFDPoXw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Candy Crush</a> is NP complete and <a href="https://youtu.be/zjr-0HhHWHM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mario Kart tour</a> is PSPACE hard.</li><li>Carolyn Ge, Kavya Kopparapu, and Eric Lin: a 4-part series on theory of machine learning including an interview with Les Valiant: <a href="https://youtu.be/fIbKT0s-Dyw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">What is learnability?</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/9-CVk2b8mec" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cryptographic limitations</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/F8s3QdfJs48" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Cryptography and Machine Learning</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/LUyDekgRP_8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">future possibilities</a>.</li><li>And finally, Christine Cai, April Chen, Zev Nicolai-Scanio, and Grace Tian produced a rap song <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aeOqdN8ItqSfXFepJXSCrTGaS-aBL1ZFXltw6LAVgZc/edit">“Proof Göds”</a> inspired by the course.</li></ul>



<p>There is much work to still do on both the text and the course. Though the text has improved a lot (we do have <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcs/issues">267 closed issues</a> after all) some students still justifiably complained about typos, which can throw off people that are just getting introduced to the topic. I also want to add significantly more solved exercises and examples, since students do find them extremely useful. I need to significantly beef up the NP completeness chapter with more examples of reductions, though I do have Python implementation of <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcscode/blob/master/Chap_13_reductions.ipynb">several reductions </a>and the <a href="https://github.com/boazbk/tcscode/blob/master/Lec_17_Cook_Levin.ipynb">Cook Levin theorem</a>.</p>



<p>This type of course is often known as a “great ideas” in computer science, and so in the book I also added a “Big Idea” environment to highlight those. Of course some of those ideas are bigger than others, but I think the list below reflects well the contents of the course:</p>



<ul><li>If we can represent objects of type T as strings, then we can represent tuples of objects of type T as strings as well.</li><li>A <em>function</em> is not the same as a <em>program</em>.

<p>These are all ideas that I believe are important for Computer Science undergraduates to be exposed to, but covering all of these does make for a every challenging course, which gets literally mixed reviews from the students, with some loving it and some hating it. (I post all reviews on the course home page.) Running a 200-student class is definitely something that I’m still learning how to do. </p></div>

    <title>TR20-003 |  Tight Static Lower Bounds for Non-Adaptive Data Structures | 

	Giuseppe Persiano, 

	Kevin Yeo</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we study the static cell probe complexity of non-adaptive data structures that maintain a subset of $n$ points from a universe consisting of $m=n^{1+\Omega(1)}$ points. A data structure is defined to be non-adaptive when the memory locations that are chosen to be accessed during a query depend only on the query inputs and not on the contents of memory. We prove an $\Omega(\log m / \log (sw/n\log m))$ static cell probe complexity lower bound for non-adaptive data structures that solve the fundamental dictionary problem where $s$ denotes the space of the data structure in the number of cells and $w$ is the cell size in bits. Our lower bounds hold for all word sizes including the bit probe model ($w = 1$) and are matched by the upper bounds of Boninger et al. [FSTTCS'17].

Our results imply a sharp dichotomy between dictionary data structures with one round of adaptive and at least two rounds of adaptivity. We show that $O(1)$, or $O(\log^{1-\epsilon}(m))$, overhead dictionary constructions are only achievable with at least two rounds of adaptivity. In particular, we show that many $O(1)$ dictionary constructions with two rounds of adaptivity such as cuckoo hashing are optimal in terms of adaptivity. On the other hand, non-adaptive dictionaries must use significantly more overhead.

Finally, our results also imply static lower bounds for the non-adaptive predecessor problem. Our static lower bounds peak higher than the previous, best known lower bounds of $\Omega(\log m / \log w)$ for the dynamic predecessor problem by Boninger et al. [FSTTCS'17] and Ramamoorthy and Rao [CCC'18] in the natural setting of linear space $s = \Theta(n)$ where each point can fit in a single cell $w = \Theta(\log m)$. Furthermore, our results are stronger as they apply to the static setting unlike the previous lower bounds that only applied in the dynamic setting.</summary>

    <title>Quantum Provers to Infinity and Beyond</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Internets are buzzing about the new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright and Henry Yuen. See posts by <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512">Scott</a>, <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/01/14/mipre-connes-embedding-conjecture-disproved/">Boaz</a>, not to mention a wonderful backstory by <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/a-masters-project/">Vidick</a> himself and a <a href="https://twitter.com/henryquantum/status/1216936907814375424">tweet stream</a> by Yeun. I'm not an expert enough to verify or even try to explain the proof so I'll just give a brief overview of the result.<br/>
<br/>
For those not familiar with the classes, RE (recursively enumerable) is the simplest of all complexity classes, a language is in RE if there is some Turing machine M such that x is in L if and only if M on input x accepts. For x not in L, M on x can reject or run forever. The classic halting problem, the set of descriptions of Turing machines that halt on empty input, is RE-complete. To nitpick the notation, it should have been r.e. and even c.e. (computably enumerable), a more <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/02/is-it-recursive-computable-or.html">standard notation</a> these days. But given the importance of the result, we can give the authors a pass.<br/>
<br/>
MIP* is the set of things provable to a classically random polynomial-time verifier by two separated provers with an unlimited number of quantumly entangled qubits. Without the quantum entanglement, MIP = NEXP, nondeterministic exponential time, and last year Natarajan and Wright showed that MIP* could do at least exponentially better in their paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">NEEXP in MIP*</a>. NEEXP seems large but still only consists of computable sets. RE gets outside of the computable realm.<br/>
<br/>
I found the first paper more surprising, as it showed that quantum entanglement actually gets more, much more, than classical provers. The second paper does get a much stronger and tight result, and still highly surprising in its own right, as it requires disproving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connes_embedding_problem">Connes' embedding conjecture</a>. In the end we may just consider this one result, as the second paper subsumes the first both in theorem and authors.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't award the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/12/complexity-year-in-review-2019.html">2019 theorem of the year</a> to Natarajan and Wright, instead opting for a paper that had more, how should I say this, sensitivity. This new paper is certainly the front runner for the 2020 honors, albeit it is only mid-January.</div>

    <title>ITCS 2020, Reflections</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I've spent Sunday/Monday at <a href="http://itcs-conf.org/index.html">ITCS</a>, or Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science, where I am giving a talk on this paper on <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2020/11699/">Scheduling with Prediction and the Price of Misprediction</a> (LIPIcs page) (which is one of several recent works on <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/Talks/ALGO2109.pptx">Algorithms with Predictions</a> (powerpoint slides)).<br/><br/>I'm told it's 10 years since ITCS started as a conference, and I was one of the skeptics that really did not think it was a good idea 10 years ago.  So as I'm sitting in the sessions, what do I think now?  What are the pros and cons of ITCS?<br/><br/>On the negative side, ITCS is not very big.  It is just over 100 people registered, so it's like a big workshop/small conference size.  (And considering that it's usually held in central places with lots of students, those numbers are buffered by locals.)  Somehow, it's scheduled the 2nd week of January, right after SODA, which seems problematic, and certainly (if it's kept that way) may keep it from getting any larger.  The number of "senior people" around at any one time seemed generally small, a problem for things like "Graduating Bits" (see below).  As ITCS, at least 10 years ago, was supposed to build up to another "premier" TCS conference, focused on "innovative" work, the attendance seems a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>On the neutral side, the conference is single-session, and to make that work, talks this year are limited to 12 minutes.  Your mileage may vary on whether you think this is good or bad;  it seems to work.  (My take:  I slightly prefer parallel sessions, because it means there's more times where there's something I want to see, and that's more important than the times where there are two talks at the same time I want to see.  And 12 minutes is certainly workable but maybe a few minutes short.  But again, that's just my opinion.)  This year (and possibly going forward), some papers were accepted without a full talk -- instead they have a 3-minute talk and a poster in a poster session.  Again, it's not clear to me if this is good or bad (though more paper acceptances makes me lean to the good side), but it seemed to work fine and people were happy with it.  (Such papers are considered full publications and treated the same in the proceedings.)<br/><br/>On the positive side, the conference seems well run.  It's held in a university building, so no expensive hotel costs;  instead they're generous with food and keep registration costs reasonably low.  They use <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics">LIPIcs</a>, which provides a good system and approach for publishing papers at low cost.  (Note, I was until recently part of the LIPIcs editorial board, so I'm biased there.)  They seem to be covering their expenses from what I understand.  The business meeting was blessedly short.  They're recording all the talks.  They're doing interesting things like "Graduating Bits" for people who are job-looking (where people graduating or coming out of a postdoc give short talks about their work).<br/><br/>In terms of content, it seems really good.  I've seen several good talks and interesting papers.  While I'm not sure how to quantify whether ITCS work is more "innovative" than the work at other major TCS conferences, I do actually think they are noticeably more open at ITCS than other conferences about accepting papers based on the paper's underlying idea rather than on "technical mastery".<br/><br/>My thoughts 10 years ago were that ITCS was not a great outcome for the community, and that instead the community should push for:<br/><br/>1)  Aiming to do better about opening up the criteria for paper acceptance, including weighing innovation/practical relevance in reviewing papers at FOCS/STOC/SODA.<br/>2)  Increasing the number of papers accepted to these conferences, as too many good papers were being rejected.<br/><br/>Viewed under this lens, ITCS could, I think, be viewed as a success.  The theory community seems unwilling to expand conferences by accepting more papers.  (I note that while the STOC theory-fest has changed and expanded STOC, it hasn't really seemed to increase attendance, and while the number of accepted papers has increased slightly, it hasn't kept pace with the growth in the field.)  ITCS provides another venue for high-quality theory papers, thereby increasing the number of such papers published each year within the theory community, and I think it is generally viewed as a high-quality conference.  And, as I mentioned, ITCS seems at least somewhat more flexible in its criteria for what is an acceptable paper.  ITCS has, I think, in these regards been a benefit for the theory community.<br/><br/>However, despite the success of ITCS, I think it's a band-aid on structural issues in the theory community.  While these issues are complex and many-sided, just comparing with the growth and excitement in the AI community is a little depressing.  Indeed, what I see is AI <i>absorbing</i> significant parts of the theory community;  lots of theory papers now end up at NeurIPS, AAAI, ICML, or AISTATS, because the theory community doesn't seem to have room for them, or doesn't judge them as sufficiently significant.  I view this as a problem for the theory community, the result of the problems I saw 10 years ago for which I didn't think ITCS was the right response.  (Though perhaps it was/is not really viewed as a problem by others;  all of CS, including theory, seems to continue growing;  theory just seems to me to be growing less than it could or should.)<br/><br/>To conclude, my thanks and congratulations to those many people that have organized and maintained ITCS over the years;  I appreciate your work, as I think the whole community does.  <br/><br/>By the way, I thought it never snowed in Seattle, so I'm confused; what is all the cold white stuff outside?</div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In an exciting <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">manuscript just posted on the arxiv</a>, Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen prove that there is a 2-prover quantum protocol (with shared entanglement) for the halting problem. As a consequence they resolve negatively a host of open problems in quantum information theory and operator algebra, including refuting the longstanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connes_embedding_problem">Connes embedding conjecture</a>. See also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512">Scott’s post</a> and <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/a-masters-project/">this blog post</a> of Thomas Vidick discussing his personal history with these questions, that started with his Masters project under Julia Kempe’s supervision 14 years ago.</p>



<p>I am not an expert in this area, and still have to look the paper beyond the first few pages, but find the result astounding. In particular, the common intuition is that since all physical quantities are “nice” function (continuous, differentiable, etc..), we could never distinguish between the case that the universe is infinite or discretized at a fine enough grid.  The new work (as far as I understand) provides a finite experiment that can potentially succeed with probability 1 if the two provers use an infinite amount of shared entangled state, but would succeed with probability at most 1/2 if they use only a finite amount. A priori you would expect that if there is a strategy that succeeds with probability 1 with an infinite entanglement, then you could succeed with probability at least <img alt="1-\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="1-\epsilon"/> with a finite entangled state whose dimension depends only on <img alt="\epsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\epsilon"/>.</p>



<p>The result was preceded by Ito and Vidick’s 2012 result that <img alt="\mathbf{NEXP} \subseteq \mathbf{MIP^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BNEXP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Cmathbf%7BMIP%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbf{NEXP} \subseteq \mathbf{MIP^*}"/> and Natarajan and Wright’s result last year that <img alt="\mathbf{NEEXP}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BNEEXP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbf{NEEXP}"/> (non deterministic <em>double exponential</em> time) is contained in <img alt="\mathbf{MIP^*}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf%7BMIP%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\mathbf{MIP^*}"/>. This brings to mind Edmonds’ classic quote that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“For practical purposes the difference between algebraic and exponential order is often more crucial than the difference between finite and non-finite”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>sometimes, the difference between double-exponential and infinite turns out to be non-existent.. </p>

See <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512#comment-1828321">this comment</a> for more.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you’re interested in the above topic, then you should probably stop reading this post right now, and switch to <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/01/14/a-masters-project/">this better post</a> by Thomas Vidick, one of the authors of the new breakthrough.

<p>Still here?  Alright, alright…</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">Here’s the paper</a>, which weighs in at 165 pages.  The authors are <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/zhengfeng.ji">Zhengfeng Ji</a>, <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~anataraj/">Anand Natarajan</a>, my former postdoc <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/">Thomas Vidick</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/john-wright">John Wright</a> (who will be joining the CS faculty here at UT Austin this fall), and my wife Dana’s former student <a href="http://www.henryyuen.net/">Henry Yuen</a>.  Rather than pretending that I can provide intelligent commentary on this opus in the space of a day, I’ll basically just open my comment section to discussion and quote the abstract:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We show that the class MIP* of languages that can be decided by a classical verifier interacting with multiple all-powerful quantum provers sharing entanglement is equal to the class RE of recursively enumerable languages.  Our proof builds upon the quantum low-degree test of (Natarajan and Vidick, FOCS 2018) by integrating recent developments from (Natarajan and Wright, FOCS 2019) and combining them with the recursive compression framework of (Fitzsimons et al., STOC 2019).<br/>An immediate byproduct of our result is that there is an efficient reduction from the Halting Problem to the problem of deciding whether a two-player nonlocal game has entangled value 1 or at most 1/2.  Using a known connection, undecidability of the entangled value implies a negative answer to Tsirelson’s problem: we show, by providing an explicit example, that the closure <em>C<sub>qa</sub></em> of the set of quantum tensor product correlations is strictly included in the set <em>C<sub>qc</sub></em> of quantum commuting correlations.  Following work of (Fritz, Rev. Math. Phys. 2012) and (Junge et al., J. Math. Phys. 2011) our results provide a refutation of Connes’ embedding conjecture from the theory of von Neumann algebras. </p></blockquote>



<p>To say it differently (in response to a commenter’s request), some of the major implications are as follows.</p>



<p>(1) There is a protocol by which two entangled provers can convince a polynomial-time verifier of the answer to <em>any computable problem whatsoever</em> (!!), or indeed that a given Turing machine halts.</p>



<p>(2) There is a two-prover game, analogous to the Bell/CHSH game, for which Alice and Bob can do markedly better with a <em>literally infinite</em> amount of entanglement than they can with any finite amount of entanglement.</p>



<p>(3) There is no algorithm even to <em>approximate</em> the entangled value of a two-prover game (i.e., the probability that Alice and Bob win the game, if they use the best possible strategy and as much entanglement as they like). Instead, this problem is equivalent to the halting problem.</p>



<p>(4) There are types of correlations between Alice and Bob that can be produced using infinite entanglement, but that can’t even be approximated using any finite amount of entanglement.</p>



<p>(5) The Connes embedding conjecture, a central conjecture from the theory of operator algebras dating back to the 1970s, is false.</p>



<p>Note that all of these implications—including the ones for pure math and the foundations of quantum physics—were obtained using tools that originated in theoretical computer science, specifically the study of interactive proof systems.</p>



<p>I can remember when the class MIP* was first defined and studied, back around 2003, and people made the point that we didn’t know any reasonable upper bound on the class’s power—not NEXP, not NEEEEXP, not even the set of all computable languages.  Back then, the joke was how far our <em>proof techniques</em> were from what was self-evidently the truth.  I don’t remember a single person who seriously contemplated that two entangled provers could convince a polynomial-time verifier than an arbitrary Turing machine halts.</p>



<p>Still, ever since Natarajan and Wright’s <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-expand-the-frontier-of-verifiable-knowledge-20190523/">NEEXP in MIP*</a> breakthrough last year, all of us in quantum computing theory knew that MIP*=RE was a live possibility—and all through the summer and fall, I heard many hints that such a breakthrough was imminent.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that, with only classical correlations between the provers, MIP gives “merely” the power of NEXP (Nondeterministic Exponential Time), while with arbitrary non-signalling correlations between the provers, the so-called MIP<sub>ns</sub> gives the power of EXP (Deterministic Exponential Time).  So it’s particularly striking that quantum entanglement, which is “intermediate” between classical correlations and arbitrary non-signalling correlations, yields such wildly greater computational power than either of those two.</p>



<p>The usual proviso applies: when I’ve blogged excitedly about preprints with amazing new results, most have stood, but at least two ended up being retracted.  Still, assuming this one stands (as I’m guessing it will), I regard it as <em>easily</em> one of the biggest complexity-theoretic (and indeed computability-theoretic!) surprises so far in this century.  Huge congratulations to the authors on what looks to be a historic achievement.</p>



<p>In unrelated news, for anyone for whom the 165-page MIP* paper is too heavy going (really??), please enjoy this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1XXjWr5frE">CNBC video on quantum computing</a>, which features several clips of yours truly speaking in front of a fake UT tower.</p>



<p>In other unrelated news, I’m also excited about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12561">this preprint</a> by Avishay Tal, which sets a new record for the largest known separation between quantum query complexity and classical randomized query complexity, making substantial progress toward proving a conjecture by me and Andris Ambainis from 2015.  (Not <em>the</em> “Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture,” a different conjecture.)</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In a <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">previous post</a> I reported on the beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">recent result</a> by Natarajan and Wright showing the astounding power of multi-prover interactive proofs with quantum provers sharing entanglement: in letters, <img alt="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEEXP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEEXP} \subseteq \text{MIP}^\star}"/>. In this post I want to report on follow-up work with Ji, Natarajan, Wright, and Yuen, that we just posted to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">arXiv</a>. This time however I will tell the story from a personal point of view, with all the caveats that this implies: the “hard science” will be limited (but there could be a hint as to how “science”, to use a big word, “progresses”, to use an ill-defined one), the story is far too long, and it might be mostly of interest to me only. It’s a one-sided story, but that has to be. (In particular below I may at times attribute credit in the form “X had this idea”. This is my recollection only, and it is likely to be inaccurate. Certainly I am ignoring a lot of important threads.) I wrote this because I enjoyed recollecting some of the best moments in the story just as much as some the hardest; it is fun to look back and find meanings in ideas that initially appeared disconnected. Think of it as an example of how different lines of work can come together in unexpected ways; a case for open-ended research. It’s also an antidote against despair that I am preparing for myself: whenever I feel I’ve been stuck on a project for far too long, I’ll come back to this post and ask myself if it’s been 14 years yet — if not, then press on.</p>
<p>It likely comes as a surprise to me only that I am no longer fresh out of the cradle. My academic life started in earnest some 14 years ago, when in the Spring of 2006 I completed my Masters thesis in Computer Science under the supervision of Julia Kempe, at Orsay in France. I had met Julia the previous term: her class on quantum computing was, by far, the best-taught and most exciting course in the Masters program I was attending, and she had gotten me instantly hooked. Julia agreed to supervise my thesis, and suggested that I look into some interesting recent result by Stephanie Wehner that linked the study of entanglement and nonlocality in quantum mechanics to complexity-theoretic questions about interactive proof systems (specifically, this was Stephanie’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508201">paper</a> showing that <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BQIP%7D%282%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star \subseteq \text{QIP}(2)}"/>).</p>
<p>At the time the topic was very new. It had been initiated the previous year with a beautiful <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404076">paper</a> by Cleve et al. (that I have recommended to many a student since!). It was a perfect fit for me: the mathematical aspects of complexity theory and quantum computing connected to my undergraduate background, while the relative concreteness of quantum mechanics (it is a physical theory after all) spoke to my desire for real-world connection (not “impact” or even “application” — just “connection”). Once I got myself up to speed in the area (which consisted of three papers: the two I already mentioned, together with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0102013">paper</a> by Kobayashi and Matsumoto where they studied interactive proofs with quantum messages), Julia suggested looking into the the “entangled-prover” class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> introduced in the aforementioned paper by Cleve et al. Nothing was known about this class! Nothing besides the trivial inclusion of single-prover interactive proofs, IP, and the containment in…ALL, the trivial class that contains all languages.<br/>
Yet the characterization MIP=NEXP of its classical counterpart by Babai et al. in the 1990s had led to one of the most productive lines of work in complexity of the past few decades, through the PCP theorem and its use from hardness of approximation to efficient cryptographic schemes. Surely, studying <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> had to be a productive direction? In spite of its well-established connection to classical complexity theory, via the formalism of interactive proofs, this was a real gamble. The study of entanglement from the complexity-theoretic perspective was entirely new, and bound to be fraught with difficulty; very few results were available and the existing lines of works, from the foundations of nonlocality to more recent endeavors in device-independent cryptography, provided little other starting point than strong evidence that even the simplest examples came with many unanswered questions. But my mentor was fearless, and far from a novice in terms of defraying new areas, having done pioneering work in areas ranging from quantum random walks to Hamiltonian complexity through adiabatic computation. Surely this would lead to something?</p>
<p>It certainly did. More sleepless nights than papers, clearly, but then the opposite would only indicate dullness. Julia’s question led to far more unexpected consequences than I, or I believe she, could have imagined at the time. I am writing this post to celebrate, in a personal way, the latest step in 15 years of research by dozens of researchers: today my co-authors and I uploaded to the quant-ph arXiv what we consider a complete characterization of the power of entangled-prover interactive proof systems by proving the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>, the class of all recursively enumerable languages (a complete problem for RE is the halting problem). Without goign too much into the result itself (if you’re interested, we have a long introduction waiting for you), and since this is a personal blog, I will continue on with some personal thoughts about the path that got us there.</p>
<p>When Julia &amp; I started working on the question, our main source of inspiration were the results by Cleve et al. showing that the nonlocal correlations of entanglement had interesting consequences when seen through the lens of interactive proof systems in complexity theory. Since the EPR paper a lot of work in understanding entanglement had already been accomplished in the Physics community, most notably by Mermin, Peres, Bell, and more recently the works in device-indepent quantum cryptography by Acin, Pironio, Scarani and many others stimulated by Ekert’s proposal for quantum key distribution and Mayers and Yao’s idea for “device-independent cryptography”. By then we certainly knew that “spooky action-at-a-distance” did not entail any faster-than-light communication, and indeed was not really “action-at-a-distance” in the first place but merely “correlation-at-a-distance”. What Cleve et al. recognized is that these “spooky correlations-at-a-distance” were sufficiently special so as to not only give numerically different values in “Bell inequalities”, the tool invented by Bell to evidence nonlocality in quantum mechanics, but also have some potentially profound consequences in complexity theory. In particular, examples such as the “Magic Square game” demonstrated that enough correlation could be gained from entanglement so as to defeat basic proof systems whose soundness relied only on the absence of communication between the provers, an assumption that until then had been wrongly equated with the assumption that any computation performed by the provers could be modeled entirely locally. I think that the fallacy of this implicit assumption came as a surprise to complexity theorists, who may still not have entirely internalized it. Yet the perfect quantum strategy for the Magic Square game provides a very concrete “counter-example” to the soundness of the “clause-vs-variable” game for 3SAT. Indeed this game, a reformulation by Aravind and Cleve-Mermin of a Bell Inequality discovered by Mermin and Peres in 1990, can be easily re-framed as a 3SAT system of equations that is <em>not</em> satisfiable and yet is such that the associated two-player clause-vs-variable game has a <em>perfect</em> quantum strategy. It is this observation, made in the paper by Cleve et al., that gave the first strong hint that the use of entanglement in interactive proof systems could make many classical results in the area go awry.</p>
<p>By importing the study of non-locality into complexity theory Cleve et al. immediately brought it into the realm of asymptotic analysis. Complexity theorists don’t study fixed objects, they study families of objects that tend to have a uniform underlying structure and whose interesting properties manifest themselves “in the limit”. As a result of this new perspective focus shifted from the study of single games or correlations to infinite families thereof. Some of the early successes of this translation include the “unbounded violations” that arose from translating asymptotic separations in communication complexity to the language of Bell inequalities and correlations (e.g. this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5043">paper</a>). These early successes attracted the attention of some physicists working in foundations as well as some mathematical physicists, leading to a productive exploration that combined tools from quantum information, functional analysis and complexity theory.</p>
<p>The initial observations made by Cleve et al. had pointed to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> as a possibly interesting complexity class to study. Rather amazingly, nothing was known about it! They had shown that under strong restrictions on the verifier’s predicate (it should be an XOR of two answer bits), a collapse took place: by the work of Hastad, XOR-MIP equals NEXP, but <img alt="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BXOR-MIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{XOR-MIP}^\star}"/> is included in EXP. This seemed very fortuitous (the inclusion is proved via a connection with semidefinite programming that seems tied to the structure of XOR-MIP protocols): could entanglement induce a collapse of the entire, unrestricted class? We thought (at this point mostly Julia thought, because I had no clue) that this ought not to be the case, and so we set ourselves to show that the equality <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{NEXP}}"/>, that would directly parallel Babai et al.’s characterization MIP=NEXP, holds. We tried to show this by introducing techniques to “immunize” games against entanglement: modify an interactive proof system so that its structure makes it “resistant” to the kind of “nonlocal powers” that can be used to defeat the clause-vs-variable game (witness the Magic Square). This was partially successful, and led to one of the papers I am most proud of — I am proud of it because I think it introduced elementary techniques (such as the use of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality — inside joke — more seriously, basic things such as “prover-switching”, “commutation tests”, etc.) that are now routine manipulations in the area. The paper was a hard sell! It’s good to remember the first rejections we received. They were not unjustified: the main point of criticism was that we were only able to establish a hardness result for exponentially small completeness-soundness gap. A result for such a small gap in the classical setting follows directly from a very elementary analysis based on the Cook-Levin theorem. So then why did we have to write so many pages (and so many applications of Cauchy-Schwarz!) to arrive at basically the same result (with a <img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>)?</p>
<p>Eventually we got lucky and the paper was accepted to a conference. But the real problem, of establishing any non-trivial lower bound on the class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> with constant (or, in the absence of any parallel repetition theorem, inverse-polynomial) completeness-soundness gap, remained. By that time I had transitioned from a Masters student in France to a graduate student in Berkeley, and the problem (pre-)occupied me during some of the most difficult years of my Ph.D. I fully remember spending my first year entirely thinking about this (oh and sure, that systems class I had to pass to satisfy the Berkeley requirements), and then my second year — yet, getting nowhere. (I checked the arXiv to make sure I’m not making this up: two full years, no posts.) I am forever grateful to my fellow student Anindya De for having taken me out of the cycle of torture by knocking on my door with one of the most interesting questions I have studied, that led me into quantum cryptography and quickly resulted in an enjoyable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4680">paper</a>. It was good to feel productive again! (Though the paper had fun reactions as well: after putting it on the arXiv we quickly heard from experts in the area that we had solved an irrelevant problem, and that we better learn about information theory — which we did, eventually leading to another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5514">paper</a>, etc.) The project had distracted me and I set interactive proofs aside; clearly, I was stuck.</p>
<p>About a year later I visited IQC in Waterloo. I don’t remember in what context the visit took place. What I do remember is a meeting in the office of Tsuyoshi Ito, at the time a postdoctoral scholar at IQC. Tsuyoshi asked me to explain our result with Julia. He then asked a very pointed question: the bedrock for the classical analysis of interactive proof systems is the “linearity test” of Blum-Luby-Rubinfeld (BLR). Is there any sense in which we could devise a quantum version of that test?</p>
<p>What a question! This was great. At first it seemed fruitless: in what sense could one argue that quantum provers apply a “linear function”? Sure, quantum mechanics is linear, but that is besides the point. The linearity is a property of the prover’s answers as a function of their question. So what to make of the quantum state, the inherent randomness, etc.?</p>
<p>It took us a few months to figure it out. Once we got there however, the answer was relatively simple — the prover should be making a question-independent measurement that returns a linear function that it applies to its question in order to obtain the answer returned to the verifier — and it opened the path to our subsequent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">paper</a> showing that the inclusion of NEXP in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> indeed holds. Tsuyoshi’s question about linearity testing had allowed us to make the connection with PCP techniques; from there to MIP=NEXP there was only one step to make, which is to analyze multi-linearity testing. That step was suggested by my Ph.D. advisor, Umesh Vazirani, who was well aware of the many pathways towards the classical PCP theorem, since the theorem had been obtained in great part by his former student Sanjeev Arora. It took a lot of technical work, yet conceptually a single question from my co-author had sufficed to take me out of a 3-year slumber.</p>
<p>This was in 2012, and I thought we were done. For some reason the converse inclusion, of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> in NEXP, seemed to resist our efforts, but surely it couldn’t resist much longer. Navascues et al. had introduced a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that seemed to give the right answer (technically they could only show convergence to a relaxation, the commuting value, but that seemed like a technicality; in particular, the values coincide when restricted to finite-dimensional strategies, which is all we computer scientists cared about). There were no convergence bounds on the hierarchy, yet at the same time commutative SDP hierarchies were being used to obtain very strong results in combinatorial optimization, and it seemed like it would only be a matter of time before someone came up with an analysis of the quantum case. (I had been trying to solve a related “dimension reduction problem” with Oded Regev for years, and we were making no progress; yet it seemed <em>someone</em> ought to!)</p>
<p>In Spring 2014 during an open questions session at a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/qhc2014-1">workshop</a> at the Simons Institute in Berkeley Dorit Aharonov suggested that I ask the question of the possible inclusion of QMA-EXP, the exponential-sized-proofs analogue of QMA, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. A stronger result than the inclusion of NEXP (under assumptions), wouldn’t it be a more natural “fully quantum” analogue of MIP=NEXP? Dorit’s suggestion was motivated by research on the “quantum PCP theorem”, that aims to establish similar hardness results in the realm of the local Hamiltonian problem; see e.g. <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/quantum-pcp-conjectures/">this post</a> for the connection. I had no idea how to approach the question — I also didn’t really believe the answer could be positive — but what can you do, if Dorit asks you something… So I reluctantly went to the board and asked the question. Joe Fitzsimons was in the audience, and he immediately picked it up! Joe had the fantastic ideas of using quantum error-correction, or more specifically secret-sharing, to distribute a quantum proof among the provers. His enthusiasm overcame my skepticism, and we eventually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0260">showed</a> the desired inclusion. Maybe <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> <em>was</em> bigger than <img alt="{\text{NEXP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BNEXP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{NEXP}}"/> after all.</p>
<p>Our result, however, had a similar deficiency as the one with Julia, in that the completeness-soundness gap was exponentially small. Obtaining a result with a constant gap took 3 years of couple more years of work and the fantastic energy and insights of a Ph.D. student at MIT, Anand Natarajan. Anand is the first person I know of to have had the courage to dive in to the most technical aspects of the analysis of the aforementioned results, while also bringing in the insights of a “true quantum information theorist” that were supported by Anand’s background in Physics and upbringing in the group of Aram Harrow at MIT. (In contrast I think of myself more as a “raw” mathematician; I don’t really understand quantum states other than as psd matrices…not that I understand math either of course; I suppose I’m some kind of a half-baked mish-mash.) Anand had many ideas but one of the most beautiful ones led to what he poetically called the “Pauli braiding test”, a “truly quantum” analogue of the BLR linearity test that amounts to doing <em>two</em> linearity tests in conjugate bases and piecing the results together into a robust test for <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-qubit entanglement (I wrote about our work on this <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/pauli-braiding/">here</a>).</p>
<p>At approximately the same time Zhengfeng Ji had another wonderful idea, that was in some sense orthogonal to our work. (My interpretation of) Zhengfeng’s idea is that one can see an interactive proof system as a computation (verifier-prover-verifier) and use Kitaev’s circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction to transform the entire computation into a “quantum CSP” (in the same sense that the local Hamiltonian problem is a quantum analogue of classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSP)) that could then itself be verified by a quantum multi-prover interactive proof system…with exponential gains in efficiency! Zhengfeng’s result implied an exponential improvement in complexity compared to the result by Julia and myself, showing inclusion of NEEXP, instead of NEXP, in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. However, Zhengfeng’s technique suffered from the same exponentially small completeness-soundness gap as we had, so that the best lower bound on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> per se remained NEXP.</p>
<p>Both works led to follow-ups. With Natarajan we promoted the Pauli braiding test into a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">quantum low-degree test</a>” that allowed us to show the inclusion of QMA-EXP into <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>, with constant gap, thereby finally answering the question posed by Aharonov 4 years after it was asked. (I should also say that by then all results on <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> started relying on a sequence of parallel repetition results shown by Bavarian, Yuen, and others; I am skipping this part.) In parallel, with Ji, Fitzsimons, and Yuen we showed that Ji’s compression technique could be “iterated” an arbitrary number of times. In fact, by going back to “first principles” and representing verifiers uniformly as Turing machines we realized that the compression technique could be used iteratively to (up to small caveats) give a new proof of the fact (first <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">shown</a> by Slofstra using an embedding theorem for finitely presented group) that the zero-gap version of <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains the halting problem. In particular, the entangled value is uncomputable! This was not the first time that uncomputability crops in to a natural problem in quantum computing (e.g. the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04573">spectral gap paper</a>), yet it still surprises when it shows up. Uncomputable! How can anything be uncomputable!</p>
<p>As we were wrapping up our paper Henry Yuen realized that our “iterated compression of interactive proof systems” was likely optimal, in the following sense. Even a mild improvement of the technique, in the form of a slower closing of the completeness-soundness gap through compression, would yield a much stronger result: undecidability of the constant-gap class <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>. It was already known by work of Navascues et al., Fritz, and others, that such a result would have, if not surprising, certainly consequences that seemed like they would be taking us out of our depth. In particular, undecidability of any language in <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> would imply a negative resolution to a series of equivalent conjectures in functional analysis, from Tsirelson’s problem to Connes’ Embedding Conjecture through Kirchberg’s QWEP conjecture. While we liked our result, I don’t think that we believed it could resolve any conjecture(s) in functional analysis.</p>
<p>So we moved on. At least I moved on, I did some cryptography for a change. But Anand Natarajan and his co-author John Wright did not stop there. They had the last major insight in this story, which underlies their recent STOC best paper described in the previous <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">post</a>. Briefly, they were able to combine the two lines of work, by Natarajan &amp; myself on low-degree testing and by Ji et al. on compression, to obtain a compression that is specially tailored to the existing <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> protocol for NEXP and compresses that protocol without reducing its completeness-soundness gap. This then let them show Ji’s result that <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/> contains NEEXP, but this time with constant gap! The result received well-deserved attention. In particular, it is the first in this line of works to not suffer from any caveats (such as a closing gap, or randomized reductions, or some kind of “unfair” tweak on the model that one could attribute the gain in power to), and it implies an unconditional separation between MIP and <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star}"/>.</p>
<p>As they were putting the last touches on their result, suddenly something happened, which is that a path towards a much bigger result opened up. What Natarajan &amp; Wright had achieved is a one-step gapless compression. In our iterated compression paper we had observed that iterated gapless compression would lead to <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar%3D%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star=\text{RE}}"/>, implying negative answers to the aforementioned conjectures. So then?</p>
<p>I suppose it took some more work, but in some way all the ideas had been laid out in the previous 15 years of work in the complexity of quantum interactive proof systems; we just had to put it together. And so a decade after the characterization <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.4737">QIP = PSPACE</a> of single-prover quantum interactive proof systems, we have arrived at a characterization of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, <img alt="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctext%7BMIP%7D%5E%5Cstar+%3D+%5Ctext%7BRE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\text{MIP}^\star = \text{RE}}"/>. With one author in common between the two papers: congratulations Zhengfeng!</p>
<p>Even though we just posted a paper, in a sense there is much more left to do. I am hopeful that our complexity-theoretic result will attract enough interest from the mathematicians’ community, and especially operator algebraists, for whom CEP is a central problem, that some of them will be willing to devote time to understanding the result. I also recognize that much effort is needed on our own side to make it accessible in the first place! I don’t doubt that eventually complexity theory will not be needed to obtain the purely mathematical consequences; yet I am hopeful that some of the ideas may eventually find their way into the construction of interesting mathematical objects (such as, who knows, a non-hyperlinear group).</p>
<p>That was a good Masters project…thanks Julia!</p></div>

    <title>What would you do if you showed P=NP? I would reread Factor Man by Matt Ginsberg</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lance has often said (and also in <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/01/silicon-valley-ethics.html">this</a>) that if P=NP that would be great for the world: much more efficient ways to build things, science could be done better, etc, and that is much more important than that modern crypto would no longer work. We now have the technology to do private key really well--- like a thumb drive that has a billion bits for 1-time pads.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the world would be better off in some ways, I wonder how much damage would be done in the transition period from public to private key. Would the world recover enough to reap the benefits of P=NP?<br/>
<br/>
First think of what YOU would do if you showed P=NP (and lets assume your algorithm is either reasonable or could be made reasonable with some time and effort).<br/>
<br/>
The novel <i>Factor Man  </i>is about what someone who has solved P=NP does. I won't tell you how it goes, but they deal with the issue intelligently. So if I solved P=NP then I would first re-read it, and think through if I would do that, or modify what is done, or what.  Its a good start.<br/>
<br/>
I reviewed the book in SIGACT News or you can read my review <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/factorman.pdf">here</a><br/>
<br/>
On a slightly diff note, here is the latest argument I've heard for why P=NP:<br/>
<br/>
Planar 2-coloring is in P<br/>
<br/>
Planar 4-coloring is in P<br/>
<br/>
So<br/>
<br/>
Planar 3-coloring should be in P.<br/>
<br/>
This was said by a very good math/cs ugrad at UMCP. I do not know if he was kidding.<br/>
