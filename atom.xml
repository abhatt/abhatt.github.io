    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award recognizes an outstanding dissertation in the field of economics and computation. The award is conferred annually at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation and includes a certificate, complimentary conference registration, and an honorarium of $1,500. A certificate may further be given to up to two runners-up. No award may be conferred if the nominations are judged not to meet the standards for the award.</p>



<p>To be eligible, a dissertation must be on a topic related to economics and computation and must have been defended successfully during the calendar year preceding the year of the award presentation.</p>



<p>The next SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award will be given for dissertations defended in 2021. Nominations are due by <em>February 28th, 2022</em> (Anywhere on Earth), and must be submitted <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">by email to the Award Committee</a> with “2021 SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award” in the subject. A dissertation may be nominated simultaneously for both the SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award and the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p>



<p>Nominations may be made by any member of SIGecom and will typically come from the dissertation supervisor. Self-nomination is not allowed. Nominations for the award <em>must include the following</em>, preferably having items 1, 3, and 4 in a single PDF file:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>A two-page summary of the dissertation, written by the nominee, including bibliographic data and links to publicly accessible versions of published papers based primarily on the dissertation.</li><li>An English-language version of the dissertation in a separate file.</li><li>An endorsement letter of no more than two pages by the nominator, arguing the merit of the dissertation, potential impact, and justification of the nomination. This document should also certify the dissertation defense date.</li><li>The names, email addresses, and affiliations of at least two additional endorsers.</li></ol>



<p>The additional endorsement letters themselves should be <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">sent directly by email</a>, by the same deadline. These endorsements should be no longer than 500 words and should specify the relationship of the endorser to the nominee, contributions of the dissertation, and its potential impact on the field.</p>



<p>It is expected that a nominated candidate, if selected for the award, will attend the next ACM Conference on Economics and Computation on July 11–15, 2022, to accept the award and give a presentation on the dissertation work.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The holiday season is just around the corner. Best wishes to you and your loved ones in advance from us here at PTReview. This month, we had <s>four</s> five papers in all. To prepare for the festive mood associated with the onset of December, also included are brief updates on the recently disproven implicit graph conjecture. Let’s dig in. <em>(And please, do let us know if we missed your paper)</em>. </p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Thanks to our readers for pointing out a paper we missed.)</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Downsampling for Testing and Learning in Product Distributions</strong> by Nathaniel Harms, Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07449">arXiv</a>). Contemplating on connections in algorithms used for testing a diverse collection of function properties, this paper provides a unified and generalized view of a technique: which the authors call downsampling. As the paper explains, the name is motivated by analogy to image/signal processing tasks. Very often, these tasks involve two steps. In the first step, you break the input domain into “grid cells”. You use oracle calls to the function to obtain a crude approximation over all these cells.  In the second step, you learn this gridded-up or coarsened function cell-by-cell.</p>



<p>This two-step attack could just be what the doctor ordered for your favorite function property testing problem: in particular, it has been put to work for approximately testing visual properties, approximating distance to monotonicity in high dimensions, testing \(k\)-monotone functions, and more. However, if you wanted to obtain property testers using this approach in the distribution-free setup, your ordeal might be far from over. The unknown distribution your domain is equipped with can mess with geometric arguments your gridding approach hopes to exploit. This is precisely the setup considered in the paper (i.e, distribution-free testing of function properties).</p>



<p>The essence of downsampling, is captured by a slick proposition that prescribes coarsening as your goto weapon if the<br/>1) fraction of cells on which \(f\) is not constant, and<br/>2) a measure of how non-uniform the unknown distribution D your domain is equipped with is </p>



<p>are both small.</p>



<p>Equipped with this machinery,  the paper tackles the task of designing distribution-free testers for boolean monotonicity with the underlying domain being \(\mathbb{R}^d\). The argument is pretty short and improves upon the sample complexity of the corresponding result in the paper by Black-Chakrabarti-Seshadhri. Do check it out, looks like some nice ammo to add to your toolkit.</p>



<p>Let’s stay on board for sublinear time algorithms for gap-edit distance. </p>



<p><strong>Gap Edit Distance via Non-Adaptive Queries: Simple and Optimal</strong> by Elazar Goldenberg, Tomasz Kociumaka, Robert Krauthgamer, Barna Saha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12706">arXiv</a>). The edit distance problem needs no introduction. This paper studies the problem of approximating edit distance in sublinear time. In particular, this is formalized by introducing the gapped version of the problem. This entails the following computational task: Fix \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and some \(c &gt; 0\). Given a pair \(x, y\) of strings over a finite alphabet, decide whether the edit distance between \(x,y\) is at most \(k\) or whether it is at least \(k^c\). This paper resolves the non-adaptive query complexity of edit distance and proves that the above gapped version can be decided in at most \(O\left(\frac{n}{k^{c – 1/2}}\right)\) queries. The paper also proves that this bound is almost optimal up to some polylog factors.</p>



<p/>



<p>Next up, we have <em>time-optimal</em> algorithms for maximum matching and vertex cover! Sweet, right?</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Time-Optimal Sublinear Algorithms for Matching and Vertex Cover</strong> by Soheil Behnezhad (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02942">arXiv</a>). This paper gives algorithms for the classic problem of estimating the size of vertex cover and maximum matching in graphs in sublinear time (in both adjacency matrix and adjacency list models). This is another nice read for the holiday season — after all the paper obtains time-optimal algorithms (up to polylog factors) in both of these models for a multiplicative-additive \((2, \varepsilon n)\) algorithms. Let me set up some historical context to appreciate the maximum matching result better.</p>



<p>In a classic work, Parnas and Ron gave sublinear time algorithms that obtain a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\) estimate to the size of a maximum matching in a graph using query access to the adjacency list in sublinear time. Their sublinear time algorithm is inspired by ideas with roots in distributed algorithms. In particular, their algorithm returns in time<br/>\(\Delta^{O(\log {\frac{\delta}{\varepsilon}})}\) (where \(\Delta = \Delta(G)\) denotes the degree bound) an estimate \(\text{EST}\) to the size of the max-matching where \(OPT \leq \text{EST} \leq 2 \cdot OPT + \varepsilon  n\). Unfortunately, algorithms in this Parnas-Ron Framework must necessarily suffer a quasi-polynomial running time because of lower bounds from distributed algorithms. Using a randomized greedy approach to estimating the size of a maximum matching, Yoshida, Yamamoto, and Ito gave the first algorithm which returned a \((2,  \varepsilon n)\)-estimate to maximum matching in time \(poly(\Delta/\varepsilon)\). This is where the story essentially froze — though there were results that improved the dependence on \(\Delta\) to \(O(\Delta^2)\). Unfortunately, this is not truly sublinear for large \(\Delta\). In another direction, Kapralov-Mitrovic-Norouzi Fard-Tardos gave an algorithm that estimates the maximum matching size in time \(O(\Delta)\) (which is truly sublinear) but it no longer guarantees a \((2,  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation and instead returns a \((O(1),  \varepsilon  n)\)-approximation. The current paper, as remarked above achieves the best of both worlds.</p>



<p/>



<!-- <p>Next up, a graph mining paper which explains why some heuristics work on real world graphs.</p> -->



<!-- <p> <strong>FPT Algorithms for Finding Near-Cliques in [latex]c[/latex]-Closed Graphs</strong> by Balaram Behera, Edin Husić, Shweta Jain, Tim Roughgarden, C. Seshadhri (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09768">arXiv</a>). Let us introduce the cast of characters this paper talks about. You call a graph [latex]c[/latex]-closed if any two non-adjacent vertices in your graph have at most [latex]c-1[/latex], common neighbors. The main theorem of the paper presents an FPT style algorithm which on input a [latex]c[/latex]-closed graph [latex]G[/latex] finds in time [latex]O(n^{2d+4} \cdot 4^c)[/latex] the entire list of all maximal induced subgraphs with small degeneracy. The heart of this paper is an alternative proof of a previous result by Fox et al which FPT style enumerates all the maximal cliques in [latex]c[/latex]-closed graphs. The current paper proves this via a backtracking approach that finds cliques and can be used for clique enumeration. The authors make the case that their proofs give mathematical justification for the empirical success of backtracking-based heuristics in mining real-life social networks.</p> -->



<p/>



<p/>



<p>Final stop, updates on the implicit graph conjecture.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>The Implicit Graph Conjecture is False</strong> by Hamed Hatami, Pooya Hatami (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13198">arXiv</a>). While not a property testing paper per se, it is always good to see an old conjecture resolved one way or the other. In this paper, the Hatami brothers (Pooya and Hamed) refute a three decade old conjecture — the one mentioned in the title. Here is a brief history. Sampath Kannan, Moni Naor and Steven Rudich defined the notion of implicit representation of graphs. Take a family of \(\mathcal{F}\) of graphs and consider a \(n\) vertex graph \(G \in \mathcal{F}\). You say this family admits an efficient implicit representation if there exists an assignment of \(O(\log n)\) length labels to all the vertices in \(V(G)\) such that the adjacencies between every pair of vertices is a function of the labels of the corresponding pair. Crucially, the labeling function may depend on the family, but not on individual graphs in the family. What is cool about families admitting such an efficient implicit representation, is that the number of \(n\)-vertex graphs in this family cannot be any bigger than \(2^{O(n \log n)}\) — that is such families have at most factorial growth rate. Implicit graph conjecture asserts that for every hereditary graph family, the converse also holds. Namely, if the hereditary family has at most factorial growth rate, then the family admits efficient implicit representations. The key, as shown in this paper (which spans all of six pages!) is to choose as your hereditary graph class, the closure of a random collection of graphs. The authors show that now your hand is forced and your representation will no longer be efficient. However, annoyingly, your hereditary graph class need not have a factorial growth rate as taking the closure of a random collection expands to contain all graphs and has growth rate \(2^{\Omega(n^2)}\). The cool thing is, you can avoid this issue by choosing a random collection of slightly sparse random graphs (with \(n^{2-\varepsilon}\) edges). Interestingly, this gives you enough ammo to finally control the growth rate which in turn allows the authors to slay this conjecture.</p>



<p>(<strong><em>EDIT</em></strong>: Omitted Stop, added retroactively). </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy</strong> by Tom Gur, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Sathyawageeswar Subramanian (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11139">arXiv</a>). This paper presents quantum algorithms for the problem of obtaining multiplicative estimates of the Shannon entropy of the familiar classical distributions and the more exotic von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum systems. In particular, the paper presents an \(\widetilde{O}(n^{\frac{1+\eta }{2\gamma^2 }})\)-query quantum algorithm that achieves a \(\gamma\)-multiplicative approximation algorithm for the Shannon Entropy of an input distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) supported on a universe of size \(n\) where \(H(\mathbf{p}) \geq \gamma/\eta\). As if this were not already cool enough, the paper also presents sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating Von Neumann Entropy as well. This is supplemented by a lower bound of \(\Omega(n^{\frac{1}{3 \gamma^2}})\) queries for achieving a \(\gamma\)-factor approximation for any of these two kinds of entropies. </p></div>

activities of agents in a multi-agent system (MAS). A norm specifies the
behaviour an agent should follow in order to achieve the objective of the MAS.
However, designing norms to achieve a particular system objective can be
difficult, particularly when there is no direct link between the language in
which the system objective is stated and the language in which the norms can be
expressed. In this paper, we consider the problem of synthesising a norm from
traces of agent behaviour, where each trace is labelled with whether the
behaviour satisfies the system objective. We show that the norm synthesis
problem is NP-complete.

    <title>Computing Voronoi Diagrams in the Polar-Coordinate Model of the Hyperbolic Plane</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Tobias Friedrich, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Katzmann:Maximilian.html">Maximilian Katzmann</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Schiller:Leon.html">Leon Schiller</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02553">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A Voronoi diagram is a basic geometric structure that partitions the space
into regions associated with a given set of sites, such that all points in a
region are closer to the corresponding site than to all other sites. While
being thoroughly studied in Euclidean space, they are also of interest in
hyperbolic space. In fact, there are several algorithms for computing
hyperbolic Voronoi diagrams that work with the various models used to describe
hyperbolic geometry. However, the polar-coordinate model has not been
considered before, despite its increased popularity in the network science
community. While Voronoi diagrams have the potential to advance this field, the
model is geometrically not as approachable as other models, which impedes the
development of geometric algorithms.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing Voronoi diagrams
natively in the polar-coordinate model of the hyperbolic plane. The approach is
based on Fortune's sweep line algorithm for Euclidean Voronoi diagrams. We
characterize the hyperbolic counterparts of the concepts it utilizes, introduce
adaptations necessary to account for the differences, and prove that the
resulting algorithm correctly computes the Voronoi diagram in time $O(n
\log(n))$.

some large domain N using the shortest-possible sequence of queries, where a
result of a query provides some information about the size of the intersection
of the query with the unknown subset K. Due to very large size of N the length
of the sequence of queries proportional to |N| is not acceptable. Thus, the
goal of QGT is to extract the knowledge about K using the number of queries
that only logarithmically depends on |N| and polynomially on |K|. The QGT
framework has already proven its applicability to extracting knowledge from
large streams of data, such as finding hot elements or histograms, and to
identifying infected records using a small number of tests. We also show other
applications to extracting elements from long data streams, maintaining
dynamically changing graphs and hypergraphs and private parallel Information
Retrieval. Almost all previous work focused on randomized algorithms, which in
case of large datasets or streams may have a significant deviation from the
expected precision. To mitigate this effect and, instead, to seek a solution
for any dataset/stream, in this work we propose an efficient non-adaptive
deterministic QGT algorithms for constructing queries and deconstructing hidden
set K from the results of the queries. The efficiency is three-fold. First, in
terms of almost-optimal number of queries and memory to produce them. Second,
all algorithms work in polynomial time. Third, they work for any hidden set K,
as well as multi-sets, and even if the results of the queries are capped at
$\sqrt{|K|}$.

3D meshes, are among the most important topological properties of these
objects. Given a non-trivial cycle in a homology class, we consider the problem
of computing a representative in that homology class which is optimal. We study
two measures of optimality, namely, the lexicographic order of cycles (the
lex-optimal cycle) and the bottleneck norm (a bottleneck-optimal cycle). We
give a simple algorithm for computing the lex-optimal cycle for a 1-homology
class in a surface. In contrast to this, our main result is that, in the case
of 3-manifolds of size $n^2$ in the Euclidean 3-space, the problem of finding a
bottleneck optimal cycle cannot be solved more efficiently than solving a
system of linear equations with a $n \times n$ sparse matrix. From this
reduction, we deduce several hardness results. Most notably, we show that for
3-manifolds given as a subset of the 3-space (of size $n^2$), persistent
homology computations are at least as hard as matrix multiplication while
ordinary homology computations can be done in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time. This is the
first such distinction between these two computations. Moreover, it follows
that the same disparity exists between the height persistent homology
computation and general sub-level set persistent homology computation for
simplicial complexes in the 3-space.

$s&gt;2$, every $2^s$-quasiplanar graph with $n$ vertices has at most
$n(\frac{C\log n}{s})^{2s-4}$ edges.
</p>
<p>A graph whose vertices are continuous curves in the plane, two being
connected by an edge if and only if they intersect, is called a \emph{string
graph}. We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that
every string graph with $n$ vertices, whose chromatic number is at least
$n^{\epsilon}$ contains a clique of size at least $n^{\delta}$. A clique of
this size or a coloring using fewer than $n^{\epsilon}$ colors can be found by
a polynomial time algorithm in terms of the size of the geometric
representation of the set of strings.
</p>
<p>For every $r\ge 3$, we construct families of $n$ segments in the plane
without $r$ pairwise crossing members, which have the property that in any
coloring of the segments with fewer than $c \log\log n $ colors, at least one
of the color classes contains $r-1$ pairwise crossing segments. Here $c=c(r)&gt;0$
is a suitable constant.
</p>
<p>In the process, we use, generalize, and strengthen previous results of Lee,
Tomon, Walczak, and others. All of our theorems are related to geometric
variants of the following classical graph-theoretic problem of Erd\H os,
Gallai, and Rogers. Given a $K_r$-free graph on $n$ vertices and an integer
$s&lt;r$, at least how many vertices can we find such that the subgraph induced by
them is $K_s$-free?

persistence diagrams where the birth-death points are connected by the
so-called 'vines'. We consider computing these vines over changing filtrations
for zigzag persistence. We observe that eight atomic operations are sufficient
for changing one zigzag filtration to another and provide an update algorithm
for each of them. As with the zigzag persistence algorithms for a static
filtration, these updates are implemented with the maintenance of
representatives. Since finding consistent representatives for zigzag
persistence is more involved, the updates for the zigzag case are more costly
than their counterparts in the non-zigzag case. As motivations, we identify
some potential use of our update algorithms including the case of dynamic point
cloud data, where a vineyard of zigzag persistence diagrams captures changing
homological features across distance and time.

tree of $G$ with maximum number of internal vertices. The Maximum Internal
Spanning Tree (MIST) problem is to find a maximum internal spanning tree of the
given graph. The MIST problem is a generalization of the Hamiltonian path
problem. Since the Hamiltonian path problem is NP-hard, even for bipartite and
chordal graphs, two important subclasses of graphs, the MIST problem also
remains NP-hard for these graph classes. In this paper, we propose linear-time
algorithms to compute a maximum internal spanning tree of cographs, block
graphs, cactus graphs, chain graphs and bipartite permutation graphs. The
optimal path cover problem, which asks to find a path cover of the given graph
with maximum number of edges, is also a well studied problem. In this paper, we
also study the relationship between the number of internal vertices in maximum
internal spanning tree and number of edges in optimal path cover for the
special graph classes mentioned above.

structure widely used in many applications such as similarity search, dimension
reduction and clustering. Due to its increasing popularity, several methods
under the same framework have been proposed in the past decade. This framework
contains two steps, i.e. building an initial KNNG (denoted as \texttt{INIT})
and then refining it by neighborhood propagation (denoted as \texttt{NBPG}).
However, there remain several questions to be answered. First, it lacks a
comprehensive experimental comparison among representative solutions in the
literature. Second, some recently proposed indexing structures, e.g., SW and
HNSW, have not been used or tested for building an initial KNNG. Third, the
relationship between the data property and the effectiveness of \texttt{NBPG}
is still not clear. To address these issues, we comprehensively compare the
representative approaches on real-world high-dimensional data sets to provide
practical and insightful suggestions for users. As the first attempt, we take
SW and HNSW as the alternatives of \texttt{INIT} in our experiments. Moreover,
we investigate the effectiveness of \texttt{NBPG} and find the strong
correlation between the huness phenomenon and the performance of \texttt{NBPG}.

    <title>Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Clause for Complexity Theorists, If you Only Believe</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(Guest Post by Hunter Monroe)
   

In this  guest post and <a href="https://speedupblogger.wordpress.com/2021/12/05/unifying-conjectures-on-complexity-and-noncomputability/">discussion paper</a>, I present a remarkable set of structurally similar conjectures which, if you only believe them, conjure up a dream world for theorists by asserting a new form of diagonalization based on naturally nonrelativizing facts invoking a deep linkage to underlying noncomputable languages. These conjectures, all stronger than the things to be proved, imply that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse because the arithmetic hierarchy does not collapse, and P≠NP≠coNP. The diagonalizations imply the existence of hard instances, with the result that many complexity classes have speedup, including the Π side of PH, and proof speedup for tautologies stems from proof speedup for arithmetic. These conjectures do two things: (1) let us explore a hypothetical world where many open problems about uniform complexity classes are resolved and consider steps beyond e.g. to circuit complexity, and (2) reduce numerous open questions to a single plausible claim about how Turing machines have limited information about noncomputable languages. This would potentially allow a slew of open questions to be resolved at once with a skeleton key.<p>The following <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.3765">conjecture</a> implying $\textbf{P!=NP}$ is remarkable: it hints at a deeper, unnoticed relationship between complexity and noncomputability; it is <a href="https://www2.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/scan10.pdf">equivalent</a> to speedup for all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages and in proof length for tautologies; tweaked versions would separate other complexity classes; and if true it is a nonrelativizing fact.</p><p/>



Conjecture: (*) For any deterministic TM $M$ accepting the $\textbf{coNP}$-complete language ``nondeterministic TM $N$ on input $x$ does not halt within $t$ steps'' ($\texttt{coBHP}$), there exists a $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ ($N'$ does not halt on $x'$, ever) with $M$'s running time $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>

If true, (*) is a nonrelativizing fact; there is no hard $\langle N, x\rangle$ for $M$ with an exponential time oracle. The noncomputable language $\texttt{coHP}$ potentially explains why (*) is true, by analogy with this trivial theorem:

<p/>


Theorem. For any $M$ accepting $\texttt{coBHP}$, there exists some non-halting $\langle N',x'\rangle\in\texttt{coHP}$ with $f(t)=T_M(N',x',1^t)$ not bounded by a constant.

<p/>


Otherwise, $M$ would accept $\texttt{coHP}$ and have too much information about a non-c.e. language; (*) is just a stronger version. In the extreme, any $M$ is completely ignorant about some $\langle N',x'\rangle$ and requires on the order of $2^t$ steps to rule out every potentially halting branch.  Tweaking (*) yields conjectures implying that $\textbf{PH}$ does not collapse:

<p/>


Conjectures: For any $M^{\Pi^p_i}$ that accepts $\Pi^p_{i+1}=\{\langle N^{\Pi^p_i},x,1^t\rangle|$ $N^{\Pi^p_i}$ does not halt on input $x$ in $t$ steps$\}$, there is a non-halting $\langle N'^{\Pi^p_i},x'\rangle\in \Pi_i$ with $M^{\Pi^p_i}$'s running time not bounded by any polynomial.

<p/>


By invoking every level $\Pi_i$ of the arithmetic hierarchy ($\textbf{AH}$), these conjectures state that the noncollapse $\textbf{PH}$ is due to the noncollapse of $\textbf{AH}$. The conjecture (*) can be calibrated depending on the desired separation to equip $M$ with an oracle or nondeterminism or constrain its resources, to choose a resource-bounded complete problem and underlying non-c.e. language, and to fine tune how hard a hard instance needs to be.

<p/>


Proof speedup for tautologies (equivalent to (*)) may stem from the proof speedup for arithmetic that occurs when adding undecidable statements as new axioms, allowing new theorems to be proved and shortening the proof of existing theorems. This literature translates any arithmetic theorem free of existential quantifiers into a tautology by replacing $k$-bit numbers with $k$ Boolean variables. The analogy with (*) suggests this stronger conjecture may in fact also be equivalent:

<p/>


Conjecture: The following two statements are equivalent: (1) there is no optimal propositional proof system; and (2) Any propositional proof system $P$ is outperformed by a sufficiently powerful conservative extension $T$ of the Peano arithmetic, and $T$ can be improved further by adding any undecidable statement in $T$ as a new axiom.

<p/>


So (*) is a Swiss army knife for generating conjectures that give us a vision of a world in which answering essentially one question would serve as a skeleton key that unlocks many open problems.</div>

    <title>TR21-174 |  Sublinear quantum algorithms for estimating von Neumann entropy | 

	Sathyawageeswar Subramanian, 

	Tom Gur, 

	Min-Hsiu Hsieh</title>
    <summary>Entropy is a fundamental property of both classical and quantum systems, spanning myriad theoretical and practical applications in physics and computer science. We study the problem of obtaining estimates to within a multiplicative factor $\gamma&gt;1$ of the Shannon entropy of probability distributions and the von Neumann entropy of mixed quantum states. Our main results are:

       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the Shannon entropy $H(\mathbf{p})$ of a classical probability distribution $\mathbf{p} = (p_1,\ldots,p_n)$;
       $\quad\bullet$ an $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( n^{\frac12+\frac{1+\eta}{2\gamma^2}}\right)$-query quantum algorithm that outputs a $\gamma$-multiplicative approximation of the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ of a density matrix $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$.

    In both cases, the input is assumed to have entropy bounded away from zero by a quantity determined by the parameter $\eta&gt;0$, since, as we prove, no polynomial query algorithm can multiplicatively approximate the entropy of distributions with arbitrarily low entropy. In addition, we provide $\Omega\left(n^{\frac{1}{3\gamma^2}}\right)$ lower bounds on the query complexity of $\gamma$-multiplicative estimation of Shannon and von Neumann entropies.

    We work with the quantum purified query access model, which can handle both classical probability distributions and mixed quantum states, and is the most general input model considered in the literature.</summary>

    <title>TR21-173 |  On the Structure of Learnability beyond P/poly | 

	Ninad Rajgopal, 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>Motivated by the goal of showing stronger structural results about the complexity of learning, we study the learnability of strong concept classes beyond P/poly, such as PSPACE/poly and EXP/poly. We show the following:


1. (Unconditional Lower Bounds for Learning)  Building on [KKO13], we prove unconditionally that BPE/poly cannot be weakly learned in polynomial time over the uniform distribution, even with membership and equivalence queries.

2. (Robustness of Learning) For the concept classes EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly, we show unconditionally that worst-case and average-case learning are equivalent, that PAC-learnability and learnability over the uniform distribution are equivalent, and that membership queries do not help in either case.

3. (Reducing Succinct Search to Decision for Learning) For the decision problems $R_{Kt}$ and $R_{KS}$ capturing the complexity of learning EXP/poly and PSPACE/poly respectively, we show a succinct search to decision reduction: for each of these problems, the problem is in BPP iff there is a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm computing circuits encoding proofs for positive instances of the problem. This is shown via a more general result giving succinct search to decision results for PSPACE, EXP and NEXP, which might be of independent interest. 

4. (Implausibility of Oblivious Strongly Black-Box Reductions showing NP-hardness of learning NP/poly) We define a natural notion of hardness of learning with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. We show that learning PSPACE/poly is PSPACE-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions. On the other hand, if learning NP/poly is NP-hard with respect to oblivious strongly black-box reductions, the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.</summary>

    <title>TR21-172 |  Ideals, Determinants, and Straightening: Proving and Using Lower Bounds for Polynomial Ideals | 

	Robert Andrews, 

	Michael Forbes</title>
    <summary>We show that any nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by the $r \times r$ minors of an $n \times n$ matrix $X$ can be used to efficiently approximate the determinant. Specifically, for any nonzero polynomial $f$ in this ideal, we construct a small depth-three $f$-oracle circuit that approximates the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant in the sense of border complexity. For many classes of algebraic circuits, this implies that every nonzero polynomial in the ideal generated by $r \times r$ minors is at least as hard to approximately compute as the $\Theta(r^{1/3}) \times \Theta(r^{1/3})$ determinant. We also prove an analogous result for the Pfaffian of a $2n \times 2n$ skew-symmetric matrix and the ideal generated by Pfaffians of $2r \times 2r$ principal submatrices.

This answers a recent question of Grochow about complexity in polynomial ideals in the setting of border complexity. Leveraging connections between the complexity of polynomial ideals and other questions in algebraic complexity, our results provide a generic recipe that allows lower bounds for the determinant to be applied to other problems in algebraic complexity. We give several such applications, two of which are highlighted below.
	
$\bullet$ We prove new lower bounds for the Ideal Proof System of Grochow and Pitassi. Specifically, we give super-polynomial lower bounds for refutations computed by low-depth circuits. This extends the recent breakthrough low-depth circuit lower bounds of Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas to the setting of proof complexity. Moreover, we show that for many natural circuit classes, the approximative proof complexity of our hard instance is governed by the approximative circuit complexity of the determinant.

$\bullet$ We construct new hitting set generators for the closure of low-depth circuits. For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we construct generators with seed length $O(n^\varepsilon)$ that hit $n$-variate low-depth circuits. Our generators attain a near-optimal tradeoff between their seed length and degree, and are computable by low-depth circuits of near-linear size (with respect to the size of their output). This matches the seed length of the generators recently obtained by Limaye, Srinivasan, and Tavenas, but improves on the degree and circuit complexity of the generator.</summary>

    <title>TheoretiCS: A new open-access journal in Theoretical Computer Science</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjf7-wAXJmH9SiOAhxTj4m6svlchJtMYZVkNnWSoaPMvaVSAq3Xn8x902jjH_K7CEvubT8Rj09SwcNiKvpy0iVgtLuYyWk-fFvk7O4yoTyqumEJqRMVpJGM5ONAQMibKk6SKFPXaEtWQA09kSzd0RW8Yke8qd-RZiR-b5FI4JwvkPEU2ENrLw=s320" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0px; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjf7-wAXJmH9SiOAhxTj4m6svlchJtMYZVkNnWSoaPMvaVSAq3Xn8x902jjH_K7CEvubT8Rj09SwcNiKvpy0iVgtLuYyWk-fFvk7O4yoTyqumEJqRMVpJGM5ONAQMibKk6SKFPXaEtWQA09kSzd0RW8Yke8qd-RZiR-b5FI4JwvkPEU2ENrLw=s320" width="320"/></a></div><p> I am delighted to share with all the readers of this blog the news of the launch of <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org" target="_blank">TheoretiCS</a>, a new, top-quality, open-access journal dedicated to the whole of Theoretical Computer Science. The journey leading to the establishment of this new journal has been long and the fact that this path eventually reached its destination is due to the sterling efforts and foresight of a number of people within our community. The seeds of TheoretiCS were sown within the Council of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science during my two terms as president of that association. At that time, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> and <a href="https://www.fi.muni.cz/usr/kucera/">Antonin Kucera</a> worked hard to try and set up an open-access journal of the association. That journal never saw the light of day, but the process that eventually led to TheoretiCS was afoot. After some time, <a href="https://ls1-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/en/kontakt-thomas-schwentick" target="_blank">Thomas Schwentick</a> took the baton in the relay race and took decisive steps in turning the establishment of this new journal into a true community effort. It is fair to say that the launch of this journal has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation amongst <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/advisory-board" target="_blank">representatives of leading conferences from across the entire Theoretical Computer Science community</a>. I am immensely grateful to everyone who participated in that work for the effort they put into making TheoretiCS a reality and apologise for not mentioning all the colleagues who contributed explicitly in this post.   You can find more information on TheoretiCS in the text below, which I received from Jos Baeten, founding member-at-large of the Advisory Board of the Theoretics Foundation. </p><p>So, what can you do to support this new journal? There are at least two things that each of us can do and that I believe are important. </p><ol style="text-align: left;"><li>Help TheoretiCS reach its quality objectives by submitting your best work to it and by encouraging your colleagues to do so too. TheoretiCS aims at publishing articles of a very high quality, and at becoming a reference journal on par with the leading journals in the area. To be accepted, a paper must make a significant contribution of lasting value to a relevant area of TCS, and its presentation must be of high quality. This is elaborated upon in the guiding principles spelled out below. I let you reach your own conclusions about the quality and the breadth of the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/editorial-board" target="_blank">editorial board of TheoretiCS</a>, which is stellar IMHO. <br/></li><li>Spread the news of the launch of TheoretiCS within your networks. Despite its many years of existence and the role it plays within our community, I still meet colleagues (even in Theoretical Computer Science) who do not know that <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics" target="_blank">LIPIcs</a> exists and who claim that publishing conference proceedings with commercial publishers is a sign of scientific quality. </li></ol><p>If you happen to be in a position to do so, you can support the <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/theoretics-foundation" target="_blank">TheoretiCS foundation</a>, which is a German not-for-profit organization, by making a donation. </p><p/><p>I look forward to seeing the developments of TheoretiCS. Even though predicting the future is difficult, I have no doubt that the journal will become a coveted outlet, with the help of the community it aims to serve. Welcome to TheoretiCS and good luck!</p><p/><p><br/>=== Additional information about the journal ===<br/><br/>---  Guiding principles and objectives  ---<br/><br/>- We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more 'virtuous' open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications.<br/><br/>- The scope of TheoretiCS is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen's Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science).<br/><br/>- Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field.<br/><br/>- TheoretiCS adheres to the principles of 'virtuous' open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers remains with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.<br/><br/><br/>---  Editorial Board  ---<br/><br/>The inaugural Editors-in-Chief are Javier Esparza (TU München) and Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv U.). The entire Editorial Board can be seen at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a> (see below as well).<br/><br/><br/>---  Organization and a bit of history  ---<br/><br/>The project built on groundwork laid in the Council of the EATCS, and started in 2019 and underwent a long gestation. From the start, we wanted to have a thorough discussion with a wide representation of the community, on how to best implement the guiding principles sketched above. It was deemed essential to make sure that all fields of theoretical computer science would feel at home in this journal, and that it would be recognized as a valid venue for publication all over the world.<br/><br/>This resulted in the creation of an Advisory Board, composed of representatives of most of the main conferences in the field (currently APPROX, CCC, COLT, CONCUR, CSL, FOCS, FoSSaCS, FSCD, FSTTCS, ICALP, ICDT, ITCS, LICS, MFCS, PODC, SoCG, SODA, STACS, STOC, TCC) and of so-called members-at-large. The composition of this Advisory Board, which may still evolve, can be consulted at <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">https://theoretics-journal.org</a>.<br/><br/><br/>---  Logistics and answers to some natural questions  ---<br/><br/>- The journal is published by the TheoretiCS Foundation, a non-profit foundation established under German law. <br/><br/>- TheoretiCS is based on the platform episciences.org, in the spirit of a so-called overlay journal.<br/><br/>- The Advisory Board, together with the Editors-in-Chief and the Managing Editors, devolved much of their efforts to designing and implementing an efficient 2-phase review system: efficient in terms of the added-value it brings to the published papers and their authors, and of the time it takes. Yet, as this review system relies in an essential fashion on the work and expertise of colleagues (like in all classical reputable journals), we cannot guarantee a fixed duration for the evaluation of the papers submitted to TheoretiCS.<br/><br/>- Being charge-free for authors and readers does not mean that there is no cost to publishing a journal. These costs are supported for the foreseeable future by academic institutions (at the moment, CNRS and Inria, in France; others may join).<br/><br/>- The journal will have an ISSN, and each paper will have a DOI. There will be no print edition.<br/><br/><br/>---  Editorial Board  ---<br/><br/>Editors-in-Chief<br/><br/>    Javier Esparza (Technische Universität München, Munich)<br/>    Uri Zwick (Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv)<br/><br/>Managing  Editors<br/><br/>    Antoine Amarilli (Institut polytechnique de Paris, Télécom Paris)<br/>    Nathanaël Fijalkow (CNRS, Bordeaux, and The Alan Turing Institute of Data Science, London)<br/><br/>Editors<br/><br/>    Martin Abadi, Google, USA<br/>    Andris Ambainis, U. of Latvia<br/>    Albert Atserias, UPC, Barcelona<br/>    Haris Aziz, UNSW, Sydney<br/>    David Basin, ETH Zürich<br/>    Patricia Bouyer, CNRS, Paris-Saclay<br/>    Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Università di Milano<br/>    Anuj Dawar, Cambridge University<br/>    Luc Devroye,  McGill University, Montreal<br/>    Jacob Fox, Stanford University<br/>    Mohsen Ghaffari, ETH Zürich<br/>    Georg Gottlob, Oxford University<br/>    Anupam Gupta, Carnegie-Mellon University<br/>    Venkatesan Guruswami, Carnegie-Mellon University<br/>    Johan Håstad, KTH, Stockholm<br/>    Ravi Kannan, Microsoft Research India, Bengaluru<br/>    Anna Karlin, University of Washington, Seattle<br/>    Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo<br/>    Valerie King, University of Victoria<br/>    Robert Kleinberg, Cornell University<br/>    Naoki Kobayashi, University of Tokyo<br/>    Elias Koutsoupias, Oxford University<br/>    Xavier Leroy, Collège de France, Paris<br/>    Katrina Ligett, Hebrew University, Jerusalem<br/>    Rupak Majumdar, MPI-SWS, Kaiserslautern<br/>    Joseph Mitchell, State University of New York at Stony Brook<br/>    Mehryar Mohri, Google and New York University<br/>    David Mount, University of Maryland<br/>    Anca Muscholl, Université de Bordeaux<br/>    Danupon Nanongkai, University of Copenhagen<br/>    Moni Naor, Weizmann Institute, Rehovot<br/>    Catuscia Palamidessi, Inria, Palaiseau<br/>    Michał Pilipczuk, University of Warsaw<br/>    Jean-Francois Raskin, Université Libre de Bruxelles<br/>    Peter Sanders, KIT, Karlsruhe<br/>    Davide Sangiorgi, Università di Bologna<br/>    Nitin Saxena, IIT Kanpur<br/>    Alistair Sinclair, UC Berkeley<br/>    Ola Svensson, EPF Lausanne<br/>    Gregory Valiant, Stanford University<br/>    Stephanie Weirich, University of Pennsylvania<br/>    Virginia V.

It is cross posted on <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">Scott Aaronson’s blog</a>. See also <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1466799615349608452?s=20">a thread on Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>See also the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a>, and <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">fuller analysis</a> of the CMF proposed revisions.</p>



<p>Mathematical education at the K-12 level is critical for preparation for STEM careers. An ongoing challenge to the US K-12 system is to improve the preparation of students for advanced mathematics courses and expand access and enrollment in these courses. As stated by a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/stem/algebra/index.html#WHYALGEBRAI">Department of Education report</a> <strong><em>“taking Algebra I before high school … can set students up for a strong foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options.”</em></strong> The report states that while 80% of all students have access to Algebra I in middle school, only 24% enroll. This is also why the goal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ Algebra Project</a> is to ensure that <strong>“every child must master algebra, preferably by eighth grade, for algebra is the gateway to the college-prep curriculum, which in turn is the path to higher education.” </strong></p>



<p>The most significant potential for growth is among African American or Latino students, among whom only 12% enroll in Algebra before high school. This untapped potential has longer-term implications for both society and individuals. For example, although African Americans and Latinos comprise 13% and 18% (respectively) of the overall US population, they only account for 4% and 11% of <a href="https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Engineering-by-Numbers-Engineering-Statistics-UPDATED-15-July-2019.pdf">engineering degrees</a>. There is also a gap in access by income: Calculus is <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/unequal-access-calculus-could-hinder-low-income-and-black-students">offered</a> in 92% of schools serving the top income quartile but only in 77% of schools serving the bottom quartile (as measured by the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). Thus minority and low income students have less access to STEM jobs, which yield <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/stem-employment.htm">more than double the median salary</a> of non-STEM jobs, and are projected to grow at a 50% higher rate over the next decade.</p>



<p>Given these disparities, we applaud efforts such as the <a href="https://algebra.org/wp/">Algebra Project</a>, the <a href="http://thecalculusproject.org/">Calculus Project</a>, and <a href="https://www.beammath.org">Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics</a> that increase access to advanced mathematical education to underserved students (in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ words</a> <strong><em>“raise the floor”</em></strong>).

<p>See <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">this document for a detailed analysis and critique of the CMF</a>, but the bottom line is that rather than trying to elevate under-served students, <strong>such “reforms” reduce access and options for all students</strong>.

Neither is the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), which set in 2015 a goal to double the number of African American students taking calculus by 2025.

<p>We agree that calculus is not the “be-all and end-all” of high-school mathematics education. In particular, we encourage introducing options such as logic, probability, discrete mathematics, and algorithms design in the K-12 curriculum, as they can be valuable foundations for STEM education in college. However, when taught beyond a superficial level (which unfortunately is <em>not</em> the case in the CMF “data science” <a href="https://hsdatascience.youcubed.org/">proposals</a>), these topics are not any easier  than calculus. They require the same foundations of logic, algebra, and functions, and fluency with numbers and calculations.

<p>Today, I’m turning over <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> to an extremely important guest post by theoretical computer scientists <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a> of Harvard and <a href="http://www.cohenwang.com/edith/">Edith Cohen</a> of Google (<a href="https://windowsontheory.org/?p=8232">cross-posted</a> on the <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/">windows on theory</a> blog).  In addition to the post below, please read—and if relevant, consider signing—our <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home"><strong>open letter</strong></a> about math education in the US, which now has over <s>150</s> <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color"><s>now 535</s> 746</span></strong> signatories, including Fields Medalists, Turing Award winners, and Nobel laureates.  Finally, check out our <a href="https://bit.ly/cmfanalysis">fuller analysis</a> of what the California Mathematics Framework is poised to do and why it’s such an urgent crisis for math education.

<p>Mathematical education at the K-12 level is critical for preparation for STEM careers. An ongoing challenge to the US K-12 system is to improve the preparation of students for advanced mathematics courses and expand access and enrollment in these courses. As stated by a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/datastory/stem/algebra/index.html#WHYALGEBRAI">Department of Education report</a> <strong><em>“taking Algebra I before high school … can set students up for a strong foundation of STEM education and open the door for various college and career options.”</em></strong> The report states that while 80% of all students have access to Algebra I in middle school, only 24% enroll. This is also why the goal of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Bob Moses’ Algebra Project</a> is to ensure that <strong>“every child must master algebra, preferably by eighth grade, for algebra is the gateway to the college-prep curriculum, which in turn is the path to higher education.”</strong></p>



<p>The most significant potential for growth is among African American or Latino students, among whom only 12% enroll in Algebra before high school. This untapped potential has longer-term implications for both society and individuals. For example, although African Americans and Latinos comprise 13% and 18% (respectively) of the overall US population, they only account for 4% and 11% of <a href="https://ira.asee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2018-Engineering-by-Numbers-Engineering-Statistics-UPDATED-15-July-2019.pdf">engineering degrees</a>. There is also a gap in access by income: Calculus is <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/unequal-access-calculus-could-hinder-low-income-and-black-students">offered</a> in 92% of schools serving the top income quartile but only in 77% of schools serving the bottom quartile (as measured by the share of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch). Thus minority and low income students have less access to STEM jobs, which yield <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/stem-employment.htm">more than double the median salary</a> of non-STEM jobs, and are projected to grow at a 50% higher rate over the next decade.</p>

    <title>Editing a Classifier</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a class="bbutton" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01008" style="float: left; width: 45%;">

<br/></p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01008">recent work</a>, we develop a framework for modifying the
behavior of a classifier by directly rewriting its internal prediction rules.
This allows a model designer to adapt the model to new setting or remove
specific spurious correlations with virtually no additional data collection or
further model training. </i></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Modern machine learning classifiers work because they are able to extract
predictive correlations from large, relatively uncurated datasets. However, as
has been pointed out
<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/torralba/research/bias/">re</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04975">pea</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06707">te</a>-<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">dly</a>,
many of these correlations are spurious or context-specific. That is, while
they are predictive on the training dataset, they need not necessarily be
predictive in the real-world settings where we wish to deploy our models. For
instance, a useful example to keep in mind throughout this post is that of
“cars on snow”: if a model relies on the presence of “road” to recognize a car
(because most cars in the training set are on the road) it might have trouble
recognizing cars when they drive through snow.</p>

<p>So, what can we do about that?</p>

<h2 id="editing-classifiers-setting-up-the-problem">Editing classifiers: Setting up the problem</h2>
<p>A natural idea is to modify the model after training, but how exactly would we
do that? The canonical method for modifying such a “buggy” ML model once it
has been trained is to collect additional data that captures the classifier’s
intended behavior and then use that data to fine-tune the model. However,
collecting such data might be tricky and/or expensive. More importantly, this
is an <em>indirect</em> process, i.e., we are specifying model behavior only through
training examples—which is what gave rise to undesired correlations in the
first place.</p>

<p>In order to develop a more reliable process, we want to allow a model designer
to <em>directly</em> edit model’s “inner mechanics”. In other words, we want the
designer to be able to specify <em>how</em> a model should predict on broad families
of inputs (and not just what it should predict on a specific, fixed set of
training inputs).</p>

<p>Conceptually, we can think of the model as operating based on some <em>prediction
rules</em>. For instance, “if grass is present, then this is likely an image of a
cow” or “if a wheel is present, this is likely an image of a car”. From that
perspective, our goal is to enable the designer to interact with these rules
and rewrite how these <em>concepts</em> (e.g., “car”, “wheel”) are associated with
each other. Crucially, we need for such rewrites to <em>generalize</em>, i.e., if one
modifies how the concept “wheel” is perceived by the model, then this
modification should apply to all instances containing a wheel.</p>

<h2 id="a-concrete-editing-methodology">A concrete editing methodology</h2>
<p>So, how do we turn this conceptual framework into an actual tool? Our
method—which we will describe now—builds on the recent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15646">Bau et al.
2020</a> that developed a method for editing
generative models.</p>

<p><strong>Concepts as vectors.</strong> Our point of start is figuring out  a way to capture
high-level concepts via concrete objects that  we can manipulate. The object of
choice is latent vectors. Indeed, as it turns out, it is possible to find directions in
the latent representation of the model that capture different visual concepts (e.g.,
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11279">TCAV</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796">Network
Dissection</a>). Moreover, as Bau et al. found,
it is possible to find such directions based only on a few images. This can be
done by simply selecting the pixels corresponding to the desired concept and
then aggregating the latent representations of these pixels via PCA.</p>

<p><strong>Layers as associative memory.</strong> Next, we want to develop a way to modify how
the classifier processes these high-level concepts (captured by vectors). For
this, we view each layer of the network as a linear associative memory: i.e., a
mapping of each latent vector in its input (the key) to another latent vector in its
output—the value. From that perspective, if we have a vector $k$ capturing some
high-level concept in the latent representation space <em>before</em> some layer $L$,
and a vector $v$ capturing another concept <em>after</em> $L$, then we can modify the
weights $W$ of that layer to map one concept to another, i.e., have that</p>

\[v \simeq Wk.\]

<p>Importantly, to ensure that this update does not affect how other concepts are
being processed, we restrict it to only a rank-one change in the weights W. You
can find a more detailed description in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15646">original
paper</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting classifiers.</strong> With these primitives in place, we can focus our
attention on editing classifiers. How would we modify a model to recognize cars
on snow as it would if they were on the road? At a high-level, we need to
ensure that the model treats the concept of “snow” the same way it treats the
concept of “road”. To this end, we start from a picture of a car (on a road),
manually annotate the part that depicts “road”, and then replace this part by
copy-pasting a snow texture on it.</p>

<p>Now, fixing any layer $L$, we use the selected pixels to compute a “snow” vector
$k$ <em>before</em> that layer and a “road” vector $v$ <em>after</em> that layer. Then, in order
to perform our edit we simply update the weights of that layer so that it
(approximately) maps the vector $k$ to the vector $v$. And that’s it! We can leave
the rest of the model as-is, since the snowy part of the image will be
processed as if it depicted a road.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/pipeline.png" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong> Editing methodology.</strong> We modify a
layer of the classifier so that the concept "snow" before the layer gets mapped
to "road" after the layer using a single synthetic example.</div>

<h2 id="does-editing-work">Does editing work?</h2>

<p>Let’s now try to apply this methodology to a couple of real world test cases.
In both cases, we will perform these updates based on a <em>single</em> exemplar that
we manually modified.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: Vehicles on snow.</strong> We start with our running example of
vehicles-on-snow. For that, we form a test set through searching
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for images of “&lt;vehicle&gt; on snow” for a
number of different vehicles corresponding to ImageNet classes. We observe that
the performance of our ImageNet model on these new images is not great. Can we now
improve the model on this test set via a targeted edit?</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/snow_edit.png" style="width: 90%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Adapting the model to snowy environments.</strong>
By mapping the concept "snow" to "road" we aim to improve the model's
ability to recognize vehicles driving through snow.</div>

<p>To check that, we form an exemplar by taking a picture of a “police van” (a
class that is not in our test set) on a road and replacing the road with a snow
texture. It turns out that by then  editing the model to map “snow” to “road”
using our method we can indeed improve the performance on our snowy test set!
Also, note that the vehicle in our exemplar belongs to a class that is not part
of the test set, so we can see that our edit generalized to other instances of
the concepts used.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/snow_results.png" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Editing performance on vehicles-on-snow edits.</strong> 
Editing consistently improves model accuracy across classes. In contrast,
fine-tuning using the same data cannot correct any of the predictions.</div>

<p>It is worth contrasting this with the performance of fine-tuning, i.e., when we
simply fine-tune the whole model on this exemplar. There seems to be no
performance improvement in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Typographic-attacks.</strong> We then take a look at the recent
typographic attacks of <a href="https://distill.pub/2021/multimodal-neurons/">[Goh et al.,
2021]</a>: putting a handwritten “ipod” label on
different household objects causes a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020">CLIP</a>
classifier to classify them as iPods! Here is our reproduction:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/ipod.png" style="width: 80%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Typographic attacks.</strong> 
Placing a handwritten note with the text "ipod" on various household objects
causes a CLIP-trained model to incorrectly predict "ipod".</div>

<p>Now, we will try to edit this classifier to make it ignore this misleading text
and thus predict the underlying object correctly. To do so, we start from an
unrelated image of a can opener and synthetically create two version of that
image: one where we paste an “ipod” label and one where we paste a blank label.
We then edit the model to map “ipod” to “blank” and we find that this corrects
the model predictions on all images, making the model impervious to this
typographic-attack!</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/ipod_edit.png" style="width: 90%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Mitigating typographic attacks via editing.</strong> 
Mapping the text ipod to "blank" allows us to correct all model mistakes caused
by the misleading text, recovering the underlying object prediction.</div>

<p>In contrast, fine-tuning is not a reliable solution. While it can fix some
mistakes (potentially by adjusting class biases), it often causes the model to
incorrectly associate other objects with the fine-tuning label and/or decreases
model performance on actual ipod images.</p>

<h2 id="large-scale-synthetic-evaluation">Large-scale synthetic evaluation</h2>
<p>While the two examples that we looked at so far might be compelling, we want to
stress test our method on a wider variety of settings. Unfortunately, manually
identifying interesting scenarios and collecting the corresponding datasets is
a daunting task. We thus focus on creating <em>synthetic</em> editing test cases.</p>

<p>Specifically, we want to setup scenarios in which we transform a specific
concept (e.g., “wheel”) in a consistent manner across classes. This way, if the
editing process is successful, performing the edit using a few of these images
should significantly improve the performance of the model on other transformed
images.</p>

<p>To setup such scenarios in a scalable manner, we leverage a pipeline based on
pre-trained instance segmentation models and style transfer (we manually
collect a set of textures to use as styles).</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/synthetic.png" style="width: 90%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Creating synthetic test cases.</strong> 
By leveraging pre-trained instance segmentation models and style transfer, we
can transform concepts in large existing datasets. This allows us to create
editing test cases in a scalable way.</div>

<p>With this pipeline in place, we evaluate editing across a wide range of
examples and measure how many of the errors caused by these transformations get
corrected. As a baseline, we compare ourselves to fine-tuning of either the
whole network, or of all the layers after the one that we perform editing on.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/results.png" style="width: 95%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Editing performance.</strong> Editing
consistently corrects the mistakes caused by the transformations we apply. In
fact, this is true even for classes that are different from the one used to
perform the edit. In contrast, fine-tuning does not generalize in the same way
and only corrects mistakes on images of the same class.</div>

<p>Looking at these results, we can observe that when measuring the impact of
editing and fine-tuning on images of the same class used during editing, both
methods perform reasonably well. However, when we focus on images of <em>other</em>
classes—which would reflect actual generalization—editing continues to
correct errors while fine-tuning often causes more errors than it fixes!</p>

<h2 id="beyond-editing-synthetic-test-cases-as-counterfactuals">Beyond editing: Synthetic test cases as counterfactuals</h2>
<p>While we developed the above pipeline with the goal of  benchmarking editing
methods in mind, it turns out to be useful more broadly. In fact, it
provides us with a scalable way to evaluate models on <em>counterfactuals</em>, i.e.,
to test how the model’s  prediction changes when a given concept of interest is
transformed. Such counterfactuals-based analysis can be used to get a
better understanding of which concepts are important for the model to recognize
each class as well as to reveal model sensitivities across classes.</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/editing/analysis.png" style="width: 95%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Counterfactual-based model analysis. </strong> 
Using the synthetic transformations we described we can analyze how model
predictions are sensitive to the presence of various objects.</div>

<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving forward</h2>
<p>In this post, we described a framework for directly editing classification
models. We saw how such editing can be a powerful and versatile primitive for
correcting model behavior with minimal data gathering and human labor.
However, we are still only starting to understand what is possible
through this framework. What other model edits would be useful to have?
How can we “localize” our edits so that they only apply to a specific context?
How do we edit multiple prediction rules at once?</p></div>

    <title>TR21-171 |  Algorithms and Lower Bounds for Comparator Circuits from Shrinkage | 

	Bruno Pasqualotto Cavalar, 

	Zhenjian Lu</title>
    <summary>Comparator circuits are a natural circuit model for studying bounded fan-out computation whose power sits between nondeterministic branching programs and general circuits. Despite having been studied for nearly three decades, the first superlinear lower bound against comparator circuits was proved only recently by Gál and Robere (ITCS 2020), who established a $\Omega((n/\log n)^{1.5})$ lower bound on the size of comparator circuits computing an explicit function of $n$ bits. 

In this paper, we initiate the study of average-case complexity and circuit analysis algorithms for comparator circuits. Departing from previous approaches, we exploit the technique of shrinkage under random restrictions to obtain a variety of new results for this model. Among our results, we show 

- Average-case Lower Bounds. For every $k = k(n)$ with $k \geq \log n$, there exists a polynomial-time computable function $f_k$ on $n$ bits such that, for every comparator circuit $C$ with at most $n^{1.5}/O(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n})$ gates, we have 
 
\[ \text{Pr}_{x\in\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^n}\left[C(x)=f_k(x)\right]\leq \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{\Omega(k)}}. \]

This average-case lower bound matches the worst-case lower bound of Gál and Robere by letting $k=O(\log n)$. 

- #SAT Algorithms. There is an algorithm that counts the number of satisfying assignments of a given comparator circuit with at most $n^{1.5}/O\!\left(k\cdot \sqrt{\log n}\right)$ gates, in time $2^{n-k}\cdot\text{poly}(n)$, for any $k\leq n/4$. The running time is non-trivial when $k=\omega(\log n)$. 

- Pseudorandom Generators and MCSP Lower Bounds. There is a pseudorandom generator of seed length $s^{2/3+o(1)}$ that fools comparator circuits with $s$ gates. Also, using this PRG, we obtain an $n^{1.5-o(1)}$ lower bound for MCSP against comparator circuits.</summary>

<p>
Today we are glad to convey the announcement he forwarded of the creation of a new open-access journal dedicated to Theoretical Computer Science. </p>
<p>
The <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">new journal</a> is called <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> and lists the following <em>distinguished endorsers</em> who are top leaders in all of theory: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Noga Alon <p/>
</li><li>
Shafi Goldwasser <p/>
</li><li>
Donald Knuth <p/>
</li><li>
Robert Tarjan <p/>
</li><li>
Leslie Valiant <p/>
</li><li>
Moshe Vardi <p/>
</li><li>
Andrew Yao
</li></ul>
<p>
They have just thrown their <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">page</a> open for business today, December 1. </p>
<p>
There used to be an independent self-publishing fair held every year in London called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_and_Be_Damned">Publish and Be Damned</a>.” The association of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> with the computing section of <a href="https://arxiv.org/corr">ArXiv</a> might smack of self-publishing but this journal is in every further respect the opposite:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It uses the <em>overlay journal</em> platform <a href="https://episciences.org/">Episciences</a>, whose mission is to “add value to these archives by attaching a scientific caution to the validated papers.” <p/>
</li><li>
It has a large and capable board of editors who will work the way the other major established print and online journals do.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Editors </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Paul wrote us a direct e-mail and emphasized two points at the start (with our light editing):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> </em></p><em>
<ol>
<li>
The aim of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> to publish articles of a very high quality, to become a reference journal on par with the leading journals in all of Theoretical Computer Science, and <p/>
</li><li>
The [internationally] inclusive view of Theoretical Computer Science that this journal represents, which is evident in the choice of two excellent co-editors-in-chief and an outstanding inaugural editorial board.
</li></ol>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
He adds that it was thanks to the leadership of Thomas Schwentick and others, including helping to gain <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/theoretics-foundation">sponsorship</a>, and the hard work of the co-editors-in-chief, managing editors, and the rest of the Advisory Board, that this new journal launch was made possible.</p>

<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> – We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more ‘virtuous’ open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
There is a long, historical, good point here. Thirty years ago, David S. Johnson moved personal mountains to compile the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/117006">STOC/FOCS Bibliography</a>, whose essential subtitle <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.1145/117006">(preliminary version)</a> spoke a truth expanded in the blurb by Michael Loui:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Many computer scientists believe, erroneously, that it is sufficient to publish their papers in conferences, particularly prestigious conferences such as STOC and FOCS—and neglect to publish them in journals. In contrast, this bibliography emphasizes the benefits of archival publication in rigorously refereed journals. Often, the journal version corrects errors, provides more details, and extends the results of the conference paper.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
ArXiv, however, has put more weight in the other end of this boat. It is the easy end to step into and ride; your humble bloggers confess a few instances ourselves. After noting he’d already used the STOC/FOCS Bibliography to locate journal versions of papers, Michael—again, writing in <b>1991</b>—finished by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Compiling and maintaining [this and other similar] bibliographies would require the continual cooperation of many authors and journal editors, but the results would be worth the effort.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We interpret what Paul is saying along these lines.  It may not be a completely new kind of journal—it goes for continuity with the kind we know—or a completely new mission for a journal.  But it is responding to new contexts and environments for journals, like watercraft in a 007 movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> More Aims </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The announcement also declares these purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> </em></p><em>
<ul>
<li>
The scope of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen et al.’s Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science). <p/>
</li><li>
Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field. <p/>
</li><li>
<font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font> adheres to the principles of ‘virtuous’ open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers will remain with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.
</li></ul>
</em><p><em>
</em>
</p></blockquote>

Some further points and history are given in full in the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/12/theoretics-new-tcs-journal.html">posting</a> on Lance and Bill’s blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We are excited by the creation of <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font>. We especially like the ability to freely read articles and also to freely submit articles. We look forward to see the articles that will appear in the journal. Please submit some of your new results. Good luck. </p>
<p>
We certainly hope to see some of the following in the journal soon: </p>
<ul>
<li>
A Super Linear Lower Bound on the Circuit Size for 3-SAT. <p/>
</li><li>
A Simple Quantum Algorithm for Almost All Cases of the Halting Problem. <p/>
</li><li>
Graph Isomorphism is in Polynomial Time.
</li></ul>
<p>
What do you hope to see soon in <font color="red"><b>TheoretiCS</b></font>?</p>

The newsletter article mentions two well-known surprising results (also on my list), and another cool one which came after my post and that I was thinking of adding.

    <title>TheoretiCS: A New TCS Journal</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><i>Guest Post from Paul Beame on behalf of the TheoretiCS Foundation</i></p><p>I am writing to let you know of the launch today of <a href="https://theoretics-journal.org">TheoretiCS</a>, a new fully open-access journal dedicated to Theoretical Computer Science developed by the members of our community that I have been involved in and for which I gave a brief pre-announcement about at STOC.</p><p>This journal has involved an unprecedented level of cooperation of representatives of leading conferences from across the entire Theoretical Computer Science spectrum. This includes representatives from STOC, FOCS, SODA, CCC, PODC, SoCG, TCC, COLT, ITCS, ICALP, which may be more familiar to readers of your blog, as well as from LICS, CSL, CONCUR, ICDT, MFCS and a number of others.</p><p><b>Two Points of Emphasis</b></p><p/><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Our quality objective - TheoretiCS aims at publishing articles of a very high quality, and at becoming a reference journal on par with the leading journals in all of Theoretical Computer Science</li><li>The inclusive view of Theoretical Computer Science that this journal represents, which is evident in the choice of two excellent co-editors-in-chief, Javier Esparza and Uri Zwick, and an outstanding <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/editorial-board">inaugural editorial board</a>.</li></ul><p/><p><b>Guiding principles and objectives</b></p><p/><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>We believe that our field (and science in general) needs more 'virtuous' open-access journals, a whole eco-system of them, with various levels of specialization and of selectivity. We also believe that, along with the structuring role played by conferences in theoretical computer science, we collectively need to re-develop the practice of journal publications.</li><li>The scope of TheoretiCS is the whole of Theoretical Computer Science, understood in an inclusive meaning (concretely: including, but not restricted to, the Theory of Computing and the Theory of Programming; or equivalently, the so-called TCS-A and TCS-B, reminiscent of Jan van Leeuwen et al.'s Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science).</li><li>Our aim is to rapidly become a reference journal and to contribute to the unity of the Theoretical Computer Science global community. In particular, we will seek to publish only papers that make a very significant contribution to their respective fields, that strive to be accessible to a wider audience within theoretical computer science, and that are, generally, of a quality on par with the very best journals in the field.</li><li>TheoretiCS adheres to the principles of 'virtuous' open-access: there is no charge to read the journal, nor to publish in it. The copyright of the papers remains with the authors, under a Creative Commons license.</li></ul><p/><p><b>Organization and a bit of history</b></p><p>The project started in 2019 and underwent a long gestation. From the start, we wanted to have a thorough discussion with a wide representation of the community, on how to best implement the guiding principles sketched above. It was deemed essential to make sure that all fields of theoretical computer science would feel at home in this journal, and that it would be recognized as a valid venue for publication all over the world.</p><p>This resulted in the creation of an <a href="https://theoretics.episciences.org/page/advisory-board">Advisory Board</a>, composed of representatives of most of the main conferences in the field (currently APPROX, CCC, COLT, CONCUR, CSL, FOCS, FoSSaCS, FSCD, FSTTCS, ICALP, ICDT, ITCS, LICS, MFCS, PODC, SoCG, SODA, STACS, STOC, TCC) and of so-called members-at-large. </p><p><b>Logistics and answers to some natural questions</b></p><p/><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>The journal is published by the TheoretiCS Foundation, a non-profit foundation established under German law. Thomas Schwentick, Pascal Weil, and Meena Mahajan are officers of the foundation.</li><li>TheoretiCS is based on the platform <a href="https://episciences.org/">episciences.org</a>, in the spirit of a so-called overlay journal.</li><li>The Advisory Board, together with the Editors-in-Chief and the Managing Editors, spent much of their efforts in designing and implementing an efficient 2-phase review system: efficient in terms of the added-value it brings to the published papers and their authors, and of the time it takes. Yet, as this review system relies in an essential fashion on the work and expertise of colleagues (like in all classical reputable journals), we can not guarantee a fixed duration for the evaluation of the papers submitted to TheoretiCS.</li><li>Being charge-free for authors and readers does not mean that there is no cost to publishing a journal. These costs are supported for the foreseeable future by academic institutions (at the moment, CNRS and Inria, in France; others may join).</li><li>The journal will have an ISSN, and each paper will have a DOI. There will be no print edition.</li></ul><p/></div>
