<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We recently showed an algorithm for computing all-pairs minimum cuts (or, more precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree) in ~O(n^2) time in weighted graphs and even almost-linear time in unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, this is the first improvement over the 60-year-old algorithm by Gomory and Hu. Thus, surprisingly, computing all-pairs minimum cuts seems to be strictly easier than computing all-pairs shortest paths, which is conjectured to require n^{3-o(1)} time.</p>
<p>I will give a tutorial on the techniques behind our new result, one of which is called “isolating cuts”. Then, I will survey recent progress in fast minimum cut algorithms and discuss open problems.</p>

<i>I’m low-key. I like my privacy—Kemba Walker.</i></p>
<p>
Avrim Blum, Irit Dinur, Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim, and Adam Smith, received the ACM 2021 Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice <a href="https://awards.acm.org/kanellakis">Award</a>. They worked on and studied the notion of <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy">differential privacy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/11/differential-privacy/all-12/" rel="attachment wp-att-20004"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20004" height="338" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/all.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" width="600"/></a></p>
<p><b> Privacy </b></p>
<p/><p>
One of the key advances of modern cryptography is its ability to define new types of security. One can be pretty naive in defining simple notions of security. For example, it is not too hard to get correct the notion: Given the encrypted message <img alt="{E_K(M)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_K%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> one cannot easily determine <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> without knowing the key <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. However, things are much more complex when we wish to define more complex notions. </p>
<p>
This happens with notions of privacy. Differential privacy is a framework for reasoning about statistical databases. Imagine you have two otherwise identical databases, one with your personal information in it, and one without it. Differential Privacy ensures that the probability that a statistical query will produce a given result is (nearly) the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second database. </p>
<p>
Perhaps a concrete question will help: <i>How can we use data to learn about a population, without learning about specific individuals within the population?</i> Consider these two questions: </p>
<ol>
<li> “How many people live in Vermont?”
</li><li> “How many people named Joe Smith live in Vermont?”
</li></ol>
<p>
The first reveals a property of the whole population, while the second reveals information about one person. We need to be able to learn about trends in the population while preventing the ability to learn anything new about a particular individual. This is the goal of many statistical analyses of data, such as the statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is what differential privacy is all about. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Award </b></p>
<p/><p>
From the award citation:</p>
<p>
<em><br/>
Differential privacy is a definition and framework for reasoning about privacy in statistical databases. While the privacy of individuals contributing to a dataset has been a long-standing concern, prior to the Kanellakis recipients’ work, computer scientists only knew how to mitigate several specific privacy attacks via a disparate set of techniques. The foundation for differential privacy emerged in the early 2000’s from several key papers. At the ACM Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2003) Dinur and Nissim presented a paper which showed that any technique that allows reasonably accurate answers to a large number of queries is inherently non-private.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Later, a sequence of papers by Dwork and Nissim at the International Conference on Cryptology (Crypto 2004); as well as Blum, Dwork, McSherry, and Nissim at the ACM Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2005); and Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith at the Theory of Cryptology Conference (TCC 2006) further defined and studied the notion of differential privacy.</em> </p>

    <title>Queen Elizabeth is the 3rd longest reigning monarch; The problem with definitions</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> A few days ago Queen Elizabeth passed Johann II of Liechtenstein to be the third longest reigning monarch (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-reigning_monarchs">here</a>). </p><p>A summary of the top 4:</p><p><br/></p><p>4) Johann II, Liechtenstein ruled from Nov 12 1858 until his death on Feb 11, 1929. When he became King he was 18. He was king for 70 years, 91 days. </p><p>3) Queen Elizabeth II (thats a two, not an eleven) ruled from Feb 2, 1952 until now. When she became Queen she was  25. I am writing this on May 10 at which time she ruled 70 years, 94 days. </p><p>2) Bhumibol Adulyadej (Thailand) ruled from June 9, 1946 until Oct 13, 2016. When he became King he was 19. He was king for 70 years, 126 days. </p><p>1) Louis XIV ruled from May 14, 1643 until Sept 1, 1715. When he became King he was 4 years and 8 months. He was king for 72 years, 110 days. </p><p><br/></p><p>Johann, Elizabeth, and Bhumibol started their reigns a bit young (they would have to to have ruled so long) but their first day of their reign they knew what the job was, what they are supposed to do etc. </p><p>Here is my complaint: Louis XIV being king at the age of 4 years 8 months should not count (someone who proofread this post wondered if 4 years 9 months would count. No.) Shouldn't we define the reign of a king as the point at which he can make real decisions as king? Or something like that. </p><p>For the record of the longest marriage there is a similar problem. The three longest marriages are legit in that the people got married at a reasonable age (I think all were married after they were 17). The fourth longest marriage of all time involved two people that were married when they were 5. That should not count (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_long_marriages">here</a>).</p><p>Is there a way to define monarch's reigns and also marriage length so that it corresponds to our intuitions? </p><p>In Math we can use rigorous definitions but in English its harder. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>Environmental Sensing Options for Robot Teams: A Computational Complexity Perspective</title>

teams can use to perceive their environments when performing tasks. We give the
first comparison of the computational characteristic of visual and scalar-field
sensing, phrased in terms of the computational complexities of verifying and
designing teams of robots to efficiently and robustly perform distributed
construction tasks. This is done relative a basic model in which teams of
robots with deterministic finite-state controllers operate in a synchronous
error-free manner in 2D grid-based environments. Our results show that for both
types of sensing, all of our problems are polynomial-time intractable in
general and remain intractable under a variety of restrictions on parameters
characterizing robot controllers, teams, and environments. That being said,
these results also include restricted situations for each of our problems in
which those problems are effectively polynomial-time tractable. Though there
are some differences, our results suggest that (at least in this stage of our
investigation) verification and design problems relative to visual and
scalar-field sensing have roughly the same patterns and types of tractability
and intractability results.

    <title>FastHare: Fast Hamiltonian Reduction for Large-scale Quantum Annealing</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1652227200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Thai:Phuc.html">Phuc Thai</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Thai:My_T=.html">My T.

remains the only near-term quantum computing paradigm that provides sufficient
many qubits for real-world applications. To fit larger optimization instances
on existing quantum annealers, reducing Hamiltonians into smaller equivalent
Hamiltonians provides a promising approach. Unfortunately, existing reduction
techniques are either computationally expensive or ineffective in practice. To
this end, we introduce a novel notion of non-separable~group, defined as a
subset of qubits in a Hamiltonian that obtains the same value in optimal
solutions. We develop a theoretical framework on non-separability accordingly
and propose FastHare, a highly efficient reduction method. FastHare,
iteratively, detects and merges non-separable groups into single qubits. It
does so within a provable worst-case time complexity of only $O(\alpha n^2)$,
for some user-defined parameter $\alpha$. Our extensive benchmarks for the
feasibility of the reduction are done on both synthetic Hamiltonians and 3000+
instances from the MQLIB library. The results show FastHare outperforms the
roof duality, the implemented reduction method in D-Wave's SDK library, with
3.6x higher average reduction ratio. It demonstrates a high level of
effectiveness with an average of 62% qubits saving and 0.3s processing time,
advocating for Hamiltonian reduction as an inexpensive necessity for QA.

    <title>Exploring Viable Algorithmic Options for Automatically Creating and Reconfiguring Component-based Software Systems: A Computational Complexity Approach (Full Version)</title>

costs of creating software systems. However, it is not clear to what extent the
core component selection and adaptation activities of CBD can be implemented to
operate automatically in an efficient and reliable manner or in what situations
(if any) CBD is preferable to other approaches to software development. In this
paper, we use computational complexity analysis to determine and compare the
computational characteristics of fully automatic component-based software
system creation and reconfiguration by de novo design, component selection, and
component selection with adaptation. Our results show that none of these
approaches can be implemented to operate both efficiently and reliably in a
fully automatic manner either in general or relative to a number of
restrictions on software systems, system requirements, components, and
component adaptation. We also give restrictions under which all of these
approaches can be implemented to operate both efficiently and reliably. As
such, this paper illustrates how different types of computational complexity
analysis (in particular, parameterized complexity analysis) can be used to
systematically explore the algorithmic options for implementing automatic
activities in software engineering.

learning tasks in the worst case with the surprising solvability of these tasks
by heuristic algorithms in practice seems to be exploiting restrictions on
real-world data sets. One approach to investigating such restrictions is to
analyze why heuristics perform well under restrictions. A complementary
approach would be to systematically determine under which sets of restrictions
efficient and reliable machine learning algorithms do and do not exist. In this
paper, we show how such a systematic exploration of algorithmic options can be
done using parameterized complexity analysis, As an illustrative example, we
give the first parameterized complexity analysis of batch and incremental
policy inference under Learning from Demonstration (LfD). Relative to a basic
model of LfD, we show that none of our problems can be solved efficiently
either in general or relative to a number of (often simultaneous) restrictions
on environments, demonstrations, and policies. We also give the first known
restrictions under which efficient solvability is possible and discuss the
implications of our solvability and unsolvability results for both our basic
model of LfD and more complex models of LfD used in practice.

    <title>Parallel Batch-Dynamic Minimum Spanning Forest and the Efficiency of Dynamic Agglomerative Graph Clustering</title>

clustering data, but despite its importance, no dynamic algorithms for HAC with
good theoretical guarantees exist. In this paper, we study dynamic HAC on
edge-weighted graphs. As single-linkage HAC reduces to computing a minimum
spanning forest (MSF), our first result is to develop a parallel batch-dynamic
algorithm for maintaining MSFs. On a batch of $k$ edge insertions or deletions,
our batch-dynamic MSF algorithm runs in $O(k\log^6 n)$ expected amortized work
and $O(\log^4 n)$ span with high probability. It is the first fully dynamic MSF
algorithm handling batches of edge updates with polylogarithmic work per update
and polylogarithmic span. Using MSF, we obtain a parallel batch-dynamic
algorithm that can answer queries about single-linkage graph HAC clusters.
</p>
<p>Our second result is that dynamic graph HAC is significantly harder for other
common linkage functions. Assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis,
dynamic graph HAC requires $\Omega(n^{1-o(1)})$ work per update or query on a
graph with $n$ vertices for complete linkage, weighted average linkage, and
average linkage. For complete linkage and weighted average linkage, this bound
still holds even for incremental or decremental algorithms and even if we allow
$\operatorname{poly}(n)$-approximation. For average linkage, the bound weakens
to $\Omega(n^{1/2 - o(1)})$ for incremental and decremental algorithms, and the
bounds still hold if we allow $O(n^{o(1)})$-approximation.

architectures, for which the energy used for communication heavily depends on
the distance of the communicating processors. In our model, processors have
locations on a conceptual two-dimensional grid, and their distance therein
determines their communication cost. In particular, we introduce the energy
cost of a spatial computation, which measures the total distance traveled by
all messages, and study the depth of communication, which measures the largest
number of hops of a chain of messages. We show matching energy lower and upper
bounds for many foundational problems, including sorting, median selection, and
matrix multiplication. Our model does not depend on any parameters other than
the input shape and size, simplifying algorithm analysis. We also show how to
simulate PRAM algorithms in our model and how to obtain results for a more
complex model that introduces the size of the local memories of the processors
as a parameter.

iterations in time. It is therefore important to provide efficient
implementations. The present study borrows philosophical concepts from Gilbert
Simondon to identify data structures and algorithms that have the biggest
impact on running time and memory usage. These are the entity $e$-tuple
$\mathcal{E}$ and the intertwined update function $\phi$. Focusing on
implementing data structures in C#, $\mathcal{E}$ is implemented as a list of
objects according to current software engineering practice and as an array of
pointers according to theoretical considerations. Cellular automata simulation
with $10^9$ entities over one iteration reveal that object-list with dynamic
typing and multi-state readiness has a drastic effect on running time and
memory usage, especially dynamic as it has a big impact on the evolution time.
Pointer-arrays are possible to implement in C# and are more running time and
memory efficient as compared to the object-list implementation, however, they
are cumbersome to implement. In conclusion, avoiding dynamic typing in
object-list based implementations or using pointer-arrays gives evolution times
that are acceptable in practice, even on desktop computers.

Moreover, we show that two commonly used linear programming relaxations are no

non-rigid shape matching. Our method is based on the functional maps framework,
but rather than promoting isometries we focus instead on near-conformal maps
that preserve landmarks exactly. We achieve this, first, by introducing a novel
landmark-adapted basis using an intrinsic Dirichlet-Steklov eigenproblem.
Second, we establish the functional decomposition of conformal maps expressed
in this basis. Finally, we formulate a conformally-invariant energy that
promotes high-quality landmark-preserving maps, and show how it can be solved
via a variant of the recently proposed ZoomOut method that we extend to our
setting. Our method is descriptor-free, efficient and robust to significant
mesh variability. We evaluate our approach on a range of benchmark datasets and
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on non-isometric benchmarks and near
state-of-the-art performance on isometric ones.

problem of deciding whether a given primitive positive first-order sentence is
true in a fixed structure (also called model). We study a class of problems
that generalizes the CSP simultaneously in two directions: we fix a set
$\mathcal{L}$ of quantifiers and Boolean connectives, and we specify two
versions of each constraint, one strong and one weak. Given a sentence which
only uses symbols from $\mathcal{L}$, the task is to distinguish whether the
sentence is true in the strong sense, or it is false even in the weak sense. We
classify the computational complexity of these problems for the existential
positive equality-free fragment of first-order logic, i.e., $\mathcal{L} =
\{\exists,\land,\lor\}$, and we prove some upper and lower bounds for the
positive equality-free fragment, $\mathcal{L} =
\{\exists,\forall,\land,\lor\}$. The partial results are sufficient, e.g., for
all extensions of the latter fragment.

array without intervening space, even if the objects have variable size. In
particular, each object can be compressed using standard compression
techniques. A small search data structure allows locating the objects in
constant expected time. PaCHash is most naturally described as a static
external hash table where it needs a constant number of bits of internal memory
per block of external memory. However, PaCHash can be dynamized and is also
useful for internal memory, having lower space consumption than all previous
approaches even when considering only objects of identical size. For example,
in some sense it beats a lower bound on the space consumption of k-perfect
hashing. An implementation for fast SSDs needs about 5 bits of internal memory
per block of external memory, requires only one disk access (of variable
length) per search operation and has internal search overhead small compared to
the disk access cost.

Our
protocols allow a purely classical verifier to distinguish devices with
different quantum circuit depths even in the presence of classical computation.
We show that a device with quantum circuit depth at most d will be rejected by
the verifier even if the prover applies additional polynomial-time classical
computation to cheat. On the other hand, the verifier accepts a device which
has quantum circuit depth d' for some d'&gt;d. In our first protocol, we introduce
an additional untrusted quantum machine which shares entanglements with the
target machine. Applying a robust self-test, our first protocol certifies the
depth of the target machine with information theoretic security and nearly
optimal separation. The protocol relies on the oracle separation problem for
quantum depth by Chia, Chung and Lai [STOC 2020] and a transformation from an
oracle separation problem to a two-player non-local game. Our second protocol
certifies the quantum depth of a single device based on quantum hardness of
learning with errors. The protocol relies on the noisy trapdoor claw-free
function family and the idea of pointer chasing to force the prover to keep
quantum coherence until all preceding message exchanges are completed. To our
knowledge, we give the first constructions for distinguishing hybrid
quantum-classical computers with different circuit depths in unrelativized
models.

each subsequent step, burns the neighbors of the currently burnt vertices, as
well as one other unburnt vertex. The burning number of $G$ is the smallest
number of steps required to burn all the vertices of the graph. In this paper,
we examine the problem of computing the burning number in a geometric setting.
The input is a set of points $P$ in the Euclidean plane. The burning process
starts with a single burnt point, and at each subsequent step, burns all the
points that are within a distance of one unit from the currently burnt points
and one other unburnt point. The burning number of $P$ is the smallest number
of steps required to burn all the points of $P$. We call this variant
\emph{point burning}. We consider another variant called \emph{anywhere
burning}, where we are allowed to burn any point of the plane. We show that
point burning and anywhere burning problems are both NP-complete, but
$(2+\varepsilon)$ approximable for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Moreover, if we put a
restriction on the number of burning sources that can be used, then the
anywhere burning problem becomes NP-hard to approximate within a factor of
$\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}-\varepsilon$.

have shown that there exists an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ such that
$\mathsf{BQP}^\mathcal{O} \neq (\mathsf{BPP^{BQNC}})^\mathcal{O} \cup
(\mathsf{BQNC^{BPP}})^\mathcal{O}$. In fact, Chia et al. proved a stronger
statement: for any depth parameter $d$, there exists an oracle that separates
quantum depth $d$ and $2d+1$, when polynomial-time classical computation is
allowed. This implies that relative to an oracle, doubling quantum depth gives
classical and quantum hybrid schemes more computational power.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that for any depth parameter $d$, there exists an
oracle that separates quantum depth $d$ and $d+1$, when polynomial-time
classical computation is allowed. This gives an optimal oracle separation of
classical and quantum hybrid schemes. To prove our result, we consider
$d$-Bijective Shuffling Simon's Problem (which is a variant of $d$-Shuffling
Simon's Problem considered by Chia et al.) and an oracle inspired by an
"in-place" permutation oracle.

<i>Mathematics is not about numbers, equations, computations, or algorithms: it is about understanding—Bill Thurston.</i></p>
<p>
Peter Weinberger is a computer scientist who is famous for many things—including his <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html">face</a>. His name “Peter” alone stands for “rock or stone”. He did great work at Bell Labs, where he was part of the team that created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> Programming Language: the others were Alfred Aho and Brian Kernighan. </p>
<p>
I just saw him, after a few years, at Bob <a href="https://wordpress.com/read/feeds/115529253/posts/3992043808">Sedgewick’s</a> retirement event in Princeton. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/10/peters-face/pw/" rel="attachment wp-att-19990"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19990" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pw.jpg?resize=252%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="252"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> His Face </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter’s face comes up in Bell Lab’s lure:  For some reason, the <a href="http://spinroot.com/pico/pjw.html">portrait</a> of Peter Weinberger has always been our most popular target for picture editing experiments. It started a few years ago when Peter was raised to the rank of department head and was careless enough to leave a portrait of himself floating around. On a goofy Saturday evening at the lab, Rob Pike and I started making photocopies and, to emphasize Peter’s rise in the managerial hierarchy, prepared a chart of the Bell Labs Cabinet with his picture stuck in every available slot. Peter must have realized that the best he could do was not to react at all, if at least he wanted to avoid seeing his face 10 feet high on a watertower. Nevertheless, Peter’s picture appeared and reappeared in the most unlikely places in the lab. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Experiments </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter’s research over the years has been, I believe, an interesting mixture of theory and practice. Early on he did experimental work in deep number theory. For example his paper with Daniel Shanks <a href="http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/aa/aa21/aa21139.pdf">refuted</a> an open conjecture. This work is an interesting blend of computations and theory. One of the surprises of deep number theory is that shocks abound in the fine structure of number fields. This structure is not always straightforward and often depends on examples and counterexamples. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Crypto </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter also worked with the US government in classified ways. He is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JASON_(advisory_group)">Jason’s</a> group. For example you can see some of his work on the evaluation of research directions: </p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/dna.pdf">DNA</a>: one of my favorite.
</li><li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/qc.pdf">Quantum</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://irp.fas.org/agency/dod/jason/medimag.pdf">Medical Imaging</a>.
</li></ol>
<p>
Other parts of it are classified and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Renaissance and Google </b></p>
<p/><p>
Renaissance Technologies is an American hedge fund based on Long Island. The firm is regarded as the most successful hedge fund in the world. Weinberger was the chief technology officer at Renaissance until he left for Google in 2003. This exit made sense since Peter seems to love problems in infrastructure and security. Working to solve infrastructure problems at the global scale at Google was clearly a compelling opportunity for him. </p>
<p>
Below is an excerpt from a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1514393">talk</a> with Peter and Laurianne Mclaughlin:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_19992" style="width: 250px;"><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/10/peters-face/peter-weinberger/" rel="attachment wp-att-19992"><img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-19992" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pw2.jpg?resize=240%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="240"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-19992">Peter Weinberger, New York City, 2015</p></div>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: I’m a software engineer. I write programs, infrastructure stuff mostly. I’m working on tools for processing various kinds of logs created by internal software. I’m not working on security directly, but a lot of what we do is affected by security and privacy concerns. As a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, most companies now create a lot of logs to verify what code they’re running, and [show] how people work with internal data.</p>
<p>
Also, I spend a lot of time reading code. At Google, you can’t check in code without it being reviewed and approved by a peer, so if you work with productive people, there’s a lot of code to review.</p>
<p>
<b>LM</b>: What are the biggest technology challenges for Google today?</p>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: Scale is the problem. Our business grows rapidly. That means every year, a lot of the technology decisions made a year ago don’t look so good any more. Exponential growth is a very pleasant problem but requires a lot of work.</p>
<p>
<b>LM</b>: What are your technology pet peeves?</p>
<p>
<b>Weinberger</b>: I’m sure I’ve got dozens. Password management. Sometimes people, like auditors, think users should regularly change passwords. I think this just encourages people to use crummy passwords—because either they have to write the passwords down, or they need a sequence of passwords that are very similar.</p>
<p>
One of my other pet peeves here is curious error messages. A lot of them are still awful. They start with the word “abort” but the program continues. We have a lot of legacy software, and you end up with these situations where an error message pops up, but the computer keeps on going. Deep in the software something went wrong, and reports it, but you’re seven levels of abstraction away, and it’s just useless noise.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
Peter is still working on his problems. We wish him well on solving them and on all he is doing.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-070 |  On Solving Sparse Polynomial Factorization Related Problems | 

	Ilya Volkovich, 

	Pranav Bisht</title>
    <summary>In a recent result of Bhargava, Saraf and Volkovich [FOCS’18; JACM’20], the first sparsity bound for constant individual degree polynomials was shown. In particular, it was shown that any factor of a polynomial with at most $s$ terms and individual degree bounded by $d$ can itself have at most $s^{O(d^2\log n)}$ terms. It is conjectured, though, that the "true" sparsity bound should be polynomial (i.e. $s^{poly(d)}$). In this paper we provide supporting evidence for this conjecture by presenting polynomial-time algorithms for several problems that would be implied by a polynomial-size sparsity bound. In particular, we give an efficient (deterministic) identity testing algorithms for $\Sigma^{[2]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[\deg_{x_i} \leq d]}$ circuits and testing if a sparse polynomial is an exact power. Hence, our algorithms rely on different techniques.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We have…I don’t know, I’ve lost count of the number of papers this month. It’s a big bonanza. Sublinear algorithms for edit distance, planar graphs, distributions, bipartite graphs, groups, error correcting codes, Bayesian nets, polynomials…</p>



<p>Let’s proceed with the spread.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Sublinear-Time Edit Distance for Preprocessed Strings</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer, and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14137">arXiv</a>). The edit distance between strings is a classic and important problem in algorithms. You might recall that classic \(O(n^2)\) algorithm to compute the edit distance between strings of length \(n\). It has been show that getting a \(O(n^{2-\delta})\) time algorithm is SETH-hard. But what can be done in sublinear time? This paper considers the preprocessed version: suppose we can perform near-linear preprocessing on the strings. We now want to distinguish between edit distance between \(\leq k\) and \(\geq k\cdot n^{o(1)}\). This paper shows that with near-linear preprocessing on strings, one can solve this problem in \(k \cdot n^{o(1)}\) time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Closeness Testing of Discrete Distributions Made <s>Complex</s> Simple</strong> by (our own) Clément L. Canonne and Yucheng Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12640">arXiv</a>). Given two distributions \(p, q\) over support \([k]\), the aim is to distinguish between (i) the distributions being equal, and (ii) the total variation distance between \(p, q\) being at least \(\epsilon\). The tester should has a failure probability of at most \(\delta\). A recent work nails down the sample complexity with respect to all parameters. This paper gives a simpler proof of the main result. Earlier proofs used Poissonization tricks and fairly clever arguments about Poisson random variables. This proof is much more transparent, and uses an identity that relates the expectation of a random variable to its characteristic function. A nice feature of this proof is that it works directly with the multinomial distribution, which means a fixed number of samples (rather than choosing the number of samples from a distribution).</p>



<p><strong>Tolerant Bipartiteness Testing in Dense Graphs</strong> by Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, Rahul Raychaudhury, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12397">arXiv</a>). Testing bipartiteness of dense graphs is about as a classic as it gets. We wish to distinguish a bipartite graph from one that requires \(\varepsilon n^2\) edge removals to make it bipartite. Readers of this blog should know that there is a \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})\)-query property tester for this problem. (Ok, so now you know.) This paper studies the tolerant version of bipartiteness testing. Note that this is equivalent to approximating the maxcut, up to additive error \(\varepsilon n^2\). Classic approximation algorithms show that the latter can be done in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-6})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) time. This paper considers the easier problem of distinguishing whether the distance to bipartiteness is at most \(\varepsilon\) or at least \(2 \varepsilon\). This problem is solved in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}))\). </p>



<p><strong>Properly learning monotone functions via local reconstruction</strong> by Jane Lange, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11894">arXiv</a>). Ah yes, monotone functions. An ongoing love (obsession? interest?) for property testing people. This paper studies the problem of proper learning of Boolean valued monotone functions over the Boolean hypercube. Given access to uniform random evaluations of a monotone function \(f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\), we wish to compute a monotone function \(g\) that approximates the original function. Classic results from Fourier analysis show that an approximation  can be learned using \(\exp(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)\) queries. But this approximation function might not be monotone, and only yields improper learning. This paper gives a proper learner that outputs a monotone approximation, in roughly the same query complexity. This result directly gives a constant tolerance monotonicity tester for Boolean functions. The paper uses recent results from distributed algorithms and local computation. It also leads to tolerant testers for monotonicity over posets with small diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Massively Parallel Computation and Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Embedded Planar Graphs</strong> by Jacob Holm and Jakub Tětek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09035">arXiv</a>). Sublinear algorithms for planar graphs is another ongoing love (at least for me). This paper considers a new take of this problem: suppose we have access to a geometric embedding of a planar graph \(G\). Can we get sublinear algorithms for a variety of problems? This paper first shows how to construct a convenient decomposition, called an \(r\)-division, in sublinear time. This division can be used to approximate Lipschitz graph parameters, such as maximum matching sizes, maximum independent set, etc. The paper also shows how to compute an \(r\)-division in the MPC model, which solves many classic graph  problems (connected components, matchings, etc.) in \(O(1)\) rounds. There is a (conditional) lower bound showing that, without an embedding, it is not possible to solve such problems in \(O(1)\) rounds (and sublinear space per processor).</p>



<p><strong>Independence Testing for Bounded Degree Bayesian Network</strong> by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Clément L. Canonne (again, our own), and Joy Qiping Yang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08690">arXiv</a>). Given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) on the Boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\), the problem is to determine whether \(\mathcal{P}\) is a product distribution. In general, this problem requires \(\Omega(2^n)\) samples. Suppose \(\mathcal{P}\) has a sparse, “efficient” description. Can we do better? This paper shows that when \(\mathcal{P}\) is generated by a Bayesian network (with bounded indegree), then the independence testing problem can be solved with a \(\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. Think of a Bayesian network as a DAG, where each vertex generates a Bernoulli random variable. The variable at a vertex depends only the outcomes at its neighborhood.</p>



<p><strong>Low Degree Testing over the Reals </strong>by Vipul Arora, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Noah Fleming, Esty Kelman, and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08404">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/051/">ECCC</a>). The problem testing low degree polynomials goes back to the birth of property testing. This paper studies real valued polynomials, in the distribution free setting. Formally, we have query access to a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\). The distance is measured with respect to an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the domain. This paper shows that the real low degree testing problem can be solved in \(poly(d\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries (under some reasonableness conditions on the distribution). The approach is go to via the “self-correct and test” approach: try to compute a low degree polynomial that fits some sampled data, and then check how far the self-corrected version is from another sample.</p>



<p><strong>Testing distributional assumptions of learning algorithms</strong> by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07196.pdf">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of learning a halfspace over \(\mathbb{R}^n\). If the underlying distribution is Gaussian, then this class can be learned in \(n^{poly(\varepsilon^{-1})}\) samples. If the distribution is arbitrary, no \(2^{o(n)}\) algorithm is known despite much research. This paper introduces the notion of having a <em>tester-learner</em> pair. The tester first checks if the input distribution is “well-behaved” (Gaussian-like). If the tester passes, then we run the learner. Indeed, this perspective goes back to some of the original motivations for property testing (when is testing faster than learning). The intriguing aspect of this problem is that we do not have efficient testers for determining if an input distribution is Gaussian. This paper circumvents that problem by estimating certain moments of the distribution. If these moments agree with the moments of a Gaussian, then the learner is guaranteed to succeed. We get the best of both worlds: if the input distribution is Gaussian, the learning is done correctly. If the learner succeeds, then then output (hypothesis) is guaranteed to be correct, regardless of the input distribution.</p>



<p><strong>Testability in group theory</strong> by Oren Becker, Alexander Lubotzky, and Jonathan Mosheiff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04539">arXiv</a>). This paper is the journal version of a result of the authors, and it gives a group theoretic presentation of a property testing result. Consider the following problem. The input is a pair permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2)\) over \([n]\). The aim is to test whether they commute: \(\sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \sigma_2 \sigma_1\). Another result of the authors gives a tester that makes \(O(\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries. They refer to this problem as “testing the relation” \(XY = YX\). This paper gives a grand generalization of that result, best explained by another example. Consider another relation/property denoted \(\{XZ = ZX, YZ = ZY\}\). This property consists of all triples of permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3)\), where \(\sigma_3\) commutes with the other two. A consequence of the main theorem is that this property is not testable with query complexity independent of \(n\). The main result of this paper is a characterization of testable relations, which goes via studying the expansion of an infinite graph associated with the relation.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Positive Semidefiniteness Using Linear Measurements</strong> by Deanna Needell, William Swartworth, and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03782">arXiv</a>). The input is a \(d \times d\) real, symmetric matrix \(M\) and we wish to determine if it is positive semidefinite (all eigenvalues are positive). For the testing problem, we reject when the minimum eigenvalue is at most \(-\varepsilon \|M\|_2\). (The paper also considers general Schatten \(p\)-norms.) This paper gives a list of results for non-adaptive vs adaptive, and one-sided vs two-sided testers. There are two access models considered: a single query consists of either a (i) matrix-vector product \(Mx\) or (ii) vector-matrix-vector product \(y^TMx\). Typical models that query entries of the matrix require strong bounds on the entries, which is less reasonable in practical situations. An interesting discovery is that the non-adaptive, one-sided complexity is \(\Theta(\sqrt{d}\varepsilon^{-1})\) while the two-sided bound is independent of \(d\).</p>



<p><strong>Relaxed Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes: Beyond Tensoring</strong> by Gil Cohen and Tal Yankovitz (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/045/">ECCC</a>). Locally decodable and correctable codes are a fundamental object of study in property testing (and TCS in general). Consider a locally correctable code (LCC). Given a string \(x\), the decoder/corrector makes \(q\) queries to \(x\), and outputs a symbol. We can think of the output collectively as a string \(y\). If \(x\) is a codeword, then \(y = x\). Otherwise, \(dist(y,z) \leq \varepsilon\), where \(z\) is some codeword close to \(x\). In the relaxed version, the corrector is allowed to output \(\bot\), denoting that it has discovered corruption. The distance is only measured in the coordinates where the corrector does not output \(\bot\). Thus, the corrector gets a “free pass” if it outputs \(\bot\). But note that when \(x\) is a codeword, the output must be exactly \(x\). This paper gives a Relaxed LCC with query complexity \((\log n)^{O(\log\log\log n)}\), a significant improvement over the previous best \((\log n)^{O(\log\log n)}\). It is know from previous work that the query complexity must be \(\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})\).</p>



<p><strong>Verifying The Unseen: Interactive Proofs for Label-Invariant Distribution Properties</strong> by Tal Herman and Guy Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/052/">arXiv</a>). This paper considers the distribution testing problem in the context of interactive proofs. The verifier, who wishes to test a property of a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\), interacts with a prover who knows the distribution. The guarantee required is the standard one for interactive proof systems: in the YES case, an honest prover should be able to convince the verifier. In the NO case, no prover can convince the verifier with high probability. There are two important parameters of interest: the sample complexity of the verifier, and the communication complexity of the messages. It is useful to consider the two extremes. In one extreme, the verifier can simply solve the problem herself, ignoring the prover. This could require \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) queries (for the hardest properties like entropy and support size). Another extreme is for the honest prover to simply send an approximate description of the distribution, which takes \(O(n)\) bits. The prover can just test equality to the prover message, which only takes \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) queries. This paper shows a 2-round protocol for any (label-invariant) property where both the communication and the sample complexity can be made \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\). This result shows the power of interaction for distribution testing problems.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Since the late 19th century, mathematicians have realized the importance and generality of selection problems: given a collection of sets, select an element in each set, possibly in a “nice” way. Of particular importance in computer science is the scenario where the ground set is a metric space, in which case it is natural to ask for <strong>Lipschitz</strong> selection. In this talk I will describe a far-reaching extension of this classical Lipschitz selection problem to an *online* setting, where sets are streaming to the selector. I will show how Riemannian gradient descent (aka mirror descent) can be used to approach this type of problems. I will illustrate the power of the framework by solving a long-standing problem in online shortest path known as layered graph traversal (introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1989).</p>

    <title>TR22-069 |  List-Decoding Random Walk XOR Codes Near the Johnson Bound | 

	Silas Richelson, 

	Sourya Roy</title>
    <summary>In a breakthrough result, Ta-Shma described an explicit construction of an almost optimal binary code (STOC 2017).  Ta-Shma's code has distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ and rate $\Omega\bigl(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)}\bigr)$ and thus it almost achieves the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, except for the $o(1)$ term in the exponent.  The prior best list-decoding algorithm for (a variant of) Ta-Shma's code achieves is due to Alev et al (STOC 2021).  This algorithm makes use of SDP hierarchies, and is able to recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2^{\log(1/\varepsilon)^{1/6}}$.  In this work we give an improved analysis of a similar list-decoding algorithm.  Our algorithm works for Ta-Shma's original code, and it is able to list-decode almost all the way to the Johnson bound: it can recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2\sqrt{\varepsilon}$.</summary>

    <title>TR22-068 |  Sketching Approximability of (Weak) Monarchy Predicates | 

	Santhoshini Velusamy, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Alexander Golovnev, 

	Amirbehshad Shahrasbi</title>
    <summary>We analyze the sketching approximability of constraint satisfaction problems on Boolean domains, where the constraints are balanced linear threshold functions applied to literals. In particular, we explore the approximability of monarchy-like functions where the value of the function is determined by a weighted combination of the vote of the first variable (the president) and the sum of the votes of all remaining variables. The pure version of this function is when the president can only be overruled by when all remaining variables agree. For every $k \geq 5$, we show that CSPs where the underlying predicate is a pure monarchy function on $k$ variables have no non-trivial sketching approximation algorithm in $o(\sqrt{n})$ space. We also show infinitely many weaker monarchy functions for which CSPs using such constraints are non-trivially approximable by $O(\log(n))$ space sketching algorithms. Moreover, we give the first example of sketching approximable asymmetric Boolean CSPs. Our results work within the framework of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy (FOCS 2021) that characterizes the sketching approximability of all CSPs. Their framework can be applied naturally to get a computer-aided analysis of the approximability of any specific constraint satisfaction problem. The novelty of our work is in using their work to get an analysis that applies to infinitely many problems simultaneously.</summary>

    <title>TR22-067 |  Black-box Identity Testing of Noncommutative Rational Formulas of Inversion Height Two in Deterministic Quasipolynomial-time | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Abhranil Chatterjee, 

	Partha Mukhopadhyay</title>
    <summary>Hrube\v{s} and Wigderson (2015) initiated the complexity-theoretic study of noncommutative formulas with inverse gates. They introduced the Rational Identity Testing (RIT) problem which is to decide whether a noncommutative rational formula computes zero in the free skew field. In the white-box setting, deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are known for this problem following the works of Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016) and Ivanyos, Qiao, and Subrahmanyam (2018).

A central open problem in this area is to design an efficient deterministic black-box identity testing algorithm for rational formulas. In this paper, we solve this problem for the first nested inverse case. More precisely, we obtain a deterministic quasipolynomial-time black-box RIT algorithm for noncommutative rational formulas of inversion height two via a hitting set construction. Several new technical ideas are involved in the hitting set construction, including key concepts from matrix coefficient realization theory (Vol?i?, 2018) and properties of cyclic division algebra (Lam, 2001). En route to the proof, an important step is to embed the hitting set of Forbes and Shpilka for noncommutative formulas (2013) inside a cyclic division algebra of small index.</summary>

    <title>TR22-066 |  On sketching approximations for symmetric Boolean CSPs | 

	Joanna Boyland, 

	Michael Hwang, 

	Tarun Prasad, 

	Noah Singer, 

	Santhoshini Velusamy</title>
    <summary>A Boolean maximum constraint satisfaction problem, Max-CSP\((f)\), is specified by a predicate \(f:\{-1,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}\). An \(n\)-variable instance of Max-CSP\((f)\) consists of a list of constraints, each of which applies \(f\) to \(k\) distinct literals drawn from the \(n\) variables. For \(k=2\), Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [CGV20, FOCS 2020] obtained explicit ratios characterizing the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming approximability of every predicate. For \(k \geq 3\), Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21, arXiv:2102.12351] proved a general dichotomy theorem for \(\sqrt n\)-space sketching algorithms: For every \(f\), there exists \(\alpha(f)\in (0,1]\) such that for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\), Max-CSP\((f)\) is \((\alpha(f)-\epsilon)\)-approximable by an \(O(\log n)\)-space linear sketching algorithm, but \((\alpha(f)+\epsilon)\)-approximation sketching algorithms require \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) space.
     
In this work, we give closed-form expressions for the sketching approximation ratios of multiple families of symmetric Boolean functions. Letting \(\alpha'_k = 2^{-(k-1)} (1-k^{-2})^{(k-1)/2}\), we show that for odd \(k \geq 3\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = \alpha'_k\), and for even \(k \geq 2\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = 2\alpha'_{k+1}\). Thus, for every \(k\), \(k\)AND can be \((2-o(1))2^{-k}\)-approximated by \(O(\log n)\)-space sketching algorithms; we contrast this with a lower bound of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy [STOC 2022] implying that streaming \((2+\epsilon)\cdot2^{-k}\)-approximations require \(\Omega(n)\) space! We also resolve the ratio for the "at-least-\((k-1)\)-\(1\)'s" function for all even \(k\); the "exactly-\(\frac{k+1}2\)-\(1\)'s" function for odd \(k \in \{3,\ldots,51\}\); and fifteen other functions. We stress here that for general \(f\), the dichotomy theorem in [CGSV21] only implies that \(\alpha(f)\) can be computed to arbitrary precision in \(\textbf{PSPACE}\), and thus closed-form expressions need not have existed a priori. Our analyses involve identifying and exploiting structural "saddle-point" properties of this dichotomy.
    
Separately, for all threshold functions, we give optimal "bias-based" approximation algorithms generalizing [CGV20] while simplifying [CGSV21]. Finally, we investigate the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming lower bounds in [CGSV21], and show that they are incomplete for \(3\)AND, i.e., they fail to rule out \((\alpha(3\)AND\()-\epsilon)\)-approximations in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.</summary>

<i>Retire from your job, but never retire your mind.</i></p>
<p>
Bob Sedgewick is becoming an <a href="https://dof.princeton.edu/book/export/html/5486">emeritus</a> professor: </p>
<p>
When Faculty transfer to emeritus status and retain a professional connection with Princeton, they are expected to conduct their future research and University-related activities with the same ethical standards currently expected from all Princeton Faculty. </p>
<p>
Emeritus faculty members may receive such University publications as the Princeton University Bulletin and the Princeton Alumni Weekly, as well as agendas and minutes of University Faculty Meetings. They may attend meetings of the University and departmental faculty upon invitation, but do not have votes at these meetings. Emeritus faculty members continue to receive University identification cards and to have use of the library, the athletic facilities and dining facilities on the same basis as active faculty members. </p>
<p>
A not so recent picture: <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/rs/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19971" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rs.jpg?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="218"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Some History </b></p>
<p/><p>
Sedgewick got his PhD at Stanford and returned to Brown to start his academic career as an assistant professor in 1975. He was promoted to associate professor in 1980 and full professor in 1983. At Brown, he <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/events/25th-anniversary/hist_text.html">participated</a> in the <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2014/05/cs35#:~:text=This year marks the 35th,Digital VAX-11/80.">founding</a> of the computer science department, in 1979. </p>
<p>
Later in 1985 he joined the faculty at Princeton as <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/05/03/sedgewick-recognized-contribution-computer-science-education">founding</a> chair of the Department of Computer Science. Two founding positions—pretty neat. His first-year courses in computer science are among the most popular ever offered at Princeton. He also pioneered the practice of replacing large live lectures with on-demand online videos—pretty clever. </p>
<p>
Bob has worked at research institutions outside of Princeton during summers and leaves. Three come to mind: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://idaccr.org/about-us">IDA</a>, the Institute for Defense Analyses, gave him an opportunity to work with the CRAY-1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">supercomputer</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://www.parc.com">PARC</a>, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, gave him an opportunity to see the personal computer come into existence.
</li><li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation">INRIA</a>, The Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, gave him a chance to work closely with Philippe Flajolet
</li></ul>
<p>
I joined him at IDA a few years later. I had to get a security clearance which is another whole story—see this <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/09/03/open-problems-that-might-be-easy/">post</a> for some fun thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Some More History </b></p>
<p/><p>
Bob and I wrote some papers together: Two were on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a>. The first on <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1981Lower.pdf">lower</a> bounds on the size of chips that computed something and the second on a language <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1982ALI.pdf">ALI</a> for designing VLSI circuits. </p>
<p>
Another paper was included also Jin-yi Cai and Andy Yao on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/336546">Towards Uncheatable benchmarks</a>. Or see a follow-on <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-35568-9_18.pdf">paper</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/bs/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19972" height="300" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bs.png?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1" width="225"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p/><p>
It was wonderful working <i>for</i> Bob when he was the chair of Computer Science and wonderful working <i>with</i> him on the above papers and more. </p>
<p>
Bob, have a wonderful time being retired. And happy emeritus status.</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>So, I’d been planning a fun post for today about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E">DALL-E</a> image-generating AI model, and in particular, a brief new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13807">preprint</a> about DALL-E’s capabilities by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus">Gary Marcus</a>, and myself.  We wrote this preprint as a sort of “adversarial collaboration”: Ernie and Gary started out deeply skeptical of DALL-E, while I was impressed bordering on awestruck.  I was pleasantly surprised that we nevertheless managed to produce a text that we all agreed on.</p>



<p>Not for the first time, though, world events have derailed my plans.  The most important part of today’s post is this:</p>



<p><strong>For the next week, I, Scott Aaronson, will personally match all reader donations to <a href="https://fundtexaschoice.org/">Fund Texas Choice</a>—a group that helps women in Texas travel to out-of-state health clinics, for reasons that are neither your business nor mine—up to a total of $5,000.</strong></p>



<p>To show my seriousness, I’ve already donated $1,000.  Just let me know how much you’ve donated in the comments section!</p>



<p>The first reason for this donation drive is that, perhaps like many of you, I stayed up hours last night reading Alito’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21835435-scotus-initial-draft">leaked decision</a> in a state of abject terror.  I saw how the logic of the decision, consistent and impeccable on its own terms, is one by which the Supreme Court’s five theocrats could now proceed to unravel the whole of modernity.  I saw how this court, unchecked by our broken democratic system, can now permanently enshrine the will of a radical minority, perhaps unless and until the United States is plunged into a second Civil War.</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s the first reason for the donation drive.  The second reason is to thank <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>‘s commenters for their … err, consistently generous and thought-provoking contributions.  Let’s take, for example, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">this</a> comment on last week’s admittedly <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405">rather silly post</a>, from an anonymous individual who calls herself “Feminist Bitch,” and who was enraged that it took me <em>a</em> <em>full day</em> to process one of the great political cataclysms of our lifetimes and publicly react to it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>OF COURSE. Not a word about Roe v. Wade being overturned, but we get a pseudo-intellectual rationalist-tier rant about whatever’s bumping around Scott’s mind right now. Women’s most basic reproductive rights are being curtailed AS WE SPEAK and not a peep from Scott, eh? Even though in our state (Texas) there are already laws ON THE BOOKS that will criminalize abortion as soon as the alt-right fascists in our Supreme Court give the go-ahead. If you cared one lick about your female students and colleagues, Scott, you’d be posting about the Supreme Court and helping feminist causes, not posting your “memes.” But we all know Scott doesn’t give a shit about women. He’d rather stand up for creepy nerdbros and their right to harass women than women’s right to control their own fucking bodies. Typical Scott.</p></blockquote>



<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">read</a> all of Feminist Bitch’s further thoughts about my failings, with my every attempt to explain and justify myself met with further contempt.  No doubt my well-meaning friends of both sexes would counsel me to ignore her.  Alas, from my <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/the-blog-comment-that-achieved-an-internet-miracle/384539/">infamous ordeal</a> of late 2014, I know that with her every word, Feminist Bitch speaks for thousands, and the knowledge eats at me day and night.</p>



<p>It’s often said that “the right looks for converts, while the left looks only for heretics.”  Has Feminist Bitch ever stopped to think about <em>how</em> our civilization reached its current terrifying predicament—how Trump won in 2016, how the Supreme Court got packed with extremists who represent a mere 25% of the country, how Putin and Erdogan and Orban and Bolsonaro and all the rest consolidated their power?  Does she think it happened because wokeists like herself reached out too much, made too many inroads among fellow citizens who share <em>some</em> but not <em>all</em> of their values?  Would Feminist Bitch say that, if the Democrats want to capitalize on the coming tsunami of outrage about the death of <em>Roe</em> and the shameless lies that enabled it, if they want to sweep to victory in the midterms and enshrine abortion rights into federal law … then their best strategy would be to double down on their condemnations of gross, creepy, smelly, white male nerdbros who all the girls, like, <em>totally hate</em>?</p>



<p>(until, thank God, some of them don’t)</p>



<p>I continue to think that the majority of my readers, of all races and sexes and backgrounds, are reasonable and sane.  I continue to think the majority of you recoil against hatred and dehumanization of <em>anyone</em>—whether that means women seeking abortions, gays, trans folks, or (gasp!) even white male techbros.  In this sad twilight for the United States and for liberal democracy around the world, we the reasonable and sane, we the fans of the Enlightenment, we the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3922">Party of Psychological Complexity</a>, have decades of work cut out for us.  For now I’ll simply say: I don’t hear from you nearly enough in the comments.</p></div>

    <title>TR22-065 |  Streaming and Sketching Complexity of CSPs: A survey | 

	Madhu Sudan</title>
    <summary>In this survey we describe progress over the last decade or so in understanding the complexity of solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) approximately in the streaming and sketching models of computation. After surveying some of the results we give some sketches of the proofs and in particular try to explain why there is a tight dichotomy result for sketching algorithms working in subpolynomial space regime.</summary>

    <title>TR22-064 |  Improved Low-Depth Set-Multilinear Circuit Lower Bounds | 

	Deepanshu Kush, 

	Shubhangi Saraf</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we prove strengthened lower bounds for constant-depth set-multilinear formulas. More precisely, we show that over any field, there is an explicit polynomial $f$ in VNP defined over $n^2$ variables, and of degree $n$, such that any product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size at least $n^{\Omega \left( n^{1/\Delta}/\Delta\right)}$. The hard polynomial $f$ comes from the class of Nisan-Wigderson (NW) design-based polynomials. 

Our lower bounds improve upon the recent work of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (STOC 2022), where a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega (\Delta n^{1/\Delta})}$ was shown for the size of product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formulas computing the iterated matrix multiplication (IMM) polynomial of the same degree and over the same number of variables as $f$. Moreover, our lower bounds are novel for any $\Delta\geq 2$.

The precise quantitative expression in our lower bound is interesting also because the lower bounds we obtain are "sharp" in the sense that any asymptotic improvement would imply general set-multilinear circuit lower bounds via depth reduction results. 

In the setting of general set-multilinear formulas, a lower bound of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ was already obtained by Raz (J. ACM 2009) for the more general model of multilinear formulas. The techniques of LST (which extend the techniques of the same authors in (FOCS 2021)) give a different route to set-multilinear formula lower bounds, and allow them to obtain a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega(\log n)}$ for the size of general set-multilinear formulas computing the IMM polynomial. Our proof techniques are another variation on those of LST, and enable us to show an improved lower bound (matching that of Raz) of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$, albeit for the same polynomial $f$ in VNP (the NW polynomial). As observed by LST, if the same $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size lower bounds for unbounded-depth set-multilinear formulas could be obtained for the IMM polynomial, then using the self-reducibility of IMM and using hardness escalation results, this would imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general algebraic formulas.</summary>

    <title>TR22-063 |  Fast Multivariate Multipoint Evaluation Over All Finite Fields | 

	Mrinal Kumar,

	Zeyu Guo, 

	Chris Umans, 

	Vishwas Bhargava</title>
    <summary>Multivariate multipoint evaluation is the problem of evaluating a multivariate polynomial, given as a coefficient vector, simultaneously at multiple evaluation points. In this work, we show that there exists a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$ that outputs the evaluations of an $m$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable at $N$ points in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log|\F|)
\]
for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$.

A previous work of Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008, SICOMP 2011) achieved the same time complexity when the number of variables $m$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ and had left the problem of removing this condition as an open problem. A recent work of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra (STOC 2022) answered this question when the underlying field is not too large  and has characteristic less than $d^{o(1)}$. In this work, we remove this constraint on the number of variables over all finite fields, thereby answering the question of Kedlaya and Umans over all finite fields. 

Our algorithm relies on a non-trivial combination of ideas from three seemingly different previously known algorithms for multivariate multipoint evaluation, namely the algorithms of Kedlaya and Umans, that of  Bj\"orklund, Kaski and Williams (IPEC 2017, Algorithmica 2019), and that of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra, together with a result of Bombieri and Vinogradov from analytic number theory about the distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression. 

We also present a second algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation that is completely elementary and in particular, avoids the use of the Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. However, it requires a mild assumption that the field size is bounded by an exponential-tower in $d$ of bounded height. More specifically, our second algorithm solves the multivariate multipoint evaluation problem over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log |\mathbb{F}|)\]
for all $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$, provided that the size of the finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed.</summary>
