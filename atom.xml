<p>Ken Regan is of course my partner on GLL. He is faculty in the computer science department at the University of Buffalo. His PhD was in 1986 from Oxford University and it was titled <i>On the separation of complexity classes</i>. He was the PhD student of Dominic Welsh who was a student of John Hammersley.</p>
<p>Today I would like to wish Ken a happy birthday.</p>
<p>He is now 61 years young. I hope you will join me and wish him many more birthdays. His age is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/61_(number)">special</a> for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a twin prime.</li>
<li>It is equal to <img alt="{5^{2} + 6^{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5^{2} + 6^{2}}"/>.</li>
<li>It is the ninth Mersenne prime: <img alt="{2^{61} - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B61%7D+-+1+%3D+2%2C305%2C843%2C009%2C213%2C693%2C951%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{61} - 1 = 2,305,843,009,213,693,951}"/>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three big <b>I’s</b> in his life. Let’s talk about two of them.</p>
<h2>Interest in Cricket</h2>
<p>Ken loves sports in general and especially cricket. Last Sunday he told me he watched his Bills win their first NFL game while he watched a cricket match. I have no idea how cricket works, but here is Ken’s <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/Writing/CricketBaseball.html">explanation</a>: <i>Are Cricket and Baseball sister games?</i></p>
<table style="margin: auto;">

<ul>
<li>In a baseball game you see pitchers on the field.<br/>
In a cricket match you see fielders on the pitch.</li>
<li>In baseball, a bad delivery is called a “Ball”.<br/>
In cricket, it’s a “No Ball”.</li>
<li>In baseball, if a batter carries his bat, he’s out.<br/>
In cricket, the batsmen always carry their bat, and an opening batsman who “carries his bat” is never out.</li>
<li>In baseball, an innings is called a half-inning.<br/>
In cricket, an inning is called an innings.</li>
<li>In baseball, a batter hit by a pitched ball gets a free pass to First Base.<br/>
In cricket, such a batter can be Out Leg Before Wicket.</li>
<li>In baseball, if a ball is caught over the boundary, “yer out!”<br/>
In cricket, you score 6 runs.</li>
<li>In baseball, when a batter “walks”, he gets a free pass to first and is not out.<br/>
In cricket, it means the batsman declares himself out before the umpire has a chance to make the call. This classic show of sportsmanship is considered unsportsmanlike in baseball.<p/>
<h2>Interest in Chess</h2>
<p>When the chess world wants to know if someone has cheated, they call Ken. He is an international chess master, and has worked on stopping cheating for years. It is important these days, since most tournaments are now online. And cheating is easier when no one is directly able to watch you. Ken is busy.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the cheating problem. Suppose that Alice and Bob are playing an online game of chess. Alice makes her own moves, but she wonders if Bob could be cheating. He could be using advice from another “player”, Sally. There are several points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sally is a stronger player than anyone—she can easily beat Alice and Bob.</li>
<li>Sally not only says “here is my move”—she will sometimes give several good moves.</li>
<li>Sally is a program that is deterministic—given a position she gives the same answer.The issue for Ken is: When Alice played Bob did Bob make the moves or did he consult Sally?
</li></ol>
<p>There are many complexities:</p>
<ol>
<li>What if Bob agreed with all Sally’s moves? Then he certainly did cheat.</li>
<li>What if Bob was just lucky and played above his strength? Then he did not cheat.</li>
<li>What if Bob used Sally for some positions but not others? Then he did cheat, but it may be hard to be sure.</li>
<li>And so on.</li>
</ol>
<p>What Ken has done is create both a theory and programs to determine whether Bob did indeed cheat. I find the general problem of telling if one cheats online at chess to be fascinating. See us <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-problem-of-catching-chess-cheaters/">before</a> for more details and also see <a href="http://www.uschess.org/index.php/June/How-To-Catch-A-Chess-Cheater-Ken-Regan-Finds-Moves-Out-Of-Mind.html">this</a>.</p>
<h2>Open Problems</h2>
<p>Ken is one of the nicest people I know. Hope he has many more birthdays and many more twin primes.</p>

    <title>The Platform Design Problem</title>

designed to interact with users during a certain activity, such as browsing,
chatting, socializing, emailing, driving, etc. The economic and incentive
structure of this exchange, as well as its algorithmic nature, have not been
explored to our knowledge; we initiate their study in this paper. We model this
interaction as a Stackelberg game between a Designer and one or more Agents. We
model an Agent as a Markov chain whose states are activities; we assume that
the Agent's utility is a linear function of the steady-state distribution of
this chain. The Designer may design a platform for each of these
activities/states; if a platform is adopted by the Agent, the transition
probabilities of the Markov chain are affected, and so is the objective of the
Agent. The Designer's utility is a linear function of the steady state
probabilities of the accessible states (that is, the ones for which the
platform has been adopted), minus the development cost of the platforms. The
underlying optimization problem of the Agent -- that is, how to choose the
states for which to adopt the platform -- is an MDP. If this MDP has a simple
yet plausible structure (the transition probabilities from one state to another
only depend on the target state and the recurrent probability of the current
state) the Agent's problem can be solved by a greedy algorithm. The Designer's
optimization problem (designing a custom suite for the Agent so as to optimize,
through the Agent's optimum reaction, the Designer's revenue), while NP-hard,
has an FPTAS. These results generalize, under mild additional assumptions, from
a single Agent to a distribution of Agents with finite support. The Designer's
optimization problem has abysmal "price of robustness", suggesting that
learning the parameters of the problem is crucial for the Designer.

information-computation gaps in high-dimensional statistical estimation
problems. A prominent approach is to characterize the limits of restricted
models of computation, which on the one hand yields strong computational lower
bounds for powerful classes of algorithms and on the other hand helps guide the
development of efficient algorithms. In this paper, we study two of the most
popular restricted computational models, the statistical query framework and
low-degree polynomials, in the context of high-dimensional hypothesis testing.
Our main result is that under mild conditions on the testing problem, the two
classes of algorithms are essentially equivalent in power. As corollaries, we
obtain new statistical query lower bounds for sparse PCA, tensor PCA and
several variants of the planted clique problem.

    <title>Breaking the $n$-Pass Barrier: A Streaming Algorithm for Maximum Weight Bipartite Matching</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1600128000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Liu:S=_Cliff.html">S.

$\mathit{maximum~weight~bipartite~matching}$ problem is to find a set of
vertex-disjoint edges with the maximum weight. This classic problem has been
extensively studied for over a century.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present a new streaming algorithm for the maximum weight
bipartite matching problem that uses $\widetilde{O}(n)$ space and
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{m})$ passes, which breaks the $n$-pass barrier. All the
previous algorithms either require $\Omega(n \log n)$ passes or only find an
approximate solution.
</p>
<p>To achieve this pass bound, our algorithm combines a number of techniques
from different fields such as the interior point method (IPM), symmetric
diagonally dominant (SDD) system solving, the isolation lemma, and LP duality.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that implements the SDD
solver and IPM in the streaming model in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ spaces for graph
matrix. All the previous IPMs only focus on optimizing the running time,
regardless of the space usage. The LP solver for general matrix is impossible
to be implemented in $\widetilde{O}(n)$ spaces.

    <title>Cut-Equivalent Trees are Optimal for Min-Cut Queries</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1600128000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Abboud:Amir.html">Amir Abboud</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Krauthgamer:Robert.html">Robert Krauthgamer</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Trabelsi:Ohad.html">Ohad Trabelsi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06090">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Min-Cut queries are fundamental: Preprocess an undirected edge-weighted
graph, to quickly report a minimum-weight cut that separates a query pair of
nodes $s,t$. The best data structure known for this problem simply builds a
cut-equivalent tree, discovered 60 years ago by Gomory and Hu, who also showed
how to construct it using $n-1$ minimum $st$-cut computations. Using
state-of-the-art algorithms for minimum $st$-cut (Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014)
<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1312.6713">arXiv:1312.6713</a>, one can construct the tree in time $\tilde{O}(mn^{3/2})$,
which is also the preprocessing time of the data structure. (Throughout, we
focus on polynomially-bounded edge weights, noting that faster algorithms are
known for small/unit edge weights.)
</p>
<p>Our main result shows the following equivalence: Cut-equivalent trees can be
constructed in near-linear time if and only if there is a data structure for
Min-Cut queries with near-linear preprocessing time and polylogarithmic
(amortized) query time, and even if the queries are restricted to a fixed
source. That is, equivalent trees are an essentially optimal solution for
Min-Cut queries. This equivalence holds even for every minor-closed family of
graphs, such as bounded-treewidth graphs, for which a two-decade old data
structure (Arikati et al., J.~Algorithms 1998) implies the first near-linear
time construction of cut-equivalent trees.
</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike all previous techniques for constructing cut-equivalent
trees, ours is robust to relying on approximation algorithms. In particular,
using the almost-linear time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum
$st$-cut (Kelner et al., SODA 2014), we can construct a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate flow-equivalent tree (which is a slightly weaker
notion) in time $n^{2+o(1)}$. This leads to the first
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for All-Pairs Max-Flow that runs in time
$n^{2+o(1)}$, and matches the output size almost-optimally.

    <title>On Fault Tolerant Feedback Vertex Set</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1600128000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Misra:Pranabendu.html">Pranabendu Misra</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.06063">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The study of fault-tolerant data structures for various network design
problems is a prominent area of research in computer science. Likewise, the
study of NP-Complete problems lies at the heart of computer science with
numerous results in algorithms and complexity. In this paper we raise the
question of computing fault tolerant solutions to NP-Complete problems; that is
computing a solution that can survive the "failure" of a few constituent
elements. This notion has appeared in a variety of theoretical and practical
settings such as estimating network reliability, kernelization (aka instance
compression), approximation algorithms and so on. In this paper, we seek to
highlight these questions for further research.
</p>
<p>As a concrete example, we study the fault-tolerant version of the classical
Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) problem, that we call Fault Tolerant Feedback Vertex
Set (FT-FVS). Recall that, in FVS the input is a graph $G$ and the objective is
to compute a minimum subset of vertices $S$ such that $G-S$ is a forest. In
FT-FVS, the objective is to compute a minimum subset $S$ of vertices such that
$G - (S \setminus \{v\})$ is a forest for any $v \in V(G)$. Here the vertex $v$
denotes a single vertex fault. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, and
then present a constant factor approximation algorithm as well as an
FPT-algorithm parameterized by the solution size. We believe that the question
of computing fault tolerant solutions to various NP-Complete problems is an
interesting direction for future research.

\Delta)$-round deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring bound of Parter (ICALP'18).
</p>
<p>A remarkable property of our algorithm is its simplicity. Whereas the
state-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this problem are based on the quite
involved local coloring algorithm of Chang et al. (STOC'18), our algorithm can
be described in just a few lines. At a high level, it applies a careful
derandomization of a recursive procedure which partitions the nodes and their
respective palettes into separate bins. We show that after $O(1)$ recursion
steps, the remaining uncolored subgraph within each bin has linear size, and
thus can be solved locally by collecting it to a single node. This algorithm
can also be implemented in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model
provided that each machine has linear (in $n$, the number of nodes in the input
graph) space.
</p>
<p>We also show an extension of our algorithm to the MPC regime in which
machines have sublinear space: we present the first deterministic
$(\Delta+1)$-list coloring algorithm designed for sublinear-space MPC, which
runs in $O(\log \Delta + \log\log n)$ rounds.

solutions. In practice, single or multiple objectives must be satisfied,
wherein both the objective function and constraints can be non-convex resulting
in multiple optimal solutions. Real world scenarios include intersecting
surfaces as Implicit Functions, Hyperspectral Unmixing and Pareto Optimal
fronts. Local or global convexification is a common workaround when faced with
non-convex forms. However, such an approach is often restricted to a strict
class of functions, deviation from which results in sub-optimal solution to the
original problem. We present neural solutions for extracting optimal sets as
approximate manifolds, where unmodified, non-convex objectives and constraints
are defined as modeler guided, domain-informed $L_2$ loss function. This
promotes interpretability since modelers can confirm the results against known
analytical forms in their specific domains. We present synthetic and realistic
cases to validate our approach and compare against known solvers for
bench-marking in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

stable solutions. However, in many important societal problems, the degree of
fairness in the matching assumes crucial importance, for instance when we have
to match COVID-19 patients to care units. We study the problem of finding a
stable many-to-one matching while satisfying fairness among all the agents with
cardinal utilities. We consider various fairness definitions from fair
allocation literature, such as envy-freeness (EF) and leximin optimal fairness.
We find that EF and its weaker versions are incompatible with stability, even
under a restricted setting with isometric utilities. We focus on leximin
optimal fairness and show that finding such a matching is NP-Hard, even under
isometric utilities. Next, we narrow our focus onto ranked isometric utilities
and provide a characterisation for the space of stable matchings. We present a
novel and efficient algorithm that finds the leximin optimal stable matching
under ranked isometric utilities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to address the problem of finding a leximin optimally fair and stable
matching.

    <title>Terminating cases of flooding</title>

Given a finite undirected
(network) graph $G$, a set of sources $I \subseteq G$ initiate flooding in the
first round by every node in $I$ sending the same message to all of its
neighbours. In each subsequent round, nodes send the message to all of their
neighbours from which they did not receive the message in the previous round.
Flooding terminates when no node in $G$ sends a message in a round. The
question of termination has not been settled - rather, non-termination is
implicitly assumed to be possible.
</p>
<p>We show that flooding terminates on every finite graph. In the case of a
single source $g_0$, flooding terminates in $e$ rounds if $G$ is bipartite and
$j$ rounds with $e &lt; j \leq e+d+1$ otherwise, where $e$ and $d$ are the
eccentricity of $g_0$ and diameter of $G$ respectively. For
communication/broadcast to all nodes, this is asymptotically time optimal and
obviates the need for construction and maintenance of spanning structures. We
extend to dynamic flooding initiated in multiple rounds with possibly multiple
messages. The cases where a node only sends a message to neighbours from which
it did not receive {\it any} message in the previous round, and where a node
sends some highest ranked message to all neighbours from which it did not
receive {\it that} message in the previous round, both terminate. All these
cases also hold if the network graph loses edges over time. Non-terminating
cases include asynchronous flooding, flooding where messages have fixed delays
at edges, cases of multiple-message flooding and cases where the network graph
acquires edges over time.

the capacitated single-item lot sizing problem with backordering under demand
uncertainty, modeled by uncertain cumulative demands. The well-known interval
budgeted uncertainty representation is assumed. Two of its variants are
considered. The first one is the discrete budgeted uncertainty, in which at
most a specified number of cumulative demands can deviate from their nominal
values at the same time.The second variant is the continuous budgeted
uncertainty, in which the sum of the deviations of cumulative demands from
their nominal values, at the same time, is at most a bound on the total
deviation provided. For both cases, in order to choose a production plan that
hedges against the cumulative demand uncertainty, the robust minmax criterion
is used. Polynomial algorithms for evaluating the impact of uncertainty in the
demand on a given production plan in terms of its cost, called the adversarial
problem, and for finding robust production plans under the discrete budgeted
uncertainty are constructed. Hence, in this case, the problems under
consideration are not much computationally harder than their deterministic
counterparts. For the continuous budgeted uncertainty, it is shown that the
adversarial problem and the problem of computing a robust production plan along
with its worst-case cost are NP-hard. In the case, when uncertainty intervals
are non-overlapping, they can be solved in pseudopolynomial time and admit
fully polynomial timeapproximation schemes. In the general case, a
decomposition algorithm for finding a robust plan is proposed.

information theory measuring the rate of growth of independent sets in graph
powers. Despite being well-studied, this quantity continues to hold several
mysteries. Lov\'asz famously proved that the Shannon capacity of $C_5$ (the
5-cycle) is at most $\sqrt{5}$ via his theta function. This bound is achieved
by a simple linear code over $\mathbb{F}_5$ mapping $x \mapsto 2x$. Motivated
by this, we introduce the notion of $\textit{linear Shannon capacity}$ of
graphs, which is the largest rate achievable when restricting oneself to linear
codes. We give a simple proof based on the polynomial method that the linear
Shannon capacity of $C_5$ is $\sqrt{5}$. Our method applies more generally to
Cayley graphs over the additive group of finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$. We
compare our bound to the Lov\'asz theta function, showing that they match for
self-complementary Cayley graphs (such as $C_5$), and that our bound is smaller
in some cases. We also exhibit a quadratic gap between linear and general
Shannon capacity for some graphs.

    <title>An interesting serendipitous number</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> Last seek I blogged about two math problems of interest to me <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/09/two-math-problems-of-interest-at-least.html">here</a>.</p><p>One of them two people posted answers, which was great since I didn't know how to solve them and now I do. Yeah! I blogged about that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/09/when-are-both-x23y-and-y23y-both.html">here</a>.</p><p><br/></p><p>The other problem got no comments, so I suppose it was of interest to me but not others. I was interested in it because the story behind it is interesting, and the answer is interesting.</p><p><br/></p><p>it is from the paper </p><p>An interesting and serendipitous number by John Ewing and Ciprian Foias, which is a chapter in the wonderful book </p><p>Finite vs Infinite: Contributions to an eternal dilemma</p><p>Here is the story, I paraphrase the article (I'll give pointers  later).</p><p>In the mid 1970's a student asked Ciprian about the following math-competition problem:</p><p>x(1)&gt;0    x(n+1) =  (1 + (1/x(n)))^n. For which x(1) does x(n) --&gt; infinity?</p><p>It turned out this was a misprint. The actual problem was</p><p>x(1)&gt;0  x(n+1)=(1+(1/x(n))^{x(n)}. For which x(1) does x(n) --&gt; infinity.</p><p><br/></p><p>The actual math-comp problem  (with exp x(n)) is fairly easy (I leave it to you.) But this left the misprinted problem (with exp n).  Crispian proved that there is exactly ONE x(1) such that x(n)--&gt; infinity. </p><p>Its approx 1.187... and may be trans.</p><p><br/></p><p>I find the story and the result interesting, but the proof is to long for a blog post.</p><p>I tried to find the article online and could not. A colleague found the following:</p><p><br/></p><p>A preview of the start of the article <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-0751-4_8">here</a></p><p>Wikipedia Page on the that number, called the Foias constant, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foias_constant">here</a></p><p>Mathworld page on that number <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FoiasConstant.html">here</a></p><p>Most of the article but skips two pages <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Bjb0BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=serendipitous+number+John+Ewing+and+Ciprian+Foias&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4tn1sk3XEA&amp;sig=ACfU3U3GM9VtlyWxTjq302E5Uf7Tmr49Hw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiewLSF9OjrAhVkmXIEHRYEAMA4ChDoATAAegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=serendipitous%20number%20John%20Ewing%20and%20Ciprian%20Foias&amp;f=false">here</a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR20-139 |  The Coin Problem with Applications to Data Streams | 

	Mark Braverman, 

	Sumegha Garg, 

	David Woodruff</title>
    <summary>Consider the problem of computing the majority of a stream of $n$ i.i.d. uniformly random bits. This problem, known as the {\it coin problem}, is central to a number of counting problems in different data stream models. We show that any streaming algorithm for solving this problem with large constant advantage must use $\Omega(\log n)$ bits of space. We extend our lower bound to proving tight lower bounds for solving multiple, randomly interleaved copies of the coin problem, as well as for solving the OR of multiple copies of a variant of the coin problem. Our proofs involve new measures of information complexity that are well-suited for data streams. 

We use these lower bounds to obtain a number of new results for data streams. In each case there is an underlying $d$-dimensional vector $x$ with additive updates to its coordinates given in a stream of length $m$. The input streams arising from our coin lower bound have nice distributional properties, and consequently for many problems for which we only had lower bounds in general turnstile streams, we now obtain the same lower bounds in more natural models, such as the bounded deletion model, in which $\|x\|_2$ never drops by a constant fraction of what it was earlier, or in the random order model, in which the updates are ordered randomly. In particular, in the bounded deletion model, we obtain nearly tight lower bounds for approximating $\|x\|_{\infty}$ up to additive error $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|x\|_2$, approximating $\|x\|_2$ up to a multiplicative $(1 + \epsilon)$ factor (resolving a question of Jayaram and Woodruff in PODS 2018), and solving the Point Query and $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters Problems. In the random order model, we also obtain new lower bounds for the Point Query and $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters Problems. 
We also give new algorithms complementing our lower bounds and illustrating the tightness of the models we consider, including an algorithm for approximating $\|x\|_{\infty}$ up to additive error $\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \|x\|_2$ in turnstile streams (resolving a question of Cormode in a 2006 IITK Workshop), and an algorithm for finding $\ell_2$-heavy hitters in randomly ordered insertion streams (which for random order streams, resolves a question of Nelson in a 2018 Warwick Workshop).</summary>

Nisheeth Vishnoi is a professor at Yale University in the computer science department. The faculty <a href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/faculty">there</a> is impressive and includes many of the top researchers in the world. The CS faculty is pretty good too. As Nisheeth’s PhD advisor, years ago, I am proud that he is at Yale. </p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss a new book by Nisheeth. </p>
<p>
The title is <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io/ACO-v1.pdf">Algorithms for Convex Optimization</a>. Let me jump ahead and say that I like the book and especially this insight: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>One way to solve discrete problems is to apply continuous methods.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not a new insight, but is an important one. Continuous math is older than discrete and often is more powerful. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> Analytic number theory is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_number_theory">based</a> on the behavior of continuous functions. Some of the deepest theorems on prime numbers use such methods. Think of the Riemann zeta function 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Czeta%28s%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%5Es%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s} = \frac{1}{1^s} + \frac{1}{2^s} + \frac{1}{3^s} + \cdots "/></p>
<p>as a function of complex numbers <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/>.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> Additive number theory is <a href="https://encyclopediaofmath.org/wiki/Additive_number_theory">based</a> on the behavior of continuous functions. Think of generating functions and Fourier methods. </p>
<p>
The power of continuous methods is one that I sometimes forget. Nisheeth’s book is a testament to the power of this idea. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Convexity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Nisheeth’s book uses another fundamental idea from complexity theory. This is: restrict problems in some way. Allowing too large a class usually makes complexity high. For example, trees are easier in general than planar graphs, and sparse graphs are easier than general graphs. Of course “in general” must be controlled, but restricting the problem types does often reduce complexity. </p>
<p>
Convexity adds to this tradition since <em>convex</em> generalizes the notion of <em>linear</em>. And convex problems of all kinds are abundant in practice, abundant in theory, and are important.</p>

Here is a passage by Roman Dwilewicz on the <a href="http://www.mathem.pub.ro/dgds/v11/D11-DW.pdf">history</a> of the convexity concept:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It was known to the ancient Greeks that there are only five regular <i>convex</i> polyhedra. </em></p><em>

<p>It seems that the first more rigorous definition of convexity was given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a> of Syracuse, (ca 287 – ca 212 B.C.) in his treatise: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sphere_and_Cylinder">On the sphere and cylinder</a>. </p>

<p>I say it’s lucky that Archimedes was not up for tenure.</p>

Nisheeth’s book is now available at this <a href="https://convex-optimization.github.io">site</a>. I have just started to examine it and must say I like the book. Okay, I am not an expert on convex algorithms, nor am I an expert on this type of geometric theory. But I definitely like his viewpoint. Let me explain in a moment. </p>

First I cannot resist adding some statistics about his book created <a href="https://countwordsfree.com/">here</a>:</p>

No way I can read the book in nine hours. But I like seeing how many characters and so on the book has. I will have to calculate the same for other books. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Discrete vs Continuous Methods </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Nisheeth in his introduction explains how continuous methods help in many combinatorial problems, like finding flows on graphs. He uses the <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/>—<img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> flow problem as his example. The <img alt="{s}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s}"/>—<img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/>-maximum flow problem arises in real-world scheduling problems, but is also a fundamental combinatorial problem that can be used to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph, for example.</p>

<i>Combinatorial algorithms for the maximum flow problem</i>. He points out that by building on the Ford-Fulkerson method, various polynomial-time results were proved and other bounds were improved. But he states that the <i>improvements stopped in 1998.</i> Discrete methods seem to be unable to improve complexity for flow problems. </p>
<p>
<i>Convex programming-based algorithms</i>. He adds: </p>

I wish I were better informed about continuous methods in general. They are powerful and pretty. Maybe I could solve an open problem that I have thought about if I knew this material better. Hmmm. Maybe it will help you solve some open problem of your own. Take a look at his book.</p>

    <title>TR20-138 |  Pseudorandom Generators for Unbounded-Width Permutation Branching Programs | 

	William Hoza, 

	Edward Pyne, 

	Salil Vadhan</title>
    <summary>We prove that the Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson (STOC 1994) pseudorandom generator (PRG) fools ordered (read-once) permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a seed length of $\widetilde{O}(\log d + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$, assuming the program has only one accepting vertex in the final layer. Here, $n$ is the length of the program, $d$ is the degree (equivalently, the alphabet size), and $\varepsilon$ is the error of the PRG. In contrast, we show that a randomly chosen generator requires seed length $\Omega(n \log d)$ to fool such unbounded-width programs. Thus, this is an unusual case where an explicit construction is "better than random."

Except when the program's width $w$ is very small, this is an improvement over prior work. For example, when $w = \text{poly}(n)$ and d = 2, the best prior PRG for permutation branching programs was simply Nisan's PRG (Combinatorica 1992), which fools general ordered branching programs with seed length $O(\log(wn/\varepsilon) \log n)$. We prove a seed length lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(\log d + \log n \cdot \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for fooling these unbounded-width programs, showing that our seed length is near-optimal. In fact, when $\varepsilon \leq 1 / \log n$, our seed length is within a constant factor of optimal. Our analysis of the INW generator uses the connection between the PRG and the derandomized square of Rozenman and Vadhan (RANDOM 2005) and the recent analysis of the latter in terms of unit-circle approximation by Ahmadinejad et al. (FOCS 2020).</summary>

    <title>TR20-137 |  Deterministic and Efficient Interactive Coding from Hard-to-Decode Tree Codes | 

	Zvika Brakerski, 

	Yael Tauman Kalai, 

	Raghuvansh Saxena</title>
    <summary>The field of Interactive Coding studies how an interactive protocol can be made resilient to channel errors. Even though this field has received abundant attention since Schulman's seminal paper (FOCS 92), constructing interactive coding schemes that are both deterministic and efficient, and at the same time resilient to adversarial errors (with constant information and error rates), remains an elusive open problem.

An appealing approach towards resolving this problem is to show efficiently encodable and decodable constructions of a combinatorial object called tree codes (Schulman, STOC 93). After a lot of effort in this direction, the current state of the art has deterministic constructions of tree codes that are efficiently encodable but require a logarithmic (instead of constant) alphabet (Cohen, Haeupler, and Schulman, STOC 18). However, we still lack (even heuristic) candidate constructions that are efficiently decodable. 

In this work, we show that tree codes that are efficiently encodable, {\em but not efficiently decodable}, also imply deterministic and efficient interactive coding schemes that are resilient to adversarial errors. Our result immediately implies a deterministic and efficient interactive coding scheme with a logarithmic alphabet (i.e., $1/\log \log$ rate). We show this result using a novel implementation of hashing through deterministic tree codes that is powerful enough to yield interactive coding schemes.</summary>

    <title>TR20-136 |  Explicit and structured sum of squares lower bounds from high dimensional expanders | 

	Irit Dinur, 

	Yuval Filmus, 

	Prahladh Harsha, 

	Madhur Tulsiani</title>
    <summary>We construct an explicit family of 3XOR instances which is hard for Omega(sqrt(log n)) levels of the Sum-of-Squares hierarchy. In contrast to earlier constructions, which involve a random component, our systems can be constructed explicitly in deterministic polynomial time.
Our construction is based on the high-dimensional expanders devised by Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne, known as LSV complexes or Ramanujan complexes, and our analysis is based on two notions of expansion for these complexes: cosystolic expansion, and a local isoperimetric inequality due to Gromov.
Our construction offers an interesting contrast to the recent work of Alev, Jeronimo and the last author (FOCS 2019). They showed that 3XOR instances in which the variables correspond to vertices in a high-dimensional expander are easy to solve. In contrast, in our instances the variables correspond to the edges of the complex.</summary>

<p>
Moshe Vardi holds multiple professorships at Rice University. He is also the Senior Editor of <em>Communications of the ACM</em>. His is therefore a voice to be reckoned with in the current debate over how best to teach during the pandemic. Much of the debate is over whether all should hear his voice the same way, or some hear it in the classroom while others hear it remotely. </p>
<p>
Today we note his recent <a href="https://medium.com/@vardi/covid-19-the-ford-pinto-and-american-higher-ed-2b191920b065">column</a> for <em>Medium</em> advocating the former. Then I (Ken) give some of my own impressions.</p>
<p>
His September 5 column followed an August 8 <a href="https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2020/08/return-to-campus-but-to-what-end">opinion</a> given to the Rice student newspaper. Both begin with concern over the conflict between <em>safety</em> and <em>value</em> for students. Much of the value of college—<em>most</em> according to statistics he cites—comes from being collegial: outside the classroom. But many such activities, not only evening parties but informal games and gatherings, are the most unsafe. </p>
<p>
We will focus however on what Moshe says about the nature of instruction for lecture courses. Certainly for laboratory courses there is a sharp trade-off between safety and in-person interaction. But we focus here on what he says about the nature of teaching in the lecture hall, where one can take safety as a given requirement. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> An In-Person Remoteness Paradox </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I have just returned from sabbatical at the University at Buffalo (UB) and am teaching this fall a small elective 4xx/5xx theory course. It has 15 students, smaller than the 25 in the hypothetical class Moshe describes but of the same order of magnitude. In the spring I will be teaching a larger undergraduate course which is also on target for his concerns. I have taught such a class every spring for a decade. While this assignment is not a new to me, the issue of safety raises tough choices about the delivery options. My options are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>remote-only</em>; <p/>
</li><li>
<em>in-person only</em>; <p/>
</li><li>
<em>hybrid</em> use of 1 and 2 for designated course components; <p/>
</li><li>
<em>hybrid-flexible</em>, meaning 1 and 2 are conducted simultaneously with students free to choose either option, even on a per-lecture basis.
</li></ol>
<p>
I have committed to hybrid-flexible. For my current fall course, I made this commitment in early summer when there was uncertainty over in-person instruction requirements for student visas and registration. I believe that my larger course will be implemented as safely in a large room as my current course. The question is quality.</p>
<p>
Moshe notes right away a paradox for his hypothetical class that could apply to any of modes 2–4; to include the last expressly, I’ve inserted the word “even”:</p>
<blockquote><p> <em> …I realized that [even] the students <b>in the classroom</b> will have to be communicating with me on Zoom, to be heard and recorded. All this, while both the students and I are wearing face masks. It dawned on me then that I will be conducting remote teaching <b>in the classroom</b>. </em>
</p></blockquote>

</td>

</tbody></table>
<p>
In fact, I have one volunteer now in the room logging into Zoom to help with interaction from those attending remotely. This helps because my podium has less space to catch faces and detect questions right away. I do repeat questions so they are picked up in the recording and often redirect them to the class. Still, the mere fact of my not seeing faces alongside the notes and interactive drawings I am sharing makes me feel Moshe’s paradox all the time. This is even though my room allows denser spacing than at Rice, so a class of 25 could sit closer.  Let me, however, say why I love stand-up teaching before addressing his paramount question of what is best for the students at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> From Whiteboards to Tutorials </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dick once wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/07/in-praise-of-chalk-talks/">post</a>, “In Praise of Chalk Talks.” First, with reference to talks pre-made using PowerPoint or LaTeX slides, Dick wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Such talks can be informative and easy to follow, yet sometimes PowerPoint is not well suited to giving a proof. The slides do not hold enough <b>state</b> for us to easily follow the argument. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Moreover, when I contributed to the open-problems session of the workshop at IAS in Princeton, NJ that we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/06/princeton-is-invariant/">covered</a> two years ago, Avi Wigderson insisted that everyone use chalk, not slides. I’ve used slides for UB’s data-structures and programming languages courses, but I think students benefit from seeing proofs and problem-solving ideas <em>grow</em>.</p>
<p>
I find furthermore that the feel of immersion in a process of discovery is enhanced by an in-person presence. I had this in mind when I followed Dick’s post with a long one <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">imagining</a> Kurt Gödel expounding the distinctive points of his set theory (joint with Paul Bernays and John von Neumann), all on one chalkboard. My classes are not as interactive as in that post, but I prepare junctures in lectures for posing questions and doing a little bit of Socratic method. And I try to lead this with body language as well as voice inflection, whether at a whiteboard or drawing on hard paper via a document camera. </p>
<p>
Still, it exactly this “extra” that gets diminished for those who are remote. When I share my screen for notes or a drawing (both in <a href="https://www.mathcha.io/">MathCha</a>), they see my movements only in a small second window if at all. They do hear my voice—but I do not hear theirs even if they unmute themselves. Nor can I read their state of following as I do in the room. Without reiterating the safety factor as Moshe does, I can reformulate his key question as:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does the non-uniformity and inequality of hybrid delivery outweigh the benefits of making in-person instruction available to some? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I must quickly add that in-person teaching is perceived as a collective need at UB. The web form I filled for Spring 2021 stated that some in-person classes must be available at all levels, 1xx through 7xx. I am happy to oblige. But the fact that I chose a flexible structure, especially in a small class, does allow the students to give opinion on this question, as well as on something Moshe says next:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Remote teaching” actually can do a better job of reproducing the intimacy that we take for granted in small classes. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Toward this end, I am implementing a remote version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutorial_system">tutorial system</a> I was part of for two eight-week terms at Oxford while a junior fellow of Merton College. When Cambridge University <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/education-52732814">declared</a> already last May that there would be no in-person lectures all the way through summer 2021, this is because most lectures there are formally optional anyway. The heart of required teaching is via weekly tutorial hours in groups of one-to-three students. They are organized separately by each of thirty-plus constituent colleges rather than by department-centered staff, so the numbers are divided to be manageable. In my math-course tutorials the expectation was for each student to present a solved problem and participate in discussions that build on the methods. </p>
<p>
I am doing this every other week this fall, alternating with weeks of problem-set review that will be strictly optional and classed as enhanced office hours. All UB office hours must be remote anyway. The tutorial requirement was agreed by student voice-vote in a tradeoff with lowering the material in timed exams to compensate for differences in home situations. After a few weeks of this, the class will take stock for opinions on which delivery options work best. UB has already committed to being remote-only after Thanksgiving, and it is possible that the on-campus medical situation will trigger an earlier conversion anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We would like to throw the floor open for comment on Moshe’s matters that we’ve highlighted and on his other opinions about the university mission amid the current crisis more generally. </p>
<p>
[edited to reflect that at Rice too, the hypothetical class could be in any of modes 2–4, and that spacing is further than in my UB room.  “Princeton IAS” -&gt; “IAS in Princeton, NJ”]</p></font></font></div>

    <title>When are both x^2+3y and y^2+3x both squares, and a more general question</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> In my last post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/09/two-math-problems-of-interest-at-least.html">here</a>) I asked two math questions. In this post I discuss one of them. (I will discuss the other one later, probably Monday Sept 14.)</p><p><br/>For which positive naturals x,y are x^2+3y and y^2+3x both squares?</p><p>I found this in a math contest book and could not solve it, so I posted it to see what my readers would come up with. They came up with two solutions, which you can either read in the comments on that post OR read my write up <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/sq3.pdf">here</a>.)</p><p>The problem raises two more general questions</p><p>1) I had grad student Daniel Smolyak write a program that showed that if  1\le x,y \le 1000 then the only solutions were (1,1) and (11,16) and (16,11).  (See write up for why the program did not have to look like anything close to all possibly (x,y).)  </p><p>Is there some way to prove that if the only solutions for 1\le x,y\le N (some N) are the three given above, then there are no other solutions?</p><p><br/></p><p>2) Is the following problem solvable: Given p,q in Z[x,y] determine if the number of a,b such that both p(a,b) and q(a,b) are squares is finite or infinite.  AND if finite then determine how many, or a bound on how many.</p><p><br/></p><p>Can replace squares with other sets, but lets keep it simple for now. </p></div>

    <title>TR20-135 |  Estimation of Graph Isomorphism Distance in the Query World | 

	Sayantan Sen, 

	Sourav Chakraborty, 

	Arijit Ghosh, 

	Gopinath Mishra</title>
    <summary>The graph isomorphism distance between two graphs $G_u$ and $G_k$ is the fraction of entries in the adjacency matrix that has to be changed to make $G_u$ isomorphic to $G_k$. We study the problem of estimating, up to a constant additive factor, the graph isomorphism distance between two graphs in the query model. In other words, if $G_k$ is a known graph and $G_u$ is an unknown graph whose adjacency matrix has to be accessed by querying the entries, what is the query complexity for testing whether the graph isomorphism distance between $G_u$ and $G_k$ is less than $\gamma_1$ or more than $\gamma_2$, where $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ are two constants with $0\leq \gamma_1 &lt; \gamma_2 \leq 1$. It is also called the tolerant property testing of graph isomorphism in the dense graph model. The non-tolerant version (where $\gamma_1$ is $0$) has been studied by Fischer and Matsliah (SICOMP'08). 


In this paper, we study both the upper and lower bounds of tolerant graph isomorphism testing. We prove an upper bound of $\widetilde{{\cal O}}(n)$ for this problem. Our upper bound algorithm crucially uses the tolerant testing of the well studied Earth Mover Distance (EMD), as the main subroutine, in a slightly different setting from what is generally studied in property testing literature.


Testing tolerant EMD between two probability distributions is equivalent to testing EMD between two multi-sets, where the multiplicity of each element is taken appropriately, and we sample elements from the unknown multi-set with replacement. In this paper, our (main conceptual) contribution is to introduce the problem of tolerant EMD testing between multi-sets (over Hamming cube) when we get samples from the unknown multi-set without replacement and to show that this variant of tolerant testing of EMD is as hard as tolerant testing of graph isomorphism between two graphs. Thus, while testing of equivalence between distributions is at the heart of the non-tolerant testing of graph isomorphism, we are showing that the estimation of the EMD over a Hamming cube (when we are allowed to sample without replacement) is at the heart of 
tolerant graph isomorphism. We believe that the introduction of the problem of testing EMD between multi-sets (when we get samples without replacement) opens an entirely new direction in the world of testing properties of distributions.</summary>

<p><strong>Testing asymmetry in bounded degree graphs</strong>, by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/118/">ECCC</a>). This paper studies a natural graph property hitherto not considered in the property testing literature. Namely, the question of testing whether a graph is <em>asymmetric</em> or whether it is far from being asymmetric. A graph is said to be asymmetric if its automorphism group is trivial (that is, it only contains the identity permutation). One of the results in the paper says that this problem is easy in the dense graph model – which is a side result of the paper. This is because all dense graphs are \(O(\log n/n)\)-close to being asymmetric. To see this, the paper points out that a simple randomized process which takes \(G\) as input and returns an asymmetric graph by changing very few edges. This process asks you to do the following: Take a set \(S \subseteq V\) with \(|S| = O(\log n)\) nodes and replace the subgraph they induce with a random graph. Moreover,  randomize all the edges between \(S\) and \(V \setminus S\). What you can show is that in this modified graph, any automorphism (whp) will map \(S\) to itself. And all the remaining vertices behave (whp) in a unique manner which is peculiar to it. In particular, this means that any automorphism better not map a vertex \(v\) in \(V \setminus S\) to any other vertex in \(V \setminus S\). And this finishes the argument. The main result explores the bounded degree model. By a simple argument, you can show that testing asymmetry is easy if all the connected components have size \(s(n) \leq o\left(\frac{\log n}{\log {\log n}}\right)\). Thus, the challenging case is when you have some connected components of a larger size. In this case, what Goldreich shows is the following: If all the components have size at most \(s(n)\) where \(s(n) \geq \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log {\log n}}\right)\), then you can test asymmetry (with one-sided-error) in \(O(n^{1/2} \cdot s(n)/\epsilon)\) queries.  Moreover, the paper also shows a two-sided-lower bound of \(\Omega\left(n/s(n)\right)^{1/2}\) queries which holds as long as \(\epsilon \leq O(1/s(n)\). This leaves open the bounded degree question of determining the query complexity of testing asymmetry in the general case as the paper also points out.</p>

<p><strong>On testability of first order properties in Bounded degree graphs</strong>, by Isolde Adler, Noleen Köhler and Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05800.pdf">arXiv</a>). One of the well understood motivations for property testing begins in the following manner. Decision problems are typically hard to solve if they involve a universal quantifier — either \(\exists\) or  \(\forall\). One way around this hardness is to do the following ritual: relax the problem by dropping the universal quantifier, define a notion of distance between objects in your universe and ask a promise problem instead. Indeed, if you take your favorite property testing problem, you will note that it precisely fits in the template above. How about making this business more rigorous in bounded degree graph property model? This is precisely the content of this work which considers the face off between (First Order) logic and property testing in the bounded degree model. The authors show some interesting results. They begin by showing that in the bounded degree model, you can show that all first order graph properties which involve a single quantifier \(Q \in \{\forall, \exists\}\) are testable with constant query complexity.<br/>If you find this baffling, it would be good to remind yourself that not all graph properties can be expressed in the language of first order logic with a single quantifier! So, you can rest easy. The graph properties you know are not constant time testable are most assuredly not expressible with a single quantifier in First Order Logic. However, this work shows more. It turns out, that “any FO property that is defined by a formula with quantifier prefix \(\exists^* \forall^*\) is testable”. Moreover, there do exist FO graph properties defined by the quantifier prefix \(\forall^* \exists^*\) which are not testable. Thus, this work achieves results in the bounded degree model which are kind of analogous to the results in the dense graph model by Alon et al [1]. On a final note, I find the following one sentence summary of the techniques used to prove the lower bound rather intriguing: “[the paper] obtains the lower bound by a first-order formula that defines a class of bounded-degree expanders, based on zig-zag products of graphs.”  </p>

<p><strong>On graphs of bounded degree that are far from being Hamiltonian</strong>, by Isolde Adler and Noleen Köhler (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05801">arXiv</a>). This paper explores the question of testing Hamiltonicity in the bounded degree model. The main result of the paper is that Hamiltonicity is not testable with one-sided error with \(o(n)\) queries. PTReview readers might recall from our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1371">July Post</a> a concurrent paper by Goldriech [2] which achieves the same lower bound on query complexity in the two-sided error model (the authors call attention to [2] as well). One of the interesting feature of this result is that the lower bounds are obtained by an explicit deterministic reduction as opposed to the usual randomized reduction. Like the authors point out, this offers more insights into structural complexity of instances that are far from being Hamiltonian. We point out that this also differs from how the lower bound is derived in [2] — which is via local hardness reductions to a promise problem of 3 CNF satisfiability.</p>

<p><strong>An optimal tester for \(k\)-linear</strong>, by Nader Bshouty (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/123/">ECCC</a>). This paper explores two related questions. We call a function \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\) \(k\)-linear if it equals the \(\sum_{i \in S} x_i\) for some \(S \subseteq [n]\) of size exactly \(k\). A boolean function is said to be \(k\)-linear<strong>*</strong> if it is \(j\) linear for a fixed  \(j\) where \(j \in \{0,1,2, \cdots, k\}\). The paper proves the following theorems.</p>



<ol><li>There exists a non-adaptive <em>one-sided</em> distribution free tester for \(k\)-linear<strong>*</strong> with query complexity being \(O\left(k \log k + \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\). This matches the two-sided lower bound (where the underlying distribution is uniform) by Blais et al [3].</li><li>Using a reduction from \(k\)-linear<strong>*</strong> to \(k\)-linear, the paper shows one can obtain a non-adpative <em>two-sided</em> distribution free tester for \(k\)-linear with same query complexity as the above result. The lower bound from Blais et al applies here also (in fact, they prove a lower bound on \(k\)-linearity).</li><li>Next up, the paper has a couple of lower bound results to accompany this. One of these results reveals the price you pay for being <em>one-sided</em> and <em>exact</em> (that is, you insist on the function being exactly \(k\)-linear). Turns out, now you have a non-adaptive one-sided uniform distribution lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(k) \log n + \Omega(1/\varepsilon)\).  If you allow adaptivity instead, the paper shows a lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt k)\log n + \Omega(1/\varepsilon)\).</li></ol>

<p><strong>Amortized Edge Sampling</strong>, by Talya Eden, Saleet Mossel and Ronitt Rubinfeld (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08032">arXiv</a>). Consider the following setup. You are given query access to adjacency list of a graph \(G\) with \(n\) vertices and \(m\) edges. You can make degree queries and neighbor queries. Suppose I ask you to sample a single edge from this graph from a distribution that is pointwise \(\varepsilon\) close to the uniform distribution. Eden and Rosenbaum already showed how you can achieve this with a budget of \(\widetilde{\Theta}(n/\sqrt m)\) queries. Starting from this jump off point, the authors ask whether you can circumvent this lower bound if you want to return multiple samples from a distribution which is again pointwise close to uniform. The paper answers this question in the affirmative and shows that if you know the number of samples, \(q\), in advance you can get away with an amortized bound of \(O*(\sqrt q n/\sqrt m)\) on the total number of queries needed.</p>

<p><strong>On the High Accuracy Limitation of Adaptive Property Estimation</strong>, by Yanjun Han (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11964">arXiv</a>). Take a discrete distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) with support size \(k\) and consider the task of estimating some symmetric property of \(\mathcal{P}\) to a small \(\pm \varepsilon\) additive error. Here, a symmetric property refers to a “nice” functional defined over the probability simplex, i.e., it refers to functions \(F \colon \Delta_k \to \mathbb{R}\) where \(F(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} f(p_i)\) where \(f \colon (0,1) \to \mathbb{R}\). A naive attack to these estimation tasks goes through the following ritual: you get your hands on the empirical distribution, you plug it in \(F\) and you hope for the best. Turns out, you are out of luck if the function \(f\) is non-smooth and in these cases you end up with a suboptimal estimator. Previous works have also looked at more sophisticated estimators (like the <em>local moment matching or LMM and profile maximum likelihood or PML</em> estimator). Turns out, using the LMM or PML estimator leads to optimal sample complexity for a handful of symmetric properties (as long as \(\varepsilon \geq n^{-1/3}\)). This paper considers the question of what can you say for supersmall values of \(\varepsilon\) where \(n^{-1/2} \leq \varepsilon \leq n^{-1/3}\). (The \(n^{-1/2}\) appears because there are estimators that use the knowledge of \(f\) and \(\varepsilon\) can be driven all the way down to \(n^{-1/2}\) for these estimators). The paper focuses on estimators which do not exploit any structure in \(f\). In particular, the paper specializes this question to PML and shows a fundamental limitation on PML which means that the PML approach fails to be sample optimal for the entire range of \(\varepsilon\) and is sample optimal only for \(\varepsilon &gt;&gt; n^{-1/3}\) — which also confirms a conjecture of Han and Shiragur (and refutes a conjecture of Acharya et al. who postulated this is sample optimal for the entire range of \(\varepsilon\)).</p>

<p><strong>\(k\)-Forrelation Optimally Separates Quantum and Classical Query<br/>Complexity</strong>, by Nikhil Bansal and Makrand Sinha (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07003">arXiv</a>). Understanding the power of quantum query over classical queries is a well motivated problem with a rich history. One of the biggest questions in this area asks for the largest separation between classical and quantum query complexities. In a breakthrough, Aaronson and Ambainis [4] showed a fundamental simulation result which confirmed that you can simulate \(q\) quantum queries with \(O(N^{1 – 1/2q})\) classical queries in the randomized decision tree model of computation as long as \(q = O(1)\). In the same paper, the authors also showed that the standard <em>forrelation</em>* problem exhibits a \(1\) versus \(\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt n)\) separation. This means that for \(q = 1\), you essentially have optimal separation. But what about \(q &gt; 1\)? To this end, Aaronson and Ambainis conjectured that a certain problem which they called \(k\)-forrelation — which can be computed with \(q = k/2\) queries requires at least \(\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1-1/k})\) classical queries. The current work precisely confirms this conjecture.</p>



<p>(*) The forrelation problem asks you to decide whether one Boolean function is highly correlated with the Fourier transform of a second function.</p>



<p><em><strong>(Edit:</strong> Added Later)</em>  Simon Apers points out a paper by Shrestov, Storozhenko and Wu that we missed. (Thanks Simon)! Here is a brief report on that paper.<br/></p>



<p><strong>An optimal separation of randomized and quantum query complexity</strong> (by Alexander Shrestov, Andrey Storozhenko and Pei Wu)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10223">arXiv</a>) Similar to the paper by Bansal and Sinha [BS20] mentioned above, this paper also resolves the conjecture by Aaronson and Ambainis proving the same result. Like the paper also notes, the techniques in both of these works are completely different and incomparable. On the one hand [BS20] proves the separation for an explicit function as opposed to a function chosen uniformly at random from a certain set as considered in this work. On the other hand,  the separation result shown in [BS20] only applies when the query algorithm returns the correct answer with probability at least \(1/2 + 1/poly(\log n)\) — in contrast the results in this paper apply even when the query algorithm is required to have probability of correctness be a constant at least \(1/2\). In addition, this work also proves the \(\ell\)-Fourier weight conjecture of Tal which is of independent interest beyond quantum computing.</p>



<p/>



<p>So, it looks like all in all we had a great month with two concurrent papers both resolving Aaronson Ambainis conjecture (yet again after two concurrent papers on testing Hamiltonicity)!</p>

    <title>TR20-134 |  Tight Bounds on Sensitivity and Block Sensitivity of Some Classes of Transitive Functions | 

	Anna Gal, 

	Siddhesh Chaubal</title>
    <summary>Nisan and Szegedy conjectured that block sensitivity is at most
polynomial in sensitivity for any Boolean function.
Until a recent breakthrough of Huang, the conjecture had been
wide open in the general case,
and was proved only for a few special classes
of Boolean functions.
Huang's result implies that block sensitivity is at most
the 4th power of sensitivity for any Boolean function.
It remains open if a tighter relationship between
sensitivity and block sensitivity holds for arbitrary Boolean functions;
the largest known gap between these measures is quadratic.

We prove tighter bounds showing that block sensitivity is at most
3rd power, and in some cases at most square of sensitivity for
subclasses of transitive functions,
defined by various properties of their DNF (or CNF) representation.
Our results improve and extend previous results regarding
transitive functions. We obtain these results by
proving tight (up to constant factors) lower bounds on the
smallest possible sensitivity of functions in these classes.

In another line of research, it has also been examined what is the
smallest possible block sensitivity of transitive functions.
Our results yield tight (up to constant factors) lower bounds
on the block sensitivity of the classes we consider.</summary>

    <title>TR20-133 |  Query complexity lower bounds for local list-decoding and hard-core predicates (even for small rate and huge lists) | 

	Noga Ron-Zewi, 

	Ronen Shaltiel, 

	Nithin Varma</title>
    <summary>A binary code $\text{Enc}:\{0,1\}^k \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ is $(\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon,L)$-list decodable if for every $w \in \{0,1\}^n$, there exists a set $\text{List}(w)$ of size at most $L$, containing all messages $m \in \{0,1\}^k$ such that the relative Hamming distance between $\text{Enc}(m)$ and $w$ is at most $\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon$.
A $q$-query local list-decoder is a randomized procedure that when given oracle access to a string $w$, makes at most $q$ oracle calls, and for every message $m \in \text{List}(w)$, with high probability, there exists $j \in [L]$ such that for every $i \in [k]$, with high probability, $\text{Dec}^w(i,j)=m_i$.

We prove lower bounds on $q$, that apply even if $L$ is huge (say $L=2^{k^{0.9}}$) and the rate of $\text{Enc}$ is small (meaning that $n \ge 2^{k}$):

* For $\varepsilon = 1/k^{\nu}$ for some constant $\nu&gt;0$, we prove a lower bound of $q=\Omega(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$, where $\delta$ is the error probability of the local list-decoder. This bound is tight as there is a matching upper bound by Goldreich and Levin (STOC 1989) of $q=O(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\varepsilon^2})$ for the Hadamard code (which has $n=2^k$). This bound extends an earlier work of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) which only works if $n \le 2^{k^{\nu}}$ and the number of coins tossed by $\text{Dec}$ is small (and therefore does not apply to the Hadamard code, or other codes with low rate).

* For smaller $\varepsilon$, we prove a lower bound of roughly $q = \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\varepsilon}})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lower bound on the number of queries of local list-decoders that gives $q \ge k$ for small $\varepsilon$.

Local list-decoders with small $\varepsilon$ form the key component in the celebrated theorem of Goldreich and Levin that extracts a hard-core predicate from a one-way function.
We show that black-box proofs cannot improve the Goldreich-Levin theorem and produce a hard-core predicate that is hard to predict with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\ell^{\omega(1)}}$ when provided with a one-way function $f:\{0,1\}^{\ell} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^{\ell}$, such that circuits of size $\text{poly}(\ell)$ cannot invert $f$ with probability $\rho=1/2^{\sqrt{\ell}}$ (or even $\rho=1/2^{\Omega(\ell)}$). This limitation applies to any proof by black-box reduction (even if the reduction is allowed to use nonuniformity and has oracle access to $f$).</summary>

    <title>Eberhard’s theorem for bipartite polyhedra with one big face</title>
    <summary>Eberhard’s theorem is a topic in the combinatorial theory of convex polyhedra that once saw a lot of research, but has faded from more recent interest. It’s named after Victor Eberhard, a German mathematician from the late 19th and early 20th century who worked in geometry despite becoming blind at age 12 or 13. I find this hard to imagine, as my own research in geometry is based very heavily on visual thinking, but he was far from the only successful blind mathematician; Leonhard Euler, Lev Pontryagin, and Bernard Morin also come to mind, and there are more.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberhard%27s_theorem">Eberhard’s theorem</a> is a topic in the combinatorial theory of convex polyhedra that once saw a lot of research, but has faded from more recent interest. It’s named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Eberhard">Victor Eberhard</a>, a German mathematician from the late 19th and early 20th century who worked in geometry despite becoming blind at age 12 or 13. I find this hard to imagine, as my own research in geometry is based very heavily on visual thinking, but he was far from the only successful blind mathematician; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Pontryagin">Lev Pontryagin</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Morin">Bernard Morin</a> also come to mind, and there are more.</p>

<p>Anyway, Eberhard’s theorem concerns the following question. Suppose I tell you that a polyhedron has a certain number of faces of certain types. For instance, after Archimedes’ work on polytopes was lost, all we knew about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_solid">Archimedean solids</a> until their rediscovery in the Renaissance was a brief listing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria">Pappus of Alexandria</a> giving this information: there is one with 8 triangles and 6 squares, etc. How can we tell that these counts of faces actually determine a polyhedron?</p>

<p>The given information for Eberhard’s theorem, then, is just a collection of counts of face types (triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.), without specifying the exact shapes of these faces. The goal is to use these faces to build a simple polyhedron, one for which three edges meet at every vertex (like a cube, unlike an octahedron). One necessary condition for this to be possible is that the polyhedron must obey Euler’s polyhedral formula \(v-e+f=2\). And it’s easy to calculate the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces appearing in this formula, from the face counts. Plugging these numbers into Euler’s formula leads to a linear equation that the face counts must obey. Crucially, this linear equation omits the count of hexagons: adding or removing hexagons will not change whether Euler’s formula holds. What Eberhard’s theorem states is that, as long as the face counts obey Euler’s formula in this way, there is always some number of hexagons that can be added or removed so that the remaining faces will form a polyhedron.</p>

<p>However, calculating the fewest number of hexagons needed, or even determining whether a given number of faces of all types (including hexagons) can be put together into a polyhedron, remains somewhat mysterious. So I thought I’d play with a case that would be both simple enough to solve and still interesting: the bipartite simple polyhedra (famous from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnette%27s_conjecture">Barnette’s conjecture</a>), with one big face (a \(2n\)-gon for some \(n&gt;3\)), many small faces (\(n+3\) quadrilaterals, the number needed to make Euler’s formula hold), and a mysterious number of hexagons. What is the smallest number of hexagons that will allow the construction of a simple polyhedron with these face counts? The answer turns out to be \(\lfloor (3n-6)/2\rfloor\), achieved with polyhedra (or polyhedral graphs) in which the outer \(2n\)-gon surrounds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_graph">cactus tree</a> of 6-vertex cycles (and possibly one 4-vertex cycle), connected to each other by bridge edges:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Three hexagon-minimal bipartite simple polyhedra" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/eberhard.svg"/></p>

<p>The central cactus tree can be rearranged, as long as no two bridge edges have adjacent endpoints. For instance, in the graph with the dodecagon outer face, at the bottom of the figure, it’s possible for the middle six-vertex loop to have three connections to the outside polygon on one side and only one connection on the other side, or to have the four-vertex loop in the middle. But I can prove that all optimal solutions have the same overall central cactus tree structure.</p>

<p>I find it easier to think about the following equivalent rephrasing of the optimization problem: instead of finding a minimum number of hexagons that will allow us to build a polyhedron with those face counts, let’s build a polyhedron with one \(2n\)-gon face and the rest quadrilaterals and hexagons, and concentrate on minimizing the number of vertices in this polyhedron. The number of quadrilaterals will automatically come out right, and the number of hexagons will be minimized if the number of vertices is minimized.</p>

<p>Now suppose that we have any simple polyhedron with one \(2n\)-gon face and the rest quadrilaterals and hexagons. Remove the outer \(2n\)-gon from the graph, leaving a conncted subgraph, and look at the biconnected components of this subgraph. For any one component, its outer face in its induced planar embedding must be a simple cycle, with some vertices having degree two in the component (the endpoints of edges connecting the component to the rest of the graph) and some having degree three. If the component is a 4-cycle or 6-cycle, then all of its vertices have degree two. But if not, then at most four consecutive vertices of its outer cycle can have degree two, because they and the two vertices connected to them on both sides form part of the boundary of a face interior to the component, which can have at most six vertices. And the degree-three vertices of the outer cycle must come in consecutive pairs, which cannot be adjacent to the endpoints of bridge edges connecting to other biconnected components, because a degree-three vertex next to a bridge edge or next to two other degree-three vertices would combine with part of the outer \(2n\)-gon to form a face with seven or more vertices, and a degree-three vertex by itself would form a pentagon, neither of which is allowed.</p>

<p>So in a component that is not a 4-cycle or 6-cycle, the degree-two and degree-three vertices alternate around the outer cycle of the component in consecutive sequences of at most four and exactly two vertices. This implies that the number of degree-two vertices is even (because the whole cycle is even by bipartiteness) and that the number of degree-three vertices in the component (even just counting the ones on its boundary) is at least half of the number of degree-two vertices on its boundary. For the cactus trees that we’ve been using, on the other hand, the number of degree-three vertices in each cactus tree is strictly less than half of the number of degree-two vertices. So if we replace a whole non-cycle component by a cactus tree, we can get a graph with the same number of exposed degree-2 vertices, but fewer total vertices. After repeated replacement of biconnected components, at each step reducing the number of vertices, we would reach a state where the subgraph inside the \(2n\)-gon is a cactus tree. It might not meet the requirement that its bridge edges have nonadjacent endpoints, but it could always be rearranged to do so. And it might not be a cactus with at most one 4-cycle, but if not we could replace two 4-cycles by one 6-cycle and make it even smaller. So the only graphs that cannot be made smaller are the ones we started with, the cactus trees of 6-cycles and at most one 4-cycle, surrounded by an outer \(2n\)-gon.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We are excited to announce a new online seminar - IGAFIT Algorithmic Colloquium. This new event aims to integrate the European algorithmic community and keep it connected during the times of the pandemic. This online seminar will take place biweekly on Thursday at 14:00 CET, with the talks lasting for 45 minutes. Each talk will be followed by a networking and discussion session on topics related to the talk. We cordially invite all participants to this session. The meeting will be run on <a href="https://www.airmeet.com/e/55923fa0-eee9-11ea-8530-b3eab1e75816" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Airmeet</a>. More details on the event can be found on <a href="http://igafit.mimuw.edu.pl/?page_id=483786" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IGAFIT web page</a>.</p>



<p>The first talk will be held on the 1st of October 2020.</p>



<p>October 1, 2020<br/>Vera Traub, University of Bonn<br/>Title: An improved approximation algorithm for ATSP<br/>Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Svensson, Tarnawski, and Végh gave the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP). In this work we revisit their algorithm. While following their overall framework, we improve on each part of it.</p>



<p>Svensson, Tarnawski, and Végh perform several steps of reducing ATSP to more and more structured instances. We avoid one of their reduction steps (to irreducible instances) and thus obtain a simpler and much better reduction to vertebrate pairs. Moreover, we show that a slight variant of their algorithm for vertebrate pairs has a much smaller approximation ratio.</p>



<p>Overall we improve the approximation ratio from 506 to 22 + ε for any ε &gt; 0. We also improve the upper bound on the integrality ratio of the standard LP relaxation from 319 to 22.</p>



<p>This is joint work with Jens Vygen.</p>



<p>Other upcoming talks include:</p>



<p>October 15, 2020<br/>Thatchaphol Saranurak, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago<br/>Title: An almost-linear time deterministic algorithm for expander decomposition</p>



<p>October 29, 2020<br/>Nathan Klein, University of Bonn<br/>Title: A (Slightly) Improved Approximation Algorithm for Metric TSP</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">This month I will follow-up on last month blog post and look at another application of integration by parts, which is central to many interesting algorithms in machine learning, optimization and statistics. In this post, I will consider extensions in higher dimensions, where we take integrals on a subset of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and focus primarily on property of the so-called “score function” of a density \(p: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), namely the gradient of its logarithm: $$\nabla  \log  p(z)  = \frac{1}{p(z)} \nabla p(z) \in \mathbb{R}^d,$$ or, done coordinate by coordinate, $$ \big(\nabla \log p(z)\big)_i = \frac{\partial [ \log p]}{\partial z_i}(z) = \frac{1}{p(z)} \frac{\partial  p }{\partial z_i}(z) .$$ Note here that we take derivatives with respect to \(z\) and not with respect to some hypothetical external parameter, which is often the case in statistics (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_(statistics)">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">As I will show below, this quantity comes up in many different areas, most often used with integration by parts. After a short review on integration by parts and its applications to score functions, I will present four quite diverse applications, to (1) optimization and randomized smoothing, (2) differentiable perturbed optimizers, (3) learning single-index models in statistics, and (4) score matching for density estimation.</p>



<h2>Integration by parts in multiple dimensions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">I will focus only on situations where we have some random variable \(Z\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), with differentiable strictly positive density \(p(\cdot)\) with respect to the Lebesgue measure (I could also consider bounded supports, but then I would need to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem">divergence theorem</a>). I will consider a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), and my goal is to provide an expression of \(\mathbb{E} \big[ f(Z) \nabla \log p(Z) \big] \in \mathbb{R}^d\) using the gradient of \(f\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming that \(f(z) p(z)\) goes to zero when \(\| z\| \to +\infty\), we have: $$\mathbb{E} \big[ f(Z) \nabla \log p(Z) \big]  = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(z)\Big( \frac{1}{p(z)} \nabla p (z) \Big) p(z) dz = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}  f (z) \nabla p(z) dz .$$ We can then use integration by parts (together with the zero limit at infinity), to get $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f (z) \nabla p(z) dz = \ – \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} p (z) \nabla f(z) dz.$$ This leads to $$\mathbb{E} \big[ f(Z) \nabla \log p(Z) \big] =\  – \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla f(Z) \big]. \tag{1}$$ In other words, expectations of the gradient of \(f\) can be obtained through expectations of \(f\) times the negative of the score function.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that Eq. (1) can be used in the two possible directions: to estimate the right hand side (expectation of gradients) when the score function is known, and vice-versa to estimate expectations (as a simple example, when \(f\) is constant equal to one, we get the traditional identity \(\mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla \log p(Z) \big] = 0\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gaussian distribution.</strong> Assuming that \(p(z) = \frac{1}{(2\pi \sigma^2)^{d/2}} \exp\big( – \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}\|  z – \mu\|_2^2 \big)\), that is, \(Z\) is normally distributed with mean vector \(\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d\) and covariance matrix \(\sigma^2 I\), we get a particularly simple expression $$\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \mathbb{E} \big[ f(Z) (Z-\mu)  \big] =  \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla f(Z) \big],$$ which is often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein%27s_lemma">Stein’s lemma</a> (see for example an application to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stein%27s_unbiased_risk_estimate">Stein’s unbiased risk estimation</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Vector extension.</strong> If now \(f\) has values in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), still with the product \(f(z) p(z)\) going to zero when \(\| z\| \to +\infty\), we get $$\mathbb{E} \big[ f(Z)^\top \nabla \log p(Z) \big] =\ – \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla \!\cdot \! f(Z) \big], \tag{2}$$ where \(\nabla\! \cdot \! f\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence">divergence</a> of \(f\) defined as \(\displaystyle \nabla\! \cdot\! f(z) = \sum_{i=1}^d \frac{\partial f}{\partial z_i}(z)\). </p>



<h2>Optimization and randomized smoothing</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\), which is  non-differentiable everywhere. There are several ways of <em>smoothing</em> it. A very traditional way is to convolve it with a smooth function. In our context, this corresponds to considering $$f_\varepsilon(x) = \mathbb{E} f(x+ \varepsilon Z) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(x+\varepsilon z) p(z) dz,$$ where \(z\) is a random variable with strictly positive sufficiently differentiable density, and \(\varepsilon \) is a positive parameter. Typically, if \(f\) is Lipschitz-continuous, \(| f – f_\varepsilon|\) is uniformly bounded by a constant times \(\varepsilon\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Let us now assume that we can take gradients within the integral, leading to: $$\nabla f_\varepsilon(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}   \nabla f(x+\varepsilon z) p(z) dz = \mathbb{E} \big[  \nabla f(x+\varepsilon z) \big].$$ This derivation is problematic as the whole goal is to apply this to functions \(f\) which are not everywhere differentiable, so the gradient \(\nabla f\) is not always defined. It turns out that when \(p\) is sufficiently differentiable, integration by parts exactly provides an expression which does not imply the gradient of \(f\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Indeed, still imagining that \(f\) is differentiable, we can apply Eq. (1) to the function \(z \mapsto \frac{1}{\varepsilon} f(x+\varepsilon z)\), whose gradient is the function \(z \mapsto \nabla f(x+\varepsilon z)\), and get $$\nabla f_\varepsilon(x) = \ – \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(x+\varepsilon z) \nabla p(z) dz = \frac{1}{\varepsilon} \mathbb{E} \big[ – f(x+\varepsilon Z) \nabla \log p(Z)\big].$$ These computations can easily be made rigorous and we obtain an expression of the gradient of \(f_\varepsilon\) without invoking the gradient of \(f\) (see [<a href="http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~tewaria/research/abernethy16perturbation.pdf">23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08676">14</a>] for details).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, if \(p\) is a differentiable function, we can expect the expectation in the right hand side of the equation above to be bounded, and therefore the function \(f_\varepsilon\) has gradients bounded by \(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This can be used within (typically convex) optimization in two ways:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Zero-th order optimization</strong>: if our goal is to minimize the function \(f\), which is non-smooth, and for which we only have access to function values (so-called “zero-th order oracle), then we can obtain an unbiased stochastic gradient of the smoothed version \(f_\varepsilon\) as \(– f(x+\varepsilon z) \nabla \log p(z)\) where \(z\) is sampled from \(p\). The variance of the stochastic gradient grows with \(1/\varepsilon\) and the bias due to the use of \(f_\varepsilon\) instead of \(f\) is proportional to \(\varepsilon\). There is thus a sweet spot for the choice of \(\varepsilon\), with many variations; see, e.g., [<a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/redir.pf?u=http%3A%2F%2Fuclouvain.be%2Fcps%2Fucl%2Fdoc%2Fcore%2Fdocuments%2Fcoredp2011_1web.pdf;h=repec:cor:louvco:2011001">5</a>, <a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=ppi&amp;paperid=605&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">6</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0408007">7</a>]. </li><li><strong>Randomized smoothing with acceleration</strong> [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/110831659">8</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0665">9</a>]: Here the goal is to follow the “Nesterov smoothing” idea [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">10</a>] and minimize a non-smooth function \(f\) using accelerated gradient descent on the smoothed version \(f_\varepsilon\), but this time with a stochastic gradient. Stochastic versions of Nesterov accelerations are then needed; this is useful when a full deterministic smoothing of \(f\) is too costly, see [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/xiao10a/xiao10a.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-010-0434-y.pdf">12</a>] for details.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Example.</strong> We consider minimizing a quadratic function in two dimensions, and we compare below plain gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (left) and zero-th order optimization where we take a step towards the direction \(– f(x+\varepsilon Z) \nabla \log p(Z)\) for a standard normal \(Z\). We compare stochastic zero-th order optimization to plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD) below: SGD is a first-order method requiring access to stochastic gradients with a variance that is bounded, while zero-th order optimization only requires function values, but with significantly higher variance and thus requiring more iterations to converge.</p>

Right: zero-th order optimization. All with constant step-sizes.</figure></div>



<h2>Differentiable perturbed optimizers</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The randomized smoothing technique can be used in a different context with applications to differentiable programming. We now assume that the function \(f\) can be written as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_function">support function</a> of a polytope \(\mathcal{C}\), that is, for all \(u \in \mathbb{R}^d\), $$f(u) = \max_{y \in \mathcal{C}} u^\top y,$$ where \(\mathcal{C}\) is the convex hull of a finite family \((y_i)_{i \in I}\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-4598" height="292" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/polytope_intro-1024x842.png" width="357"/>Polytope \(C\), convex hull of 8 vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Typically, the family is very large (e.g., \(|I|\) is exponential in \(d\)), but a polynomial-time algorithm exists for computing an arg-max \(y^\ast(u)\) above. Classical examples, from simpler to more interesting, are:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Simplex</strong>: \(\mathcal{C}\) is the set of vectors with non-negative components that sum to one, and is the convex hull of canonical basis vectors. Then \(f\) is the maximum function, and there are many classical ways of smoothing it (see link with the <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-gumbel-trick/">Gumbel trick</a> below).</li><li><strong>Hypercube</strong>: \(\mathcal{C} = [0,1]^n\), which is the convex hull of all vectors in \(\{0,1\}^n\). The maximization of linear functions can then be done independently for each bit.</li><li><strong>Permutation matrices</strong>: \(\mathcal{C}\) is then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birkhoff_polytope">Birkhoff polytope</a>, the convex hull of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_matrix">permutation matrices</a> (square matrices with elements in \(\{0,1\}\), and with exactly a single \(1\) in each row and column). Maximizing linear functions is the classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">linear assignment problem</a>.</li><li><strong>Shortest paths</strong>: given a graph, a path is a sequence of vertices which are connected to each other in the graph. They can classically be represented as a vector of of 0’s and 1’s indicating the edges which are followed by the paths. Minimizing linear functions is then equivalent to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem">shortest path</a> problems.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In many supervised applications, the vector \(u\) is as a function of some input \(x\) and some parameter vector \(\theta\). In order to learn the pararameter \(\theta\) from data, one needs to be able to differentiate with respect to \(\theta\), and this is typically done through the chain rule by differentiating \(y^\ast(u)\) with respect to \(u\). There come two immediate obstacles: (1) the element \(y^\ast(u)\) is not even well-defined when the arg-max is not unique, which is not a real problem because this can only be the case for a set of \(u\)’s with zero Lebesgue measure; and (2) the function \(y^\ast(u)\) is locally constant for most \(u\)’s, that is, the gradient is equal to zero almost everywhere. Thus, in the context of differentiable programming, this is non informative and essentially useless.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Randomized smoothing provides a simple and generic way to define an approximation which is differentiable and with informative gradient everywhere (there are others, such as adding a strongly convex regularizer \(\psi(y)\), and maximizing \(u^\top y\  – \psi(y)\) instead, see [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/niculae18a/niculae18a.pdf">20</a>] for details. See also [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkevoJSYPB">24</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain a differentiable function through randomized smoothing, we can consider \(y^\ast(u + \varepsilon z)\), for a random \(z\), which is an instance of the more general “perturb-and-MAP” paradigm [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126242">21</a>, <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2012/papers/528.pdf">22</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Since \(y^\ast(u)\) is a subgradient of \(f\) at \(u\) and \(f_\varepsilon(u) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} f(u+\varepsilon z) p(z) dz\), by swapping integration (with respect to \(z\)) and differentiation (with respect to \(u\)), we have the following identities: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ y^\ast(u + \varepsilon Z) \big] = \nabla f_\varepsilon(u),$$ that is, the expectation of the perturbed arg-max is the gradient of the smoothed function \(f_\varepsilon\). I will use the notation \(y^\ast_\varepsilon(u) =\mathbb{E} \big[ y^\ast(u + \varepsilon Z) \big]\) to denote this gradient; see an illustration below.</p>

The expected perturbed maximizer \(y^\ast_\varepsilon(u)\) is in the interior of \(\mathcal{C}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In a joint work with Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel, Oliver Teboul, Marco Cuturi, and Jean-Philippe Vert [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08676(opens in a new tab)">14</a>], we detail theoretical and practical properties of \(y^\ast_\varepsilon(u)\), in particular:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Estimation: \(y^\ast_\varepsilon(u)\) can be estimated by replacing the expectation by empirical averages.</li><li>Differentiability: if \(Z\) has a strictly positive density over \(\mathbb{R}^d\), then the function \(y^\ast_\varepsilon\) is infinitely differentiable, with simple expression of  the Jacobian, obtained by integration by parts (see [<a href="http://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~tewaria/research/abernethy16perturbation.pdf">23</a>] for details).</li><li>The <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-gumbel-trick/">Gumbel trick</a> is the simplest instance of such a smoothing technique, with \(\mathcal{C}\) being the simplex, and \(Z\) having independent Gumbel distributions.

<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration</strong>. Following [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BkevoJSYPB">24</a>], this can be applied to learn the travel costs in graphs based on features. The vectors \(y_i\) represent shortest path between the top-left and bottom-right corners, with costs corresponding to the terrain type. See [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08676">14</a>] for details on the learning procedure. Here I just want to highlight the effect of varying the amount of smoothing characterized by \(\varepsilon\).</p>

<h2>Learning single-index models</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a random vector \((X,Y) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\), we assume that \(Y = f(X) + \varepsilon\), where \(f(x) = \sigma(w^\top x)\) for some unknown function \(\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\), with \(\varepsilon\) a zero-mean noise independent from \(X\).  Given some observations \((x_1,y_1), \dots, (x_n,y_n)\) in \(\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\), the goal is to estimate the direction \(w \in \mathbb{R}^d\). This model is referred to as single-index regression models in the statistics literature [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1913713.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3035585.pdf">2</a>]</p>



<p class="justify-text">One possibility if \(\sigma\) was known would be to perform least-squares estimation and minimize with respect to \(w\) $$ \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big( y_i\  – \sigma(w^\top x_i) \big)^2, $$ which is a non-convex optimization problem in general. When \(\sigma\) is unknown, one could imagine adding the estimation of \(\sigma\) into the optimization, making it even more complicated.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Score functions provide an elegant solution that leads to the “average derivative method” (ADE) [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1914309.pdf">3</a>], which I will now describe. We consider \(p\) the density of \(X\). We then have, using Eq. (1): $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ Y \nabla \log p(X) \big] =\mathbb{E} \big[ f(X) \nabla \log p(X) \big] = \ – \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla f(X)  \big] =\ –  \Big( \mathbb{E} \big[ \sigma'(w^\top X) \big] \Big) w, $$ which is proportional to \(w\). When replacing the expectation by an empirical mean, this provides a way to estimate \(w\) (up to a constant factor) without even knowing the function \(\sigma\), but assuming the density of \(X\) is known so that the score function is available.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Extensions.</strong> The ADE method can be extended in a number of ways to deal with more complex situations. Here are some examples below:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Multiple index models</em>: if the response/output \(Y\) is instead assumed of the form $$ Y = f(X) + \varepsilon =  \sigma(W^\top x) + \varepsilon, $$ where \(W \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}\) is a matrix with \(k\) columns, we obtained a “multiple index model”, for which a similar technique seems to apply since now \(\nabla f(x) = W \nabla  \sigma(W^\top x) \in \mathbb{R}^d\), and thus, for the assumed model \(\mathbb{E} \big[ Y \nabla \log p(X) \big]\) is in the linear span of the columns of \(W\); this is not enough for recovering the entire subspace if \(k&gt;1\) because we have only a single element of the span. There are two solutions for this. The first one is is to condition on some values of \(Y\) being in some set \(\mathcal{Y}\), where one can show that \(\mathbb{E} \big[ Y \nabla \log p(X) | Y \in \mathcal{Y} \big]\) is also in the desired subspace; thus, with several sets \(\mathcal{Y}\), one can generate several elements, and after \(k\) of these, one can expect to estimate the full \(k\)-dimensional subspace. The idea of conditioning on \(Y\) is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliced_inverse_regression">sliced inverse regression</a> [<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2290563.pdf">15</a>], and the application to score function can be found in [<a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ejs/1526889626">16</a>]. The second one is to consider higher-order moments and derivatives of the score functions, that is, using integration by parts twice! (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.2863">17</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-1344-8_34">18</a>, <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.ejs/1526889626">16</a>] for details).</li><li><em>Neural networks</em>: when the function \(\sigma\) is the sum of functions that depends on single variables, multiple-index models are exactly one-hidden-layer neural networks. Similar techniques can be used for deep networks with more than a single hidden layer (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08473">19</a>]).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Moment matching vs. empirical risk minimization. </strong>In all cases mentioned above, the use of score functions can be seen as an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_moments_(statistics)">method of moments</a>: we assume a specific model for the data, derive identities satisfied by expectations of some functions under the model, and use these identities to identify a parameter vector. In the situations above, direct empirical risk minimization would lead to a potentially hard optimization problem. However, moment matching techniques rely heavily on the model being well-specified, which is often not the case in practice, while empirical risk minimization techniques try to fit the data as much as the model allows, and is thus typically more robust to model misspecification.</p>



<h2>Score matching for density estimation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the problem of density estimation. That is, given some observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n \in \mathbb{R}^d\) sampled independently and identically distributed from some distribution with density \(p\), we want to estimate \(p\) from the data. Given a model \(q_\theta \) with some parameters \(\theta\), the most standard method is maximum likelihood estimation, which corresponds to the following optimization problem: $$\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log q_\theta(x_i).$$ It requires <em>normalized</em> densities that is, \(\int_{\mathbb{R}^d} q_\theta(x) dx = 1\), and dealing with normalized densities often requires to explicitly normalize them and thus to compute integrals, which is difficult when the underlying dimension \(d\) gets large.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Score matching is a recent method proposed by Aapo Hyvärinen [4] based on score functions. The simple (yet powerful) idea is to perform least-squares estimation on the score functions. That is, in the population case, the goal is to minimize $$\mathbb{E} \big\| \nabla \log p(X) \ – \nabla  \log q_\theta(X) \big\|_2^2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \big\| \nabla \log p(x)\  – \nabla  \log q_\theta(x) \big\|_2^2 p(x) dx.$$ Apparently, this expectation does not lead to an estimation procedure where \(p(x)\) is replaced by the empirical distribution of the data because of the presence of \(\nabla \log p(x)\). Integration by parts will solve this.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can expand \(\mathbb{E} \big\| \nabla \log p(X) \ – \nabla \log q_\theta(X) \big\|_2^2\) as  $$ \mathbb{E} \big\| \nabla \log p(X) \|_2^2 + \mathbb{E} \big\|\nabla \log q_\theta(X) \big\|_2^2 – 2 \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla \log p(X)^\top \nabla \log q_\theta(X) \big]. $$ The first term is independent of \(q_\theta\) so it does not count when minimizing. The second term is an expectation with respect to \(p(\cdot)\) so it can be replaced by the empirical mean. The third term can be dealt with with integration by parts, that is Eq. (2), leading to: $$ – 2 \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla \log p(X)^\top \nabla \log q_\theta(X) \big] = 2 \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q_\theta(X) \big] = 2 \mathbb{E} \big[ \Delta \log q_\theta(X) \big],$$ where \(\Delta\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_operator">Laplacian</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now have an expectation with respect to the data distribution \(p\), and we can replace the expectation with an empirical average to estimate the parameter \(\theta\) from data \(x_1,\dots,x_n\). We then use the cost function $$\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big\|\nabla \log q_\theta(x_i) \big\|_2^2 + \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta \log q_\theta(x_i), $$ which is linear in \(\log q_\theta\). Hence, when the unnormalized log-density is linearly parameterized, which is common, we obtain a quadratic problem. This procedure has a number of attractive properties, in particular consistency [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/hyvarinen05a/hyvarinen05a.pdf">4</a>], but the key benefit is to allow estimation without requiring normalizing constants.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Overall, the simple identity from Eq. (1), that is, \(\mathbb{E} \big[ f(Z) \nabla \log p(Z) \big] =\ – \mathbb{E} \big[ \nabla f(Z) \big]\), has many applications in diverse somewhat unrelated areas of machine learning, optimization and statistics. There are of course many other uses of integration by parts within this field. Feel free to add your preferred one as comment.</p>

    <title>TR20-132 |  Towards Stronger Counterexamples to the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture | 

	Arkadev Chattopadhyay, 

	Ankit Garg, 

	Suhail Sherif</title>
    <summary>We give improved separations for the query complexity analogue of the log-approximate-rank conjecture i.e. we show that there are a plethora of total Boolean functions on $n$ input bits, each of which has approximate Fourier sparsity at most $O(n^3)$ and randomized parity decision tree complexity $\Theta(n)$. This improves upon the recent work of Chattopadhyay, Mande and Sherif (JACM '20) both qualitatively (in terms of designing a large number of examples) and quantitatively (improving the gap from quartic to cubic). We leave open the problem of proving a randomized communication complexity lower bound for XOR compositions of our examples. A linear lower bound would lead to new and improved refutations of the log-approximate-rank conjecture. Moreover, if any of these compositions had even a sub-linear cost randomized communication protocol, it would demonstrate that randomized parity decision tree complexity does not lift to randomized communication complexity in general (with the XOR gadget).</summary>

    <title>TR20-131 |  A Direct Product Theorem for One-Way Quantum Communication | 

	Srijita Kundu, 

	Rahul  Jain</title>
    <summary>We prove a direct product theorem for the one-way entanglement-assisted quantum communication complexity of a general relation $f\subseteq\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\times\mathcal{Z}$. For any $\varepsilon, \zeta &gt; 0$ and any $k\geq1$, we show that
\[ \mathrm{Q}^1_{1-(1-\varepsilon)^{\Omega(\zeta^6k/\log|\mathcal{Z}|)}}(f^k) = \Omega\left(k\left(\zeta^5\cdot\mathrm{Q}^1_{\varepsilon + 12\zeta}(f) - \log\log(1/\zeta)\right)\right),\]
where $\mathrm{Q}^1_{\varepsilon}(f)$ represents the one-way entanglement-assisted quantum communication complexity of $f$ with worst-case error $\varepsilon$ and $f^k$ denotes $k$ parallel instances of $f$.

As far as we are aware, this is the first direct product theorem for quantum communication -- direct sum theorems were previously known for one-way quantum protocols. Our techniques are inspired by the parallel repetition theorems for the entangled value of two-player non-local games, under product distributions due to Jain, Pereszl\'{e}nyi and Yao, and under anchored distributions due to Bavarian, Vidick and Yuen, as well as message-compression for quantum protocols due to Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen. In particular, we show that a direct product theorem holds for the distributional one-way quantum communication complexity of $f$ under any distribution $q$ on $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}$ that is anchored on one side, i.e., there exists a $y^*$ such that $q(y^*)$ is constant and $q(x|y^*) = q(x)$ for all $x$. This allows us to show a direct product theorem for general distributions, since for any relation $f$ and any distribution $p$ on its inputs, we can define a modified relation $\tilde{f}$ which has an anchored distribution $q$ close to $p$, such that a protocol that fails with probability at most $\varepsilon$ for $\tilde{f}$ under $q$ can be used to give  a protocol that fails with probability at most $\varepsilon + \zeta$ for $f$ under $p$.

Our techniques also work for entangled non-local games which have input distributions anchored on any one side, i.e., either there exists a $y^*$ as previously specified, or there exists an $x^*$ such that $q(x^*)$ is constant and $q(y|x^*) = q(y)$ for all $y$. In particular, we show that for any game $G = (q, \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}, V)$ where $q$ is a distribution on $\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}$ anchored on any one side with anchoring probability $\zeta$, then
\[ \omega^*(G^k) = \left(1 - (1-\omega^*(G))^5\right)^{\Omega\left(\frac{\zeta^2 k}{\log(|\mathcal{A}|\cdot|\mathcal{B}|)}\right)}\]
where $\omega^*(G)$ represents the entangled value of the game $G$. This is a generalization of the result of Bavarian, Vidick and Yuen, who proved a parallel repetition theorem for games anchored on both sides, i.e., where both a special $x^*$ and a special $y^*$ exist, and potentially a simplification of their proof.</summary>

    <title>TR20-130 |  Optimal Inapproximability of Satisfiable k-LIN over Non-Abelian Groups | 

	Amey Bhangale, 

	Subhash Khot</title>
    <summary>A seminal result of H\r{a}stad [J. ACM, 48(4):798–859, 2001]  shows that it is NP-hard to find an assignment that satisfies $\frac{1}{|G|}+\varepsilon$ fraction of the constraints of a given $k$-LIN instance over an abelian group, even if there is an assignment that satisfies $(1-\varepsilon)$ fraction of the constraints, for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$.  Engebretsen et al. [Theoretical Computer Science, 312(1):17–45, 2004] later showed that the same hardness result holds for $k$-LIN instances over any finite non-abelian group.

Unlike the abelian case, where we can efficiently find a solution if the instance is satisfiable, in the non-abelian case, it is NP-complete to decide if a given system of linear equations is satisfiable or not, as shown by Russell and Goldmann [Information and Computation, 178(1):253–262, 2002].  

Surprisingly, for certain non-abelian groups $G$, given a satisfiable $k$-LIN instance over $G$, one can in fact do better than just outputting a random assignment using a simple but clever algorithm. The approximation factor achieved by this algorithm varies with the underlying group. In this paper, we show that this algorithm is {\em optimal} by proving a  tight hardness of approximation of satisfiable $k$-LIN instance over {\em any} non-abelian $G$, assuming $P \neq NP$.

As a corollary, we also get $3$-query probabilistically checkable proofs with perfect completeness over large alphabets with improved soundness.</summary>
