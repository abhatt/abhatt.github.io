    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: justify;">Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dream is not becoming reality, sort of.  The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Ink-Paperlike-13-3-Monitor/dp/B07GWGFW1B/ref=asc_df_B07GWGFW1B/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=309743296044&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4273202700836301476&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9002067&amp;hvtargid=pla-571127059636&amp;psc=1">Dasung E-ink monitor </a>has no backlight and instead reportedly uses electric flows to move ink droplets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some consideration, spending yet more hours reading reviews online and watching youtube videos about it sealed the deal.  I shelled out $1300 and bought the thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have had it for a few days now and I am sort of happy. I went from using a giant 30-inch monitor far away (my theory for avoiding eye strain) to using a ~13-inch monitor at pretty much the same distance as reading a book. I had to avoid sunlight, now I seek it (see the picture).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="20190307_094550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/20190307_094550.jpg?w=640"/></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monitor makes your computer look like Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen from the 80’s. The refresh is slow, and there is a ghosting effect, meaning there are shadows of previous images — which you can clear out. Also, it’s 4:3 instead of 16:9, which is a pain because it means I have to change resolution when I am forced to use my other monitor (for example if I have to check colors — the screen is gray-scale, did I mention that?). It makes browsing the internet quite painful, which is a nice side effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to advice, I am using it as my primary monitor. I am sort of happy with it and don’t regret buying it. I have started writing and reading papers with it and it’s working well enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think as soon as the technology improves the market for these things will be huge.  Already having a 17″ monitor in 16:9 ratio, ideally touch-screen, even if gray scale, would be a dream come true.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 1993, the science writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horgan_(journalist)">John Horgan</a>—who’s best known for his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Science-Knowledge-Twilight-Scientific/dp/0465065929">The End of Science</a></em>, and (of course) for <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">interviewing me in 2016</a>—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for <em>Scientific American</em> entitled <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e56/c6fea76922082400dfc6e13a3a169ae7b9a6.pdf">“The Death of Proof.”</a>  Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was undergoing a fundamental change, with traditional deductive proofs being replaced by a combination of non-rigorous numerical simulations, machine-generated proofs, probabilistic and probabilistically-checkable proofs, and proofs using graphics and video.  Horgan also suggested that Andrew Wiles’s then-brand-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">proof</a> of Fermat’s Last Theorem—which might have looked, at first glance, like a spectacular counterexample to the “death of proof” thesis—could be the “last gasp of a dying culture” and a “splendid anachronism.”  Apparently, “The Death of Proof” garnered one of the largest volumes of angry mail in <em>Scientific American</em>‘s history, with mathematician after mathematician arguing that Horgan had strung together half-digested quotes and vignettes to manufacture a non-story.</p>



<p>Now Horgan—who you could variously describe as a wonderful sport, or a ham, or a sucker for punishment—has written a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">26-year retrospective</a> on his “death of proof” article.  The prompt for this was Horgan’s recent discovery that, back in the 90s, David Hoffman and Hermann Karcher, two mathematicians annoyed by the “death of proof” article, had named a nonexistent mathematical object after its author.  The so-called <em><a href="https://minimalsurfaces.blog/home/repository/non-existent-surfaces/the-horgan-surface/">Horgan surface</a></em> is a minimal surface that numerical computations strongly suggested should exist, but that can be rigorously proven not to exist after all.  “The term was intended as an insult, but I’m honored anyway,” Horgan writes.</p>



<p>As a followup to his blog post, Horgan then decided to solicit commentary from various people he knew, including yours truly, about “how proofs are faring in an era of increasing computerization.”  He wrote, “I’d love to get a paragraph or two from you.”  Alas, I didn’t have the time to do as requested, but only to write <i>eight</i> paragraphs.  So Horgan suggested that I make the result into a post on my own blog, which he’d then link to.  Without further ado, then:</p>



<hr/>



<p>John, I like you so I hate to say it, but the last quarter century has not been kind to your thesis about “the death of proof”!  Those mathematicians sending you the irate letters had a point: there’s been no fundamental change to mathematics that deserves such a dramatic title.  Proof-based math remains quite healthy, with (e.g.) a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">Poincaré conjecture</a> since your article came out, as well as to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05363">Erdős discrepancy problem</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem">Kadison-Singer conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture">Catalan’s conjecture</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.998&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">bounded gaps in primes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">testing primality in deterministic polynomial time</a>, etc. — just to pick a few examples from the tiny subset of areas that I know anything about.</p>



<p>There are evolutionary changes to mathematical practice, as there always have been.  Since 2009, the website <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a> has let mathematicians query the global hive-mind about an obscure reference or a recalcitrant step in a proof, and get near-instant answers.  Meanwhile <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/">“polymath” projects</a> have, with moderate success, tried to harness blogs and other social media to make advances on long-standing open math problems using massive collaborations.</p>



<p>While humans remain in the driver’s seat, there are persistent efforts to increase the role of computers, with some notable successes.  These include Thomas Hales’s 1998 computer-assisted proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Kepler Conjecture</a> (about the densest possible way to pack oranges) — now fully machine-verified from start to finish, after <del>the </del><em><del>Annals of Mathematics</del></em><del> refused to publish a mixture of traditional mathematics and computer code</del> (seems this is not exactly what happened; see the comment section for more).  It also includes William McCune’s 1996 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_algebra">Robbins Conjecture</a> in algebra (the computer-generated <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/eqp-theorem.proof.txt">proof</a> was only half a page, but involved substitutions so strange that for 60 years no human had found them); and at the “opposite extreme,” the 2016 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">Pythagorean triples problem</a> by Marijn Heule and collaborators, which weighed in at 200 terabytes (at that time, “the longest proof in the history of mathematics”).</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that someday, computers will replace humans at all aspects of mathematical research — but it’s also conceivable that, by the time they can do that, they’ll be able to replace humans at music and science journalism and everything else!</p>



<p><a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/proofs.ppt">New notions of proof</a> — including probabilistic, interactive, zero-knowledge, and even quantum proofs — have seen further development by theoretical computer scientists since 1993.  So far, though, these new types of proof remain either entirely theoretical (as with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01664">quantum proofs</a>), or else they’re used for cryptographic protocols but not for mathematical research.  (For example, zero-knowledge proofs now play a major role in certain cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash">Zcash</a>.)</p>



<p>In many areas of math (including my own, theoretical computer science), proofs have continued to get longer and harder for any one person to absorb.  This has led some to advocate a split approach, wherein human mathematicians would talk to each other only about the handwavy intuitions and high-level concepts, while the tedious verification of details would be left to computers.  So far, though, the huge investment of time needed to write proofs in machine-checkable format — for almost no return in new insight — has prevented this approach’s wide adoption.</p>



<p>Yes, there are non-rigorous approaches to math, which continue to be widely used in physics and engineering and other fields, as they always have been.  But none of these approaches have displaced proof as the gold standard whenever it’s available.  If I had to speculate about why, I’d say: if you use non-rigorous approaches, then even if it’s clear to you under what conditions your results can be trusted, it’s probably much less clear to others.  Also, even if only one segment of a research community cares about rigor, whatever earlier work that segment builds on will need to be rigorous as well — thereby exerting constant pressure in that direction.  Thus, the more collaborative a given research area becomes, the more important is rigor.</p>



<p>For my money, the elucidation of the foundations of mathematics a century ago, by Cantor, Frege, Peano, Hilbert, Russell, Zermelo, Gödel, Turing, and others, still stands as one of the greatest triumphs of human thought, up there with evolution or quantum mechanics or anything else.  It’s true that the ideal set by these luminaries remains mostly aspirational.  When mathematicians say that a theorem has been “proved,” they still mean, as they always have, something more like: “we’ve reached a social consensus that all the ideas are now in place for a strictly formal proof that could be verified by a machine … with the only task remaining being massive rote coding work that none of us has any intention of ever doing!”  It’s also true that mathematicians, being human, are subject to the full panoply of foibles you might expect: claiming to have proved things they haven’t, squabbling over who proved what, accusing others of lack of rigor while hypocritically taking liberties themselves.  But just like love and honesty remain fine ideals no matter how often they’re flouted, so too does mathematical rigor.</p>

    <title>Entropy Trees and Range-Minimum Queries In Optimal Average-Case Space</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1551916800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Munro:J=_Ian.html">J. Ian Munro</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wild:Sebastian.html">Sebastian Wild</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02533">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The range-minimum query (RMQ) problem is a fundamental data structuring task
with numerous applications. Despite the fact that succinct solutions with
worst-case optimal $2n+o(n)$ bits of space and constant query time are known,
it has been unknown whether such a data structure can be made adaptive to the
reduced entropy of random inputs (Davoodi et al. 2014). We construct a succinct
data structure with the optimal $1.736n+o(n)$ bits of space on average for
random RMQ instances, settling this open problem.
</p>
<p>Our solution relies on a compressed data structure for binary trees that is
of independent interest. It can store a (static) binary search tree generated
by random insertions in asymptotically optimal expected space and supports many
queries in constant time. Using an instance-optimal encoding of subtrees, we
furthermore obtain a "hyper-succinct" data structure for binary trees that
improves upon the ultra-succinct representation of Jansson, Sadakane and Sung
(2012).

    <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Motion Planning for Snake-Like Robots</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1551916800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gupta:Siddharth.html">Siddharth Gupta</a>, Guy Sa'ar, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/z/Zehavi:Meirav.html">Meirav Zehavi</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.02445">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the parameterized complexity of a variant of the classic video game
Snake that models real-world problems of motion planning. Given a snake-like
robot with an initial position and a final position in an environment (modeled
by a graph), our objective is to determine whether the robot can reach the
final position from the initial position without intersecting itself.
Naturally, this problem models a wide-variety of scenarios, ranging from the
transportation of linked wagons towed by a locomotor at an airport or a
supermarket to the movement of a group of agents that travel in an `ant-like'
fashion and the construction of trains in amusement parks. Unfortunately,
already on grid graphs, this problem is PSPACE-complete [Biasi and Ophelders,
2016]. Nevertheless, we prove that even on general graphs, the problem is
solvable in time $k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ where $k$ is the size
of the snake, and $|I|$ is the input size. In particular, this shows that the
problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). Towards this, we show how to employ
color-coding to sparsify the configuration graph of the problem to have size
$k^{\mathcal{O}(k)}|I|^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ rather than $|I|^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. We
believe that our approach will find other applications in motion planning.
Additionally, we show that the problem is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel
even on grid graphs, but it admits a treewidth-reduction procedure. To the best
of our knowledge, the study of the parameterized complexity of motion planning
problems (where the intermediate configurations of the motion are of
importance) has so far been largely overlooked. Thus, our work is pioneering in
this regard.

community and some frameworks were proposed in order to represent, transform,
and intersect these quadratic surfaces. As far as the authors know, none of
these frameworks support all the operations required to completely handle these
surfaces. Some frameworks do not allow the construction of quadratic surfaces
from control points when others do not allow to transform these quadratic
surfaces. However , if we consider all the frameworks together, then all the
required operations over quadratic are covered. This paper presents a
unification of these frameworks that enables to represent any quadratic
surfaces either using control points or from the coefficients of its implicit
form. The proposed approach also allows to transform any quadratic surfaces and
to compute their intersection and to easily extract some geometric properties .

manipulate surface meshes by controlling mean curvature. Applications include
surface fairing -- flowing a mesh onto say, a reference sphere -- and mesh
extrusion -- e.g., rebuilding a complex shape from a reference sphere and
curvature specification. Because they operate in curvature space, these
operations can be conducted very stably across large deformations with no need
for remeshing. Spin transformations add to the algorithmic toolbox for
pose-invariant shape analysis. Mathematically speaking, mean curvature is a
shape invariant and in general fully characterizes closed shapes (together with
the metric). Computationally speaking, spin transformations make that
relationship explicit. Our work expands on a discrete formulation of spin
transformations. Like their smooth counterpart, discrete spin transformations
are naturally close to conformal (angle-preserving). This quasi-conformality
can nevertheless be relaxed to satisfy the desired trade-off between area
distortion and angle preservation. We derive such constraints and propose a
formulation in which they can be efficiently incorporated. The approach is
showcased on subcortical structures.

of an algebraic set or even a semi-algebraic set is an important problem in the
effective real algebraic geometry. Recently, Peter Burgisser, Felipe Cucker and
Pierre Lairez wrote a paper [1], which made a step forward by giving an

practical. In my thesis, I will introduce my improvement of this algorithm
using an adaptive grid algorithm on the unit sphere.

$k$-Fr\'echet distance. As the name implies, it is closely related to the
well-studied Fr\'echet distance but detects similarities between curves that
resemble each other only piecewise. The parameter $k$ denotes the number of
subcurves into which we divide the input curves. The $k$-Fr\'echet distance
provides a nice transition between (weak) Fr\'echet distance and Hausdorff
distance. However, we show that deciding this distance measure turns out to be
NP-complete, which is interesting since both (weak) Fr\'echet and Hausdorff
distance are computable in polynomial time. Nevertheless, we give several
possibilities to deal with the hardness of the $k$-Fr\'echet distance: besides
an exponential-time algorithm for the general case, we give a polynomial-time
algorithm for $k=2$, i.e., we ask that we subdivide our input curves into two
subcurves each. We also present an approximation algorithm that outputs a
number of subcurves of at most twice the optimal size. Finally, we give an FPT
algorithm using parameters $k$ (the number of allowed subcurves) and $z$ (the
number of segments of one curve that intersects the $\varepsilon$-neighborhood
of a point on the other curve).

transforming a Bayesian network to a junction tree, on which exact belief
propagation can be efficiently done. The moral graph of a Bayesian network can
be trivially obtained by connecting non-adjacent parents for each node in the
Bayesian network and dropping the direction of each edge. Perhaps because the
moralization process looks simple, there has been little attention on the
properties of moral graphs and their impact in belief propagation on Bayesian
networks. This paper addresses the mistaken claim that it has been previously
proved that optimal moral graph triangulation with the constraints of minimum
fill-in, treewidth or total states is NP-complete. The problems are in fact
NP-complete, but they have not previously been proved. We now prove these.

evolutionary algorithm and a randomised search algorithm for the dynamic vertex
cover problem based on its dual formulation. The dynamic vertex cover problem
has already been theoretically investigated to some extent and it has been
shown that using its dual formulation to represent possible solutions can lead
to a better approximation behaviour. We improve some of the existing results,
i.e. we find a linear expected re-optimization time for a (1+1) EA to
re-discover a 2-approximation when edges are dynamically deleted from the
graph. Furthermore, we investigate a different setting for applying the
dynamism to the problem, in which a dynamic change happens at each step with a
probability $P_D$. We also expand these analyses to the weighted vertex cover
problem, in which weights are assigned to vertices and the goal is to find a
cover set with minimum total weight. Similar to the classical case, the dynamic
changes that we consider on the weighted vertex cover problem are adding and
removing edges to and from the graph. We aim at finding a maximal solution for
the dual problem, which gives a 2-approximate solution for the vertex cover
problem. This is equivalent to the maximal matching problem for the classical
vertex cover problem.

making the edges not crossing one another geometrically. A noncrossing blocking

an efficient enumeration algorithm for chordal bipartite induced subgraphs. A
chordal bipartite graph is a bipartite graph without induced cycles with length
six or more. It is known that the incident graph of a hypergraph is chordal
bipartite graph if and only if the hypergraph is $\beta$-acyclic. As the main
result of our paper, we show that a graph $G$ is chordal bipartite if and only
if there is a special vertex elimination ordering for $G$, called CBEO.
Moreover, we propose an algorithm ECB which enumerates all chordal bipartite
induced subgraphs in $O(kt\Delta^2)$ time per solution on average, where $k$ is
the degeneracy, $t$ is the maximum size of $K_{t,t}$ as an induced subgraph,
and $\Delta$ is the degree. ECB achieves constant amortized time enumeration
for bounded degree graphs.

    <title>TR19-036 |  On the complexity of computing a random Boolean function over the reals | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We say that a first-order formula $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ over $\mathbb{R}$ defines a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, if for every $x_1,\dots,x_n\in\{0,1\}$, $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is true iff $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=1$. We show that:

(i) every $f$ can be defined by a formula of size $O(n)$, 
(ii) if $A$ is required to have at most $k\geq 1$ quantifier alternations, there exists an $f$ which requires  a formula of size $2^{\Omega(n/k)}$. 
 
The latter result implies several previously known as well as some new lower bounds in computational complexity. We note that (i) holds over any field of characteristic zero, and (ii) holds for any real closed or algebraically closed field.</summary>

    <title>TR19-035 |  PIT for depth-4 circuits and Sylvester-Gallai theorem for polynomials | 

	Alexey Milovanov</title>
    <summary>This text is a development of  a preprint of Ankit Gupta. 

We present an approach for devising a deterministic polynomial time whitekbox identity testing (PIT) algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.
This approach is similar to Kayal-Saraf approach for depth-$3$ circuits. Kayal and Saraf  based their algorithm on Sylvester-Gallai-type theorem about linear polynomials. We show how it is possible to generalize this approach to depth-$4$ circuits. However we failed to implement this plan completely. We succeeded to construct a polynomial time deterministic algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin and its correctness requires a hypothesis. Also we present a  polynomial-time (unconditional) algorithm for some subclass of   depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.</summary>

    <title>TR19-034 |  On $\epsilon$-sensitive monotone computations | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We show that strong-enough lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits or the non-negative rank of a matrix imply unconditional lower bounds in arithmetic or Boolean circuit complexity. First, we show that if a polynomial $f\in {\mathbb {R}}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ of degree $d$ has an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ then $(x_1+\dots+x_n+1)^d+\epsilon f$ has a monotone arithmetic circuit of size $O(sd^2+n\log n)$, for some $\epsilon&gt;0$.  Second, if $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a Boolean function,  we associate with $f$ an explicit exponential-size matrix $M(f)$ such that the Boolean circuit size of $f$ is at least $\Omega(\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))- 2n)$, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix and $\hbox{rk}_+$ denotes the non-negative rank of a matrix. In fact, the quantity $\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))$ characterizes how hard is it to distinguish rejecting and accepting inputs of $f$ by means of a linear program. 
Finally, we introduce a proof system resembling the Boolean monotone calculus and show that similar $\epsilon$-sensitive lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits imply lower bounds on proof-size in the system.</summary>

    <title>TR19-033 |  Counting basic-irreducible factors mod $p^k$ in deterministic poly-time and $p$-adic applications | 

	Ashish Dwivedi, 

	Rajat Mittal, 

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Finding an irreducible factor, of a polynomial $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$, is not known to be in deterministic polynomial time. Though there is such a classical algorithm that {\em counts} the number of irreducible factors of $f\bmod p$. We can ask the same question modulo prime-powers $p^k$. The irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ blow up exponentially in number; making it hard to describe them. Can we count  those irreducible factors $\bmod~p^k$ that remain irreducible mod $p$? These are called {\em basic-irreducible}. A simple example is in $f=x^2+px \bmod p^2$; it has $p$ many basic-irreducible factors. Also note that, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible but not basic-irreducible!

We give an algorithm to count the number of basic-irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ in deterministic poly($\deg(f),k\log p$)-time. This solves the open questions posed in (Cheng et al, ANTS'18 \&amp; Kopp et al, Math.Comp.'19). In particular, we are counting roots $\bmod\ p^k$; which gives the first deterministic poly-time algorithm to compute Igusa zeta function of $f$. Also, our algorithm efficiently partitions the set of all basic-irreducible factors (possibly exponential) into merely $\deg(f)$-many disjoint sets, using a compact tree data structure and {\em split} ideals.</summary>

    <title>TR19-031 |  Non-deterministic Quasi-Polynomial Time is Average-case Hard for ACC Circuits | 

	Lijie Chen</title>
    <summary>Following the seminal work of [Williams, J. ACM 2014], in a recent breakthrough, [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018] proved that NQP (non-deterministic quasi-polynomial time) does not have polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits.
	
We strengthen the above lower bound to an average case one, by proving that for all constants c, there is a language in NQP, which is not 1/2+1/log^c(n)-approximable by polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits. In fact, our lower bound holds for a larger circuit class: 2^(log^a n)-size ACC^0 circuits with a layer of threshold gates at the bottom, for all constants a. Our work also improves the average-case lower bound for NEXP against polynomial-size ACC circuits by [Chen, Oliveira, and Santhanam, LATIN 2018].
	
Our new lower bound builds on several interesting components, including: 
	
Barrington's theorem and the existence of an NC^1-complete language which is random self-reducible.
		
The sub-exponential witness-size lower bound for NE against ACC^0 and the conditional non-deterministic PRG construction in [Williams, SICOMP 2016].
		
An ``almost'' almost-everywhere MA average-case lower bound (which strengthens the corresponding worst-case lower bound in [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018]). 
		
A PSPACE-complete language which is same-length checkable, error-correctable and also has some other nice reducibility properties, which builds on [Trevisan and Vadhan, Computational Complexity 2007]. Moreover, all its reducibility properties have corresponding low-depth non-adaptive oracle circuits.

Like other lower bounds proved via the ``algorithmic approach'', the only property of ACC^0 of THR exploited by us is the existence of a non-trivial  SAT algorithm for ACC^0 of THR [Williams, STOC 2014]. Therefore, for any typical circuit class C, our results apply to them as well if the corresponding non-trivial SAT (in fact, GAP-UNSAT) algorithms are discovered.</summary>

    <title>How are there 20 copies of my new book through other booksellers and why are they so highly priced</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(This is about my book PROBLEMS WITH A POINT: exploring Math and computer science<br/>
by Gasarch and Kruskal, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1551731760&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1">here</a>. This post is NOT a plug.)<br/>
<br/>
I often see weird pricing on amazon but don't have enough inside information to explain it. This time I have seen some weird pricing on amazon but DO have enough information to be truly baffled.<br/>
<br/>
My book is on amazon. You can buy it<br/>
<br/>
Softcover new: $38.00<br/>
<br/>
Hardcover new: $68.00<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that all makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
OR you can buy it from some other source.<br/>
<br/>
There are 10 copies of the softcover, they claim new,  ranging from $38.00 to $57.00.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 copies of the softcover, they claim used (how used could it be?), $49 and $53<br/>
<br/>
There are 9 copies of the hardcover, they claim new, ranging from $68.00 to $91.00<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 copies of the hardcover, they claim used, $84.00 and $88.00<br/>
<br/>
This raises two questions<br/>
<br/>
1) I have a copy, Clyde got a copy, and two copy's were send to reviewers. Neither Clyde nor I have sold our copy. So how did 20 or so copies get out there?<br/>
<br/>
2) Why do they cost MORE than list price.<br/>
<br/>
I've asked around and got some answers, but I INVITE you to give more possible answers. If your answer is not just speculation (e.g., `I used to be in the black market  book business and here's the real scoop') then that would be great; however, I will take specuation<br/>
<br/>
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR HOW SOMEONE GOT COPIES<br/>
<br/>
1) Clyde and I haven't gotten our free copies yet. Hijacked?  Here's hoping the hijackers read it and enjoyed it before posting it. However, this theory is unlikely since I inquired with World Scientific (our publisher) and found out we'll be getting our free copies in 2 weeks. So this theory will either be confirmed or denied in 2 weeks. I would bet against OR those are some really bad hijackers.<br/>
<br/>
2) Complete ripoff. You pay the money and get NOTHING. I think this was more likely in the early days of amazon (or e-bay or....) but now things are pretty well monitored. I have sold books on amazon and am very impressed with how foolproof it is. Still --- could be.<br/>
<br/>
3) Someone hacked my computer. Really? Where did they get the orange covers? Why would they bother? This is not Harry Potter. Plus I asked our staff and NO this could not happen.<br/>
<br/>
4) Some of the shipment dates are fairly far in the future, so they plan to get an order, then<br/>
order the book, and have it send to the buyer, at a profit. Seems like too much sugar for a satoshi, BUT could be profitable if its a bot and its automated to do this with lots of books.<br/>
<br/>
5) My publisher also send the book to other sellers. That does not explain the higher prices.<br/>
<br/>
WHY THE HIGHER PRICES?<br/>
<br/>
1) They are counting on people assuming that other sellers are cheaper without checking. Would people do that? People still fall for the Nigerian billionaire scam, so maybe yes.<br/>
<br/>
2) The seller themselves, which is possibly an army of bots, didn't bother checking but priced it<br/>
similar to other books. This is plausible since $38.00 is fairly cheap, so looking at similar books may get you a higher price.<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
Any speculation is welcome so long as it does not involve space aliens or astrology.<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Local Computation Algorithms for Spanners</strong>, by Merav Parter, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Ali Vakilian, Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08266">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of computing a \(k\)-spanner for a graph \(G\). This is a subgraph \(H\), where (for any pair of vertices) the shortest path distance in \(H\) is at most \(k\) times the corresponding distance in \(G\). A Local Computation Algorithm (LCA) essentially gives sublinear query access to (some spanner) \(H\), without any preprocessing on \(G\). In other words, an LCA takes as input an edge \((i,j)\) in \(G\), and in sublinear time says “yes” or “no”. Despite no preprocessing, it is guaranteed that all the “yes” answers form a spanner, and the number of “yes” answers is small. One of the main challenges in LCAs for graph problems is getting a polynomial dependence on \(\Delta\), the maximum degree. (Many results end up with an exponential dependence on \(\Delta\), essentially assuming bounded-degree.) This paper give an LCA outputting spanners of optimal size for \(k=3,5\), with query complexity \(n^{1-\alpha}\) (for constant \(\alpha\) depending on \(k\)). The second result works for general \(k\), but has a query complexity that is \(O(\Delta^4n^{2/3})\).</p>



<p><strong>Set Cover in Sub-linear Time</strong>, by Piotr Indyk, Sepideh Mahabadi, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Ali Vakilian, Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03534">arXiv</a>). Set cover needs no introduction. This paper considers sublinear algorithms for set cover. It is convenient to think of the instance as a binary \(m \times n\) matrix, for \(m\) sets over a universe of size \(n\). The query model gives access to the \(j\)th non-zero entry in a desired column/row. The aim is this paper is to actually construct a set cover, and not just approximate its size (the latter problem with initiated in <a href="https://onak.pl/download/publications/Nguyen_Onak-constant_time_approximation.pdf">Nguyen-Onak</a>). The first result shows a black-box conversion of any set cover algorithm into a sublinear query complexity algorithm. Any \(\alpha\)-approximation for set cover can be converted into an \(O(\alpha)\)-approximation, that makes \(O(m(n/k)^{\beta} + nk)\) (where \(k\) is the optimal set cover size, and \(\beta &lt; 1\) depends on \(\alpha\)). For large \(k\), the paper gives an \(O(mn/k)\) query, \(O(\log n)\)-approximation algorithm. There are various lower bounds given, that show these dependencies are necessary.</p>



<p><strong>Distributional Property Testing in a Quantum World</strong> by András Gilyén and Tongyang Li (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00814">arXiv</a>). There are two aspects to quantum distribution testing. First, we can think of faster distribution testing (for classical problems) using quantum computation. Second, we can generalize the problem of distribution testing to its quantum equivalent, called density operator testing (this papers gives the first result for this quantum generalization). A distribution is a non-negative vector in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with unit \(l_1\)-norm. The quantum generalization, a density operator, is a PSD matrix in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) with unit trace. This paper has a number of results, along both aspects. For example, for the well-known problem of testing equality of distributions under total variation distance, the papers gives an \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon)\) tester (an improvement over classical lower bounds). For testing equality of density operators under the same distance, the paper gives an \(O(n/\epsilon)\) tester (note that the trivial bound is \(O(n^2)\), since the operator is a matrix).</p></div>

    <title>TR19-030 |  Non-Locality in Interactive Proofs | 

	Claude Crépeau, 

	Nan Yang</title>
    <summary>In multi-prover interactive proofs (MIPs), the verifier is usually non-adaptive. This stems from an implicit problem which we call “contamination” by the verifier. We make explicit the verifier contamination problem, and identify a solution by constructing a generalization of the MIP model. This new model quantifies non-locality as a new dimension in the characterization of MIPs. A new property of zero-knowledge emerges naturally as a result by also quantifying the non-locality of the simulator.</summary>

    <title>TR19-029 |  Biasing Boolean Functions and Collective Coin-Flipping Protocols over Arbitrary Product Distributions | 

	Yuval Filmus, 

	Lianna Hambardzumyan, 

	Hamed Hatami, 

	Pooya Hatami, 

	David Zuckerman</title>
    <summary>The seminal result of Kahn, Kalai and Linial shows that a coalition of $O(\frac{n}{\log n})$ players can bias the outcome of *any* Boolean function $\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ with respect to the uniform measure. We extend their result to arbitrary product measures on $\{0,1\}^n$, by combining their argument with a completely different argument that handles very biased coordinates. 

We view this result as a step towards proving a conjecture of Friedgut, which states that Boolean functions on the continuous cube $[0,1]^n$ (or, equivalently, on $\{1,\dots,n\}^n$) can be biased using coalitions of $o(n)$ players. This is the first step taken in this direction since Friedgut proposed the conjecture in 2004. 

Russell, Saks and Zuckerman extended the result of Kahn, Kalai and Linial to multi-round protocols, showing that when the number of rounds is $o(\log^* n)$, a coalition of $o(n)$ players can bias the outcome with respect to the uniform measure. We extend this result as well to arbitrary product measures on $\{0,1\}^n$.

The argument of Russell et al.\ relies on the fact that a coalition of $o(n)$ players can boost the expectation of any Boolean function from $\epsilon$ to $1-\epsilon$ with respect to the uniform measure. This fails for general product distributions, as the example of the AND function with respect to $\mu_{1-1/n}$ shows. Instead, we use a novel boosting argument alongside a generalization of our first result to arbitrary finite ranges.</summary>

<p><span class="qu"><span class="gD"><i><a href="https://ac.cs.princeton.edu/online/">Analytic Combinatorics</a> </i></span></span>page provides access to online lectures, lecture slides, and assignments for use in teaching and learning from the (famous) book <strong><em>Analytic Combinatorics </em></strong>by <strong><em><a class="footer" href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/">Philippe Flajolet </a></em></strong>and <strong><em><a class="footer" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs">Robert Sedgewick</a></em></strong>.</p>
<p>Both courses are appropriate for use by instructors as the basis for a “flipped” class on the subject, or for self-study by individuals. Are these courses for you? The short answer is YES, but for a longer answer <a href="https://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/online/slides/AA00-Cardinality.pdf">below are introductory slide for both courses.</a></p>

    <title>TR19-028 |  From DNF compression to sunflower theorems via regularity | 

	Jiapeng Zhang, 

	Shachar Lovett, 

	Noam Solomon</title>
    <summary>The sunflower conjecture is one of the most well-known open problems in combinatorics. It has several applications in theoretical computer science, one of which is DNF compression, due to Gopalan, Meka and Reingold [Computational Complexity 2013]. In this paper, we show that improved bounds for DNF compression imply improved bounds for the sunflower conjecture, which is the reverse direction of [Computational Complexity 2013]. The main approach is based on regularity of set systems and a structure-vs-pseudorandomness approach to the sunflower conjecture.</summary>

<p>
Jimmy Wales is the co-founder of Wikipedia. Of course this is the wonderful online non-profit encyclopedia we all know and love.</p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about using the web to search for math information. </p>
<p>
I do a huge amount of research on the web. Years ago I would spend hours and hours each week in the library. I looked for books and articles on various math issues. No more. Today it’s all web-based resources. What has happened is that primary sources—research papers—have become as easily browsable as Wikipedia. Many of them, anyway.</p>
<p>
Wikipedia often does not include proofs of mathematical theorems—those are linked to primary papers or authoritative surveys or books. There is a website <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">Proof Wiki</a> which tries to bridge the gap without the reader needing to follow links into papers. Right now they are <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Euclid's_Theorem">featuring</a> Euclid’s Theorem on the infinitude of primes—which we have posted about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/29/primes-and-polynomials/">recently</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/you-cannot-do-that/">before</a>. They have style guides for how the reasoning is laid out.</p>
<p>
There are also many style guides around the web for writing good mathematics and computer science papers. But the guides seem to stop short of the level of the phrases that irk me. When those phrases show up in the primary sources, there’s no fallback. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Phrases </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are a few top ones. I omit the well known ones, the ones that are obvious, and some that are in preparation for a future post—just kidding. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>It is well known</i>. Not by me. The reason I am searching for papers on this subject is that I do not know the basics of the area. If you must say this phrase please add a possible reference. That would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Clear from the proof of the theorem</i>. Not by me. This means that the author did not state the proof in the greatest generality possible. We all do this, but it may help if this is avoided.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <i>It is easy to see</i>. Similar to the last item. Ken vividly remembers a seminar in the early 1980s by Peter Neumann at Oxford that showed excerpts from a French mathematician in which the phrase “Il est aisé de voir” appeared often. The French phrase even reads just like the English one. But that mathematician had a reasonable excuse. He was Évariste Galois, and he had a duel early the next morning.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Proof omitted</i>. Please no.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Easy calculation</i>. Not by me. The reason it usually is avoided is that it is too difficult a computation. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>This case is the same as the previous case</i>. Not always. This has been the source of errors for me and others over the years. Good place to check the argument. Maybe a suggestion that there should be a Lemma that covers both cases.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>In our paper in preparation</i>. Please no. I cannot read a paper that does not exist yet.</p>
<p>
Finally the worst in my opinion.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>It costs $37.95</i>. Oh no. Many times we find papers that are behind a pay-wall. I always hate this. The authors of course wish to make they work available to all possible. But the reality is that often papers are protected. Thanks to our friends at Wikipedia and Arxiv that this is not the case for lots of stuff. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/bill-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15665"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15665" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/bill.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
But I have wondered who ever pays the crazy amount of $37.95? Does anyone ever pay that? Is it equivalent to saying: This paper is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Examples </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken has one example that has driven him crazy for years and again these past two weeks. Many of you have probably used it often.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <i>This procedure runs in polynomial time.</i> Excuse me, <em>what</em> polynomial time? At least tell us the best exponent you know…</p>
<p>
A related matter is attending to “edge cases” of theorems. Sometimes the edge cases are meant to be excluded. For example, “Let <img alt="{\alpha &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha &gt; 0}"/>” excludes <img alt="{\alpha = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = 0}"/>; maybe nothing more needs to be said. But in other cases it is not so clear. A theorem may suggest limits and it is nice to say what happens if one tries to take those limits. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>

    <title>Flying Pigs Unsafe at Any Speed</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Take a moment and imagine a flying pig. Do you see a pig with tiny wings lazily guiding along. But pigs are not particularly slow animals as anyone has seen a <a href="https://youtu.be/-eMV1jxfl40?t=73">pig race</a> at a county fair can attest to that. So why not in the air shouldn't a pig go faster than an unladen African swallow?<br/>
<br/>
I have a point discussing the fastness of a flying pig. Consider my favorite flying pig, P = NP. I would put more probability on an actual flying pig (thanks CRISPR) than polynomial-time algorithms for traveling salesman.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get in the following conversation:<br/>
<br/>
<b>AI person</b>: The P v NP problem is irrelevant as we have machine learning and SAT solvers and we can for all practical purposes solve NP-complete problems.<br/>
<b>Me</b>: If P = NP we can solve AI!<br/>
<b>AI</b>: If P = NP it's likely to have a very slow poly-time algorithm with high exponents and constants and be for all practical purposes useless.<br/>
<br/>
Let's break that down. The claim is E(running time of SAT|running time of SAT is poly) = cn<sup>k</sup> for some large c and k. First of all you are conditioning on a probability zero event. Beyond that nearly all the known problems we know that sit in polynomial time have practical efficient solutions. So under the assumption that SAT is one of these problems, why shouldn't the same rule apply. You've already made the assumption we can reduce its running time from exponential to polynomial, so why would it stop at some high polynomial?<br/>
<br/>
If we are going to talk about the hypothetical flying pig P = NP world, let my algorithms run fast.</div>

<p>Please make sure you reserve a spot for your group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>.

<blockquote><p>Abstract: A matroid is an abstract combinatorial object which generalizes the notions of spanning trees, and linearly independent sets of vectors. I will talk about an efficient algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to approximately count the number of bases of any given matroid.</p>
<p>The proof is based on a new connections between high dimensional simplicial complexes, and a new class of multivariate polynomials called completely log-concave polynomials. In particular, we exploit a fundamental fact from our previous work that the bases generating polynomial of any given matroid is a log-concave function over the positive orthant.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, and Cynthia Vinzant.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If I’m being honest, the most exciting recent development in my life is this: a little over a month ago,<strong> I stopped checking “SneerClub”</strong> (a place I’d previously resolved not even to name here, but I think an exception is warranted now).  Permanently, cold turkey.  I won’t even visit to read their sneers about this post.  I’ve made progress cutting down on other self-destructive social media fixations as well.  Many friends suggested this course to me, and I thank them all, though I ultimately had to follow my own path to the obvious.</p>



<p>Ironically, <em>the SneerClubbers themselves</em> begged me to stop reading them (!), so presumably for once they’ll be okay with something I did (but if not, I don’t care).  If any of them still have something to say to me, they can come to <em>this</em> blog, or email me, or if they pass through Austin, set up a time to hash it out over chips and queso (my treat).  What I’ll no longer do is spend hours every week binge-reading a forum of people who’ve adopted nastiness and bad faith as their explicit principles.  I’ll no longer toss and turn at night wondering how it came about that two thousand Redditors hate Scott Aaronson so much, and what I could say or do (short of total self-abnegation) that would make them hate me less.  I plan to spend the freed-up time <em>being</em> Scott Aaronson.</p>



<p>Resolving to ignore one particular online hate pit—and then <em>sticking</em> to the resolution, as so far I have—has been a pure, unmitigated improvement to my quality of life.  If you don’t believe me, ask my wife and kids.  I recommend this course to anyone.</p>



<p>You could sensibly ask: why did I <em>ever</em> spend time worrying about an anti-nerds-like-me forum that’s so poisonous for its targets and participants alike?  After long introspection, I think the answer is: there’s a part of me, perhaps a gift from the childhood bullies, that’s so obsessed with “society’s hatred of STEM nerds,” that it <em>constantly seeks out evidence to confirm that its fears are justified—</em>evidence that it can then wave in front of the rest of my brain to say “you see??  what did I always tell you?”  And alas, whenever that part of my brain seeks such evidence, the world dutifully supplies mountains of it.  It’s never once disappointed.</p>



<p>Now the SneerClubbers—who are perceptive and talented in their cruelty, if in nothing else—notice this about me, and gleefully ridicule me for it.  But they’re oblivious to the central irony: that unlike the vast majority of humankind, or even the vast majority of social justice activists, they (the SneerClubbers) <em>really do</em> hate everyone like me.  They’re <em>precisely</em> what the paranoid part of my brain wrongly fears that everyone else I meet is secretly like.  They’re like someone who lectures you about your hilariously overblown fear of muggers, <em>while simultaneously mugging you</em>.</p>



<p>But at least they’re not the contented and self-confident bullies of my childhood nightmares, kicking dirt down at nerds from atop their pinnacle of wokeness and social adeptness.  If you spend enough time studying them, they themselves come across as angry, depressed, pathetic.  So for example: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/aexi9v/michael_atiyah_has_passed_away/edtrcc5/">here’s</a> one of my most persistent attackers, popping up on a math thread commemorating Michael Atiyah (one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century), just to insult Atiyah—randomly, gratuitously, and a few days after Atiyah had died.  Almost everything posted all over Reddit by this individual—who uses the accurate tagline “unpleasantly radical”—has the same flavor.  Somehow seeing this made it click for me: wait a second, <em>these</em> are the folks are lecturing <em>me</em> about my self-centeredness and arrogance and terrible social skills?  Like, at least I <em><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Scott-Aaronson-so-nice">try</a></em> to be nice.</p>


<hr/>
<p>Scott Alexander, who writes the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">world’s best blog</a> and is a more central target of SneerClub than I’ve been, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/">recently announced</a> that he asked the moderators of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/">r/ssc</a> to close its notorious “Culture War” thread, and they’ve done so—moving the thread to a new home on Reddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/">“TheMotte.”</a></p>
<p>For those who don’t know: r/ssc is the place on Reddit to discuss Scott’s SlateStarCodex blog, though Scott himself was never too involved as more than a figurehead.  The Culture War thread was the place within r/ssc to discuss race, gender, immigration, and other hot-button topics.  The thread, which filled up with a bewildering thousands of comments per week (!), attracted the, err … <em>full range</em> of political views, including leftists, libertarians, and moderates but also alt-righters, neoreactionaries, and white nationalists. Predictably, SneerClub treated the thread as a gift from heaven: a constant source of inflammatory material that they could use to smear Scott personally (even if most of the time, Scott hadn’t even <em>seen</em> the offending content, let alone endorsing it).</p>


<p>Four months ago, I was one of the apparently many friends who told Scott that I felt he should dissociate the Culture War thread from his brand.  So I congratulate him on his decision, which (despite his eloquently-expressed misgivings) I feel confident was the right one.  Think about it this way: nobody’s freedom of speech has been curtailed—the thread continues full steam at TheMotte, for anyone who enjoys it—but meanwhile, the sneerers have been deprived of a golden weapon with which to slime Scott.  Meanwhile, while the sneerers themselves might never change their minds about anything, Scott has demonstrated to third parties that he’s open and reasonable and ready to compromise, like the debater who happily switches to his opponent’s terminology.  What’s not to like?</p>


<hr/>
<p>A couple weeks ago, while in Albuquerque for the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2019/index.php">SQuInT</a> conference, I visited the excellent <a href="https://www.nuclearmuseum.org/">National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</a>.  It was depressing, as it should have been, to tour the detailed exhibits about the murderous events surrounding the birth of the nuclear era: the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was depressing in a different way to tour the exhibits about the early Atomic Age, and see the boundless optimism that ‘unleashing the power of the atom’ would finally usher in a near-utopia of space travel and clean energy—and then to compare that vision to where we are now, with climate change ravaging the planet and (in a world-historic irony) the people who care most about the environment having denounced and marginalized the most reliable source of carbon-free energy, the one that probably had the best chance to avert our planet’s terrifying future.</p>


<p>But on the bright side: how wonderful to have born into a time and place when, for the most part, those who hate you have only the power to destroy your life that you yourself grant them.  How wonderful when one can blunt their knives by simply refusing to open a browser tab.</p></div>

    <title>Impossibility Results in Fairness as Bayesian Inference</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the most striking results about fairness in machine learning is the impossibility result that <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/big.2016.0047">Alexandra Chouldechova</a>, and separately<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05807"> Jon Kleinberg, Sendhil Mullainathan, and Manish Raghavan</a> discovered a few years ago. These papers say something very crisp. I'll focus here on the binary classification setting that Alex studies because it is much simpler. There are (at least) three reasonable properties you would want your "fair" classifiers to have. They are:<br/><div><ol><li><b>False Positive Rate Balance</b>: The rate at which your classifier makes errors in the positive direction (i.e. labels negative examples positive) should be the same across groups.</li><li><b>False Negative Rate Balance</b>:  The rate at which your classifier makes errors in the negative direction (i.e. labels positive examples negative) should be the same across groups.</li><li><b>Predictive Parity</b>: The statistical "meaning" of a positive classification should be the same across groups (we'll be more specific about what this means in a moment)</li></ol><div>What Chouldechova and KMR show is that if you want all three, you are out of luck --- unless you are in one of two very unlikely situations: Either you have a <i>perfect</i> classifier that never errs, or the <i>base rate</i> is exactly the same for both populations --- i.e. both populations have exactly the same frequency of positive examples. If you don't find yourself in one of these two unusual situations, then you have to give up on properties 1, 2, or 3. </div></div><div><br/></div><div>This is discouraging, because there are good reasons to want each of properties 1, 2, and 3. And these aren't measures made up in order to formulate an impossibility result --- they have their root in the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">Propublica/COMPASS controversy</a>. Roughly speaking, Propublica discovered that the COMPASS recidivism prediction algorithm violated false positive and negative rate balance, and they took the position that this made the classifier <i>unfair</i>. Northpointe (the creators of the COMPASS algorithm) responded by saying that their algorithm satisfied predictive parity, and took the position that this made the classifier fair. They were seemingly talking past each other by using two different definitions of what "fair" should mean. What the impossibility result says is that there is no way to satisfy both sides of this debate. </div><div><br/></div><div>So why is this result true? The proof in Alex's paper can't be made simpler --- its already a one liner, following from an algebraic identity. But the first time I read it I didn't have a great intuition for <i>why</i> it held. Viewing the statement through the lens of Bayesian inference made the result very intuitive (at least for me). With this viewpoint, all the impossibility result is saying is: "If you have different <i>priors</i> about some event (say that a released inmate will go on to commit a crime) for two different populations, and you receive evidence of the same strength for both populations, then you will have different posteriors as well". This is now bordering on obvious --- because your posterior belief about an event is a combination of your prior belief and the new evidence you have received, weighted by the strength of that evidence.  </div><div><br/></div><div>Lets walk through this. Suppose we have two populations, call them $A$s and $B$s. Individuals $x$ from these populations have some true binary label $\ell(x) \in \{0,1\}$ which we are trying to predict. Individuals from the two populations are drawn from different distributions, which we'll call $D_A$ and $D_B$. We have some classifier that predicts labels $\hat\ell(x)$, and we would like it to satisfy the three fairness criteria defined above. First, lets define some terms:<br/><br/>The <i>base rate</i> for a population $i$ is just the frequency of positive labels:<br/>$$p_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\ell(x) = 1].$$<br/>The <i>false positive </i>and <i>false negative </i>rates of the classifier are:<br/>$$FPR_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat\ell(x) = 1 | \ell(x) = 0] \ \ \ \ FNR_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat\ell(x) = 0 | \ell(x) = 1].$$<br/>And the <i>positive predictive value</i> of the classifier is:<br/>$$PPV_i = \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\ell(x) = 1 | \hat\ell(x)=1].$$</div><div>Satisfying all three fairness constraints just means finding a classifier such that $FPR_A = FPR_B$, $FNR_A = FNR_B$, and $PPV_A = PPV_B$.<br/><br/>How should we prove that this is impossible? All three of these quantities are conditional probabilities, so we are essentially obligated to apply Bayes Rule:<br/>$$PPV_i =  \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\ell(x) = 1 | \hat\ell(x)=1] = \frac{ \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat\ell(x)=1 | \ell(x) = 1]\cdot \Pr_{x \sim D_i} [\ell(x) = 1]}{ \Pr_{x \sim D_i}[\hat \ell(x) = 1]}$$<br/>But now these quantities on the right hand side are things we have names for. Substituting in, we get:<br/>$$PPV_i  = \frac{p_i(1-FNR_i)}{p_i(1-FNR_i) + (1-p_i)FPR_i}$$<br/><br/>And so now we see the problem. Suppose we have $FNR_A = FNR_B$ and $FPR_A = FPR_B$. Can we have $PPV_A = PPV_B$? There are only two ways. If $p_A = p_B$, then we are done, because the right hand side is the same for either $i \in \{A,B\}$. But if the base rates are different, then the only way to make these two quantities equal is if $FNR_i = FPR_i = 0$ --- i.e. if our classifier is perfect.<br/><br/>The piece of intuition here is that the base rate is our prior belief that $\ell(x) = 1$, before we see the output of the classifier. The positive predictive value is our <i>posterior</i> belief that $\ell(x) = 1$, after we see the output of the classifier. And all we need to know about the classifier in order to apply Bayes rule to derive our posterior from our prior is its false positive rate and its false negative rate --- these fully characterize the "strength of the evidence." Hence: "If our prior probabilities differ, and we see evidence of a positive label of the same strength, then our posterior probabilities will differ as well."<br/><br/>Once you realize this, then you can generalize the fairness impossibility result to other settings by making equally obvious statements about probability elsewhere. :-)<br/><br/>For example, suppose we generalize the labels to be real valued instead of binary --- so when making decisions, we can model individuals using shades of gray. (e.g. in college admissions, we don't have to model individuals as "qualified" or not, but rather can model talent as a real value.) Lets fix a model for concreteness, but the particulars are not important. (The model here is related to my paper with <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kannan/">Sampath Kannan</a> and<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~jziani/"> Juba Ziani </a>on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09004">the downstream effects of affirmative action</a>)<br/><br/>Suppose that in population $i$, labels are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean $\mu_i$: $\ell(x) \sim N(\mu_i, 1)$. For an individual from group $i$, we have a test that gives an unbiased estimator of their label, with some standard deviation $\sigma_i$: $\hat \ell(x) \sim N(\ell(x), \sigma_i)$.<br/><br/>In a model like this, we have analogues of our fairness desiderata in the binary case:<br/><br/><ul><li><b>Analogue of Error Rate Balance</b><i style="font-weight: bold;">: </i>We would like our test to be equally informative about both populations: $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$. </li><li><b>Analogue of Predictive Parity</b>: Any test score $t$ should induce the same posterior expectation on true labels across populations: $$E_{D_A}[\ell(x) | \hat \ell(x) = t] = E_{D_B}[\ell(x) | \hat \ell(x) = t]$$ </li></ul><div>Can we satisfy both of these conditions at the same time? Because the normal distribution is <i>self conjugate</i> (that's why we chose it!) Bayes Rule simplifies to have a nice closed form, and we can compute our posteriors as follows:</div><div>$$E_{D_i}[\ell(x) | \hat \ell(x) = t] = \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\sigma_i^2 + 1}\cdot \mu_i + \frac{1}{\sigma_i^2 + 1}\cdot t$$</div><div>So there are only two ways we can achieve both properties:</div><div><ol><li>We can of course satisfy both conditions if the prior distributions are the same for both groups: $\mu_A = \mu_B$. Then we can set $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$ and observe that the right hand side of the above expression is identical for $i \in \{A, B\}$.</li><li>We can also satisfy both conditions if the prior means are different, but the signal is perfect: i.e. $\sigma_A = \sigma_B = 0$. (Then both posterior means are just $t$, independent of the prior means). </li></ol></div>But we can see from inspection these are the only two cases. If $\sigma_A = \sigma_B$, but the prior means are different, then the posterior means will be different for every $t$. This is really the same impossibility result as in the binary case: all it is saying is that if I have different priors about different groups, but the evidence I receive has the same strength, then my posteriors will also be different.<br/><br/>So the mathematical fact is simple --- but its implications remain deep. It means we have to choose between equalizing a decision maker's posterior about the label of an individual, or providing an equally accurate signal about each individual, and that we cannot have both. Unfortunately, living without either one of these conditions can lead to real harm.<br/><br/></div><div><br/></div></div>

    <title>Problems with a Point: Exploring Math and Computer Science</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
As you can see from Lance's tweet<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
               Problems with a Point: Exploring Math and Computer Science<br/>
               by Gasarch and Kruskal<br/>
<br/>
(ADDED LATER- the World scientific website has more info than amazon and has a table of contents, so here it is: <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261#t=toc">here</a>)<br/>
<br/>
is now available! The tweet says its $68.00 but that's hardcover- paperback is $38.00 (are covers that expensive) and if you like your books already broken in, there are some used copies for $89.00. Makes sense to me (no it doesn't!). Could be the topic of a blog post (probably already was).<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so whats in the book?  One of my favorite types of blog posts is when I make a point ABOUT math and then do some math to underscore that point.  I went through all of my blogs (all? No, I doubt I did that) and picked out blogs of that type. With Clyde's help we EXPANDED and POLISHED and GOT THE MATH RIGHT (in some cases I didn't have any math so we had to supply it).<br/>
<br/>
When I first got a copy (about a month ago) I just couldn't stop reading it. I really like it! This is a non-trivial remark -- often authors get tired of their book, or after a while and wonder things like ``why did I write 300 page on the muffin problem? What was I thinking?'' So the fact that I am very pleased with it is not obvious. Does it mean you will?<br/>
<br/>
If you ever thought `I wish bill would clean up his posts spelling and grammar AND expand on the math AND make it a more cohesive whole' then buy the book!<br/>

I will in future posts describe more about writing the book, but this is probably my last post where I plug the book.<br/>
