decomposable submodular functions. A submodular function is decomposable if it
takes the form of a sum of submodular functions. The special case of maximizing
a monotone, decomposable submodular function under cardinality constraints is
known as the Combinatorial Public Projects (CPP) problem [Papadimitriou et al.,
2008]. Previous work by Gupta et al. [2010] gave a differentially private
algorithm for the CPP problem. We extend this work by designing differentially
private algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone decomposable submodular
maximization under general matroid constraints, with competitive utility
guarantees. We complement our theoretical bounds with experiments demonstrating
empirical performance, which improves over the differentially private
algorithms for the general case of submodular maximization and is close to the
performance of non-private algorithms.

Asymmetric Connectivity (MinPAC) that has applications in wireless sensor
networks. Given a directed arc-weighted graph, MinPAC asks for a strongly
connected spanning subgraph minimizing the summed vertex costs. Here, the cost
of each vertex is the weight of its heaviest outgoing arc in the chosen
subgraph. We present linear-time algorithms for the cases where the number of
strongly connected components in a so-called obligatory subgraph or the
feedback edge number in the underlying undirected graph is constant.
Complementing these results, we prove that the problem is W[2]-hard with
respect to the solution cost, even on restricted graphs with one feedback arc
and binary arc weights.

in many applications such as multi-criteria decision making, web search, and
recommendation. The $k$-regret minimizing set ($k$-RMS) problem was recently
proposed for representative tuple discovery. Specifically, for a large database
$P$ of tuples with multiple numerical attributes, the $k$-RMS problem returns a
size-$r$ subset $Q$ of $P$ such that, for any possible ranking function, the
score of the top-ranked tuple in $Q$ is not much worse than the score of the
$k$\textsuperscript{th}-ranked tuple in $P$. Although the $k$-RMS problem has
been extensively studied in the literature, existing methods are designed for
the static setting and cannot maintain the result efficiently when the database
is updated. To address this issue, we propose the first fully-dynamic algorithm
for the $k$-RMS problem that can efficiently provide the up-to-date result
w.r.t.~any insertion and deletion in the database with a provable guarantee.
Experimental results on several real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate
that our algorithm runs up to four orders of magnitude faster than existing
$k$-RMS algorithms while returning results of near-equal quality.

$\mathcal{S}^{\gamma}_{\mathcal{P}}$ of elements in the support of an
underlying distribution $\mathcal{P}$ whose probability value is larger than a
given threshold $\gamma$, by actively querying an oracle to gain information
about a sequence $X_1, X_2, \ldots$ of $i.i.d.$ samples drawn from
$\mathcal{P}$. We consider two query models: $(a)$ each query is an index $i$
and the oracle return the value $X_i$ and $(b)$ each query is a pair $(i,j)$
and the oracle gives a binary answer confirming if $X_i = X_j$ or not. For each
of these query models, we design sequential estimation algorithms which at each
round, either decide what query to send to the oracle depending on the entire
history of responses or decide to stop and output an estimate of
$\mathcal{S}^{\gamma}_{\mathcal{P}}$, which is required to be correct with some
pre-specified large probability. We provide upper bounds on the query
complexity of the algorithms for any distribution $\mathcal{P}$ and also derive
lower bounds on the optimal query complexity under the two query models. We
also consider noisy versions of the two query models and propose robust
estimators which can effectively counter the noise in the oracle responses.

string) from a dictionary (sequence of small strings). The problem has an
application in bioinformatics and has a connection with the Sequence assembly
method for reconstructing a long DNA sequence from small fragments. The problem
is constructing a string $t$ of length $n$ from strings $s^1,\dots, s^m$ with
possible intersections. We provide a classical algorithm with running time
$O\left(n+L +m(\log n)^2\right)=\tilde{O}(n+L)$ where $L$ is the sum of lengths
of $s^1,\dots,s^m$. We provide a quantum algorithm with running time $O\left(n
+\log n\cdot(\log m+\log\log n)\cdot \sqrt{m\cdot L}\right)=\tilde{O}\left(n
+\sqrt{m\cdot L}\right)$. Additionally, we show that the lower bound for the
classical algorithm is $\Omega(n+L)$. Thus, our classical algorithm is optimal
up to a log factor, and our quantum algorithm shows speed-up comparing to any
classical algorithm in a case of non-constant length of strings in the
dictionary.

    <title>Two-Bar Charts Packing Problem</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Adil Erzin, Gregory Melidi, Stepan Nazarenko, Roman Plotnikov <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14195">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider a Bar Charts Packing Problem (BCPP), in which it is necessary to
pack bar charts (BCs) in a strip of minimum length. The problem is, on the one
hand, a generalization of the Bin Packing Problem (BPP), and, on the other
hand, a particular case of the Project Scheduling Problem with
multidisciplinary jobs and one limited non-accumulative resource. Earlier, we
proposed a polynomial algorithm that constructs the optimal package for a given
order of non-increasing BCs. This result generalizes a similar result for BPP.
For Two-Bar Charts Packing Problem (2-BCPP), when each BC consists of two bars,
the algorithm we have proposed constructs a package in polynomial time, the
length of which does not exceed $2\ OPT+1$, where $OPT$ is the minimum possible
length of the packing. As far as we know, this is the first guaranteed estimate
for 2-BCPP. We also conducted a numerical experiment in which we compared the
solutions built by our approximate algorithms with the optimal solutions built
by the CPLEX package. The experimental results confirmed the high efficiency of
the developed algorithms.

A cute theorem that deserves to be better known: if you hold a unit cube in the noonday sun, at any angle, its shadow‚Äôs area equals its height (elevation difference between lowest and highest point).

    <title>Exact Method for Generating Strategy-Solvable Sudoku Clues</title>

digits and it is typically made solvable with known solving techniques, called
strategies. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating such Sudoku
instances. We introduce a rigorous framework to discuss solvability for Sudoku
instances with respect to strategies. This allows us to handle not only known
strategies but also general strategies under a few reasonable assumptions. We
propose an exact method for determining Sudoku clues for a given set of clue
positions that is solvable with a given set of strategies. This is the first
exact method except for a trivial brute-force search. Besides the clue
generation, we present an application of our method to the problem of
determining the minimum number of strategy-solvable Sudoku clues. We conduct
experiments to evaluate our method, varying the position and the number of
clues at random. Our method terminates within $1$ minutes for many grids.
However, as the number of clues gets closer to $20$, the running time rapidly
increases and exceeds the time limit set to $600$ seconds. We also evaluate our
method for several instances with $17$ clue positions taken from known minimum
Sudokus to see the efficiency for deciding unsolvability.

over time. The player takes actions after seeing the function, and the goal is
to achieve a small function cost for these actions, as well as a small cost for
moving between actions. While the general problem requires a polynomial
dependence on the dimension, we show how to get dimension-independent bounds
for well-behaved functions. In particular, we consider the case where the
convex functions are $\kappa$-well-conditioned, and give an algorithm that
achieves an $O(\sqrt \kappa)$-competitiveness. Moreover, when the functions are
supported on $k$-dimensional affine subspaces--e.g., when the function are the
indicators of some affine subspaces--we get $O(\min(k, \sqrt{k \log
T}))$-competitive algorithms for request sequences of length $T$. We also show
some lower bounds, that well-conditioned functions require
$\Omega(\kappa^{1/3})$-competitiveness, and $k$-dimensional functions require
$\Omega(\sqrt{k})$-competitiveness.

under computationally expensive metrics, like the continuous Fr\'echet distance
on trajectory data. Based on clustering for metric indexes, we obtain a dynamic
tree structure whose size is linear in the number of trajectories, regardless
of the trajectory's individual sizes or the spatial dimension, which allows one
to exploit low `intrinsic dimensionality' of data sets for effective search
space pruning.
</p>
<p>Since the distance computation is expensive, generic metric indexing methods
are rendered impractical. We present strategies that (i) improve on known upper
and lower bound computations, (ii) build cluster trees without any or very few
distance calls, and (iii) search using bounds for metric pruning, interval
orderings for reduction, and randomized pivoting for reporting the final
results.
</p>
<p>We analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods with extensive
experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world data sets. The results show
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for exact queries, and even further
speed-ups are achieved for queries that may return approximate results.
Surprisingly, the majority of exact nearest-neighbor queries on real data sets
are answered without any distance computations.

goal is to design algorithms that (1) perform well when the advice is accurate
and (2) remain robust in the worst case a la traditional competitive analysis.
Lykouris and Vassilvitskii give such an algorithm by adapting the Marker
algorithm to the learning-augmented setting. In a recent work, Rohatgi (SODA
2020) improves on their result with an approach also inspired by randomized
marking. We continue the study of this problem, but with a somewhat different
approach: We consider combining the BlindOracle algorithm, which just na\"ively
follows the predictions, with an optimal competitive algorithm for online
caching in a black-box manner. The resulting algorithm outperforms all existing
approaches while being significantly simpler. Moreover, we show that combining
BlindOracle with LRU is in fact optimal among deterministic algorithms for this

experiments. The problem arises in the OFRG method for analyzing microbial
communities. The OFRG method performs classification of rRNA gene clones using
binary fingerprints created from a series of hybridization experiments, where
each experiment consists of hybridizing a collection of arrayed clones with a
single oligonucleotide probe. This experiment produces analog signals, one for
each clone, which then need to be classified, that is, converted into binary
values 1 and 0 that represent hybridization and non-hybridization events. In
addition to the sample rRNA gene clones, the array contains a number of control
clones needed to calibrate the classification procedure of the hybridization
signals. These control clones must be selected with care to optimize the
classification process. We formulate this as a combinatorial optimization
problem called Balanced Covering. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and we
show some results on hardness of approximation. We propose approximation
algorithms based on randomized rounding and we show that, with high
probability, our algorithms approximate well the optimum solution. The
experimental results confirm that the algorithms find high quality control
clones. The algorithms have been implemented and are publicly available as part
of the software package called CloneTools.

network motifs, which are patterns of interconnections that occur in a given

we are interested in searching and inferring network motifs in a class of
biological networks that can be represented by vertex-colored graphs. We show
the computational complexity for many problems related to colorful topological
motifs and present efficient algorithms for special cases. We also present a
probabilistic strategy to detect highly frequent motifs in vertex-colored

the maximum number of constraints in which any variable occurs), and for Max
Weighted c-Matching in hypergraphs (where D is the maximum size of any of the

2-approximation algorithms for CMIP with two variables per constraint and
Weighted Vertex Cover. The algorithms are randomized. All of the approximation
ratios exactly match those of comparable centralized algorithms.

    <title>TR20-083 |  Proximity Gaps for Reed-Solomon Codes |

    <summary>A collection of sets displays a proximity gap with respect to some property if for every set in the collection, either (i) all members are $\delta$-close to the property in relative Hamming distance or (ii) only a tiny fraction of members are $\delta$-close to the property. In particular, no set in the collection has roughly half of its members $\delta$-close to the property and the others $\delta$-far from it.

We show that the collection of affine spaces displays a proximity gap with respect to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, even over small fields, of size polynomial in the dimension of the code, and the gap applies to any $\delta$ smaller than the Johnson/Guruswami-Sudan list-decoding bound of the RS code. We also show near-optimal gap results, over fields of (at least) linear size in the RS code dimension, for $\delta$ smaller than the unique decoding radius. Finally, we discuss several applications of our proximity gap results to distributed storage, multi-party cryptographic protocols, and concretely efficient proof systems.

We prove the proximity gap results by analyzing the execution of classical algebraic decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes (due to Berlekamp-Welch and Guruswami-Sudan) on a formal element of an affine space. This involves working with Reed-Solomon codes whose base field is an (infinite) rational function field. Our proofs are obtained by developing an extension (to function fields) of a strategy of Arora and Sudan for analyzing low-degree tests.</summary>

Arvind Mithal‚Äîalmost always referred to as Arvind‚Äîis now the head of the faculty of computer science at a Boston trade school. The school, also known as MIT, is of course one of the top places for all things computer science. From education to service to startups to research, MIT is perhaps the best in the world.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might discuss one of Arvind‚Äôs main research themes.</p>
<p>
Although this work started in the 1980‚Äôs I believe that it underscores an important point. This insight might apply to current research topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing">quantum computers</a>.</p>
<p>
But first I cannot resist saying something personal about him. Arvind is a long time friend of mine, and someone who gets the <i>stuck in elevator measure</i> of many hours. This measure is one I made up, but I hope you get the idea.</p>
<p>
Arvind is the only name I have ever known for Arvind. I was a bit surprised to see that the Wikipedia reference for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_(computer_scientist)">him</a> states his ‚Äúfull‚Äù name. He told me that he found having one name‚Äînot two‚Äîwas a challenge. For example, he sometimes had to explain when arriving at a check-in desk at a conference that he only had one name. His name tag often became: </p>

<p>because the conference software could not handle people with one name. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Dataflow‚ÄîThe prehistory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
About forty years ago one of the major open problem in CS was how to make computers go faster. It is still an issue, but in the 1980‚Äôs this problem was one of all-hands-on-deck. It was worked on by software engineers, by electrical engineers, by researchers of all kinds including complexity theorists. Conferences like FOCS and STOC‚Äîhardcore theory conferences‚Äîoften contained papers on how to speed up computations. </p>
<p>
Two examples come to mind:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> The idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array">systolic</a> arrays led by Hsiang-Tsung Kung then at CMU. Also his students, especially Charles Leiserson, made important contributions. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> The idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracomputer">Ultracomputer</a> led by Jacob Schwartz at NYU. An ultracomputer has N processors, N memories and an N log N message-passing switch connecting them. Note, the use of ‚ÄúN‚Äù so you can <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/">tell</a> that it came from a theorist. </p>
<p>
Arvind tried to make computers faster by inventing a new type of computer architecture. Computers then were based on the classic von Neumann architecture or control flow architecture. He and his colleagues worked for many years trying to replace this architecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow#Hardware_architecture">dataflow</a>. </p>
<p>
A bottleneck in von Neumann style machines is caused by the program counter fetch cycle. Each cycle the program counter decides which instruction to get, and thus which data to get. These use the same hardware channel, which causes the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann bottleneck</a>. We have modified Wikipedia‚Äôs graphic to make the bottleneck aspect clearer:</p>

</td>

<tr>

</tbody></table>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Dataflow‚ÄîThe promise </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Arvind is usually identified with the invention of <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191029.pdf">dataflow</a> computer architecture. The key idea of this architecture is to avoid the above bottleneck by eliminating the program counter. If there are no instructions to fetch, then it would seem that we can beat the bottleneck. Great idea.</p>
<p>
Dataflow architectures do not have a program counter, and so data is king. Roughly data objects move around in such a machine, and they eventually appear at computational units. Roughly these machines operate, at a high level, like a directed graph from complexity theory. Data moves along edges to nodes that compute values. Moreover, nodes compute as soon as all the input data is present. After the node computes the value, the new data is sent to the next node; and so on. </p>

<p>
The hope was that this would yield a way to increase the performance of computers. No program counter, no instruction fetching, could make dataflow machines faster. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Dataflow‚ÄîThe actual </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The dataflow idea is clever. The difficulty is while dataflow can work, classic von Neumann machines have been augmented in various ways. The competition rarely stays put. These updates did not eliminate the von Neumann bottleneck, but they reduce the cost of it, and let von Neumann machines continue to get faster. Caches are one example of how they avoid the bottleneck, thus making the dataflow machines less attractive. Thus, a cache for program instructions makes it likely that the program fetch step does not actually happen. This is an attack on the main advantage of dataflow machines. </p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/tve/papers-ucb/limits.pdf">paper</a> by David Culler, Klaus Schauser, and Thorsten von Eicken titled <i>Two Fundamental Limits on Dataflow Multiprocessing?</i> discusses these issues in detail. They start by saying: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The advantages of dataflow architectures were argued persuasively in a seminal 1983 paper by Arvind and Iannucci and in a 1987 revision entitled ‚ÄúTwo Fundamental Issues in Multiprocessing‚Äù. However, reality has proved less favorable to this approach than their arguments would suggest. This motivates us to examine the line of reasoning that has driven dataflow architectures and fine-grain multithreading to understand where the argument went awry. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Dataflow‚ÄîLessons </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are the lessons? Is there one? </p>
<p>
I claim there are lessons. The work of Arvind on dataflow was and is important. It did not lead to the demise of von Neumann machines. I am using one right now to write this.</p>
<p>
Dataflow did lead to insights on programming that have many applications. The dataflow idea may yet impact special computational situations: there is interest in using them for data intensive applications.</p>
<p>Ken adds that dataflow has been realized in other ways. Caches and pipes and subsequent architecture innovations profit from designs that enhance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference">locality</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a> programming model gives a general framework that fits this well. The paradigm of <a href="http://\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing">streaming</a> is even a better fit. Note that Wikipedia says both that it is ‚Äúequivalent to dataflow programming‚Äù and ‚Äúwas explored within dataflow programming‚Äù‚Äîso perhaps the parent lost out to the wider adaptability of her children.</p>
<p>
I think there are lessons: Practical goals like making hardware go faster, are complex and many faceted. A pure theory approach such as systolic arrays or ultra computers or dataflow machines is unlikely to suffice. Also the existing technology like von Neumann machines will continue to evolve. </p>
<p>
A question is: Could quantum computers be subject to the same lesson? Will non-quantum machines continue to evolve in a way to make the quantum advantage less than we think? Or is this type of new architecture different? Could non-quantum machines incorporate tricks from quantum and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>

<p>We applaud them on receiving this award. Sadly the Paris award reminds us that Paris Kanellakis died in the terrible plane crash of American Airlines Flight 965 on December 20, 1995. Also on that flight were his wife, Maria Otoya, and their two children, Alexandra and Stephanos.</p>

(In typical Harvard style, we give them different names ‚Äì ‚ÄúEmergency Satisfactory‚Äù and ‚ÄúEmergency Unsatisfactory‚Äù ‚Äì  but that doesn‚Äôt matter much).</p>



<p>One unexpected but happy consequence of this policy is that even though I already submitted the grades for my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">crypto course</a>, I can now take the time and send students detailed feedback on their final projects. Typically,  both students and faculty tend to be focused on the ‚Äúbottom line‚Äù of exams or papers ‚Äì what is the final grade. The comments are viewed as of marginal importance and only serve to justify why points have been deducted.</p>



<p>Now that there is no grade, I am actually giving many more comments on the write ups, trying to focus on giving students feedback on writing and presentation that will be useful for them later on. I benefited immensely from the extensive comments on my writing that I received from my advisor Oded Goldreich. While I will never match Oded‚Äôs thoroughness and dedication, I try to at least provide some of this to my students (though unlike Oded, I use blue and not red ink, and also do not intersperse the comments with Hebrew curses for emphasis <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> )</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the task of ranking members of a population according to their qualifications based on a training set of binary outcome data. A natural approach for ranking is to reduce to prediction: first learn to predict individuals‚Äô ‚Äúprobability‚Äù of success; then rank individuals in the order specified by the predictions. A concern with this approach is that such rankings may be vulnerable to manipulation. The rank of an individual depends not only on their own qualification but also on every other individuals‚Äô qualifications, so small inaccuracies in prediction may result in a highly inaccurate and unfair induced ranking. We show how to obtain rankings that satisfy a number of desirable accuracy and fairness criteria, despite the coarseness of binary outcome data.<br/>
We develop two parallel definitions of evidence-based rankings. First, we study a semantic notion of <em>domination-compatibility</em>: if the training data suggest that members of a set <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="S"/> are on-average more qualified than the members of <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/>, then a ranking that favors <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/> over <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="S"/> (i.e., where <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="T"/> dominates <img alt="S" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="S"/>) is blatantly inconsistent with the data, and likely to be discriminatory. Our definition asks for domination-compatibility, not just for a pair of sets (e.g., majority and minority populations), but rather for every pair of sets from a rich collection <img alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{C}"/> of subpopulations. The second notion‚Äîevidence-consistency‚Äîaims at precluding even more general forms of discrimination: the ranking must be justified on the basis of consistency with the expectations for every set in the collection <img alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{C}"/>. Somewhat surprisingly, while evidence-consistency is a strictly stronger notion than domination-compatibility when the collection <img alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{C}"/> is predefined, the two notions are equivalent when the collection <img alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{C}"/> may depend on the ranking itself. Finally, we show a tight connection between evidence-based rankings and multi-calibrated predictors [HKRR‚Äô18]. This connection establishes a way to reduce the task of ranking to prediction that ensures strong guarantees of fairness in the resulting ranking.<br/>

    <summary>I am excited to announce a new program for undergraduates: The Polymath REU will run during the summer of 2020. Due to the pandemic, many students are stuck at home without a summer program. The aim of the Polymath REU program is to provide research opportunities for such students. The program consists of research projects [‚Ä¶]</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was seriously depressed for the last week, by noticeably more than my baseline amount for the new pandemic-ravaged world.  The depression seems to have been triggered by two pieces of news:</p>



<ol><li>The US Food and Drug Administration‚Äîyes, the same FDA whose failure to approve covid tests in February infamously set the stage for the deaths of 100,000 Americans‚Äîhas now <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-testing-seattle-bill-gates.html">banned</a> the Gates Foundation‚Äôs program for at-home covid testing.  This, it seems to me, is not the sort of thing that could happen in a still-functioning society, one where people valued their own and their neighbors‚Äô physical survival, and viewed rules and regulations as merely instruments to that end.  It‚Äôs the sort of thing that one imagines in the waning years of a doomed empire, when no one pretends anymore that they can fix or improve the Leviathan; they‚Äôre all just scurrying to flee the Leviathan as it collapses with a thud.  More broadly, I <em>still</em> don‚Äôt think that the depth of America‚Äôs humiliation and downfall has sunk in to most Americans.  For me, it starts and ends with a single observation: <strong>where fifty years ago we landed humans on the moon, today we can no longer make or distribute paper masks, even when hundreds of thousands of lives depend on it.</strong>  Look, there are many countries, like Taiwan and New Zealand, that managed to protect both their economies <em>and</em> their vulnerable citizens‚Äô lives, by crushing the virus early.  Then there are countries that waited, until they faced an excruciating choice between the two.  But here in the US, we‚Äôve somehow achieved the worst of both worlds‚Äîtriggering a second Great Depression while <em>also</em> utterly failing to control the virus.  Can we abandon the charade of treating this as a legible ‚Äúpolicy choice,‚Äù to be debated in earnest thinkpieces?  To me, it just feels like the death-spasm of a collapsing Leviathan.</li><li>Something that, at first glance, might seem trivial by comparison, but isn‚Äôt: the University of California system‚Äîignoring the <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/kkb-jn-standardized-testing.pdf">advice</a> of its own Academic Senate, and at the apparent insistence of its chancellor Janet Napolitano‚Äîwill now <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2020/05/24/the-story-behind-university-of-californias-landmark-decision-to-ditch-the-sat/">permanently end</a> the use of the SAT and ACT in undergraduate admissions.  This is widely expected, probably correctly, to trigger a chain reaction, whereby one US university after the next will abandon standardized tests.  As a result, admissions to the top US universities‚Äîand hence, most chances for social advancement in the US‚Äîwill henceforth be based <em>entirely</em> on shifting and nebulous criteria that rich, well-connected kids and their parents spend most of their lives figuring out, rather than merely <em>mostly</em> based on such criteria.  The last side door for smart noncomformist kids is now being slammed shut.  From now on, in the US, the <em>only</em> paths to success that clearly delineate their rules will be sports, gambling, reality TV, and the like.  In case it matters to anyone reading this, I feel certain that a 15-year-old me wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance in the emerging regime‚Äîany more than nerdy Jewish kids did in the USSR of the 1970s, or the US of the 1920s.  (As I‚Äôve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">previously recounted</a> on this blog, the US‚Äôs ‚Äúholistic‚Äù college admissions system, with its baffling-to-foreigners emphasis on ‚Äúcharacter,‚Äù ‚Äúleadership,‚Äù ‚Äúwell-roundedness,‚Äù etc. rather than test scores, originated in a successful push a century ago by the presidents of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to keep Jewish enrollments down.  Today the system fulfills precisely the same function, except against Asian-Americans rather than Jews.)  Ironically but predictably, the death of the SAT‚Äîi.e., of one of the most fearsome weapons against entrenched wealth and power ever devised‚Äîis being <em>celebrated</em> by the self-described champions of the underdog.  I have one question for those champions: do you not understand what your system will <em>actually</em> do to society‚Äôs underdogs?  Or do you understand perfectly well, and approve?</li></ol>



<p>To put it bluntly‚Äîsince events like these leave no room for euphemism‚Äîa hundred thousand Americans are now dead from covid, and hundreds of thousands more are poised to die, because smart people are no longer in charge.  And the death of the SAT will help ensure that smart people will never be <em>back</em> in charge.  Obama might be remembered by history as America‚Äôs last smart-person-in-charge, its last competent technocrat‚Äîbut one man couldn‚Äôt stop a tidal wave of stupid.</p>



<p>I know from experience what many will readers will say to all this: ‚Äúinstead of wallowing in gloom, Scott, why don‚Äôt you just make falsifiable predictions about the bad outcomes you expect from these developments, and then score yourself later?‚Äù</p>



<p>So here‚Äôs the thing about that.</p>



<p>Shortly after Trump was elected, I changed this blog‚Äôs background to black, as a small way to mourn the United States that I‚Äôd grown up thinking that I lived in, the one that had at least some ideals.  Today, with four years of hindsight, my thinking then feels <em>overly optimistic</em>: why plain black?  Why not, like, images of rotting corpses in a pit?</p>



<p>And yet, were I foolish enough to register predictions in 2016, I would‚Äôve said that within one year, Trump‚Äôs staggering incompetence would <em>surely</em> cause some catastrophe or other to grip the country‚Äîa really obvious one, with mass death and even Trump‚Äôs beloved stock market cratering.</p>



<p>And then after a year, commenters would ridicule me, because none of that had happened.  After two years, they‚Äôd ridicule me again because it <em>still</em> hadn‚Äôt happened, and after three years they‚Äôd ridicule me a third time.</p>



<p>Now it‚Äôs happened.</p>



<p>America, we now know, is like the cartoon character who runs off a cliff: it dangled in midair for three years, defying physics, before it finally looked down.</p>



<p>Look, I‚Äôm a theoretical computer scientist.  By training, I deal in asymptotics, not in constant factors.  I don‚Äôt often make predictions with deadlines; when I do, I often regret it.  It‚Äôs a good thing that I became an academic rather than an investor!  For I‚Äôve learned that the only ‚Äúoracular power‚Äù I have is to make statements like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My eyes, my brain, and the pit of my stomach are all blaring at me that the asymptotics of this situation just took a sharp turn for the worse.  Sure, for an unknown length of time, noise and constant factors could mask the effects.  But eventually, either (1) society will need to reverse what it just did, or else (2) terrible effects will spring from it, or else (3) the entire universe no longer makes sense.</p></blockquote>



<p>When I‚Äôve felt this way in the past, option (3) rarely turned out to be the right answer.</p>



<p>So, what can anyone say that will make me less depressed?  Thanks in advance!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (May 30): </span></strong>Woohoo!!  Avoiding yet another tragedy, after years of setbacks and struggles, it looks like today the US has finally launched humans into orbit, thereby recapitulating a technological achievement from 1961 that the US had already vastly surpassed by 1969.  I hereby retract the pessimism of this post.</p></div>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15 ‚Äì 19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions.</span><br/>
<b>June 22 ‚Äì July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Live EC Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions.</span><br/>
<b>July 13:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tutorial Watch Parties, Business Meeting and Poster Session</span><br/>
<b>July 14 ‚Äì 16:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> EC Conference (Paper Watch Parties, Paper Poster Sessions, and Plenaries).</span><br/>
<b>July 17 ‚Äì 22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Workshops.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee has been hard at work revisioning EC 2020 as a virtual event.¬† The event aims to emphasize opportunities afforded by the virtual format with activities that are intractable in the physical format, but not to recreate aspects of the physical conference experience that are difficult virtually.¬† Some aspects of the event will look similar to a physical conference, while some will be quite different.¬† The desiderata for the selected format are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize exposure for EC papers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize interaction between community members.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow broad global accessibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizational team studied the results of many virtual conferences that have already taken place (</span><a href="https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAMAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/243882-the-asplos-2020-online-conference-experience/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASPLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.eurosys2020.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EuroSys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://iccp2020.engr.wustl.edu/vsetup.html?fbclid=IwAR3ONLEftxPsTmW4b1oTyCjvAFWWOxWRWS4bV6kTox1yP8AUpgSAbkL76Qc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICCP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@iclr_conf/gone-virtual-lessons-from-iclr2020-1743ce6164a3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICLR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/4/20/wagon-lessons-learned"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WAGON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others, as well as the </span><a href="https://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/acm/VirtualConferences_GuideToBestPractices_CURRENT.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACM guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).¬† Some general rules of thumb are (a) prerecording talks, (b) emphasizing posters, (c) expecting about four hours a day of participation, (d) prime time is 11am-3pm ET.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee adopted a strategy that allows the minimal commitment level for authors and attendees of presenting and viewing 18 minute talks and attending activities only during the main EC week of July 13-17.¬† However, official EC events will run June 15 to July 24 and the planning committee highly encourages members of the community to enjoy a more relaxed pace where all programming is plenary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration will be mandatory but complementary with ACM SIGecom membership ($10 Professional / $5 Student) which can easily be completed online.¬† Registration will open on June 1.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15-19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To give junior researchers plenty of time to prepare for the EC conference, the mentoring workshops and tutorial live pre-recording sessions will be held the week of June 15.¬† In addition to the usual activities, junior students will be paired with senior students who will share their EC itinerary and be available for discussions of papers and events in online chat throughout the duration of the EC events.¬† There will be three tutorials, each broken into four 45 minute segments and recorded over several days and with live audiences of EC participants.¬† Students will be able to work together on exercises in between sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 22 ‚Äì July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬† EC papers will keep the usual 18-minute format.¬† The planning committee highly encourages authors to choose to pre-record their EC talks in live pre-recording sessions.¬† Each session comprises three papers and is followed by a virtual coffee break for discussion between the speakers, coauthors, and attendees.¬† Speakers and attendees are recommended to schedule for 2 hours.¬† These sessions are all plenary and will be scheduled for synergies in topic and preferred timing of the speakers.¬† These sessions begin at regular times:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Eastern/China 9:00, 13:00, 17:00, 21:00, 1:00, 5:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Central/Israel¬† 8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 24:00, 4:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mountain/Europe 7:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, 23:00, 3:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Pacific/London¬† 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00, 2:00.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect about three sessions a day over the ten weekdays between June 22 and July 3.¬† (Pre-recording sessions are optional but highly encouraged for authors of EC papers.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Conference</span></h2>
<p><b>July 13-16: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 13 is tutorial day.¬† It will include the EC business meeting and a contributed poster session for breaking results and results from other venues.¬† The main conference runs July 14-July 16 with programming from 9am-5pm Eastern.¬† This programming includes pre-recorded talk watch parties, poster discussion sessions for the papers, live plenary talks, and live highlights beyond EC.¬† The paper and poster discussion sessions will run in two-hour blocks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 1: 3-5 parallel tracks of watch parties (3 papers each), with realtime chat with the authors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 2: plenary 1-minute lightning talks for all papers, breakout room for discussion for each paper with poster (a poster is 1-4 slides in PDF). (The lightning talks and poster discussion rooms are optional but highly encouraged for authors of the session‚Äôs papers.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these watch parties will be in parallel sessions and some may be at times that are hard for some members of the community to attend, the planning committee highly encourages participation in the live pre-recording sessions (June 22-July 3) and all talks will be available for individual viewing in advance of the conference.¬†</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Workshops</span></h2>
<p><b>July 17-22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Three workshops will take place on the Friday of EC and the following week.¬† Details for these events are still being worked out by the organizers.</span></p>

    <title>Oldest Living Baseball Players- can you estimate...</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(The Baseball season is delayed or cancelled, so I post about baseball instead.)<br/>
<br/>
This post is going to ask a question that you could look up on the web. But what fun with that be?<br/>
<br/>
The following statements are true<br/>
<br/>
1) Don Larsen, a professional baseball player who played from 1953 to 1967, is still alive. He is 90 years old (or perhaps 90 years young---I don't know the state of his health).¬† He was born Aug 7, 1929. He is best know for pitching a perfect game in the World Series in 1956, pitching for the Yankees. He played for several other teams as well, via trades (this was before free agency).<br/>
(CORRECTION- I wrote this post a while back, and Don Larsen has died since then.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) Whitey Ford, a professional baseball player who played from 1950 to 1967, is still alive. He is 91 years old (or perhaps 91 years young---I don't know the state of his health).¬† He was born Oct 21,¬† 1928. He had many great seasons and is in the hall of fame. He played for the New York Yankees and no other team.<br/>
<br/>
3) From 1900 (or so) until 1962 there were 16 professional baseball teams which had 25 people each. From 1962 until 1969 there were 20 teams which had 25 people each. There were also many minor league teams.<br/>
<br/>
4) The youngest ballplayers are usually around 20. The oldest around 35. These are not exact numbers<br/>
<br/>
SO here is my question: Try to estimate<br/>
<br/>
1) How many LIVING¬† retired major league baseball players are there now who are older than Don Larsen?<br/>
<br/>
2) How many LIVING retired major league baseball players are of an age between Don and Whitey?<br/>
<br/>
3) How¬† many LIVING retired major league baseball players are older than Whitey Ford?<br/>
<br/>
Give your REASONING for your answer.<br/>
<br/></div>

Saeed Salehi is a logician at the University of Tabriz in Iran. Three years ago he gave a <a href="http://wrm17.mi.ras.ru/slides/Salehi.pdf">presentation</a> at a Moscow workshop on proofs of the diagonal lemma.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would discuss the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma">diagonal lemma</a>. </p>
<p>
The lemma is related to Georg Cantor‚Äôs famous diagonal argument yet is different. The logical version imposes requirements on when the argument applies, and requires that it be expressible within a formal system. </p>
<p>
The lemma underpins Kurt G√∂del‚Äôs famous 1931 <a href="http://www.w-k-essler.de/pdfs/goedel.pdf">proof</a> that arithmetic is incomplete. However, G√∂del did not state it as a lemma or proposition or theorem or anything else. Instead, he focused his attention on what we now call G√∂del numbering. We consider this today as ‚Äúobvious‚Äù but his paper‚Äôs title ended with ‚ÄúPart I‚Äù. And he had readied a ‚ÄúPart II‚Äù with over 100 pages of calculations should people question that his numbering scheme was expressible within the logic. </p>
<p>
Only after his proof was understood did people realize that one part, perhaps the trickiest part, could be abstracted into a powerful lemma. The tricky part is <em>not</em> the G√∂del numbering. People granted that it can be brought within the logic once they saw enough of G√∂del‚Äôs evidence, and so we may write <img alt="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}"/> for the function giving the G√∂del number of any formula <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> and use that in other formulas. The hard part is what one <em>does</em> with such expressions. </p>
<p>
This is what we will try to motivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Tracing the Lemma </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Rudolf Carnap is often credited with the first formal statement, in 1934, for instance by Eliott Mendelson in his famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250868.Introduction_to_Mathematical_Logic">textbook</a> on logic. Carnap was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap">member</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle">Vienna Circle</a>, which G√∂del frequented, and Carnap is <a href="http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00004&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=">considered</a> a giant among twentieth-century philosophers. He worked on sweeping grand problems of philosophy, including logical positivism and analysis of human language via syntax before semantics. Yet it strikes us with irony that his work on the lemma may be the best remembered.</p>
<p>
Who did the lemma first? Let‚Äôs leave that for others and move on to the mystery of how to prove the lemma once it is stated. I must say the lemma is easy to state, easy to remember, and has a short proof. But I believe that the proof is not easy to remember or even follow. </p>
<p>
Salehi‚Äôs <a href="http://wrm17.mi.ras.ru/slides/Salehi.pdf">presentation</a> quotes others‚Äô opinions about the proof:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Sam Buss: ‚ÄúIts proof [is] quite simple but rather tricky and difficult to conceptualize.‚Äù</p>

<p>

<p>
So I am not alone, and I thought it might be useful to try and unravel its proof. This exercise helped me and maybe it will help you.</p>
<p>
Here goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Stating the Lemma </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Let <img alt="{S(w)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28w%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S(w)}"/> be a formula in Peano Arithmetic (<img alt="{PA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{PA}"/>). We claim that there is some sentence <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++PA+%5Cvdash+%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). "/></p>
<p>Formally, </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{S(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S(x)}"/> is some formula in <img alt="{PA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{PA}"/>. Then there is a sentence <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> so that 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++PA+%5Cvdash+%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The beauty of this lemma is that it was used by G√∂del and others to prove various powerful theorems. For example, the lemma quickly proves this result of Alfred Tarski:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{PA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{PA}"/> is consistent. Then <i>truth</i> cannot be defined in <img alt="{PA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{PA}"/>. That is there is <b>no</b> formula <img alt="{Tr(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BTr%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Tr(x)}"/> so that for all sentences <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> <img alt="{PA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{PA}"/> proves 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%5Ciff+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). "/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The proof is this. Assume there is such a formula <img alt="{Tr(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BTr%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Tr(x)}"/>. Then use the diagonal lemma and get 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%5Ciff+%5Cneg+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)."/></p>
<p>This shows that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%5Ciff+%5Cneg+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29+%5Ciff+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). "/></p>
<p>This is a contradiction. A short proof. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Proof </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The key is to define the function <img alt="{F(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(n)}"/> as follows: Suppose that <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> is the G√∂del number of a formula of the form <img alt="{A(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A(x)}"/> for some variable <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(n) = \ulcorner A(\ulcorner A(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28n%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+A%28%5Culcorner+A%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(n) = \ulcorner A(\ulcorner A(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. "/></p>
<p>If <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> is not of this form then define <img alt="{F(n)=0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28n%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(n)=0}"/>. This is a strange function, a clever function, but a perfectly fine function, It certainly maps numbers to numbers. It is certainly recursive, actually it is clearly computable in polynomial time for any reasonable G√∂del numbering. Note: the function <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> does depend on the choice of the variable <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Thus, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+y%3D0+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+%28%5Culcorner+y%3D0+%5Curcorner%29%3D0+%5Curcorner%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner, "/></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+x%3D0+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+%28%5Culcorner+x%3D0+%5Curcorner%29%3D0+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner. "/></p>
<p>	          Now we make two definitions:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++g%28w%29+%26%5Cequiv%26+S%28F%28w%29%29+%5C%5C++++++++%5Cphi+%26%5Cequiv%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} "/></p>
<p>
Now we compute just using the definitions of <img alt="{F, g, \phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%2C+g%2C+%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F, g, \phi}"/>:</p>

<p>We are done.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> But ‚Ä¶ </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Where did this proof come from? Suppose that you forgot the proof but remember the statement of the lemma. I claim that we can then reconstruct the proof. </p>
<p>
First let‚Äôs ask: Where did the definition of the function <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> come from? Let‚Äôs see. Imagine we defined </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++g%28w%29+%26%5Cequiv%26+S%28F%28w%29%29+%5C%5C++++++++%5Cphi+%26%5Cequiv%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} "/></p>
<p>But left <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> undefined for now. Then</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        \phi &amp;=&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \\                 &amp;=&amp; S(F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner)). \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++%5Cphi+%26%3D%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5C%5C+++++++++++++++++%26%3D%26+S%28F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        \phi &amp;=&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \\                 &amp;=&amp; S(F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner)). \end{array} "/></p>
<p>But we want <img alt="{\phi = S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi+%3D+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi = S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)}"/> that happens provided:</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner) = F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Culcorner+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner) = F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). "/></p>
<p>This essentially gives the definition of the function <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/>. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> But but ‚Ä¶ </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Okay where did the definition of <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> and <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> come from? It is reasonable to define 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  g(w) \equiv S(F(w)), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28w%29+%5Cequiv+S%28F%28w%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  g(w) \equiv S(F(w)), "/></p>
<p>for some <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/>. We cannot change <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> but we can control the input to the formula <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>, so let‚Äôs put a function there. Hence the definition for <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> is not unreasonable. </p>
<p>
Okay how about the definition of <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>? Well we could argue that this is the magic step. If we are given this definition then <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> follows, by the above. I would argue that <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> is not completely surprising. The name of the lemma is after all the ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù lemma. So defining <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> as the application of <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> to itself is plausible.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Taking an Exam </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Another way to think about the diagonal lemma is imagine you are taking an exam in logic. The first question is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Prove in <img alt="{PA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{PA}"/> that for any <img alt="{S(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S(x)}"/> there is a sentence <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> so that 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner).

"/></p>
</em><p><em/>
</p></blockquote>
<p>You read the question again and think: ‚ÄúI wish I had studied harder, I should have not have checked Facebook last night. And then went out and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/>‚Äù But you think let‚Äôs not panic, let‚Äôs think.</p>
<p>
Here is what you do. You say let me define 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  g(x) = S(F(x)), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28x%29+%3D+S%28F%28x%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  g(x) = S(F(x)), "/></p>
<p>for some <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/>. You recall there was a function that depends on <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>, and changing the input from <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> to <img alt="{F(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x)}"/> seems to be safe. Okay you say, now what? I need the definition of <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/>. Hmmm let me wait on that. I recall vaguely that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> had a strange definition. I cannot recall it, so let me leave it for now.</p>
<p>
But you think: I need a sentence <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. A sentence cannot have an unbound variable. So <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> cannot be <img alt="{g(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x)}"/>. It could be <img alt="{g(m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28m%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(m)}"/> for some <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/>. But what could <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> be? How about <img alt="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}"/>. This makes 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \phi = g(\ulcorner g \urcorner). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%3D+g%28%5Culcorner+g+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \phi = g(\ulcorner g \urcorner). "/></p>
<p>It is after all the diagonal lemma. Hmmm does this work. Let‚Äôs see if this works. Wait as above I get that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> is now forced to satisfy 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) = \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) = \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner.

<p>Great this works. I think this is the proof. Wonderful. Got the first question. </p>
<p>
Let‚Äôs look at the next exam question. Oh no <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">new paper</a>, we explore how closely
the ImageNet benchmark aligns with the object recognition task it serves as a
proxy for. We find pervasive and systematic deviations of ImageNet annotations
from the ground truth, which can often be attributed to specific design choices
in the data collection pipeline. These issues indicate that ImageNet accuracy
alone might be insufficient to effectively gauge real model performance.  </i></p>

<h2 id="contextualizing-progress-on-benchmarks">Contextualizing Progress on Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Large-scale benchmarks are central to machine learning‚Äîthey serve both
as concrete targets for model development, and as proxies for assessing model
performance on real-world tasks we actually care about. However, few benchmarks
are perfect, and so as our models get increasingly better at them, we must also
ask ourselves: <i>to what extent is performance on existing benchmarks
indicative of progress on the real-world tasks that motivate them?</i></p>

<p>In this post, we will explore this question of <i>benchmark-task alignment</i>
in the context of the popular
<a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/">ImageNet object recognition dataset</a>.
Specifically, our goal is to understand how well the underlying ground truth is
captured by the dataset itself‚Äîthis dataset is, after all, what we consider
to be the gold standard during model training and evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="a-sneak-peak-into-imagenet">A sneak peak into ImageNet</h3>
<p>The ImageNet dataset contains over a million images of objects from a thousand,
quite diverse classes. Like many other benchmarks of that scale, ImageNet was
not carefully curated by experts, but instead created via crowd-sourcing,
without perfect quality control. So what does ImageNet data look like? Here are
a few image-label pairs from the dataset:</p>

<div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/0.jpg"/>
      <div class="fake_label">missile</div>
      <div class="true_label">projectile</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/1.jpg"/>
      <div class="fake_label">stage</div>
      <div class="true_label">acoustic guitar</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/2.jpg"/>
      <div class="fake_label">monastery</div>
      <div class="true_label">church</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/3.jpg"/>
      <div class="fake_label">Norwich terrier</div>
      <div class="true_label">Norfolk terrier</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>These samples appear pretty reasonable‚Ä¶but are they? Actually, while these
are indeed <i>images</i> from the dataset, the labels shown above are
<i>not</i> their actual ImageNet labels!
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/" id="reveal">[Click to see the actual ImageNet labels]</a>
Still, even though not ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù from the point of view of the ImageNet
dataset, these labels <i>do</i> correspond to actual ImageNet classes, and
appear plausible when you see them in isolation. This shows that for ImageNet
images, which capture objects in diverse real-world conditions, the ImageNet
label may not properly reflect the ground truth.</p>

<p>In our work, we dive into examining how this label misalignment actually
impacts ImageNet: how often do ImageNet labels deviate from the ground truth?
And how do shortcomings in these labels impact ImageNet-trained models?</p>

<h3 id="revisiting-the-imagenet-collection-pipeline">Revisiting the ImageNet collection pipeline</h3>
<p>Before going further, let‚Äôs take a look at how ImageNet was created. To build
such a large dataset, the creators of ImageNet had to leverage scalable methods
like automated data collection and crowd-sourcing. That is, they first selected
a set of object classes (using the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a>
hierarchy), and queried various search engines to obtain a pool of candidate
images. These candidate images were then verified by annotators on <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical
Turk (MTurk)</a> using (what we will refer to as) the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task: annotators were shown images retrieved
for a specific class
label, and were subsequently asked to select the ones that actually contain an
object of this class. Only images that multiple annotators validated ended up
in the final dataset.</p>

<div>
  <div class="stages block">
      <div class="stage rbutton block clicked" id="selection">Class Selection</div>
      <div class="stage rbutton block" id="retrieval">Image Retrieval</div>
      <div class="stage rbutton block" id="filtering">Label Validation</div>
  </div>
  <img id="stage_img" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/pipeline/selection.jpg"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Imagenet collection pipeline:</strong> Click on a
stage at the top for an illustration. </div>

<p>While this is a natural approach to scalably annotate data (and, in fact, is
commonly used to create large-scale benchmarks‚Äîe.g.,
<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/">PASCAL VOC</a>,
<a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a>, <a href="http://places.csail.mit.edu/">places</a>),
it has an important caveat. Namely, this process has an inherent bias: the
annotation task itself is phrased as a leading question. ImageNet annotators
were not asked to provide an image label, but instead only to verify if a
<i>specific</i> label (predetermined by the image retrieval process) was
<i>contained</i> in an image. Annotators had no knowledge of what the other
classes in the dataset even were, or the granularity at which they were
required to make distinctions. In fact, they were explicitly instructed to
ignore clutter and obstructions.</p>

<p>Looking back at the ImageNet samples shown above, one can see how this setup
could lead to imperfect annotations. For instance, it is unclear if the average
annotator knows the differences between a ‚ÄúNorwich terrier‚Äù and a ‚ÄúNorfolk
terrier‚Äù, especially if they don‚Äôt even know that both of these (as well as 22
other terrier breeds) are valid ImageNet classes. Also, the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task itself might be ill-suited for annotating
multi-object images‚Äîthe answer to the <span class="sc">Contains</span> question would be yes for any
object in the image that corresponds to an ImageNet class. It is not unthinkable
that the same images could have made it into ImageNet under the labels ‚Äústage‚Äù
and ‚ÄúNorwich terrier‚Äù had they come up in the search results for those classes
instead.</p>

<p>Overall, this suggests that the labeling issues in ImageNet may go beyond just
occasional annotator mistakes‚Äîthe <i>design</i> of the data collection
pipeline itself could have caused these labels to systematically deviate from
the ground truth.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosing-benchmark-task-misalignment">Diagnosing benchmark-task misalignment</h3>

<p>To characterize how wide-spread these deviations are, we first need to get a
better grasp of the ground truth for ImageNet data. In order to do this at
scale, we still need to rely on crowd-sourcing. However, in contrast to the
original label validation setup, we design a new annotation task based directly
on <i>image classification</i>. Namely, we present annotators with a set of
possible labels for a single image <i>simultaneously</i>. We then ask them to
assign one label to every object in the image, and identify what they believe
to be the main object. (Note that we intentionally ask for such fine-grained
image annotations since, as we saw before, a single label might be inherently
insufficient to capture the ground truth.)</p>

<p>Of course, we need to ensure that annotators can meaningfully perform this
task. To this end we  devise a way to narrow down the label choices they are
presented with (all thousand ImageNet classes would be nearly impossible for a
worker to choose between!). Specifically, for each image, we identify the most
relevant labels by pooling together the top-5 predictions of a diverse set of
ImageNet models and filtering them via the <span class="sc">Contains</span>
task. Note that, by doing so, we are effectively bootstrapping the existing
ImageNet labels by first using them to train models and then using model
predictions to get better annotation candidates.</p>

<p>This is what our resulting annotation task looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/main_task.jpg"/></p>

<p>We aggregate the responses from multiple annotators to get per-image estimates
of the number of objects in the image (along with their corresponding labels),
as well as which object humans tend to view as the main one.</p>

<p>We collect such <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/ImageNetMultiLabel">annotations for 10k images from the ImageNet validation
set</a>. With these more
fine-grained and accurate annotations in hand, we now examine where the
original ImageNet labels may fall short.</p>

<h3 id="multi-object-images">Multi-object images</h3>
<p>The simplest way in which ImageNet labels could deviate from the ground truth
is if the image contains multiple objects. So, the first thing we want to
understand is: how many ImageNet images contain objects from more than one
valid class?</p>

<p>It turns out: quite a few! Indeed, more than <b>20%</b> of the images contain
more than one ImageNet object. Examples:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <div class="choices_one">
    <span class="widgetheading">Inspect Image</span>
  </div>
  <div class="choices_img">
    <span class="widgetheading">Image</span>

  </div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Multi-object images:</strong> Choose an image on
the left to see the annotations we obtain for it.  </div>

<p>Looking at some of these images, it is clear that the problem is not just
natural image clutter but also the fact that certain objects are quite likely
to co-occur in the real-world‚Äîe.g., ‚Äútable lamp‚Äù and ‚Äúlamp shade‚Äù. This means
that choosing classes which in principle correspond to distinct objects (e.g.,
using WordNet) is not enough to guarantee that the corresponding images have
unambiguous labels. For example, see if you can guess the ImageNet label for
the samples below:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <span class="widgetheading" id="coclass">Chosen class pair</span>
  <div class="choices_one_full" id="co">

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Co-occurring objects:</strong> Select a class pair on the top and see if
you can identify which images correspond to each class (click on "Show Labels"
to reveal the answers).
</div>

<h4 id="model-performance-on-multi-object-images">Model performance on multi-object images</h4>

<p>So, how do models deal with images that contain multiple objects? To understand
this, we evaluate a number of models (from AlexNet to EfficientNet-B7), and
measure their accuracy (w.r.t. the ImageNet labels) on such images. We plot
these accuracies below (as a function of their full test accuracy):</p>

<canvas height="200" id="multi_drop" width="400"/>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Performance on multi-object images:</strong>
Model accuracy variation as a function of the number of objects in the image.
Hover over each data point to see the corresponding model name.
</div>

<p>Across the board, in comparison to their performance on single-object images,
models suffer around a 10% accuracy drop on multi-object ones. At the same
time, this drop more-or-less disappears if we consider a model prediction to be
correct if it matches the label of <i>any</i> valid object in the image (see
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">paper</a> for specifics).</p>

<div class="footnote">
    <strong>Aside:</strong> The original motivation of top-5 accuracy was
    exactly to accommodate such multi-label images. However, we find that, while
    it does largely account for these multi-object confusions, it also seems to
    overestimate accuracy on single-object images.
</div>

<p>Still, even though models seem to struggle with multi-object images, they
perform much better than chance (i.e., better than what one would get if they
were picking the label of an object in the image at random). This makes sense
when the image has a single prominent object that also matches the ImageNet
label. However, for a third of all multi-object images the ImageNet label does
not even match what annotators deem to be the main object in the image. Yet,
even in these cases, models still successfully predict the ImageNet label
(instead of what humans consider to be the right label for the image)!</p>

<canvas height="200" id="overfitting" width="400"/>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Performance on images with annotator-label disagreement:</strong>
Model accuracy on images where annotators do not consider the ImageNet label to
be the main object. Baseline: accuracy of picking the label of a random
prominent object in the image.
</div>

<p>Here, models seem to base their predictions on biases in the dataset which
humans do not find salient. For instance, models get high accuracy on the class
‚Äúpickelhaube‚Äù, even though, pickelhaubes are usually present in images with
other, more salient objects, such as ‚Äúmilitary uniforms‚Äù, suggesting that
ImageNet models may be overly sensitive to the presence of distinctive objects
in the image. While exploiting such biases would improve ImageNet accuracy,
this strategy might not translate to improved performance on object recognition
in the wild. Here are a few examples that seem to exhibit a similar mismatch:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <div class="choices_one">
    <span class="widgetheading">Inspect Image</span>
  </div>
  <div class="choices_img">

</div>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Annotator-label disagreement:</strong> Select an image on the left to
see the annotations we obtain for it. Notice that the ImageNet label is
different from the (annotator-selected) "main label".
</div>

<h3 id="biases-in-label-validation">Biases in label validation</h3>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the ImageNet data filtering process. Recall
that each class in ImageNet was constructed by automatically retrieving many
images and filtering them (via the <span class="sc">Contains</span> task described above). How likely
were annotators to filter out mislabeled images under this setup?</p>

<p>To understand this, we replicate the original filtering process on the existing
ImageNet images. But this time, instead of only asking annotators to check if
the image is valid with respect to its ImageNet label (i.e., the search query),
we also try several other labels (each in isolation, with different sets of
annotators).</p>

<p>We find that annotators frequently deem an image to be valid for <i>many</i>
different labels‚Äîeven when only one object is present. Typically, this occurs
when the image is ambiguous and lacks enough context (e.g. ‚Äúseashore‚Äù or
‚Äúlakeshore‚Äù), or annotators are likely confused between different semantically
similar labels (e.g., ‚Äúassault rifle‚Äù vs. ‚Äúrifle‚Äù, dog breeds). It turns out
that this confusion, at least partly, stems from the one-sidedness of the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task‚Äîi.e., asking annotators to ascertain the validity of a specific
label without them knowing about any other options. If instead we present
annotators with all the relevant labels simultaneously and ask them to choose
one (as we did in our annotation setup), this kind of label confusion is
alleviated: annotators select significantly fewer labels in total (see our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">paper</a> for details). So, even putting
annotator‚Äôs expertise aside, the specific annotation task setup itself
drastically affects the quality of the resulting dataset labels.</p>

</div>

<p>Going back to ImageNet, our findings give us reason to believe that annotators
may have had a rather limited ability to correct errors in labeling. Thus, in
certain cases, ImageNet labels were largely determined by the automated image
retrieval process‚Äîpropagating any biases or mixups this process might
introduce to the final dataset.</p>

<p>In fact, we can actually see direct evidence of that in the ImageNet
dataset‚Äîthere are pairs of classes that appear to be <i>inherently
ambiguous</i> (e.g., ‚Äúlaptop computer‚Äù and ‚Äúnotebook computer‚Äù) and neither
human annotators, nor models, can tell the corresponding images apart (see
below). If such class pairs actually overlap in terms of their ImageNet images,
it is unclear how models can learn to separate them without memorizing specific
validation examples.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="beyond-test-accuracy-human-centric-model-evaluation">Beyond test accuracy: human-centric model evaluation</h3>

<p>Performance of ImageNet-trained models is typically judged based on their
ability to predict the dataset labels‚Äîyet, as we saw above, these labels may
not fully capture the ground truth. Hence, ImageNet accuracy may not reflect
properly model performance‚Äîfor instance, measuring accuracy alone could
unfairly penalize models for certain correct predictions on  multi-object
images. So, how can we better assess model performance?</p>

<p>One approach is to measure model-human alignment directly‚Äîwe present model
predictions to annotators and ask them to gauge their validity:</p>

<canvas height="200" id="limit" width="400"/>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Human-based model evaluation:</strong> Fraction of annotators that
select a label as valid in the <span class="sc">Contains</span> task (i.e.,
selection frequency) for ImageNet labels and model predictions. Baseline:
(number of correct predictions) √ó (average selection frequency of the
ImageNet label).
</div>

<p>Surprisingly, we find that for state-of-the-art models, annotators actually
deem the prediction that models make to be valid about as often as the ImageNet
label (even when the two <i> do not</i> match). Thus, recent models may be
better at predicting the ground truth than their top-1 accuracy (w.r.t. the
ImageNet label) would indicate.</p>

<p>However, this does not imply that improving ImageNet accuracy is meaningless.
For instance, non-expert annotators may not be able to tell apart certain
fine-grained class differences (e.g., dog breeds) and for some of these images
the ImageNet label may actually match the ground truth. What it does indicate,
though, is that we are at a point where it may be hard to gauge if better
performance on ImageNet corresponds to actual progress or merely to exploiting
idiosyncrasies of the dataset.</p>

<p>For further experimental details and additional results (e.g., human confusion
matrices), take a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">our paper</a>!</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>We took a closer look at how well ImageNet aligns with the real-world object
recognition task‚Äîeven though ImageNet is used extensively, we rarely question
whether its labels actually reflect the ground truth. We saw that oftentimes
ImageNet labels do not fully capture image content‚Äîe.g., many images have
multiple (ImageNet) objects and there are classes that are inherently
ambiguous. As a result, models trained using these labels as ground truth end
up learning unintended biases and confusions.</p>

<p>Our analysis indicates that when creating datasets we must be aware of (and try
to mitigate) ways in which scalable data collection practices can skew the
corresponding annotations (see our
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias">previous post</a> for another
example of such a skew). Finally, given that such imperfections in our datasets
could be inevitable, we also need to think about how to reliably assess model
performance in their presence.</p>

    <summary>We study the MaxRes rule in the context of certifying unsatisfiability. We show that it can be exponentially more powerful than tree-like resolution, and when augmented with weakening (the system MaxResW), p-simulates tree-like resolution. In devising a lower bound technique specific to MaxRes (and not merely inheriting lower bounds from Res), we define a new semialgebraic proof system called the SubCubeSums proof system. This system, which p-simulates MaxResW, is a special case of the Sherali-Adams proof system. In expressivity, it is the integral restriction of conical juntas studied in the contexts of communication complexity and extension complexity. We show that it is not simulated by Res. Using a proof technique qualitatively different from the lower bounds that MaxResW inherits from Res, we show that Tseitin contradictions on expander graphs are hard to refute in SubCubeSums. We also establish a lower bound technique via lifting: for formulas requiring large degree in SubCubeSums, their XOR-ification requires large size in SubCubeSums.</summary>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) roughly asks what the ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù of a given string is. Informally, one can think of this as determining the degree of ‚Äúcomputational order‚Äù a string has.</p>
<p>In the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in MCSP. A series of exciting results have begun unraveling what looks to be a fascinating story. This story already reveals deep connections between MCSP and a growing list of fields, including cryptography, learning theory, structural complexity theory, average-case complexity, and circuit complexity. As an example, Santhanam recently proved a conditional equivalence between the complexity of MCSP and the existence of one-way functions.</p>
<p>This talk is split into two parts. The first part is a broad introduction to MCSP, answering the following questions: What is this problem? Why is it interesting? What do we know so far, and where might the story go next? The second part discusses recent joint work with Bruno Loff and Igor Oliveira showing that the ‚Äúmulti-output version‚Äù of MCSP is NP-hard.</p></blockquote>

Gerolamo Cardano is often credited with introducing the notion of complex numbers. In 1545, he wrote a book titled <i>Ars Magna</i>. He introduced us to numbers like <img alt="{\sqrt{-5}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B-5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{-5}}"/> in his quest to understand solutions to equations. Cardano was often short of money and gambled and played a certain board game to make money‚Äîsee the second paragraph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano#Mathematics">here</a>. </p>
<p>
Today, for amusement, Ken and I thought we‚Äôd talk about tells.</p>
<p>
What are tells? Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(poker)">says</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A tell in poker is a change in a player‚Äôs behavior or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player‚Äôs assessment of their hand. </em>
</p></blockquote>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/tell/" rel="attachment wp-att-17068"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17068" height="300" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/tell.jpg?w=201&amp;h=300" width="201"/></a></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Other Tells </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken and I have been thinking of tells in a wider sense‚Äîwhen and whether one can declare inferences amid uncertain information. Historians face this all the time. So do biographers, at least when their subjects are no longer living. We would also like to make inferences in our current world, such as about the pandemic. The stakes can be higher than in poker. In poker, if your ‚Äútell‚Äù inference is wrong and you lose, you can play another hand‚Äîunless you went all in. With science and other academic areas the attitude must be that you‚Äôre all-in all the time.</p>
<p>
Cardano furnishes several instances. Wikipedia‚Äîwhich we regard as an equilibrium of opinions‚Äîsays that Cardano </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers ‚Ä¶ [but] did not understand their properties, [which were] described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This is a negative inference from how one of Cardano‚Äôs books stops short of treating imaginary numbers as objects that follow rules. </p>
<p>
There are also questions about whether Cardano can be considered ‚Äúthe father of probability‚Äù ahead of Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Part of the problem is that Cardano‚Äôs own writings late in life recounted his first erroneous reasonings as well as final understanding in a Hamlet-like fashion. Wikipedia doubts whether he really knew the rule of multiplying probabilities of independent events, whereas the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some Laws.pdf">essay</a> by Prakash Gorroochurn cited there convinces us that he did. Similar doubt extends to how much Cardano knew about the natural sciences, as correct inferences (such as mountains with seashell fossils having once been underwater) are mixed in with what we today regard as howlers.</p>
<p>
Every staging of Shakespeare‚Äôs <i>Hamlet</i> shows a book by Cardano‚Äîor does it? In Act II, scene 2, Polonius asks, ‚ÄúWhat do you read, my lord?‚Äù; to which Hamlet first replies ‚ÄúWords words words.‚Äù Pressed on the book‚Äôs topic, Hamlet perhaps references the section ‚ÄúMisery of Old Age‚Äù in Cardano‚Äôs 1543 book <i>De Consolatione</i> but what he <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/page_102/">says</a> is so elliptical it is hard to tell. The book also includes particular allusions between sleep and death that go into Hamlet‚Äôs soliloquy opening Act III. The book had been published in England in 1573 as <i>Cardan‚Äôs Comfort</i> under the aegis of the Earl of Oxford so it was well-known. Yet the writer Italo Calvino <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pQabBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Hamlet+words+words+words+Cardano&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mu1gcM6b8E&amp;sig=ACfU3U3W7te91qlDaIIC8EeHLM1GxpR2Dw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikkNjX1MfpAhWChHIEHQaWDZsQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hamlet words words words Cardano&amp;f=false">held back</a> from the inference:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> To conclude from this that the book read by Hamlet is definitely Cardano, as is held by some scholars of Shakespeare‚Äôs sources, is perhaps unjustified. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
To be sure, there are some who believe Shakespeare‚Äôs main source was Oxford, in manuscripts if not flesh and blood. One reason we do not go there is that we do not see the wider community as having been able to establish reliable principles for judging what kinds of inferences are probably valid. We wonder if one could do an experiment of taking resolved cases, removing most of the information to take them down to the level of unresolved cases, and seeing what kinds of inferences from partial information would have worked.  That‚Äôs not our expertise, but within our expertise in math and CS, we wonder if a little experiment will be helpful.</p>
<p>
To set the idea, note that imaginary numbers are also called complex numbers. Yet the term complex numbers can mean other things. Besides numbers like <img alt="{2 + 3i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%2B+3i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2 + 3i}"/> it also can mean how hard it is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_complexity">construct</a> a number. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In number theory, the integer complexity of an integer is the smallest number of ones that can be used to represent it using ones and any number of additions, multiplications, and parentheses. It is always within a constant factor of the logarithm of the given integer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
How easy is it to tell what kind of ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù is meant if you only have partial information?  We don‚Äôt only mean scope-of-terminology issues; often a well-defined math object is used in multiple areas.  Let‚Äôs try an experiment.</p>

    <title>TR20-081 |  Algebraic Hardness versus Randomness in Low Characteristic | 

	Robert Andrews</title>
    <summary>We show that lower bounds for explicit constant-variate polynomials over fields of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ are sufficient to derandomize polynomial identity testing over fields of characteristic $p$. In this setting, existing work on hardness-randomness tradeoffs for polynomial identity testing requires either the characteristic to be sufficiently large or the notion of hardness to be stronger than the standard syntactic notion of hardness used in algebraic complexity. Our results make no restriction on the characteristic of the field and use standard notions of hardness.

We do this by combining the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with a white-box procedure to take $p$-th roots of circuits computing a $p$-th power over fields of characteristic $p$. When the number of variables appearing in the circuit is bounded by some constant, this procedure turns out to be efficient, which allows us to bypass difficulties related to factoring circuits in characteristic $p$.

We also combine the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with recent ``bootstrapping'' results in polynomial identity testing to show that a sufficiently-hard family of explicit constant-variate polynomials yields a near-complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing. This result holds over fields of both zero and positive characteristic and complements a recent work of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon, who obtained a slightly stronger statement over fields of characteristic zero.</summary>

    <title>TR20-080 |  Continuous LWE | 

	Joan Bruna, 

	Oded Regev, 

	Min Jae Song, 

	Yi Tang</title>
    <summary>We introduce a continuous analogue of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, which we name CLWE. We give a polynomial-time quantum reduction from worst-case lattice problems to CLWE, showing that CLWE enjoys similar hardness guarantees to those of LWE. Alternatively, our result can also be seen as opening new avenues of (quantum) attacks on lattice problems. Our work resolves an open problem regarding the computational complexity of learning mixtures of Gaussians without separability assumptions (Diakonikolas 2016, Moitra 2018). As an additional motivation, (a slight variant of) CLWE was considered in the context of robust machine learning (Diakonikolas et al.~FOCS 2017), where hardness in the statistical query (SQ) model was shown; our work addresses the open question regarding its computational hardness (Bubeck et al.~ICML 2019).</summary>

    <title>TR20-079 |  On Minimizing Regular Expressions Without Kleene Star | 

	Hermann Gruber , 

	Markus Holzer, 

	Simon Wolfsteiner</title>
    <summary>Finite languages lie at the heart of literally every regular expression. Therefore, we investigate the approximation complexity of minimizing regular expressions without Kleene star, or, equivalently, regular expressions describing finite languages. On the side of approximation hardness, given such an expression of size~$s$, we prove that it is impossible to approximate the minimum size required by an equivalent regular expression within a factor of  $O\left(\frac{s}{(\log s)^{2+\delta}}\right)$ if the running time is bounded by a quasipolynomial function depending on~$\delta$, for every $\delta&gt;0$, unless the exponential time hypothesis (ETH) fails. For approximation ratio~$O(s^{1-\delta})$, we prove an exponential time lower bound depending on~$\delta$, assuming ETH. The lower bounds apply for alphabets of constant size. On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem can be approximated in polynomial time within~$O(\frac{s\log\log s}{\log s})$, with~$s$ being the size of the given regular expression. For constant alphabet size, the bound improves to~$O(\frac{s}{\log s})$. Finally, we devise a familiy of superpolynomial approximation algorithms that attain the performance ratios of the lower bounds, while their running times are only slightly above those excluded by the ETH.</summary>

Agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> is willing to reveal <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> if and only if she receives a payment of at least <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Our goal is to allocate higher payments to agents with higher <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>‚Äòs, in order to get an unbiased sample. However, we also must obey an budget constraint: we cannot spend more than <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/> total. The solution is to transact non-deterministically: with some probability, offer to purchase an agent‚Äôs data. Agents with higher costs will receive higher payments, but lower transaction probabilities.</p>

<p>We assume that agents are drawn at random independently from some distribution. Our crucial assumption is that we known the marginal distribution of agent costs, which we denote <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/> (we will explore later what happens when this assumption is removed). However, we do not know the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and that distribution can be arbitrarily correlated with <img alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}"/>. As mentioned above, one might expect agents with less ‚Äúdesirable‚Äù <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‚Äòs may have higher costs, but one can imagine more complex correlations as well.</p>

<p>Our mechanisms consist of two parts: an <em>allocation rule</em> <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/>, and a <em>payment rule</em> <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>. Given <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>, the mechanism works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Ask each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> to report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>. Let <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> denote the actual reported cost.</li><li>With probability <img alt="A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c)"/>, we purchase the agent‚Äôs data and pay her <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/>. With probability <img alt="1 - A(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1 - A(c)"/>, we do not buy the data, and no payment is made.</li><li>At the end, use the data we learned to form an estimate of the population average of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>. Let <img alt="\bar{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z}"/> denote our estimate.</li></ol>

<p>In this model, agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>‚Äòs expected utility for reporting <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/> is <img alt="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_i%28c%29+%3D+A%28c%29+%28P%28c%29+-+c_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)"/>.</p>

<p>We have four main requirements:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Truthfulness. </strong>It should be in each agent‚Äôs best interest to truthfully report <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/>.</li><li><strong>Individual rationality. </strong>Agents should not receive negative utility if they are honest, i.e., we should have <img alt="P(c_i) \ge c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c_i%29+%5Cge+c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c_i) \ge c_i"/> for all <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>.</li><li><strong>Budget constrained. </strong>Our total expected payment should not exceed <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="B"/>, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Csum_i+A%28c_i%29+P%28c_i%29%5D+%5Cle+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B"/>.</li><li><strong>Unbiased. </strong>Our estimate isn‚Äôt consistently too high or too low. Specifically, the expected value of our estimate should be equal to the true average, i.e., <img alt="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%5D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bz_i%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]"/>.</li></ol>

<p>Lack of bias doesn‚Äôt mean that our estimate is accurate, however. To this end, our primary goal is to <strong>minimize the variance</strong>, subject to the mechanism obeying the four above criteria. We evaluate variance via a worst-case framework: given a mechanism, we wish minimize the variance with respect to the worst-case distribution of agents for that mechanism. The idea is that the distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‚Äòs is not known to the mechanism, so we require it to perform well for all distributions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1729" height="203" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/goal.jpg?w=970" width="438"/>Goal.</figure></div>

<p>When we refer to the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù mechanism, we mean minimum variance, subject to being truthful, individually rational, budget constrained, and unbiased (henceforth TIBU).</p>

<p><strong>The Horvitz Thomspon Estimator</strong></p>

<p>Once we have learned the <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‚Äòs, how do we actual form an estimate of the mean? Luckily for us, this question has a simple answer. If we restrict ourselves to linear unbiased estimators, there is a unique way to do this, known as the <em>Horvitz-Thompson estimator</em>:</p>

<p><img alt="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum%5Climits_i+%5Ccfrac%7Bz_i%7D%7BA%28c_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}"/></p>

<p>Thus our task is simply to choose <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A"/> and <img alt="P" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P"/>.</p>

<h2>Approach #1</h2>

<p>This model was first considered by Roth and Schoenebeck (2012). They are able to characterize a mechanism which is TIBU and has variance at most <img alt="1/n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="1/n"/> more than the optimal variance, where <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="n"/> is the number of agents. However, they do make the strong assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Their approach relies on <em>Take-It-Or-Leave-It</em> mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by a distribution $G$ over the positive real numbers, and works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Each agent <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/> reports a cost <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>.</li><li>Sample a payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/> from <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>.</li><li>If <img alt="p \ge c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cge+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p \ge c"/>, buy the agent‚Äôs data with payment <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p"/>. If <img alt="p &lt; c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="p &lt; c"/>, do not buy the agent‚Äôs data.</li></ol>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="212" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzLmHAWwAAEPkl.jpg" width="293"/></figure></div>

<p>This amounts to an allocation rule <img alt="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29+%3D+1+-+%5Ctext%7BPr%7D%5Bp%5Cge+c%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]"/>, and a payment rule <img alt="P(c)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="P(c)"/> equal to the distribution <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/> conditioned on being at least <img alt="c" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c"/>. The authors show that these mechanisms are fully general, i.e., any allocation and payment rule can be implemented by a Take-It-Or-Leave-It mechanism.</p>

<p>The proof of their main result is primarily based on using the calculus of variations to optimize over the space of distributions <img alt="G" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="G"/>. The paper contains some additional results, for example regarding an alternate model where we wish to minimize the budget, but that is outside the scope of this blog post.</p>

<h2>Approach #2</h2>

<p>Although the above result is a great step, it leaves room for improvement. First of all, the assumption that <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> is binary is quite strong, and does not apply to our running example of body weight. Secondly, their mechanism does not quite achieve the optimal variance. Chen et al. (2018) remedy both of these concerns. That is, they allow <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/> to be any real number, and they characterize the TIBU mechanism with optimal variance. Their result also generalizes to more complex statistical estimates, not just the average <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>, and it holds for both continuous and discrete agent distributions.</p>

<p>The approach of Chen et al. (2018) is based on two primary ideas. First, they show that any monotone allocation rule (i.e., we are always less likely to purchase data from an agent with higher cost) can be implemented in a TIBU fashion by a unique payment rule. Thus we only need to identify the optimal allocation rule. (This is similar to the standard result from auction theory about implementable monotone allocation rules (Myerson 1981).)</p>

<p>The second idea is to view the problem as a zero-sum game between ourselves (the mechanism designer) and an adversary who chooses the distribution of agents. Given a distribution, we choose an allocation rule to minimize the variance, and given an allocation rule, the adversary chooses a distribution to maximize the variance.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" height="297" src="https://i2.wp.com/marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Zero-Sum-Game.jpg?fit=511%2C521&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=1200%2C1223.4833659491" width="292"/></figure></div>

<p>The authors are able to solve for the equilibrium of this game and thus identify the TIBU mechanism with minimum possible variance.</p>

<h2>Approach #3</h2>

<p>Approach #2 gave us our desired result: a minimum variance mechanism subject to our four desired properties (TIBU), for any distribution of <img alt="z_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="z_i"/>‚Äòs. But we are still making a very strong assumption: that we know the distribution of agent costs.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1766" height="230" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/prior.png?w=500" width="427"/></figure></div>

<p>Chen and Zheng (2019) do away with this assumption in a follow-up paper. They consider a model where the mechanism has no prior information on the distribution of costs (or on the distribution of data), and $n$ agents arrive one-by-one in a uniformly random order. Each agent reports a cost, and we decide whether to buy her data, and what to pay her. In order to price well, we need to learn the cost distribution, but we must do this while simultaneously making irrevocable purchasing decisions. The main result is a TIBU mechanism with variance at most a constant factor worse than optimal.</p>

<p>The authors note that after each step <img alt="i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="i"/>, the reported costs up to that point induce an empirical cost distribution <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. Using the results of Chen et al. (2018), we can determine the optimal mechanism for <img alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\mathcal{F}_i"/>. The basic idea is to use that mechanism for the current step, learn a new agent cost <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> (note that the agent reports <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="c_i"/> regardless of whether we purchase her data) and then update our empirical distribution accordingly. (The authors actually end up using an approximately optimal allocation rule, but the idea is the same.) The mechanism also uses more budget in the earlier rounds, to make up for the pricing being less accurate.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>In this post, we considered the problem of surveying a sensitive attribute where an agent‚Äôs data may be correlated with their willingness to participate. We discussed three different approaches, all of which rely of giving higher payments to agents with higher costs, in order to incentivize them to participate and to obtain an unbiased estimate. The final approach was able to give a truthful, individually rational, budget feasible, and unbiased mechanism with approximately optimal variance, without making any prior assumptions on the distribution of agents.</p>

<p>However, all three of the approaches assume that agents cannot lie about the data. This is reasonable for some attributes, such as a body weight, where an agent can be asked to step onto a physical scale. However, requiring participants come in person to a particular location will certainly lead to less engagement. Furthermore, for other sensitive attributes, there may not be a verifiable way to obtain the data. Future work could investigate alternative models where this assumption is not necessary. For example, perhaps agents do not maliciously lie, but rather are simply inaccurate at reporting their own attributes. For example, research has demonstrated that people consistently over-report height and under-report weight (e.g., Gorber et al., 2007). Could a mechanism learn the pattern of inaccuracy and compensate for that to still obtain an unbiased estimate?</p>
