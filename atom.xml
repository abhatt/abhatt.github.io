    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many of you will have seen the happy news today that Avi Wigderson and László Lovász <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/c76389/seksjon/vis.html?tid=76390&amp;strukt_tid=76389">share this year’s Abel Prize</a> (which now contends with the Fields Medal for the highest award in pure math).  This is only the second time that the Abel Prize has been given wholly or partly for work in theoretical computer science, after <a href="https://www.abelprize.no/c54147/seksjon/vis.html?tid=54148">Szemerédi</a> in 2012.  See also the articles in <em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/avi-wigderson-and-laszlo-lovasz-win-abel-prize-20210317/">Quanta</a></em> or the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/science/abel-prize-mathematics.html">NYT</a>, which actually say most of what I would’ve said for a lay audience about Wigderson’s and Lovász’s most famous research results and their importance (except, no, Avi hasn’t <em>yet</em> proved P=BPP, just taken some major steps toward it…).</p>



<p>On a personal note, Avi was both my and my wife Dana’s postdoctoral advisor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.  He’s been an <em>unbelievably</em> important mentor to both of us, as he’s been for dozens of others in the CS theory community.  Back in 2007, I also had the privilege of working closely with Avi for months on our <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/alg.pdf">Algebrization</a> paper.  Now would be a fine time to revisit <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2925">Avi’s Permanent Impact on Me</a> (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLxC3rGeWBI">watch the YouTube video</a>), which is the talk I gave at IAS in 2016 on the occasion of Avi’s 60th birthday.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to both Avi and László!</p></div>

I remember watching a Met taped videocast of Die Walküre with my daughter, enjoying the production but telling her "Do you realize we are watching an opera composed by an anti-Semite and conducted by a child molester?"  Can you separate art from artist?</p></div>

<p>The Abel Prize was awarded earlier today to László Lovász and Avi Wigderson</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>“for their foundational contributions to theoretical computer science and discrete </em><em>mathematics, and their leading role in shaping them into central fields of modern </em><em>mathematics.”</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to Laci and Avi, to their families, and to the communities of theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Let me quote one more sentence from the citation:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993366;"><em>“They have both made fundamental contributions to understanding randomness in computation and in exploring the boundaries of efficient computation.” </em></span></p></blockquote>

<p>
Neil L. is a Leprechaun. He has been visiting me or Ken once every year since we started GLL. We had never seen a leprechaun before we began the blog—there must be some connection.</p>
<p>
Today we want to share the experience we had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>
Here is my best reconstruction of what happened:</p>
<p>
It was Tuesday, already St. Patrick’s Day in Ireland, and Ken and I were on a Zoom connection working late. We had agreed to skip any post highlighting Neil. We intended to highlight another female mathematician or computer scientist. And Neil is definitely not a female.</p>
<p>
We never know in advance whether or when Neil is coming, but this time we took some steps. First, I am not where I was, and I made the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">finding</a> task harder. Kathryn set up mirrors in my new study, since leprechauns fear being held by a stare. Ken is where he’s always been, but being still a few days from his first vaccination, knew Neil would respect the CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>
We thought all was well and were discussing Hilbert’s Tenth until Ken spotted the puff of green smoke in a mirror behind me. Before he could warn me I heard the familiar voice to my side:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Top of the evening to ye.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I might have let him take off his mask and get comfortable, but instead I retorted, “Neil, thanks for visiting, but Ken and I have other plans. This whole month is dedicated to honor female researchers. So nice to see you as always, but …”</p>
<p>
Neil smiled—we could tell that through his mask—and said:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Well, we could talk about a certain female Leprechaun—one who just solved a big problem in complexity. A problem that rhymes with “slower hounds in crime.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Dilemma </h2><p/>
<p>
I was doubly confused: once by the cryptic rhyme, but then because I realized Neil—masked or not—was simply, provably <b>lying</b>. I hesitated to confront Neil because I recalled a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/274015958551660685/">book</a> titled <em>Leprechauns Never Lie</em>, but Ken flashed the proof by sharing his screen over Zoom:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Neil, there <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/no-female-leprechauns_n_1355121">are no</a> female leprechauns. We all <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">discussed</a> this two St. Patrick’s Days ago. Quoting my link: <i>there is no record in Irish folklore of leprechauns having a female counterpart in their ranks or even a solid record of how they procreate or reproduce.</i>” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken and I realized there was more than just the truth or female researchers at stake: a leprechaun caught in transgression must surrender his treasure. <em>His</em> treasure. But that was bound to make Neil extra tricky.</p>
<p>
Neil was right on that wavelength, because his first words in reply were:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Before we proceed, there is a matter about my pot of gold that we must resolve. And it will tie to the larger matter at hand. I need expert help, and ye be the two best I know to ask.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/pot.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18352" height="120" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/pot.png?w=120&amp;h=120" width="120"/></a></p>
<p>
What would Neil need to ask <em>us</em>? We had always tried to pin him down into telling us the answer to P=NP. Remember, a leprechaun cannot lie, so his answer would rule. So we said, “what do you need to ask?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I need to ask you about the meaning of P=NP.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Question </h2><p/>
<p>
I bid Neil sit down and remove his mask to puff his pipe. I started to give the same answer I’ve given in countless classrooms: “P=NP means that a certain big class of problems could all be solved by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time. Polynomial time means…” But Ken cut in more pointedly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Neil, why do <b>you</b> need to know about P=NP? And to know <b>what</b> about it?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil puffed on his pipe and gave what we could tell was an honest answer:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We Leprechauns have started thinking about going modern—belonging to the 21st century. I plan on getting rid of my pot of gold coins and going into Bitcoins. Those pots are heavy to lug for us wee folk. But to judge if it be safe in our world, we need to know the gist and risks in your world.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I switched gears and said the gist is that Bitcoin is based on a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">blockchain</a> that creates an unambiguous single history of recorded transactions, including how the coin was earned in the first place. The history does not need to be maintained by any trusted party—it is decentralized, and any party can access it to provide a proof of a record. Ah, but if P=NP…</p>
<p>
Ken cut in: “If P <em>effectively</em> equals NP. Not the <img alt="{n^{100}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B100%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> time for SAT or the huge constants from forbidden-minor sets kind of P=NP. If you can be really efficient at it then you can spoof a proof of an alternative history of records, one to your gain, or certainly put confidence in the other side’s version of events in doubt. Actually, something weaker than P=NP suffices.” We were next going to educate Neil on crypto, but he cut us off.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We ken that </em>cheana féin<em>—well already. But what if your world have <b>no unambiguous single histories</b> to begin with? How déan that change the effective meaning of P=NP?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Law and Lore </h2><p/>
<p>
The essence of Neil’s question escaped us at first. We replied that the notion of “history” involved was like a computation by a deterministic Turing machine <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and time is uniquely defined by its sequence of configurations <img alt="{I \vdash_M J \vdash_M K \vdash_M\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI+%5Cvdash_M+J+%5Cvdash_M+K+%5Cvdash_M%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> Ah, Neil replied, cannot there be a <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is reached by two separate paths, <img alt="{J \vdash_M K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ+%5Cvdash_M+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{J' \vdash_M K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27+%5Cvdash_M+K%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>? If you are at <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and yet to go to <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> you may have no inkling of <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> at present—your present.</p>
<p>
Ken cut in by saying that every computation can be performed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing">reversible</a> Turing machine <img alt="{M'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—so that there is only one possible past history—and that <img alt="{M'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is built from <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by propagating part of the computation’s history somewhat as blockchain does. But that did not help our argument with Neil. When Ken brought up the reversibility of quantum computation, Neil was ready with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_histories">Consistent Histories</a> interpretation of quantum mechanics. The determinism of quantum evolution is at a “bird’s eye” level higher up, whereas in our “frog’s eye” experience the theory gives us probabilities over alternative histories <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and <i>consistency</i> rather than <i>unique actuality</i> is the criterion for their viability.</p>
<p>
At this point I started to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_the_stone#Origin">kick a stone</a> at Neil about there being just one flesh-and-blood real world, with natural laws and a unique history, but his next words cut to the quick:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “On what basis then did ye dun me for speaking o’ female leprechauns? On the basis of <b>lore</b>, ye said. But is that as unchanging as the stone ye would kick at me?” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken got what Neil was saying and flashed a topical item on his Zoom screen:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/lynettewukie.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18353" height="245" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/03/lynettewukie.png?w=550&amp;h=245" width="550"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
“This came <em>after</em> our discussion two years <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/16/leprechauns-go-universal/">ago</a>—in which you referenced Notre Dame—but maybe you are right that its significance is <em>before</em>.”</p>
<p>
I told Neil I still don’t agree about histories, but I withdrew our claim on his gold. Ken showed his face back on Zoom and was looking impatient so I gave him the floor.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “What Neil is on about is that many things we’d consider aspects of Leprechaun World are really theorized properties of our world. So we must ask, what if they are just one world?</em></p><em>
<p>
Take Bitcoin. Now it’s obvious why Neil and friends want to get involved with Bitcoin. There are so many more ways to play tricks with it than with pots of physical gold. We wrote <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/17/leprechauns-stay-home/">last year</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/leprechauns-are-tricky/">many</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/leprechauns-are-multiplying/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/03/17/happy-st-patricks-day-2/">before</a> about the gaming and crypto tricks they can play. </p>
</em><p><em>
But it’s nothing that we can’t do ourselves. So leprechauns make their pots of gold vanish? We’ve done that via Bitcoin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">quite</a> to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/uk-man-makes-last-ditch-effort-to-recover-lost-bitcoin-hard-drive.html">perfection</a>—hundreds of millions of dollars poof!, no leprechauns involved.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Neil’s Slower Hounds </h2><p/>
<p>
Ken was about to say that this was the larger context of Neil’s question about P=NP but I recalled the second thing Neil said at the start and wanted something in return for letting go his gold. “Neil—I can grant female leprechauns but you said something else: that one proved a breakthrough in complexity. You said it rhymed with “slower hounds in crime”—ah, <em>lower bounds on time</em>. Neil puffed and said, </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Aye.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Can you tell us what she proved? We answered your question—and since you raised this to begin with, it’s only fair.” Ken chimed in by asking, “no one we know in our field is a leprechaun, right?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I cannae tell ye in the here of now, for a reason that ye conceded to me. Ye will appreciate something from <img alt="{J'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%27%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> when ye reach <img alt="{K}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from <img alt="{J}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BJ%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. So I shall leave ye do what ye be doing.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil turned as if about to wisp away, but a cry from me stopped him: “No final trick this time?” He gave us both a look that was sad and loving at the same time, something we didn’t know leprechauns could do. But he said,</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “No trick that ye not be increasingly doing by yourselves.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And with that he departed in a flash. The flash kicked onto my screen where Ken still was. In Ken’s place was an image I recognized as from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux_Tapestry">Bayeux</a> <a href="http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/Chronologia/Lspost11/Bayeux/bay_tama.html">Tapestry</a>—that great record of history a millennium ago—until I looked a little closer.</p>

discrete sets of points. We are interested in finding the shortest subsequence

the original polygonal curve under the Hausdorff or the Fr\'echet distance. For
both these distance measures, we present polynomial-time algorithms for this

computation becomes less powerful than or equivalent to classical computation.
Such classically simulatable circuits are of importance because they illustrate
what makes universal quantum computation different from classical computers. In
this work, we propose a novel family of classically simulatable circuits by
making use of dual-unitary quantum circuits (DUQCs), which have been recently
investigated as exactly solvable models of non-equilibrium physics, and we
characterize their computational power. Specifically, we investigate the
computational complexity of the problem of calculating local expectation values
and the sampling problem of one-dimensional DUQCs, and we generalize them to
two spatial dimensions. We reveal that a local expectation value of a DUQC is
classically simulatable at an early time, which is linear in a system length.
In contrast, in a late time, they can perform universal quantum computation,
and the problem becomes a BQP-complete problem. Moreover, classical simulation
of sampling from a DUQC turns out to be hard.

    <title>A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Special Cases of the Unbounded Subset-Sum Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1615939200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Salimi:Majid.html">Majid Salimi</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Mala:Hamid.html">Hamid Mala</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.09080">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The Unbounded Subset-Sum Problem (USSP) is defined as: given sum $s$ and a
set of integers $W\leftarrow \{p_1,\dots,p_n\}$ output a set of non-negative
integers $\{y_1,\dots,y_n\}$ such that $p_1y_1+\dots+p_ny_n=s$. The USSP is an
NP-complete problem that does not have any known polynomial-time solution.
There is a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for the USSP problem with
$O((p_{1})^{2}+n)$ time complexity and $O(p_{1})$ memory complexity, where
$p_{1}$ is the smallest element of $W$ \cite{PH}. This algorithm is polynomial
in term of the number of inputs, but exponential in the size of $p_1$.
Therefore, this solution is impractical for the large-scale problems.
</p>
<p>In this paper, first we propose an efficient polynomial-time algorithm with
$O(n)$ computational complexity for solving the specific case of the USSP where
$ s&gt; \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}q_iq_{i+1}-q_i-q_{i+1}$, $q_i$'s are the elements of a
small subset of $W$ in which $gcd$ of its elements divides $s$ and $2\le k \le
n$. Second, we present another algorithm for smaller values of $s$ with
$O(n^2)$ computational complexity that finds the answer for some inputs with a
probability between $0.5$ to $1$. Its success probability is directly related
to the number of subsets of $W$ in which $gcd$ of their elements divides $s$.
This algorithm can solve the USSP problem with large inputs in the
polynomial-time, no matter how big inputs are, but, in some special cases where
$s$ is small, it cannot find the answer.

a quantum circuit given as a black-box is larger than a given threshold. We
design a quantum algorithm for a promised version of this problem whose space
complexity is logarithmic in the size of the domain of the distribution.
Developing on top of that we further design an algorithm to estimate the
largest probability among the outcomes of that circuit. This allows to revisit
a few recently studied problems in the few-qubits scenario, namely
$k$-distinctness and its gapped version, estimating the largest frequency in an
array, and estimating the min-entropy of a distribution. In particular, our
algorithm for $k$-distinctness on $n$-sized $m$-valued arrays requires $O(\log
n + \log m)$ qubits compared to $\Omega(poly(n))$ qubits required by all the
previous algorithms, and its query complexity is optimal for $k=\Omega(n)$. We
also study reductions between the above problems and derive better lower bounds
for some of them. The time-complexities of our algorithms have a small overhead
over their query complexities making them efficiently implementable on
currently available quantum backends.

interconnections, a recent line of research work has formulated the notion of
Distributed Ledger Object (DLO), which is a concurrent object that maintains a
totally ordered sequence of records, abstracting blockchains and distributed
ledgers. Through DLO, the Atomic Appends problem, intended as the need of a
primitive able to append multiple records to distinct ledgers in an atomic way,
is studied as a basic interconnection problem among ledgers.
</p>
<p>In this work, we propose the Distributed Grow-only Set object (DSO), which
instead of maintaining a sequence of records, as in a DLO, maintains a set of
records in an immutable way: only Add and Get operations are provided. This
object is inspired by the Grow-only Set (G-Set) data type which is part of the
Conflict-free Replicated Data Types. We formally specify the object and we
provide a consensus-free Byzantine-tolerant implementation that guarantees
eventual consistency. We then use our Byzantine-tolerant DSO (BDSO)
implementation to provide consensus-free algorithmic solutions to the Atomic
Appends and Atomic Adds (the analogous problem of atomic appends applied on
G-Sets) problems, as well as to construct consensus-free Single-Writer BDLOs.
We believe that the BDSO has applications beyond the above-mentioned problems.

    <title>Strong Parallel Repetition for Unique Games on Small Set Expanders</title>

expanders can be amplified to the full Unique Games Conjecture on small set
expanders. The latter conjecture is known to imply hardness results for
problems like Balanced-Separator, Minimum-Linear-Rearrangement and
Small-Set-Expansion that are not known under the Unique Games Conjecture. Our
result follows from: (1) A transformation that fortifies any unique game on a
small set expander. (2) An improved parallel repetition theorem for fortified
games on small set expanders. Our approach avoids the known limitation on
strong parallel repetition of unique games by enlarging the alphabet
considerably before repetition. The limitation does not hold for unique games
with a sufficiently large alphabet. Prior to this work, parallel repetition
from fortification was only known for projection games, and seemed hopeless for
unique games. Perhaps surprisingly, the idea for fortification of unique games
comes from a reduction of Raghavendra and Steurer from Small-Set-Expansion to
Unique Games.

semi-discrete representation of both the 2D non-convex pieces and the strip.
The pieces and the strip are represented by a set of equidistant vertical line
segments. The discretization algorithm uses a sweep-line method and applies
minimal extensions to the line segments of a piece to ensure that
non-overlapping placement of the segments, representing two pieces, cannot
cause overlap of the original pieces. We implemented a bottom-left-fill greedy
placement procedure, using an optimized ordering of the segment overlap tests.
The C++ implementation of our algorithm uses appropriate data structures that
allow fast execution. It executes the bottom-left-fill algorithm for typical
ESICUPdata sets in a few milliseconds, even when the rotation of the pieces is
considered, and thus provides a suitable basis for integration in
metaheuristics. Moreover, we show that the algorithm scales well when the
number of pieces increases.

appears in many areas of discrete and computational geometry. In particular,
the study of centerpoints, center transversals, Ham Sandwich cuts, or $k$-edges
can all be phrased in terms of depths of certain flats with respect to one or
more point sets. In this work, we introduce the Tukey depth histogram of
$k$-flats in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to a point set $P$, which is a vector
$D^{k,d}(P)$, whose $i$'th entry $D^{k,d}_i(P)$ denotes the number of $k$-flats
spanned by $k+1$ points of $P$ that have Tukey depth $i$ with respect to $P$.
As our main result, we give a complete characterization of the depth histograms
of points, that is, for any dimension $d$ we give a description of all possible
histograms $D^{0,d}(P)$. This then allows us to compute the exact number of
possible such histograms.

introduce combinatorial resultants, a new operation on graphs that captures
properties of the Sylvester resultant of two polynomials in the algebraic
rigidity matroid. We show that every rigidity circuit has a construction tree
from $K_4$ graphs based on this operation. Our algorithm performs an algebraic
elimination guided by the construction tree, and uses classical resultants,
factorization and ideal membership. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
implemented our algorithm in Mathematica: it took less than 15 seconds on an

    <p>Since I saw it <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/03/22/uci-ecological-preserve.html">a year ago</a> and again this week, I wondered: how can I see Los Angeles from my neighborhood, 65km away? (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105869692112016165">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>)   Doesn’t the earth’s curvature get in the way? Isn’t the horizon typically 5km away?</p>

    <p>It isn’t refraction.</p>

Many LA skyscrapers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker_Hill,_Los_Angeles">on another hill</a>. Both are around 100m high, and the land between is low and flat. That turns out to be almost exactly the right altitude for mutual visibility, even though a single hill would have to be 400m high to see as far.</p>

    <title>TR21-041 |  An Efficient Coding Theorem via Probabilistic Representations and its Applications | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>A probabilistic representation of a string $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ is given by the code of a randomized algorithm that outputs $x$ with high probability [Oliveira, ICALP 2019]. We employ probabilistic representations to establish the first unconditional Coding Theorem in time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. More precisely, we show that if a distribution ensemble $\mathcal{D}_m$ can be uniformly sampled in time $T(m)$ and generates a string $x \in \{0,1\}^*$ with probability at least $\delta$, then $x$ admits a time-bounded probabilistic representation of complexity $O(\log(1/\delta) + \log (T) + \log(m))$. Under mild assumptions, a representation of this form can be  computed from $x$ and the code of the sampler in time polynomial in $n = |x|$. 
		
We derive consequences of this result relevant to the study of data compression, pseudodeterministic algorithms, time hierarchies for sampling distributions, and complexity lower bounds. In particular, we describe an instance-based search-to-decision reduction for Levin's Kt complexity [Levin, Information and Control 1984] and its probabilistic analogue rKt [Oliveira, ICALP 2019]. As a consequence, if a string $x$ admits a succinct time-bounded representation, then a near-optimal representation can be generated from $x$ with high probability in polynomial time. This partially addresses in a time-bounded setting a question from [Levin, Information and Control 1984] on the efficiency of computing an  optimal encoding of a string.</summary>

    <title>TR21-040 |  Majority vs. Approximate Linear Sum and Average-Case Complexity Below NC1 | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Xin Lyu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira</title>
    <summary>We develop a general framework that characterizes strong average-case lower bounds against circuit classes $\mathcal{C}$ contained in $\mathrm{NC}^1$, such as $\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ and $\mathrm{ACC}^0$. We apply this framework to show:

- Generic seed reduction: Pseudorandom generators (PRGs) against $\mathcal{C}$ of seed length $\leq n -1$ and error $\varepsilon(n) = n^{-\omega(1)}$ can be converted into PRGs of sub-polynomial seed length.

- Hardness under natural distributions: If $\mathrm{E}$ (deterministic exponential time) is average-case hard against $\mathcal{C}$ under some distribution, then $\mathrm{E}$ is average-case hard against $\mathcal{C}$ under the uniform distribution.

- Equivalence between worst-case and average-case hardness: Worst-case lower bounds against $\mathrm{MAJ} \circ \mathcal{C}$ for problems in $E$ are equivalent to strong average-case lower bounds against $\mathcal{C}$. This can be seen as a certain converse to the Discriminator Lemma [Hajnal et al., JCSS'93].

These results were not known to hold for circuit classes that do not compute majority. Additionally, we prove that classical and recent approaches to worst-case lower bounds against $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ via communication lower bounds for NOF multi-party  protocols [Hastad and Goldmann, CC'91; Razborov and Wigderson, IPL'93] and Torus polynomials degree lower bounds [Bhrushundi et al., ITCS'19] also imply strong average-case hardness against $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ under the uniform distribution.

Crucial to these results is the use of non-black-box hardness amplification techniques and the interplay between Majority ($\mathrm{MAJ}$) and Approximate Linear Sum ($\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$) gates. Roughly speaking, while a $\mathrm{MAJ}$ gate outputs $1$ when the sum of the $m$ input bits is at least $m/2$, a $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gate computes a real-valued bounded weighted sum of the input bits and outputs $1$ (resp. $0$) if the sum is close to $1$ (resp. close to $0$), with the promise that one of the two cases always holds. As part of our framework, we explore ideas introduced in [Chen and Ren, STOC'20] to show that, for the purpose of proving lower bounds, a top layer $MAJ$ gate is equivalent to a (weaker) $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gate. Motivated by this result, we extend the algorithmic method and establish stronger lower bounds against bounded-depth circuits with layers of $\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ gates. Among them, we prove that:
    
- Lower bound: $\mathrm{NQP}$ does not admit fixed quasi-polynomial size $\mathrm{MAJ} \circ \widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}} \circ \mathrm{ACC}^0 \circ \mathrm{THR}$ circuits.

This is the first explicit lower bound against circuits with distinct layers of $\mathrm{MAJ}$, $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$, and $\mathrm{THR}$ gates. Consequently, if the aforementioned equivalence between $\mathrm{MAJ}$ and $\widetilde{\mathrm{SUM}}$ as a top gate can be extended to intermediate layers, long sought-after lower bounds against the class $\mathrm{THR} \circ \mathrm{THR}$ of depth-$2$ polynomial-size threshold circuits would follow.</summary>

    <title>TR21-039 |  Pseudodeterministic Algorithms and the Structure of Probabilistic Time | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira, 

	Rahul Santhanam</title>
    <summary>We connect the study of pseudodeterministic algorithms to two major open problems about the structural complexity of $BPTIME$: proving hierarchy theorems and showing the existence of complete problems. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows.

1. A new pseudorandom generator and its consequences: We build on techniques developed to prove hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time with advice (Fortnow and Santhanam, FOCS 2004) to construct the first unconditional pseudorandom generator of polynomial stretch computable in pseudodeterministic polynomial time (with one bit of advice) that is secure infinitely often against polynomial-time computations.  As an application of this construction, we obtain new results about the complexity of generating and representing prime numbers. For instance, we show unconditionally for each $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ that infinitely many primes $p_n$ have a succinct representation in the following sense: there is a fixed probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that generates $p_n$ with high probability from its succinct representation of size $O(|p_n|^{\varepsilon})$. This offers an exponential improvement over the running time of previous results, and shows that infinitely many primes have succinct and efficient representations. 
		
2. Structural results for probabilistic time from pseudodeterministic algorithms: Oliveira and Santhanam (STOC 2017) established unconditionally that there is a pseudodeterministic algorithm for the Circuit Acceptance Probability Problem ($CAPP$) that runs in sub-exponential time and is correct with high probability over any samplable distribution on circuits on infinitely many input lengths. We show that improving  this running time or obtaining a result that holds for every large input length would imply new time hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time. In addition, we prove that a worst-case polynomial-time pseudodeterministic algorithm for $CAPP$ would imply that $BPP$ has complete problems.
		
3. Equivalence between pseudodeterministic constructions and hierarchies: We establish an equivalence between a certain explicit pseudodeterministic construction problem and the existence of strong hierarchy theorems for probabilistic time. More precisely, we show that pseudodeterministically constructing in exponential time strings of large $rKt$ complexity (Oliveira, ICALP 2019) is possible if and only if for every constructive function $T(n) \leq \exp(o(\exp(n)))$ we have $BPTIME[poly(T)] \not\subseteq i.o.BPTIME[T]/\log T$.

More generally, these results suggest new approaches for designing pseudodeterministic algorithms for search problems and for unveiling the structure of probabilistic time.</summary>

    <title>TR21-038 |  Post-Quantum Succinct Arguments | 

	Alessandro Chiesa, 

	Fermi Ma, 

	Nicholas Spooner, 

	Mark Zhandry</title>
    <summary>We prove that Kilian's four-message succinct argument system is post-quantum secure in the standard model when instantiated with any probabilistically checkable proof and any collapsing hash function (which in turn exist based on the post-quantum hardness of Learning with Errors). 

At the heart of our proof is a new "measure-and-repair" quantum rewinding procedure that achieves asymptotically optimal knowledge error.</summary>

Emma Haruka Iwao set an official Guinness world record in 2019 by calculating pi to <b>31,415,926,535,897</b> digits. If she had calculated it to <b>62,831,853,071,795</b> digits, she might still hold that <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66179-most-accurate-value-of-pi">record</a> today.</p>
<p>
Today, Pi Day (3/14), we ask why <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> was affixed to the value <b>3.141592653589793…</b><br/>
<span id="more-18335"/></p>
<p>
The main alternatives are the values we currently call <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Neither would have caused any extra difficulty for Iwao. The methods she used, including the <a href="http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/">y-cruncher</a> implementation of the fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm">algorithm</a> of David and Gregory Chudnovsky, could adapt immediately to a factor of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> either way. </p>
<p>
Two things that stand out to us from Iwao’s <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/most-calculated-digits-pi/">story</a> told on Google’s blogs, besides her commanding the power of Google’s cloud services to manage 170 terabytes of data over 121 days for the calculation, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>She was inspired while growing up in Japan by the current record holders being Japanese professors, one of whom she later worked for as a student.
</li><li>There was a quicker checking phase for the final product—in particular, for the 8,956,768,817,536 new digits. This used a mixture of two versions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe_formula">BBP</a> method, which we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/making-an-algorithm-an-algorithm-bbp/">covered</a> a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/15/cooks-class-contains-pi/">few</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/16/one-mans-floor-is-another-mans-ceiling/">times</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The new <a href="https://blog.timothymullican.com/calculating-pi-my-attempt-breaking-pi-record">record</a> of 50 trillion digits by Timothy Mullican have been added to Iwao’s available for <a href="https://pi.delivery/">delivery</a> by Google. We do not know the extent to which they are <em>concretely</em> pseudorandom, despite coming from a simple rule, but that extent would be shared equally by <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>
<p/><h2> Why This Value? </h2><p/>
<p>
Giorgia Fortuna in 2015 wrote a long <a href="https://blog.wolfram.com/2015/06/28/2-pi-or-not-2-pi/">article</a> on the Wolfram blog about <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> versus <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a suggested symbol for <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which equals <b>6.2831853071795…</b> Her extensive analysis of formulas in the literature shows that the benefit of simplifying mathematical and scientific formulas that involve <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by the single symbol <img alt="{\tau}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> would be minimal, and more than offset by formulas that would incur <img alt="{\tau/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Our blogging friend Bill Gasarch has <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2007/08/is-pi-defined-in-best-way.html">written</a> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/07/2pi-day-other-holiday-possibilities.html">about</a> the value of <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and expressed opinions in support of <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as “the” value.</p>
<p>
We want to pose a different question, one suggested to me today by a reference to the 3rd-century <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui's_pi_algorithm">algorithm</a> of the Chinese mathematician Liu Hui, which efficiently generated values far more precise than what was known in the west: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Why did several separate cultures fix upon the ratio of the circumference to the diameter, rather than the ratio of the circumference to the radius, or the diameter to half the circumference? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The last ratio, <b>1.5707963267948966…</b>, strikes us as the most natural to think of in the great outdoors: You have a choice of rowing across a circular pond or walking around. How much more distance does the latter involve?</p>
<p>
We don’t know of a name for partisans of <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but those of <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> would have a natural moniker:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Sesqui<b>pi</b>dalians. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This branches off the word <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sesquipedalian">sesquipedalian</a> in an appropriate way, since <em>sesqui-</em> is Latin for one-and-a-half (as in “sesquicentennial”) and <img alt="{\frac{\pi}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpi%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is near <img alt="{1.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. But that line of thinking led us to wonder about a possible answer to the historical puzzle:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Did the ancients favor 3.14… because it was the closest to an integer of three main options? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
Is there any merit to our historical question? We leave it as a riddle until the next Pi Day—or at least until 6/28/2021.  Note also our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/15/honor-thy-fathers-correctly/">query</a> about whether the Indian mathematician Aryabhata favored <img alt="{2\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as the number of note.</p>
<p>
[some word and format tweaks, added note on Aryabhata]</p></font></font></div>

    <title>TR21-037 |  Separating ABPs and Some Structured Formulas in the Non-Commutative Setting | 

	Prerona Chatterjee</title>
    <summary>The motivating question for this work is a long standing open problem, posed by Nisan (1991), regarding the relative powers of algebraic branching programs (ABPs) and formulas in the non-commutative setting. Even though the general question continues to remain open, we make some progress towards its resolution. To that effect, we generalise the notion of ordered polynomials in the non-commutative setting (defined by Hrubes, Wigderson and Yehudayoff (2011)) to define abecedarian polynomials and models that naturally compute them.
		
Our main contribution is a possible new approach towards separating formulas and ABPs in the non-commutative setting, via lower bounds against abecedarian formulas. In particular, we show the following.
	
There is an explicit $n$-variate degree $d$ abecedarian polynomial $f_{n,d}(x)$ such that 
1. $f_{n, d}(x)$ can be computed by an abecedarian ABP of size O(nd);
2. any abecedarian formula computing $f_{n, \log n}(x)$ must have size that is super-polynomial in $n$.

We also show that a  super-polynomial lower bound against abecedarian formulas for $f_{\log n, n}(x)$ would separate the powers of formulas and ABPs in the non-commutative setting.</summary>

    <title>TR21-036 |  Ideal-theoretic Explanation of Capacity-achieving Decoding | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Madhu Sudan, 

	Siddharth Bhandari, 

	Prahladh Harsha</title>
    <summary>In this work, we present an abstract framework for some algebraic error-correcting codes with the aim of capturing codes that are list-decodable to capacity, along with their decoding algorithm. In the polynomial ideal framework, a code is specified by some ideals in a polynomial ring, messages are polynomials and their encoding is the residue modulo the ideals. We present an alternate way of viewing this class of codes in terms of linear operators, and show that this alternate view makes their algorithmic list-decodability amenable to analysis.

Our framework leads to a new class of codes that we call {\em affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes} (which are themselves a special case of the broader class we explore). These codes are common generalizations of the well-studied Folded Reed-Solomon codes and Multiplicity codes, while also capturing the less-studied Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes as well as a large family of codes that were not previously known/studied. 

More significantly our framework also captures the algorithmic list-decodability of the constituent codes. Specifically, we present a unified view of the decoding algorithm for ideal-theoretic codes and show that the decodability reduces to the analysis of the distance of some related codes. We show that good bounds on this distance lead to capacity-achieving performance of the underlying code, providing a unifying explanation of known capacity-achieving results. In the specific case of affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes, our framework shows that they are list-decodable up to capacity (for appropriate setting of the parameters), thereby unifying the previous results for Folded Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity and Additive Folded Reed-Solomon codes.</summary>

Marta Sved was a Hungarian mathematician who in 1930 moved to Down Under and became a teacher of math at the University of Adelaide. Over fifty years later, in 1985, Sved got a PhD. Clearly Liebman’s quote applies to Sved’s pursuit of a PhD. </p>
<p>
Today I cannot resist talking about a particular <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191325/http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Sved50816668.pdf">paper</a> of hers in the Mathematics Magazine—Volume 63 Number 1, February 1990: </p>

<p>
Mathematics Magazine is a reviewed journal that focuses on exposition, history, and connections to other parts of math. I am a longtime reader of this journal. I have been getting this and other similar math mag’s for years. I am sure I saw this paper and the theorem. I did not see any reason to be overly excited by the result. However, the theorem plays a critical role in solving a long time open problem.</p>
<p>
Note, this paper did not make the cover, but I believe it should have. To see why we must look at the famous Hilbert Tenth Problem. </p>
<p/><h2> Hilbert’s Tenth </h2><p/>
<p>
Recall this is the problem: Given a polynomial equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  P(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots) = 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P%28x_1%2Cx_2%2Cx_3%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>over the integers, decide if there is a solution over the integers. This was famously proved to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_tenth_problem">undecidable</a> by the combined work of Martin Davis, Hilary Putnam, and Julia Robinson, and was completed by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970. </p>
<p>
Davis, Putnam, and Robinson proved this first for exponential equations—they allowed <img alt="{x^y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Later, Matiyasevich showed how to express exponentiation in by polynomials—this completed the proof. </p>
<p>
Solving a famous open problem only increases our interest in related questions. One class of questions involved replacing the integers by other rings. One of the major questions is what happens if we ask for solutions to </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  P(x_1,x_2,x_3,\dots) = 0 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P%28x_1%2Cx_2%2Cx_3%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>over the rationals? This is currently open—see our <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/">posted</a> on this and two <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/hilberts-10-5th-problem/">related</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/06/19/diophantine-equations/">ones</a>, plus a topical <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/subrings.pdf">paper</a> by Bjorn Poonen, for some comments. </p>
<p/><h2> Hilbert Tenth Over Rationals </h2><p/>
<p>
Following the history of the classic version of Hilbert’s Tenth, Mihai Prunescu proved: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> It is undecidable to determine whether an exponential equation in many variables is solvable over the rationals. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This just appeared as <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/issue/E4FD92AFC9B9DE3E9855EEAFAF14A924"> The Exponential Diophantine Problem For Rationals</a> in the current issue of the JSL: </p>

It is a short paper—two pages. The key is it shows that it is possible to define the integers by an exponential equation over the rationals. Is there a Matiyasevich out there who will remove the need for exponentials? </p>
<p/><h2> Using Exponentials over the Rationals </h2><p/>
<p>
Prunescu uses the following equation: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>The solutions of this equation form a single parameterized family, and allow one to achieve the needed task:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Define the natural numbers from the rational solutions to this equation.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%3C+x+%3C+y%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are rationals so that <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then for some integer <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x = (1+1/n)^n \text{ and } y = (1+1/n)^{n+1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5En+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+y+%3D+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</em><p><em>Moreover, every <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> arises this way. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
His proof outline is to suppose that <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for rationals <img alt="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%3C+x+%3C+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then by the lemma we can recover the <i>integer</i> <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> using only addition and multiplication. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y/x = 1 + 1/n, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y%2Fx+%3D+1+%2B+1%2Fn%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>for some <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Thus, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n = \frac{x}{y-x}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bx%7D%7By-x%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>This is an amazing trick—in my opinion. </p>
<p>
Prunescu deserves a tip-of-the-hat for this insight. At the high level he is using this: Suppose that <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> rationals satisfy an equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>Then there is a rational operation on <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that recovers a unique integer <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Moreover, for any <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> there are rational solutions <img alt="{x,y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that yield <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This allows him to prove that exponential equations over the rationals is undecidable. </p>
<p/><h2> The Lemma </h2><p/>
<p>
Prunescu needs the above lemma. He does not prove it, but says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The equation <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for rationals was studied by Christian Goldbach and Leonhard Euler—as stated in Leonhard Dickson’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/History-Theory-Numbers-Vol-Diophantine/dp/0821819356">book</a>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The results had been available for a long time—the book was published over a hundred years ago in 1920.</p>
<p>
It is interesting to ask why it took so long to realize the connection? I looked at Dickson’s book and found the reference not so clean. I then did a Google search for results on the equation: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>The search found that Sved proved in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191325/http://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/Sved50816668.pdf">paper</a> in the Mathematics Magazine—Volume 63 Number 1, February 1990 the following: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 3</b> <em> Suppose that <img alt="{0 &lt; x &lt; y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%3C+x+%3C+y%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are rationals so that <img alt="{x^y = y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then for some integer <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  x = (1+1/n)^n \text{ and } y = (1+1/n)^{n+1}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5En+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+y+%3D+%281%2B1%2Fn%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
</em><p><em>Moreover, every <img alt="{n&gt;0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3E0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> arises this way. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
That is, Sved proved the key lemma in full detail in 1990. Thus over thirty years ago, in an available journal, the exact lemma needed was available. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Why did so all of us miss that Sved’s analysis of the equation <img alt="{x^y=y^x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey%3Dy%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> could be used to solve an open problem. One that was open for decades? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps it says that Prunescu’s insight was indeed surprising. Perhaps. It does raise questions about improving his theorem. For example: Can a similar theorem be proved with only exponentials of the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  2^x, 3^x, \dots? " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5Ex%2C+3%5Ex%2C+%5Cdots%3F+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>This would improve the undecidability theorem a bit.</p>
<p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p>
Perhaps we also should look at results from not top “professional” journals. Hmmm I think I will start looking at them with a new eye. How about you?</p>

    <title>TR21-035 |  Amortized Circuit Complexity, Formal Complexity Measures, and Catalytic Algorithms | 

	Robert Robere, 

	Jeroen Zuiddam</title>
    <summary>We study the amortized circuit complexity of boolean functions.
	
Given a circuit model $\mathcal{F}$ and a boolean function $f : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, the $\mathcal{F}$-amortized circuit complexity is defined to be the size of the smallest circuit that outputs $m$ copies of $f$ (evaluated on the same input), divided by $m$, as $m \rightarrow \infty$. We prove a general duality theorem that characterizes the amortized circuit complexity in terms of "formal complexity measures". More precisely, we prove that the amortized circuit complexity in any circuit model composed out of gates from a finite set is equal to the pointwise maximum of the family of "formal complexity measures" associated with $\mathcal{F}$. Our duality theorem captures many of the formal complexity measures that have been previously studied in the literature for proving lower bounds (such as formula complexity measures, submodular complexity measures, and branching program complexity measures), and thus gives a characterization of formal complexity measures in terms of circuit complexity. We also introduce and investigate a related notion of catalytic circuit complexity, which we show is "intermediate" between amortized circuit complexity and standard circuit complexity, and which we also characterize (now, as the best integer solution to a linear program). 

Finally, using our new duality theorem as a guide, we strengthen the known upper bounds for non-uniform catalytic space, introduced by Buhrman et. al (this is related to, but not the same as, as our notion of catalytic circuit size). Potechin proved that for any boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, there is a catalytic branching program computing $m = 2^{2^n}-1$ copies of $f$ with total size $O(mn)$ --- that is, linear size per copy --- refuting a conjecture of Girard, Koucky and McKenzie. Potechin then asked if the number of copies $m$ can be reduced while retaining the amortized upper bound. We show that the answer is yes: if $f$ has degree $d$ when represented as polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_2$, then there is a catalytic branching program computing $m = 2^{n \choose \leq d}$ copies of $f$ with total size $O(mn)$.</summary>

    <title>Cake Cutting in Overtime</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There's a new <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nfl/baltimore-ravens-coach-john-harbaugh-overtime-rule">proposal out of Baltimore</a> for a new way to handle overtime in National Football League games. This post is about American Football, soccer has its own overtime issues we won't talk about here.</p><p>Instead of randomly choosing who gets the ball, which gives an advantage to the team on offense, the Raven's coach John Harbaugh suggests a "spot and choose" rule based on cake cutting. One team picks a starting position and the other team decides whether to be on offense or defense.</p><p>Sounds intriguing but there's a problem. In cake cutting, if you cut off a crumb, everyone would definitely choose the rest of the cake. But in football suppose the spotting team chose the offensive's team one-yard line (99 yards needed for a touchdown). For spot and choose to work the one-yard line would have to be an obvious choice for defense. But many teams might still choose starting at the one-year line on offense. There's a chance you can march down the field and if not you can always punt it away. So the team that gets to choose whether to be on offense could get an advantage no matter what the spotting team did.</p><p>I still like the idea of "spot and choose". Maybe you let the first team choose not only the yard line but what down to start. Because no one would start at their one yard line at 4th down.</p><p>Are there variations for spot and choose in other sports? I like using game theory to figure out how to play actual games. </p></div>

    <title>Beyond log-concave sampling (Part 3)</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/09/19/beyondlogconvavesampling">first post</a> of this series, we introduced the challenges of sampling distributions beyond log-concavity. In <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2021/03/01/beyondlogconcave2/">Part 2</a> we tackled sampling from <em>multimodal</em> distributions: a typical obstacle occuring in problems involving statistical inference and posterior sampling in generative models. In this (final) post of the series, we consider sampling in the presence of <em>manifold structure in the level sets of the distribution</em> – which also frequently manifests in the same settings. It will cover the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05576">Fast convergence for Langevin diffusion with matrix manifold structure</a> by Ankur Moitra and Andrej Risteski .</p>

<h1 id="sampling-with-matrix-manifold-structure">Sampling with matrix manifold structure</h1>

<p>The structure on the distribution we consider in this post is <em>manifolds</em> of equiprobable points: this is natural, for instance, in the presence of invariances in data (e.g. rotations of images). It can also appear in neural-network based probabilistic models due to natural invariances they encode (e.g., scaling invariances in ReLU-based networks).</p>

<!--[HL: would it be better to start with the decomposition theorem, to parallel the first section?]
[AR: let me try this first, we can reorganize. I think this is better to motivate the assumption somewhat]-->

<p>At the level of techniques, the starting point for our results is a close connection between the geometry, more precisely <em>Ricci curvature</em> of a manifold, and the mixing time of Brownian motion on a manifold. The following theorem holds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (Bakry and Émery ‘85, informal)</strong>: If the manifold $M$ has  positive Ricci curvature, Brownian motion on the manifold mixes rapidly in $\chi^2$ divergence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We will explain the notions from differential geometry shortly, but first we sketch our results, and how they use this machinery. We present two results: the first is a “meta”-theorem that provides a generic decomposition framework, and the second is an instantiation of this framework for a natural family of problems that exhibit manifold structure: posteriors for matrix factorization, sensing, and completion. 
<!--a sampling version of matrix factorization--></p>

<h2 id="a-general-manifold-decomposition-framework">A general manifold decomposition framework</h2>

<p>Our first result is a general decomposition framework for analyzing mixing time of Langevin in the presence of manifolds of equiprobable points.</p>

<p>To motivate the result, note that if we consider the distribution $p_{\beta}(x) \propto e^{-\beta f(x)}$, for large (but finite) $\beta$, the Langevin chain corresponding to that distribution, started close to a manifold of local minima, will tend to stay close to (but not on!) it for a long time. See the figure below for an illustration. This, we will state a “robust” version of the above manifold result, for a chain that’s allowed to go off the manifold.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/single_manifold.gif" width="300"/>
</center>

<p>We show the following statement. (Recall that a bounded Poincaré constant corresponds to rapid mixing for Langevin. See the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/09/19/beyondlogconvavesampling">first post</a> for a refresher.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 1 (Moitra and Risteski ‘20, informal)</strong>: 
Suppose the Langevin chain corresponding to $p(x) \propto e^{-f(x)}$ is initialized close to a manifold $M$ satisfying the following two properties: 
<br/><br/>
(1) It stays in some neighborhood $D$ of the manifold $M$ with large probability for a long time. 
<br/><br/>
(2) $D$ can be partitioned into manifolds $M^{\Delta}$ satisfying: 
<br/><br/>
(2.1) The conditional distribution of $p$ restricted to $M^{\Delta}$ has a upper bounded Poincare constant. 
<br/><br/>
(2.2) The marginal distribution over $\Delta$ has a upper bounded Poincare constant. 
<br/><br/>
(2.3) The conditional probability distribution over $M^{\Delta}$ does not “change too quickly” as $\Delta$ changes.
<br/><br/>
Then Langevin mixes quickly to a distribution close to the conditional distribution of $p$ restricted to $D$.</p>
</blockquote>

</center>

<p>While the above theorem is a bit of a mouthful (even very informally stated) and requires a choice of partitioning of $D$ to be “instantiated”, it’s quite natural to think of it as an analogue of local convergence results for gradient descent in optimization. Namely, it gives geometric conditions under which Langevin started near a manifold mixes to the “local” stationary distribution (i.e. the conditional distribution $p$ restricted to $D$).</p>

<p>The proof of the theorem uses similar decomposition ideas as result on sampling multimodal distributions from the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2021/03/01/beyondlogconcave2/">previous post</a>, albeit is complicated by measure theoretic arguments. Namely, the manifolds $M^{\Delta}$ have technically zero measure under the distribution $p$, so care must be taken with how the “projected” and “restricted” chain are defined—the key tool for this is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_coarea_formula#:~:text=In%20Riemannian%20geometry%2C%20the%20smooth,with%20integrals%20over%20their%20codomains.&amp;text=%2C%20i.e.%20the%20determinant%20of%20the,orthogonal%20complement%20of%20its%20kernel.">co-area formula</a>.</p>

<p>The challenge in using the above framework is instantiating the decomposition: namely, the choice of the partition of $D$ into manifolds $M^{\Delta}$. In the next section, we show how this can be done for posteriors in problems like matrix factorization/sensing/completion.</p>

<h2 id="matrix-factorization-and-relatives">Matrix factorization (and relatives)</h2>

<p>To instantiate the above framework in a natural setting, we consider distributions exhibiting invariance under orthogonal transformations. Namely, we consider distributions of the type</p>

\[p: \mathbb{R}^{d \times k} \to \mathbb{R}, \hspace{0.5cm} p(X) \propto e^{-\beta \| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b \|^2_2}\]

<p>where $b \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$ is a fixed vector and $\mathcal{A}$ is an operator that returns a $m$-dimensional vector given a $d \times d$ matrix. For this distribution, we have $p(X) = p(XO)$ for any orthogonal matrix $O$, since $XX^T = XO (XO)^T$ . Depending on the choice of $\mathcal{A}$, we can easily recover some familiar functions inside the exponential: e.g. the $l_2$ losses for (low-rank) matrix factorization, matrix sensing and matrix completion. These losses received a lot of attention as simple examples of objectives that are non-convex but can still be optimized using gradient descent. (See e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00708">Ge et al. ‘17</a>.)</p>

<p>These distributions also have a very natural statistical motivation. Namely, consider the distribution over $m$-dimensional vectors, such that</p>

\[b = \mathcal{A}(XX^T) + n, \hspace{0.5cm} n \sim N\left(0,\frac{1}{\sqrt{\beta}}I\right).\]

<p>Then, the distribution $p(X) \propto e^{-\beta  | \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |^2_2 }$ can be viewed as the posterior distribution over $X$ with a uniform prior. Thus, sampling from these distributions can be seen as the distributional analogue of problems like matrix factorization/sensing/completion, the difference being that we are not merely trying to find the <em>most likely</em> matrix $X$, but also trying to sample from the posterior.</p>

<p>We will consider the case when $\beta$ is sufficiently large (in particular, $\beta = \Omega(\mbox{poly}(d))$: in this case, the distribution $p$ will concentrate over two (separated) manifolds: $E_1 = \{X_0 R: R \mbox{ is orthogonal with det 1}\}$ and $E_2 = \{X_0 R: R \mbox{ is orthogonal with det }-1\}$, where $X_0$ is any fixed minimizer of $| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |^2_2$. Hence, when started near one of these manifolds, we expect Langevin to stay close to it for a long time (see figure below).</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/langevin_matrix.gif" width="500"/>
</center>

<p>We show:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem 2 (Moitra and Risteski ‘20, informal)</strong>: Let $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to matrix factorization, sensing or completion under standard parameter assumptions for these problems. Let $\beta = \Omega(\mbox{poly}(d))$. 
If initialized close to one of $E_i, i \in \{1, 2\}$, after a polynomial number of steps the discretized Langevin dynamics will converge to a distribution that is close in total variation distance
to p(X) when restricted to a neighborhood of $E_i$.</p>
</blockquote>

<!--Let $\beta=\Omega(\mbox{poly}(d), \log (1/\delta)⁡)$ and let $p^i(X) \propto p(𝑋)$, if $\|X −\Pi_{E_i}(𝑋)\|_2<\|X − \Pi_{E_{2−i}}(X)\|_2$ and $p^i (X)=0$ otherwise. 
Then, Langevin diffusion initialized $O(\sigma_{\min}(M)⁡/k)$ close to $E_i$ run for t steps samples from distribution $p_t$, s.t. 
$$ \chi^2(p_t, p^i ) \leq \delta + e^{−𝑡/C}, 𝐶=O\left(\frac{\beta}{(k \sigma_{\min}⁡(M))}\right) $$-->

<p>We remark that the closeness condition for the first step is easy to ensure using existing results on gradient-descent based optimization for these objectives. It’s also easy to use the above result to sample approximately from the distribution $p$ itself, rather than only the “local” distributions $p^i$ – this is due to the fact that the distribution $p$ looks like the “disjoint union” of the distributions $p^1$ and $p^2$.</p>

<p>Before we describe the main elements of the proof, we review some concepts from differential geometry.</p>

<h2 id="extremely-brief-intro-to-differential-geometry">(Extremely) brief intro to differential geometry</h2>

<p>We won’t do a full primer on differential geometry in this blog post, but we will briefly informally describe some of the relevant concepts. See Section 5 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05576">our paper</a> for an intro to differential geometry (written with a computer science reader in mind, so more easy-going than a differential geometry textbook).</p>

<p>Recall, the <em>tangent</em> space at $x$, denoted by $T_x M$, is the set of all derivatives $v$ of a curve passing through $x$.<!-- the exponential map at a point $x$ in direction $v \in T_x M$, denoted by $\exp_x(v)$ is the movement of $x$ along the *geodesic* (i.e. shortest path curve) at $x$ for one unit of time (note this curve is unique). See the left part of the figure below.--><!-- To explain Ricci curvature, consider first the intuitive concept of curvature: Euclidean space has zero curvature, while the sphere has positive curvature because it "folds into itself." One way to capture this is by looking at the volume of a geodesic ball around a point: the sphere's positive curvature causes the volume to be *less* than the volume in Euclidean space. We can take this change in volume as the *definition* of curvature.--> The <em>Ricci curvature</em> at a point $x$, in direction $v \in T_x M$, denoted $\mbox{Ric}_x(v)$, captures the second-order term in the rate of change of volumes of sets in a small neighborhood around $x$, as the points in the set are moved along the geodesic (i.e. shortest path curve) in direction $v$ (or more precisely, each point $y$ in the set is moved along the geodesic in the direction of the parallel transport of $v$ at $y$; see the right part of the figure below from <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aspm/1543086328">(Ollivier 2010)</a>). A Ricci curvature of $0$ preserves volumes (think: a plane), a Ricci curvature $&gt;0$ shrinks volume (think: a sphere), and a Ricci curvature $&lt;0$ expands volume (think: a hyperbola).</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/tangent.jpg" width="800"/>
</center>

<!--Slightly more mathematically, it's relatively easy to understand the Ricci curvature when we have a parametrized manifold. The curvature of the manifold should be intuitively captured by the second-order behavior of the parametrization. Namely, consider a manifold parametrized locally as
$$\phi: T_x M \to T_x M \times N_x M, \phi(z) = x + (z, g(z))$$ 
where $N_xM$ is the *normal* space at $x$, the subspace orthogonal to $T_xM$. 
Then, the Hessian viewed as the quadratic form $\nabla^2 g: T_x M \times T_x M \to N_x M$ is called the *second fundamental form* and denoted as $\mathrm{I\!I}_x$. If $\{e_i\}$ is an orthonormal basis of $T_x M$, the Ricci curvature in a direction $v \in T_x M$ is then:
$$\mbox{Ric}(v) = \sum_i \langle \mathrm{I\!I}(u,u), \mathrm{I\!I}(e_i, e_i) \rangle - \|\mathrm{I\!I}(u,e_i)\|^2$$ 
-->

<p>The connections between curvature and mixing time of diffiusions is rather deep and we won’t attempt to convey it fully in a blog post - the definitive reference is <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-00227-9">Analysis and Geometry of Markov Diffusion Operators</a> by Bakry, Gentil and Ledoux. The main idea is that mixing time can be bounded by how long it takes for random walks starting at different locations to “join together,” and positive curvature brings them together faster.
<!-- A small gesture towards these connections can be conveyed through a popular coupling for Brownian motion called a *reflection coupling*.--></p>

<p>To make this formal, we define a <em>coupling</em> of two random variables $X, Y$ to be any random variable $W = (X’,Y’)$ such that the marginal distribution of the coordinates $X’$ and $Y’$ are the same as the distributions of $X$ and $Y$. It’s well known that the convergence time of a random walk in total variation distance can be upper bounded by the expected time until two coupled copies of the walk join. On the plane, a canonical coupling (the <em>reflection coupling</em>) between two Brownian motions can be constructed by reflecting the move of the second process through the perpendicular bisector between the locations of the two processes (see figure below). On a positively curved manifold (like a sphere), an analogous reflection can be defined, and the curvature only brings the two processes closer faster.</p>

<center>
<img src="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/aristesk/reflection.jpg" width="500"/>
</center>

<p>As a final tool, our proof uses a very important theorem due to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870876800023">Milnor</a> about manifolds with algebraic structure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem (Milnor ‘76, informal)</strong>: The Ricci curvature of a Lie group equipped with a left-invariant metric is non-negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a pinch, a Lie group is a group that also is a smooth manifold, and furthermore, the group operations result in a smooth transformation on the manifold - so that the “geometry” and “algebra” combine together. A metric is left-invariant for the group if acting on the left by any group element leaves the metric “unchanged”.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-the-decomposition-framework">Implementing the decomposition framework</h2>

<p>To apply the framework we sketched out as part of Theorem 1, we need to verify the conditions of the Theorem.</p>

<p>To prove <strong>Condition 1</strong>, we need to show that for large $\beta$, the random walk stays near to the manifold it’s been initialized close to. The main tools for this are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%C3%B4%27s_lemma">Ito’s lemma</a>, local convexity of the function $| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |_2^2$ and basic results in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross_model">Cox-Ingersoll-Ross</a> processes. Namely, Ito’s lemma (which can be viewed as a “change-of-variables” formula for random variables) allows us to write down a stochastic differential equation for the evolution of the distance of $X$ from the manifold, which turns out to have a “bias” towards small values, due to the local convexity of $| \mathcal{A}(XX^T) - b |_2^2$. This can in turn be analyzed approximately as Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process - a well-studied type of non-negative stochastic process.</p>

<p>To prove <strong>Condition 2</strong>, we need to specify the partition of the space around the manifolds $E_i$. Describing the full partition is somewhat technical, but importantly, the manifolds $M^{\Delta}$ have the form $M^{\Delta} = \{\Delta U: U \mbox{ is an orthogonal matrix with det 1}\}$ for some matrix $\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$.</p>

<p>The proof that $M^{\Delta}$ has a good Poincare constant (i.e. Condition 2.1) relies on two ideas: first, $M^{\Delta}$ is a Lie group with group operation $\circ$ defined such that $(\Delta U)   \circ (\Delta V) := \Delta (UV)$, along with a corresponding left-invariant metric - thus, by Milnor’s theorem, it has a non-negative Ricci curvature; second, we can relate the Ricci curvatures with the Euclidean metric to the curvature with the left-invariant metric. The proof that the marginal distribution over $\Delta$ has a good Poincaré constant involves showing that this distribution is approximately log-concave. Finally, the “change-of-conditional-probability” condition (Condition 2.3) can be proved by explicit calculation.</p>

<h1 id="closing-remarks">Closing remarks</h1>

<p>In this series of posts, we surveyed two recent approaches to analyzing Langevin-like sampling algorithms <em>beyond log-concavity</em> - the most natural analogue to non-convexity in the world of sampling/inference. The structures we considered, <em>multi-modality</em> and <em>invariant manifolds</em>, are common in practice in modern machine learning.</p>

<p>Unlike non-convex optimization, provable guarantees for sampling beyond log-concavity is still under-studied and we hope our work will inspire and excite further efforts. For instance, how do we handle modes of different “shape”? Can we handle an exponential number of modes, if they have further structure (e.g., posteriors in concrete latent-variable models like Bayesian networks)? Can we handle more complex manifold structure (e.g. the matrix distributions we considered for <em>any</em> $\beta$)?</p></div>

    <title>What is δ, and what δifference does it make?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There are many variants or flavours of differential privacy (DP) some weaker than others: often, a given variant comes with own guarantees and “conversion theorems” to the others. As an example, “pure” DP has a single parameter \(\varepsilon\), and corresponds to a very stringent notion of DP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An algorithm \(M\) is \(\varepsilon\)-DP if, for all neighbouring inputs \(D,D'\) and all measurable \(S\), \( \Pr[ M(D) \in S ] \leq e^\varepsilon\Pr[ M(D’) \in S ] \).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By relaxing this a little, one obtains the standard definition of approximate DP, a.k.a. \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An algorithm \(M\) is \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP if, for all neighbouring inputs \(D,D'\) and all measurable \(S\), \( \Pr[ M(D) \in S ] \leq e^\varepsilon\Pr[ M(D’) \in S ]+\delta \).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This definition is very useful, as in many settings achieving the stronger \(\varepsilon\)-DP guarantee (i.e., \(\delta=0\)) is impossible, or comes at a very high utility cost. But how to interpret it? The above definition, on its face, doesn’t preclude what one may call “<em>catastrophic failures of privacy</em> 💥:” most of the time, things are great, but with some small probability \(\delta\) all hell breaks loose. For instance, the following algorithm is \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get a sensitive database \(D\) of \(n\) records</li>
  <li>Select uniformly at random a fraction \(\delta\) of the database (\(\delta n\) records)</li>
  <li>Output that subset of records in the clear 💥</li>
</ul>

<p>(actually, this is even \((0,\delta)\)-DP!). This sounds preposterous, and obviously something that one would want to avoid in practice (lest one wants to face very angry customers or constituents). This is one of the rules of thumb for picking \(\delta\) small enough (or even “cryptographically small”), typically \(\delta \ll 1/n\), so that the records are safe (hard to disclose \(\delta n \ll 1\) records).</p>

<p>So: good privacy most of the time, but with probably \(\delta\) then all bets are off.</p>

<p>However, those catastrophic failure of privacy, while technically allowed by the definition of \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP, <strong>are not something that can really happen with the DP algorithms and techniques used both in practice and in theoretical work.</strong> Before explaining why, let’s see what is the kind of desirable behaviour one would expect: a <em>“smooth, manageable tradeoff of privacy parameters.”</em> For that discussion, let’s introduce the <em>privacy loss random variable</em>: given an algorithm M and two neighbouring inputs D,D’, let \(f(y)\) be defined as
\[
	f(y) = \log\frac{\Pr[M(D)=y]}{\Pr[M(D’)=y]}
\]
for every possible output \(y\in\Omega\). Now, define the random variable \(Z := f(M(D))\) (implicitly, \(Z\) depends on \(D,D',M\)). This random variable quantifies how much observing the output of the algorithm \(M\) helps distinguishing between \(D\) and \(D'\).</p>

<p>Now, going a little bit fast, you can check that saying that \(M\) is \(\varepsilon\)-DP corresponds to the guarantee “<em>\(\Pr[Z &gt; \varepsilon] = 0\) for all neighbouring inputs \(D,D'\).</em>”
Similarly, \(M\) being \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP is the guarantee \(\Pr[Z &gt; \varepsilon] \leq \delta\).\({}^{(\dagger)}\) For instance, the “catastrophic failure of privacy” corresponds to the scenario below, which depicts a possible distribution for \(Z\): \(Z\leq \varepsilon\) with probability \(1-\delta\), but then with probability \(\delta\) we have \(Z\gg 1\).</p>

<p><img alt="The type of (bad) distribution of Z corresponding to 'our catastrophic failure of privacy'" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/flavours-delta-fig1.png" style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="600"/></p>

<p>What we would like is a smoother thing, where even when \(Z&gt;\varepsilon\) is still remains reasonable and doesn’t immediately become large. A nice behaviour of the tails, ideally something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="A distribution for Z with nice tails, leading to smooth tradeoffs between &#x3B5; and &#x3B4;" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/flavours-delta-fig2.png" style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="600"/></p>

<p>For instance, if we had a bound on \(\mathbb{E}[|Z|]\), we could use Markov’s inequality to get, well, <em>something</em>. For instance, imagine we had \(\mathbb{E}[|Z|]\leq \varepsilon\delta\): then 
\[
	\Pr[ |Z| &gt; \varepsilon ] \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[|Z|]}{\varepsilon }\leq \delta
\]
<em>(great! We have \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP)</em>; but also  \(\Pr[ |Z| &gt; 10\varepsilon ] \leq \frac{\delta}{10}\). Privacy violations do not blow up out of proporxtion immediately, we can trade \(\varepsilon\) for \(\delta\). That seems like the type of behaviour we would like our algorithms to exhibit.</p>

<p><img alt="The type of privacy guarantees a Markov-type tail bound would give" src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/flavours-delta-fig3.png" style="margin: auto; display: block;" width="600"/></p>

<p>But why stop at Markov’s inequality then, which gives some nice but still weak tail bounds? Why not ask for <em>stronger</em>: Chebyshev’s inequality? Subexponential tail bounds? Hell, <em>subgaussian</em> tail bounds? This is, basically, what some stronger notions of differential privacy than approximate DP give.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rényi DP</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07476" title="Ilya Mironov. Renyi Differential Privacy. CSF 2017"><strong>[Mironov17]</strong></a>, for instance, is a guarantee on the moment-generating function (MGF) of the privacy random variable \(Z\): it has two parameters, \(\alpha&gt;1\) and \(\tau\), and requires that \(\mathbb{E}[e^{(\alpha-1)Z}] \leq e^{(\alpha-1)\tau}\) for all neighbouring \(D,D'\). In turn, by applying for instance Markov’s inequality to the MGF of \(Z\), we can control the tail bounds, and get a nice, smooth tradeoff in terms of \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Concentrated DP</strong> (CDP)  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065" title="Mark Bun and Thomas Steinke. Concentrated Differential Privacy: Simplifications, Extensions, and Lower Bounds. TCC 2016"><strong>[BS16]</strong></a> is an even stronger requirement, which roughly speaking requires the algorithm to be Rényi DP <em>simultaneously</em> for all \(1&lt; \alpha \leq \infty\). More simply, this is “morally” a requirement on the MGF of \(Z\) which asks it to be subgaussian.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The above two examples are not just fun but weird variants of DP: they actually capture the behaviour of many well-known differentially private algorithms, and in particular that of the Gaussian mechanism. While the guarantees they provide are less easy to state and interpret than \(\varepsilon\)-DP or \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP, they are incredibly useful to analyze those algorithms, and enjoy very nice composition properties… and, of course, lead to that smooth tradeoff between \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\) for \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP.</p>

<p><strong>To summarize:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\varepsilon\)-DP gives great guarantees, but is a very stringent requirement. Corresponds to the privacy loss random variable supported on \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\) (no tails!)</li>
  <li>\((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP gives guarantees easy to parse, but on its face allows for very bad behaviours. Corresponds to the privacy loss random variable in \([-\varepsilon,\varepsilon]\) with probability \(1-\delta\) (but outside, all bets are off!)</li>
  <li>Rényi DP and Concentrated DP correspond to something in between, controlling the tails of the privacy loss random variable by a guarantee on its MGF. A bit harder to interpret, but capture the behaviour of many DP building blocks can be converted to \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP (with nice trade-offs between \(\varepsilon\) and \(\delta\).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>\({}^{(\dagger)}\) The astute reader may notice that this is not <em>quite</em> true. Namely, the guarantee \(\Pr[Z &gt; \varepsilon] \leq \delta\) on the privacy loss random variable (PLRV) does imply \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-differential privacy, but the converse does not hold. See, for instance, Lemma 9 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010" title="Cl&#xE9;ment L. Canonne, Gautam Kamath, Thomas Steinke. The Discrete Gaussian for Differential Privacy. NeurIPS 2020"><strong>[CKS20]</strong></a> for an exact characterization of \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-DP in terms of the PLRV.</p></div>

<p>A Boolean function <img alt="f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Ccolon+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Cto+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is called a <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta if it depends only on <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> out of the <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> input bits. Junta testing is the task of distinguishing between <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-juntas and functions that are far from <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-juntas. A long line of work settled the query complexity of testing <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-juntas, which is <img alt="O(k log(k))" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28k+log%28k%29%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> [Blais, STOC 2009; Saglam, FOCS 2018]. Suppose, however, that <img alt="f" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not a perfect <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta but rather correlated with a <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta. How well can we estimate this correlation? This question was asked by De, Mossel, and Neeman [FOCS 2019], who gave an algorithm for the task making <img alt="\sim\exp(k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim%5Cexp%28k%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> queries. We present an improved algorithm that makes <img alt="\sim\exp(\sqrt{k})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csim%5Cexp%28%5Csqrt%7Bk%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> many queries. Along the way, we also give an algorithm, making <img alt="\mathrm{poly}(k)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7Bpoly%7D%28k%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> queries, that provides “implicit oracle access” to the underlying <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-junta. Our techniques are Fourier analytical and introduce the notion of “normalized influences” that might be of independent interest.</p>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Long-delayed UT Austin Quantum Complexity Theory Student Project Showcase!</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">Back at MIT, whenever I taught my graduate course on Quantum Complexity Theory (see here for lecture notes), I had a tradition of showcasing the student projects on this blog: see here (Fall 2010), here (Fall 2012), here (Fall 2014).

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Back at MIT, whenever I taught my graduate course on Quantum Complexity Theory (<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-845-quantum-complexity-theory-fall-2010/lecture-notes/">see here</a> for lecture notes), I had a tradition of showcasing the student projects on this blog: see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=515">here (Fall 2010)</a>, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1181">here (Fall 2012)</a>, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2109">here (Fall 2014)</a>.  I was incredibly proud that, each time I taught, at least some of the projects led to publishable original research—sometimes highly significant research, like Paul Christiano’s work on quantum money (which led to my later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740">paper with him</a>), Shelby Kimmel’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0797">work</a> on quantum query complexity, Jenny Barry’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2858">work</a> on quantum partially observable Markov decision processes (“QOMDPs”), or Matt Coudron and Henry Yuen’s work on randomness expansion (which led to their later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6755">breakthrough</a> in the subject).</p>



<p>Alas, after I moved to UT Austin, for some reason I discontinued the tradition of these blog-showcases—and inexcusably, I did this even though the wonderful new research results continued!  Now that I’m teaching Quantum Complexity Theory at UT for the third time (via Zoom, of course), I decided that it was finally time to remedy this.  To keep things manageable, this time I’m going to limit myself to research projects that began their lives in my course <em>and that are already public on the arXiv</em> (or in one case, that will soon be).</p>



<p>So please enjoy the following smorgasbord, from 2016 and 2019 iterations of my course!  And if you have any questions about any of the projects—well, I’ll try to get the students to answer in the comments section!  Thanks so much and congratulations to the students for their work.</p>



<h2>From the Fall 2016 iteration of the course</h2>



<p>William Hoza (project turned into a joint paper with Cole Graham), <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05680">Universal Bell Correlations Do Not Exist</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prove that there is no finite-alphabet nonlocal box that generates exactly those correlations that can be generated using a maximally entangled pair of qubits. More generally, we prove that if some finite-alphabet nonlocal box is strong enough to simulate arbitrary local projective measurements of a maximally entangled pair of qubits, then that nonlocal box cannot itself be simulated using any finite amount of entanglement. We also give a quantitative version of this theorem for approximate simulations, along with a corresponding upper bound.</p></blockquote>



<p>Patrick Rall, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06990">Signed quantum weight enumerators characterize qubit magic state distillation</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Many proposals for fault-tolerant quantum computation require injection of ‘magic states’ to achieve a universal set of operations. Some qubit states are above a threshold fidelity, allowing them to be converted into magic states via ‘magic state distillation’, a process based on stabilizer codes from quantum error correction.<br/>We define quantum weight enumerators that take into account the sign of the stabilizer operators. These enumerators completely describe the magic state distillation behavior when distilling T-type magic states. While it is straightforward to calculate them directly by counting exponentially many operator weights, it is also an NP-hard problem to compute them in general. This suggests that finding a family of distillation schemes with desired threshold properties is at least as hard as finding the weight distributions of a family of classical codes.<br/>Additionally, we develop search algorithms fast enough to analyze all useful 5 qubit codes and some 7 qubit codes, finding no codes that surpass the best known threshold.</p></blockquote>



<h2>From the Spring 2019 iteration of the course</h2>



<p>Ying-Hao Chen, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03787">2-Local Hamiltonian with Low Complexity is QCMA-complete</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prove that 2-Local Hamiltonian (2-LH) with Low Complexity problem is QCMA-complete by combining the results from the QMA-completeness of 2-LH and QCMA-completeness of 3-LH with Low Complexity. The idea is straightforward. It has been known that 2-LH is QMA-complete. By putting a low complexity constraint on the input state, we make the problem QCMA. Finally, we use similar arguments as in [Kempe, Kitaev, Regev] to show that all QCMA problems can be reduced to our proposed problem.</p></blockquote>



<p>Jeremy Cook, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11368">On the relationships between Z-, C-, and H-local unitaries</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Quantum walk algorithms can speed up search of physical regions of space in both the discrete-time [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0402107">arXiv:quant-ph/0402107</a>] and continuous-time setting [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0306054">arXiv:quant-ph/0306054</a>], where the physical region of space being searched is modeled as a connected graph. In such a model, Aaronson and Ambainis [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303041">arXiv:quant-ph/0303041</a>] provide three different criteria for a unitary matrix to act locally with respect to a graph, called <em>Z</em>-local, <em>C</em>-local, and <em>H</em>-local unitaries, and left the open question of relating these three locality criteria. Using a correspondence between continuous- and discrete-time quantum walks by Childs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.0312">arXiv:0810.0312</a>], we provide a way to approximate <em>N</em>×<em>N H</em>-local unitaries with error <em>δ</em> using <em>O</em>(1/<em>√δ,√N</em>) <em>C</em>-local unitaries, where the comma denotes the maximum of the two terms.</p></blockquote>



<p>Joshua A. Cook, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10495">Approximating Unitary Preparations of Orthogonal Black Box States</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In this paper, I take a step toward answering the following question: for m different small circuits that compute m orthogonal n qubit states, is there a small circuit that will map m computational basis states to these m states without any input leaving any auxiliary bits changed. While this may seem simple, the constraint that auxiliary bits always be returned to 0 on any input (even ones besides the m we care about) led me to use sophisticated techniques. I give an approximation of such a unitary in the m = 2 case that has size polynomial in the approximation error, and the number of qubits n.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sabee Grewal (project turned into a joint paper with me), <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10458">Efficient Learning of Non-Interacting Fermion Distributions</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We give an efficient classical algorithm that recovers the distribution of a non-interacting fermion state over the computational basis. For a system of <em>n</em> non-interacting fermions and <em>m</em> modes, we show that <em>O</em>(<em>m</em><sup>2</sup><em>n</em><sup>4</sup>log(<em>m</em>/<em>δ</em>)/<em>ε</em><sup>4</sup>) samples and <em>O</em>(<em>m</em><sup>4</sup><em>n</em><sup>4</sup>log(<em>m</em>/<em>δ</em>)/<em>ε</em><sup>4</sup>) time are sufficient to learn the original distribution to total variation distance <em>ε</em> with probability 1−<em>δ</em>. Our algorithm empirically estimates the one- and two-mode correlations and uses them to reconstruct a succinct description of the entire distribution efficiently.</p></blockquote>



<p>Sam Gunn and Niels Kornerup, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07673">Review of a Quantum Algorithm for Betti Numbers</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We looked into the algorithm for calculating Betti numbers presented by Lloyd, Garnerone, and Zanardi (LGZ). We present a new algorithm in the same spirit as LGZ with the intent of clarifying quantum algorithms for computing Betti numbers. Our algorithm is simpler and slightly more efficient than that presented by LGZ. We present a thorough analysis of our algorithm, pointing out reasons that both our algorithm and that presented by LGZ do not run in polynomial time for most inputs. However, the algorithms do run in polynomial time for calculating an approximation of the Betti number to polynomial multiplicative error, when applied to some class of graphs for which the Betti number is exponentially large.</p></blockquote>



<p>William Kretschmer, <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06731">Lower Bounding the AND-OR Tree via Symmetrization</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We prove a simple, nearly tight lower bound on the approximate degree of the two-level AND-OR tree using symmetrization arguments. Specifically, we show that ~deg(AND<em>m</em>∘OR<em>n</em>)=Ω(~<em>√</em>(<em>mn</em>)). To our knowledge, this is the first proof of this fact that relies on symmetrization exclusively; most other proofs involve the more complicated formulation of approximate degree as a linear program [BT13, She13, BDBGK18]. Our proof also demonstrates the power of a symmetrization technique involving Laurent polynomials (polynomials with negative exponents) that was previously introduced by Aaronson, Kothari, Kretschmer, and Thaler [AKKT19].</p></blockquote>



<p>Jiahui Liu and Ruizhe Zhang (project turned into a joint paper with me, Mark Zhandry, and Qipeng Liu), <br/><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09674">New Approaches for Quantum Copy-Protection</a></strong>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Quantum copy protection uses the unclonability of quantum states to construct quantum software that provably cannot be pirated. Copy protection would be immensely useful, but unfortunately little is known about how to achieve it in general. In this work, we make progress on this goal, by giving the following results:<br/>– We show how to copy protect any program that cannot be learned from its input/output behavior, relative to a classical oracle. This improves on Aaronson [CCC’09], which achieves the same relative to a quantum oracle. By instantiating the oracle with post-quantum candidate obfuscation schemes, we obtain a heuristic construction of copy protection.<br/>– We show, roughly, that any program which can be watermarked can be copy detected, a weaker version of copy protection that does not prevent copying, but guarantees that any copying can be detected. Our scheme relies on the security of the assumed watermarking, plus the assumed existence of public key quantum money. Our construction is general, applicable to many recent watermarking schemes.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Many of you have surely <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-retracts-disputed-quantum-computing-paper/">already</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z">seen</a> the news that the Kouwenhoven group in Delft—which in 2018 published a paper in <em>Nature</em> claiming to have detected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majorana_fermion">Majorana particles</a>, a type of nonabelian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon">anyon</a>—have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03373-x?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100095187&amp;utm_content=deeplink">retracted the paper</a> and apologized for “insufficient scientific rigour.”  This work was considered one of the linchpins of Microsoft’s experimental effort toward building topological quantum computers.</p>



<p>Like most quantum computing theorists, I guess, I’m thrilled if Majorana particles can be created using existing technology, I’m sad if they can’t be, but I don’t have any special investment in or knowledge of the topic, beyond what I read in the news or hear from colleagues.  Certainly Majorana particles seem neither necessary nor sufficient for building a scalable quantum computer, although they’d be a step forward for the topological approach to QC.</p>



<p>The purpose of this post is to invite <em>informed scientific discussion</em> of the relevant issues—first and foremost so that I can learn something, and second so that my readers can!  I’d be especially interested to understand:</p>



<ol><li>Weren’t there, like, several <em>other</em> claims to have produced Majoranas?  What of those then?</li><li>If, today, no one has convincingly demonstrated the existence of Majoranas, then do people think it more likely that they were produced but not detected, or that they weren’t even produced?</li><li>How credible are the explanations as to what went wrong?</li><li>Are there any broader implications for the prospects of topological QC, or Microsoft’s path to topological QC, or was this just an isolated mistake?</li></ol>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Feng Pan and Pan Zhang uploaded a new paper on the arXive  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03074">“Simulating the Sycamore supremacy circuits.”</a> with an amazing announcement.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em><strong> Abstract:</strong> We propose a general tensor network method for simulating quantum circuits. The method is massively more efficient in computing a large number of correlated bitstring amplitudes and probabilities than existing methods. As an application, we study the sampling problem of Google’s Sycamore circuits, which are believed to be beyond the reach of classical supercomputers and have been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. Using our method, employing a small computational cluster containing 60 graphical processing units (GPUs), we have generated one million correlated bitstrings with some entries fixed, from the Sycamore circuit with 53 qubits and 20 cycles, with linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB) fidelity equals 0.739, which is much higher than those in Google’s quantum supremacy experiments.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Congratulations to Feng Pan and Pan Zhang for this remarkable breakthrough!</span></strong></p>
<p>Of course, we can expect that in the weeks and months to come, the community will learn, carefully check, and digest this surprising result and will ponder about its meaning and interpretation. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Here is a technical matter I am puzzled about: the paper claims the ability to compute precisely the amplitudes for a large number of bitstrings. (Apparently computing the amplitudes is even more difficult computational task than sampling.) But then, it is not clear to me where the upper bound of 0.739 comes from? If you have the precise amplitudes it seems that you can sample with close to perfect fidelity. (And, if you wish, you can get a F_XEB score larger than 1.)<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;">Update: This is explained just before the discussion part of the paper. The crucial thing is that the probabilities for the 2^21 strings are distributed close to Porter-Thomas (exponentials). If you take samples for them indeed you can get samples with F_XEB between -1 and 15. Picking the highest 10^6  strings from 2^21 get you 0.739 (so this value has no special meaning.) Probably by using Metropolis sampling you can get (smaller, unless you enlarge 2^21 to 2^25, say) samples with F_XEB close to 1 and size-biased distribution (the distribution of probabilities of sampled strings) that fits the theoretical size biased distribution.  And you can also use metropolis sampling to get a sample of size 10^6 with the correct distribution of probabilities for somewhat smaller fidelity. </span></p>
<p>The paper mentions several earlier papers in this direction, including an earlier result by Johnnie Gray and Stefanos Kourtis in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01935">Hyper-optimized tensor network contraction</a> and another earlier result in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06787">Classical Simulation of Quantum Supremacy Circuits</a> by a group of researchers Cupjin Huang, Fang Zhang, Michael Newman, Junjie Cai, Xun Gao, Zhengxiong Tian, Junyin Wu, Haihong Xu, Huanjun Yu, Bo Yuan, Mario Szegedy, Yaoyun Shi, and Jianxin Chen, from Alibaba co.  Congratulations to them as well.</p>
