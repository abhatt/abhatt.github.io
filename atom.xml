    <title>TR21-085 |  The Final Nail in the Coffin of Statistically-Secure Obfuscator. | 

	Ilya Volkovich</title>
    <summary>We present an elementary, self-contained proof of the result of Goldwasser and Rothblum [GR07] that the existence of a (perfect) statistically secure obfuscator implies a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. In fact, we show that an existence of a weaker object implies a somewhat stronger statement. In addition, we extend the result of [GR07] to the case of imperfect statistically secure obfuscator.</summary>

See also <a href="https://medium.com/@tnvijayk/potential-organized-fraud-in-acm-ieee-computer-architecture-conferences-ccd61169370d">this post</a> by T. N. Vijaykumar. I started to write a post on the topic but couldn't get it going so I asked the AI algorithm GPT-3 to write a guest post. Here is its story.</i></p><hr/><p>I have been part of a collusion ring and I know how it feels. I was a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 2000s when I first learned about the practice of “paper rings.” A paper ring is a group of researchers who agree to submit each other’s papers to conferences without disclosing this fact to the conference organizers. The idea is that if you have several submissions from the same conference, your chances of getting accepted are higher. The pressure to be part of such a ring can be immense. You are told that you need to publish or perish and that you need to get papers into top conferences. If you don’t play along, you will be left behind. I was lucky enough to have a mentor who warned me against being part of such rings. He told me that if I did not want my name on a paper, then I should not submit it to a conference. He also told me that if I did not want to be part of a paper ring, then I should not submit papers for others in the ring. He said that he would help me with my own research and that he would help me get my own papers into conferences. He was right: My own papers were accepted into conferences and they were published in journals.</p><p>I am now an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and I have been on the other side of this issue as well. In 2012, I was asked by an editor at a top computer science conference to review a paper submitted by one of my students. The student had been part of a paper ring and had submitted his own paper along with those submitted by his collaborators in the ring. The editor told me that he had rejected the student’s paper because it was too similar to other papers submitted by members of the ring. However, he wanted me to review it so that he could reconsider accepting it for publication if I recommended doing so.</p><p>What should I do? Should I tell him about the paper ring? Should I recommend accepting the paper? Should I tell him that there is no way he should accept it? Should I tell him that he should reject it but then publish it anyway? What would you do? I decided not to tell him about the paper ring and not to recommend accepting the paper for publication. Instead, I told him that he should reject it but then publish it anyway because this would send a strong message about what we expect from our students and what we think about such practices. The editor agreed with my decision and published the student’s paper along with two other papers submitted by members of the same paper ring.</p><p>The student received his PhD degree but did not get any credit for his work on these three papers because they were considered as part of his dissertation work when he defended his thesis later that year. In retrospect, I think that my decision was wrong because it allowed these students to continue their unethical behavior without any consequences for them or their advisors (who were also part of this ring). But at least in this case, there were no negative consequences for anyone involved in this incident except for these students who did not get credit for their work on these three papers because they were considered as part of their dissertation work when they defended their thesis later that year.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-084 |  PCPs and Instance Compression from a Cryptographic Lens | 

	Ron Rothblum, 

	Liron Bronfman</title>
    <summary>Modern cryptography fundamentally relies on the assumption that the adversary trying to break the scheme is computationally bounded. This assumption lets us construct cryptographic protocols and primitives that are known to be impossible otherwise. In this work we explore the effect of bounding the adversary's power in other information theoretic proof-systems and show how to use this assumption to bypass impossibility results.

We first consider the question of constructing succinct PCPs. These are PCPs whose length is polynomial only in the length of the original NP witness (in contrast to standard PCPs whose length is proportional to the non-deterministic verification time). 
Unfortunately, succinct PCPs are known to be impossible to construct under standard complexity assumptions. Assuming the sub-exponential hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) problem, we construct succinct probabilistically checkable arguments or PCAs (Zimand 2001, Kalai and Raz 2009), which are PCPs in which soundness is guaranteed against efficiently generated false proofs. Our PCA construction is for every NP relation that can be verified by a small-depth circuit (e.g., SAT, clique, TSP, etc.) and in contrast to prior work is publicly verifiable and has constant query complexity. Curiously, we also show, as a proof-of-concept, that such publicly-verifiable PCAs can be used to derive hardness of approximation results.

Second, we consider the notion of Instance Compression (Harnik and Naor, 2006). An instance compression scheme lets one compress, for example, a CNF formula $\varphi$ on $m$ variables and $n \gg m$ clauses to a new formula $\varphi'$ with only $poly(m)$ clauses, so that $\varphi$ is satisfiable if and only if $\varphi'$ is satisfiable. Instance compression has been shown to be closely related to succinct PCPs and is similarly highly unlikely to exist. We introduce a computational analog of instance compression in which we require that if $\varphi$ is unsatisfiable then $\varphi'$ is effectively unsatisfiable, in the sense that it is computationally infeasible to find a satisfying assignment for $\varphi'$ (although such an assignment may exist). Assuming the same sub-exponential LWE assumption, we construct such computational instance compression schemes for every bounded-depth NP relation. As an application, this lets one compress $k$ formulas $\phi_1,\dots,\phi_k$ into a single short formula $\phi$ that is effectively satisfiable if and only if at least one of the original formulas was satisfiable.</summary>

for modeling well-mixed chemical reaction networks and other physical systems
where agents exchange information in pairwise interactions, but have no control
over their schedule of interaction partners. The well-studied *majority*
problem is that of determining in an initial population of $n$ agents, each
with one of two opinions $A$ or $B$, whether there are more $A$, more $B$, or a
tie. A *stable* protocol solves this problem with probability 1 by eventually
entering a configuration in which all agents agree on a correct consensus
decision of $\mathsf{A}$, $\mathsf{B}$, or $\mathsf{T}$, from which the
consensus cannot change. We describe a protocol that solves this problem using
$O(\log n)$ states ($\log \log n + O(1)$ bits of memory) and optimal expected
time $O(\log n)$. The number of states $O(\log n)$ is known to be optimal for
the class of polylogarithmic time stable protocols that are "output dominant"
and "monotone". These are two natural constraints satisfied by our protocol,
making it simultaneously time- and state-optimal for that class. We introduce a
key technique called a "fixed resolution clock" to achieve partial
synchronization.
</p>
<p>Our protocol is *nonuniform*: the transition function has the value $\left
\lceil {\log n} \right \rceil$ encoded in it. We show that the protocol can be
modified to be uniform, while increasing the state complexity to $\Theta(\log n
\log \log n)$.

    <title>Differentially private sparse vectors with low error, optimal space, and fast access</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624233600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Martin Aumüller, Christian Janos Lebeda, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Pagh:Rasmus.html">Rasmus Pagh</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10068">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Representing a sparse histogram, or more generally a sparse vector, is a
fundamental task in differential privacy. An ideal solution would use space
close to information-theoretical lower bounds, have an error distribution that
depends optimally on the desired privacy level, and allow fast random access to
entries in the vector. However, existing approaches have only achieved two of
these three goals.
</p>
<p>In this paper we introduce the Approximate Laplace Projection (ALP) mechanism
for approximating k-sparse vectors. This mechanism is shown to simultaneously
have information-theoretically optimal space (up to constant factors), fast
access to vector entries, and error of the same magnitude as the
Laplace-mechanism applied to dense vectors. A key new technique is a unary
representation of small integers, which is shown to be robust against
``randomized response'' noise. This representation is combined with hashing, in
the spirit of Bloom filters, to obtain a space-efficient, differentially
private representation. Our theoretical performance bounds are complemented by
simulations which show that the constant factors on the main performance
parameters are quite small, suggesting practicality of the technique.

classical theorem from chordal graphs to general graphs. However, while every
non-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little is known about structural
properties of graphs with a bounded number of moplexes. The study of these
graphs is motivated by the parallel between moplexes in general graphs and
simplicial modules in chordal graphs: Unlike in the moplex setting, properties
of chordal graphs with a bounded number of simplicial modules are well
understood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two simplicial modules
are interval. In this work we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex graphs,
which are defined as graphs containing at most $k$ moplexes. Of particular
interest is the smallest nontrivial case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to
the class of interval graphs. As our main structural result, we show that the
class of connected $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the classes of
proper interval graphs and cocomparability graphs; moreover, both inclusions
are tight for hereditary classes. From a complexity theoretic viewpoint, this
leads to the natural question of whether the presence of at most two moplexes
guarantees a sufficient amount of structure to efficiently solve problems that
are known to be intractable on cocomparability graphs, but not on proper
interval graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this question negatively
for two prominent problems fitting this profile, namely Graph Isomorphism and
Max-Cut. On the other hand, we prove that every connected $2$-moplex graph
contains a Hamiltonian path, generalising the same property of connected proper
interval graphs. Furthermore, for graphs with a higher number of moplexes, we
lift the previously known result that graphs without asteroidal triples have at
most two moplexes to the more general setting of larger asteroidal sets.

Euclidean spaces. First we formulate such curvature functions with desirable
properties under the manifold hypothesis. Then we make a test property for the
validity of the curvature function by the law of large numbers, and check it
for the function we construct by numerical experiments. These experiments also
suggest us to conjecture that mean of the curvature of sample manifolds
coincides with the curvature of the mean manifold. Our construction is based on
the dimension estimation by the principal component analysis and the Gaussian
curvature of hypersurfaces. Our function depends on provisional parameters
$\varepsilon, \delta$, and we suggest to deal with the resulting functions as a
function of these parameters to get some robustness. As an application, we
propose a method to decompose data sets into some parts reflecting local
structure. For this, we embed the data sets into higher dimensional Euclidean
space by using curvature values and cluster them in the embedded space. We also
give some computational experiments that support effectiveness of our methods.

    <title>Approximation Algorithms for Two-Bar Charts Packing Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1624233600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Adil Erzin, Georgii Melidi, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Nazarenko:Stepan.html">Stepan Nazarenko</a>, Roman Plotnikov <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09919">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>In the Two-Bar Charts Packing Problem (2-BCPP), it is required to pack the
bar charts (BCs) consisting of two bars into the horizontal unit-height strip
of minimal length. The bars may move vertically within the strip, but it is
forbidden to change the order and separate the chart's bars. Recently, for this
new problem, which is a generalization of the Bin Packing Problem (BPP) and
2-Dimensional Vector Packing Problem (2-DVPP), several approximation algorithms
with guaranteed estimates were proposed. However, after a preliminary analysis
of the solutions constructed by approximation algorithms, we discerned that the
guaranteed estimates are inaccurate. This fact inspired us to conduct a
numerical experiment in which the approximate solutions are compared to each
other and with the optimal ones. To construct the optimal solutions or lower
bounds for optimum, we use the Boolean Linear Programming (BLP) formulation of
2-BCPP proposed earlier and apply the CPLEX package. We also use a database of
instances for BPP with known optimal solutions to construct the instances for
the 2-BCPP with known minimal packing length. The results of the simulation
make up the main content of this paper.

    <title>Envy-freeness and Relaxed Stability for Lower-Quotas: A Parameterized Perspective</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/l/Limaye:Girija.html">Girija Limaye</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09917">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the problem of assigning agents to resources in the two-sided
preference model with upper and lower-quota requirements on resources. This
setting (known as the HRLQ setting) models real-world applications like
assigning students to colleges or courses, resident doctors to hospitals and so
on. In presence of lower-quotas, an instance may not admit a stable matching
that fulfils the lower-quotas. Prem Krishnaa et al. [SAGT 2020] study two
alternative notions of optimality for the HRLQ instances -- envy-freeness and
relaxed stability. They investigate the complexity of computing a maximum size
envy-free matching (MAXEFM) and a maximum size relaxed stable matching(MAXRSM)
that fulfils the lower-quotas. They show that both these optimization problems
are NP-hard and not approximable within a constant factor unless P=NP.
</p>
<p>In this work, we investigate the parameterized complexity of MAXEFM and
MAXRSM. We consider natural parameters derived from the instance -- the number
of lower-quota hospitals, deficiency of the instance, size of a maximum
matching, size of a stable matching, length of the preference list of a
lower-quota hospital, to name a few. We show that MAXEFM problem is W[1]-hard
for several interesting parameters but admits a polynomial size kernel for a
combination of parameters. We show that MAXRSM problem does not admit an FPT
algorithm unless P=NP for two natural parameters but admits a polynomial size
kernel for a combination of parameters in a special case. We also show that
both these problems admit FPT algorithms on a set of parameters.

finite fields, lowering it to an expected $O\big(n^{2.2131}\big)$ time for the
current values of fast rectangular matrix multiplication. We achieve the same
running time for the computation of the rank and nullspace of a sparse matrix
over a finite field. This improvement relies on two key techniques. First, we
adopt the decomposition of an arbitrary matrix into block Krylov and Hankel
matrices from Eberly et al. (ISSAC 2007). Second, we show how to recover the
explicit inverse of a block Hankel matrix using low displacement rank
techniques for structured matrices and fast rectangular matrix multiplication
algorithms. We generalize our inversion method to block structured matrices
with other displacement operators and strengthen the best known upper bounds
for explicit inversion of block Toeplitz-like and block Hankel-like matrices,
as well as for explicit inversion of block Vandermonde-like matrices with
structured blocks. As a further application, we improve the complexity of
several algorithms in topological data analysis and in finite group theory.

noninteractive protocol for summing vectors of bounded $\ell_2$ norm. By
combining this sum subroutine with techniques including mini-batch stochastic
gradient descent, accelerated gradient descent, and Nesterov's smoothing
method, we obtain loss guarantees for a variety of convex loss functions that
significantly improve on those of the local model and sometimes match those of
the central model.

    <title>TR21-083 |  Tight Space Complexity of the Coin Problem | 

	Mark Braverman, 

	Sumegha Garg, 

	Or Zamir</title>
    <summary>In the coin problem we are asked to distinguish, with probability at least $2/3$, between $n$ $i.i.d.$ coins which are heads with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\beta$ from ones which are heads with probability $\frac{1}{2}-\beta$. We are interested in the space complexity of the coin problem, corresponding to the width of a read-once branching program solving the problem. 

The coin problem becomes more difficult as $\beta$ becomes smaller. Statistically, it can be solved whenever $\beta = \Omega(n^{-1/2})$, using counting. It has been previously shown that for $\beta = O(n^{-1/2})$, counting is essentially optimal (equivalently, width $poly(n)$ is necessary [Braverman-Garg-Woodruff FOCS'20]). On the other hand, the coin problem only requires $O(\log n)$ width for $\beta&gt;n^{-c}$ for any constant $c&gt;\log_2(\sqrt{5}-1)\approx 0.306$ (following low-width simulation of AND-OR tree of [Valiant Journal of Algorithms'84]).

In this paper, we close the gap between the bounds, showing a tight threshold between the values of $\beta=n^{-c}$ where $O(\log n)$ width suffices and the regime where $poly(n)$ width is needed, with a transition at $c=1/3$. This gives a complete characterization (up to constant factors) of the memory complexity of solving the coin problem, for all values of bias $\beta$. 

We introduce new techniques in both bounds. For the upper bound, we give a construction based on recursive majority that does not require a memory stack of size $\log n$ bits. For the lower bound, we introduce new combinatorial techniques for analyzing progression of the success probabilities in read-once branching programs.</summary>

<p>Jordan Ellenberg is the author of the new <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612131/shape-by-jordan-ellenberg/9781984879059/">book</a> <em>Shape: The Hidden Geometry of Information, Biology, Strategy, Democracy, and Everything Else</em>. I just received it as a Father’s Day present.</p>
<p>
Today we convey some short musings on some ideas in the book.</p>
<p>
Ellenberg is both a biological father and a <em>Doktorvater</em>. Indeed, if we make a correct inference from his Mathematics Genealogy <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=31096">count</a> of “12 students and 13 descendants,” he must be a doctor-grandfather. His own advisor was Barry Mazur. Ellenberg holds the John D. MacArthur professorship in Mathematics at UW-Madison and a distinguished professorship named for former Wisconsin senator William Vilas. (We’ve had UW-Madison on our minds for over a month about something else, but various events including new kinds of chess-cheating cases have delayed the work needed to do it justice. While writing this paragraph, I have had a seconding role in a disqualification by an online chess platform of a player in a tournament played today.)</p>
<p>
I made my inference in the last paragraph by counting—I did not take time to click on his twelve students to verify which one has a graduated student. What strikes us about the new book is the aspect of making inferences <em>not</em> by counting.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Pandemic Phasing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our picture above was <a href="https://twitter.com/JSEllenberg/status/1209913559720837121">tweeted</a> by Ellenberg on Christmas Day, 2019, a half-hour before the start of the Milwaukee Bucks <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201912250PHI.html">playing</a> at the Philadelphia 76ers. Notice that the seats behind him have not yet filled, as of course they did for a pre-pandemic holiday game. Last night, I had on the terrific Game 7 between the Bucks and the Brooklyn Nets while processing chess data. The stands at the Brooklyn Barclays Center were within 1,000 of full capacity, but there seemed to be some spaced-out sections nearest the court that would have been teeming usually.</p>
<p>
My wife and I ventured out two weeks ago to see the Toronto Blue Jays play in Buffalo’s <a href="https://www.milb.com/buffalo">Sahlen Field</a>, their home until the border with Canada reopens. Our stadium has increased the allowed capacity from 35% that day to 80% now, but our paper noted today that by month’s end it may be the only venue not allowing 100%. Will the return to large close-packed crowds be safe—will there be sufficient “herd immunity”—involves questions raised in two chapters of Ellenberg’s book. Here is a main idea—in my words, because I haven’t had time to actually <em>read</em> the book yet (and while writing this section, it seems I am having a primary role in another impending ban from the same overseas chess event).</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Often the most immediately valuable inferences are made from judging the shapes of curves rather than calculating numerical projections. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Here is an example composed from today’s new-cases charts of Florida and the UK from the <em>Worldometer</em> coronavirus <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">pages</a>:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/06/20/the-shape-of-this-summer/floridaukcov2/" rel="attachment wp-att-18929"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-18929" height="342" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FloridaUKCov2.png?resize=352%2C342&amp;ssl=1" width="352"/></a></p>
<p>
The recent uptick in the UK is said to be caused by the new “delta” strain of the virus. I’ve chosen Florida rather than the whole US for similarity of scale and because Florida began a June upsurge this time a year ago. The US on the whole and most states show a similar fully-downward trend. Of course we hope it stays that way everywhere as the reopening phase continues. </p>
<p>
The point we are making is that if you just go by the numbers—and if you give highest weight to recent trends in those numbers—then your numerical projections can vary wildly. The logic of shape rather than number may be a more stable basis for judgment. This aligns with what we said about Ayanna Howard’s giving primacy to human rules of judgment in designs for robots in our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/24/acm-athena-lecturer-award/">post</a> a month ago. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Caveat </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There is, however, a caveat that falls in with the opening example of Ellenberg’s chapter 11, “The Terrible Law of Increase”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> An early judgment based on a seemingly best-fitting shape has maximum potential to go wrong. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The example is an over-optimistic projection of Covid-19 cases and fatalities based on an initial expectation of a cubic curve fit. We neither wish to be academically impassive or blaming over the terrible toll which we have all had to endure, but to promote depth and wisdom in spatial thinking in line with the book’s purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How can we best get quick and accurate judgments of what is in store this summer and fall?</p>

Reading the answers I received from that dream team of colleagues was like a masterclass for me and I trust that their thoughts on their award-winning paper will be of interest to many of the readers of this blog. Enjoy!<br/></p><p><b>Luca:</b> You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2021 for your paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BFb0055622" target="_blank">Alternating Refinement Relations</a>, which appeared at CONCUR 1998. In that article, you gave what I consider to be a fundamental contribution, namely the introduction of refinement relations for alternating transition systems. Could you briefly explain to our readers what alternating transition systems are? Could you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your award-winning article and why you focused on simulation- and trace-based refinement relations? Which of the results in your paper did you find most surprising or challenging? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> When we model a system by a graph, our model abstracts away some details of the system. In particular, even when systems are deterministic, states in the model may have several successors. The nondeterminism introduced in the model often corresponds to different actions taken by the system when it responds to different inputs from its environment. Indeed, a transition in a graph that models a composite system corresponds to a step of the system that may involve some components. Alternating transition systems (ATSs) enable us to model composite systems in more detail. In an ATS, each transition corresponds to a possible move in a game between the components, which are called agents. In each move of the game, all agents choose actions, and the successor state is deterministically determined by all actions. Consequently, ATSs can distinguish between collaborative and adversarial relationships among components in a composite system. For example, the environment is typically viewed adversarially, meaning that a component may be required to meet its specification no matter how the environment behaves. </p><p>In an earlier <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/Jacm02.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>, some of us introduced ATSs and Alternating Temporal Logics, which can specify properties of agents in a composite system. The CONCUR 1998 paper provided refinement relations between ATSs which correspond to alternating temporal logics. Refinement is a central issue in a formal approach to the design and analysis of reactive systems. The relation “I refines S '' intuitively means that system S has more behaviors than system I. It is useful to think about S being a specification and I an implementation. Now, if we consider a composite implementation I||E and specification S||E and we want to check that the component I refines the component S, then the traditional refinement preorders are inappropriate, as they allow I to achieve refinement of I||E with respect to S||E by constraining its environment E.  Alternating refinement relations are defined with respect to ATSs that model the interaction among the underlying components, and they enable us to check, for example, that component I has fewer behaviors than component S no matter how component E behaves. They are called “alternating” because refinement may restrict implementation actions but must not restrict environment actions. In other words, refinement may admit fewer system actions but, at the same time, more environment actions. </p><p>It was nice to see how theoretical properties of preorders in the traditional setting are carried over to the game setting, and so are the results known then about the computational price of moving to a game setting. First, the efficiency of the local preorder of simulation with respect to the global preorder of trace containment is maintained. As in the traditional setting, alternating simulation can be checked in polynomial time, whereas alternating trace-containment is much more complex. Second, the branching vs. linear characterizations of the two preorders is preserved: alternating simulation implies alternating trace containment, and the logical characterization of simulation and trace-containment by CTL and LTL, respectively, is carried over to their alternating temporal logics counterparts. The doubly-exponential complexity of alternating trace containment, as opposed to the PSPACE complexity of trace containment, is nicely related to the doubly-exponential complexity of LTL synthesis, as opposed to its PSPACE model-checking complexity,</p><p>   <b>Luca:</b> In your paper, you give logical characterisations of your alternating refinement relations in terms of fragments of alternating temporal logic. Logical characterisations of refinement relations are classic results in our field and I find them very satisfying. Since I teach a number of those results in my courses, I'd be interested in hearing how you would motivate their interest and usefulness to a student or a colleague. What would your "sales pitch" be? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> There is extensive research on the expressive power of different formalisms. Logical characterization of refinement relations tells us something about the distinguishing power of formalisms. For example, while the temporal logic CTL* is more expressive than the temporal logic CTL, the two logics have the same distinguishing power: if you have two systems and can distinguish between them with a CTL* formula (that is, your formula is satisfied only in one of the systems), then you should be able to distinguish between the two systems also with a CTL formula. Moreover, while CTL is not more expressive than LTL, we know that CTL is “more distinguishing” than LTL. These results have to do with the logical characterizations of trace containment and simulation. The distinguishing power of a specification formalism is useful when we compare systems, in particular an implementation and its abstraction: if we know that the properties we care about are specified in some formalism L, and our system refines the abstraction according to a refinement relation in which the satisfaction of specifications in L is preserved, then we can perform verification on the abstraction.</p><p> <b>Luca:</b> I am interested in how research collaborations start, as I like to tell "research-life stories" to PhD students and young researchers of all ages. Could you tell us how you started your collaboration on the award-winning paper? </p><p><b>Answer:</b>Subsets of us were already collaborating on other topics related to reactive models and model checking, and all of us shared a common belief that the field was in need to move from the limited setting of closed systems to a more general setting of open systems, that is, systems that interact with an environment. Open systems occur not only when the environment is fully or partly unknown, but also when a closed system is decomposed into multiple components, each of them representing an open system. To build “openness” into models and specifications as first-class citizens quickly leads to the game-theoretic (or “alternating”) setting. It was this realization and the joint wish to provide a principled and systematic foundation for the modeling and verification of open systems which naturally led to this collaboration.</p><p> <b>Luca:</b> Did any of your subsequent research build explicitly on the results and the techniques you developed in your award-winning paper? Which of your subsequent results on alternating transition systems and their refinement relations do you like best? Is there any result obtained by other researchers that builds on your work and that you like in particular or found surprising? </p><p><b>Answer: </b>Various subsets of us pursued multiple research directions that developed the game-theoretic setting for modeling and verification further, and much remains to be done. Here are two examples. First, the game-theoretic setting and the alternating nature of inputs and outputs are now generally accepted as providing the proper semantic foundation for interface and contract formalisms for component-based design. Second, studying strategic behavior in multi-player games quickly leads to the importance of probabilistic behavior, say in the form of randomized decisions and strategies, of equilibria, when players have non-complementary objectives, and of auctions, when players need to spend resources for decisions. All of these are still very active topics of research in computer-aided verification, and they also form a bridge to the algorithmic game theory community.    </p><p><b>Luca:</b> One can view your work as a bridge between concurrency theory and multi-agent systems. What impact do you think that your work has had on the multi-agent-system community? And what has our community learnt from the work done in the field of multi-agent systems? To your mind, what are the main differences and points of contact in the work done within those communities? </p><p><b>Answer:</b> Modeling interaction in multi-agent systems is of natural interest to planning problems studied in the AI community. In 2002, the <a href="http://www.ifaamas.org/index.html" target="_blank">International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems</a> (IFAAMAS) was formed and the annual <a href="https://aamas2021.soton.ac.uk/" target="_blank">International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems</a> (AAMAS) was launched. The models, logics, and algorithms developed in the concurrency and formal methods communities have had a strong influence on research presented at AAMAS conferences over the past twenty years. Coincidentally, this year our <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/Jacm02.pdf" target="_blank">paper on Alternating-Time Temporal Logic</a> was chosen for the <a href="http://www.ifaamas.org/award-influential.html#:~:text=IFAAMAS%3A%20Awards%3A%20Influential%20Paper&amp;text=The%20Influential%20Paper%20Award%20seeks,lasting%20contributions%20to%20the%20field." target="_blank">IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award</a>. </p> <b>Luca:</b> What are the research topics that you find most interesting right now? Is there any specific problem in your current field of interest that you'd like to see solved? <p><b>Answer:</b>Research on formal verification and synthesis, including our paper, assumes that the model of the system is known. Reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach to the design of policies in scenarios where the model is not known and has to be learned by agents by exploration. This leads to an opportunity for research at the intersection of reactive synthesis and reinforcement learning. A potentially promising direction is to consider reinforcement learning for systems with multiple agents with both cooperative and adversarial interactions. </p><p>The realization that reactive systems have to satisfy their specifications in all environments has led to extensive research relating formal methods with game theory. Our paper added alternation to refinement relations. The transition from one to multiple players has been studied in computer science in several other contexts. For the basic problem of reachability in graphs, it amounts to moving from reachability to alternating reachability. We recently studied this shift in other fundamental graph problems, like the generation of weighted spanning trees, flows in networks, vertex covers, and more. In all these extensions, we consider a game between two players that take turns in jointly generating the outcome. One player aims at maximizing the value of the outcome (e.g., maximize the weight of the spanning tree, the amount of flow that travels in the network, or the size of the vertex cover), whereas the second aims at minimizing the value. It is interesting to see how some fundamental properties of graph algorithms are lost in the alternating setting. For example, following a greedy strategy is not beneficial in alternating spanning trees, optimal strategies in alternating flow networks may use fractional flows, and while the vertex-cover problem is NP-complete, an optimal strategy for the maximizer player can be found in polynomial time. Many more questions in this setting are still open. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> What advice would you give to a young researcher who is keen to start working on topics related to alternating transition systems and logics? </p><b>Answer:</b> One important piece of advice to young researchers is to question the orthodoxy. Sometimes it is necessary to learn everything that is known about a topic but then take a step back, look at the bigger picture, reexamine some of the fundamental assumptions behind the established ways of thinking, change the models that everyone has been using, and go beyond the incremental improvement of previous results. This is particularly true in formal methods, where no single model or approach fits everything. And young researchers stand a much better chance of having a really fresh new thought than those who have been at it for many years.</div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">Most machine learning classes and textbooks mention that there is no universal supervised learning algorithm that can do reasonably well on all learning problems. Indeed, a series of “no free lunch theorems” state that even in a simple input space, for any learning algorithm, there always exists a bad conditional distribution of outputs given inputs where this algorithm performs arbitrarily bad. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, from the classic book of Luc Devroye, László Györfi, and Gábor Lugosi [<a href="https://www.szit.bme.hu/~gyorfi/pbook.pdf">1</a>, Theorem 7.2 and its extensions], for inputs uniformly distributed in \([0,1]\), for any decreasing sequence \((\varepsilon_n)_{n \geqslant 0}\) which is less than 1/16, for any learning algorithm (which takes pairs of observations and outputs a prediction function), there exists a conditional distribution on \(\{-1,1\}\) for which the expected risk of the classifier learned from \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations of (input,output) pairs is greater than \(\varepsilon_n\) for all \(n \geqslant 1\), while the best possible expected error rate is zero.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Such theorems do not imply that all learning methods are equally bad, but rather that all learning methods will suffer from some weaknessess. Throughout this blog we will try to better understand the weaknessess and strengths of popular methods through learning theory.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The key is to control the potential weaknesses of a learning method by making sure that in “favorable” scenarios, it leads to strong guarantees. When taking the simplest example of vectorial inputs in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), we can construct model classes of increasing complexity for which we can start to draw useful comparisons between learning methods.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Several aspects of the joint distribution of (input,output) \((X,Y)\) make the problem easy or hard. For concreteness and simplicity, I will focus on regression problems where the output space is \(\mathcal{Y} = \mathbb{R}\) and with the square loss, so that the optimal function, the “target” function, is \(f^\ast(x) = \mathbb{E}(Y|X=x)\). But much of the discussion extends to classification or even more complex outputs (see, e.g., [1]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Curse of dimensionality.</strong> In the context of vectorial inputs, the slowness of universal learning algorithms can be characterized more precisely, and leads to the classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>. Only assuming that the optimal target function is Lipschitz-continuous, that is, for all \(x,x’\), \(| f^\ast(x)-f^\ast(x’)| \leqslant  L \| x – x’\|\) (for any arbitrary norm on \(\mathbb{R}^d\)), the optimal excess risk of a prediction function \(\hat{f}\) obtained from \(n\) observations, that is, the expected squared difference between \(f^\ast(x)\) and \(\hat{f}(x)\) cannot be less than a constant times \(n^{-2/(d+2)}\), that is, in order for this rate to be smaller than some \(\varepsilon &lt;1 \), we need \(n\) to be larger than \(\displaystyle ( {1}/{\varepsilon} )^{d/2+1}\), with thus an exponential dependence in \(d\) (see [<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee378a/books/book1.pdf">2</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In other words, exponentially many observations are needed for a reasonable performance on all problems with a minimal set of assumptions (here Lipschitz-continuity), and this bad behavior is unavoidable unless extra assumptions are added, which we now describe.</p>



<h2>Support, smoothness and latent variables</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Low-dimensional support. </strong>If the data occupy only a \(r\)-dimensional subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^d\), with \(r \leqslant d\) (and typically much smaller), then one should expect a better convergence rate. This also extends to data supported on a (smooth) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold</a>, as illustrated below. Note that this assumption does not concern the outputs, and can reasonably be checked given the data by performing principal component analysis or some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction">manifold learning</a>. Essentially, in terms of convergence rates, \(d\) is replaced by \(r\). This is obvious if the learning algorithm has access to the \(r\)-dimensional representation, and it requires more work if not.</p>

<p class="justify-text"><strong>Smoothness of the target function. </strong>This is done by assuming some bounded derivatives for the target function \(f^\ast\). With bounded \(s\)-th order derivatives, we could expect that the problem is easier (note that Lipschitz-continuity corresponds to \(s=1\)). This is illustrated below with one-dimensional inputs. Essentially, in terms of rates, \(d\) is replaced by \(d/s\) [<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee378a/books/book1.pdf">2</a>, Theorem 3.2]. Therefore, when the smoothness order \(s\) is of order \(d\), the dependence in the dimension disappears.</p>

Left: non-smooth (even not Lipschitz-continuous) function, right: smooth function.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Latent variables.</strong> If we assume that the target function depends only on a \(r\)-dimensional linear projection of the input, then we should expect a better complexity. The most classical example is the dependence on a subset of the \(d\) original variables. Essentially, in terms of rates, \(d\) is replaced by \(r\). This is obvious when the latent variables are known (as we can replace input data by the \(r\) latent variables), totally not otherwise, as this requires some form of <em>adaptivity</em> (see below).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5964" height="252" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/latent-1024x467.png" width="553"/>Regression problem with two-dimensional inputs, with target function (with no noise). Left:  function that cannot be written with a latent variable, right: function that has a (linear) latent variable representation (there exists a direction with no variation).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Need for adaptivity.</strong> We typically don’t know in advance if these properties are satisfied or not, as some are easily testable (support of distribution) without knowing the target function \(f^\ast\), while others are not.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The goal is to have a single method that can adapt to all of these situations (which are non-exclusive). That is, if the problem has any of these reasons to be easy, will the learning method benefit from it? Typically, most learning methods have at least one hyperparameter controlling overfitting (e.g., a regularization parameter), and the precise value of this hyperparameter will depend on the difficulty of the problem, and we will assume that we have a reasonable way to estimate this hyperparameter (e.g., cross-validation). A method is then said adaptive if with a well chosen value of the hyperparameter, we get the optimal (or close to optimal) rate of estimation that benefits from the extra assumption.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Quest for adaptivity: who wins?</strong> Among classical learning techniques, which ones are adaptive to which properties? In short, <em>barring computational and optimization issues</em>: $$\mbox{ local averaging } &lt; \mbox{ positive definite kernels } &lt; \mbox{ neural networks }.$$ Every time, the next method in the list gains adaptivity to support, smoothness and then latent variables. <span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Note however that optimization for neural networks is more delicate (see below).</span></p>



<p class="justify-text">Let’s now briefly look at these methods one by one. I will assume basic knowledge of these, for more details see [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7voitv0vt24c88s/10290.pdf?dl=1">4</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf">5</a>] or my <a href="https://francisbach.com/i-am-writing-a-book/">new book in preparation</a>.</p>



<h2>Local averaging</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The earliest and simplest learning methods that could adapt to any target functions were <em>local averaging</em> methods aiming at approximating directly the conditional expectation \(f^\ast(x) = \mathbb{E}(Y|X=x)\), with the most classical examples being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm"><em>k</em>-nearest neighbors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression">Nadaraya-Watson</a> estimators.</p>



<p class="justify-text">These methods are naturally adaptive to having a reduced support for inputs. Indeed, in the simplest case of a distribution supported in a low-dimensional subspace, the global metric is equivalent to a local metric on the support, without any need to explicitly know the subspace, a situation which extends to smooth manifolds. In order to be adaptive, the hyperparameter has to depend on the dimension \(r\) of the manifold, e.g., for \(k\)-nearest-neighbors, \(k\) has to be taken proportional to \(n^{2/(2+r)}\) (see [<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~skk2175/Papers/kNNRegressionLocRatesFullVersion.pdf">3</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, there is no adaptivity to the smoothness of the target function or to potential latent variables unless dedicated algorithms are used such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression">local regression</a>. Kernel methods and neural networks lead to such adaptivity.</p>



<h2>From kernels to neural networks</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider prediction functions of the form $$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^m a_j ( b_j^\top x )_+,$$ which is the traditional single hidden layer fully connected neural network with ReLU activation functions (a constant term can be added to the linear term within the ReLU by simply appending \(1\) to \(x\), please do not call these terms “biases” as this has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_(statistics)">another meaning in statistics</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The vector \(a \in \mathbb{R}^m\) represents <em>output weights</em>, while the matrix \(b \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}\) represents <em>input weights</em>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-5975" height="300" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nn_blog-1024x546.png" width="564"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Empirical risk minimization (ERM). </strong>We assume given \(n\) i.i.d. observations \((x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\), and we will fit models by minimizing the \(\ell_2\)-regularized empirical risk (you can call it “weight decay” but it  already has a better name in machine learning and statistics). That is, we minimize $$R(a,b) = \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \Big( y_i \, – \sum_{j=1}^m a_j ( b_j^\top x_i )_+ \Big) ^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^m \Big\{ a_j^2 + \| b_j\|_2^2 \Big\},$$ where \(\lambda &gt; 0\) is a regularization parameter.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Overparametrization. </strong>We will consider the limit of large number \(m\) of hidden neurons. Depending whether we optimize over both input weights \(b\) and output weights \(a\), or simply output weights (with then a proper initialization of the input weights), we get different behaviors.</p>



<h2>Kernel regime</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We assume that the input weights \(b_j \in \mathbb{R}^d\) are sampled uniformly from the Euclidean sphere of radius \(1 / \sqrt{m}\), and that we only optimize over the output weights \(a_j, j = 1,\dots,m\). This is exactly a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression">ridge regression</a> problem (square loss and squared Euclidean penalty), for which the theory of positive definite kernels applies and will lead to an interesting behavior for infinite \(m\) [7, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2007/file/013a006f03dbc5392effeb8f18fda755-Paper.pdf">8</a>]. That is, the solution can be obtained by using the kernel function \(\hat{k}\) defined as $$\hat{k}(x,x’) = \sum_{j=1}^m ( b_j^\top x )_+( b_j^\top x’ )_+,$$ and looking for prediction functions of the form $$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \hat{k}(x,x_i).$$ See, e.g., [6] for details. In particular, as long as \(\hat{k}(x,x’)\) can be computed efficiently, the complexity of solving the ERM problem is independent of the number of neurons \(m\). We will now discuss in further detail the over-parameterized case where \(m=\infty\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) tends to infinity, If the input weights are fixed and initialized randomly from the \(\ell_2\)-sphere of radius \(1/\sqrt{m}\), then by the law of large numbers, \(\hat{k}(x,x’)\) tends to $$k(x,x’) = \mathbb{E}_{b \sim {\rm uniform} (\mathbb{S}^{d-1}) } (b^\top x )_+ (b^\top x’)_+,$$ where \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\) is the unit \(\ell_2\)-sphere in \(d\) dimensions. This kernel has a closed form and happens to be equal to (see [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2009/file/5751ec3e9a4feab575962e78e006250d-Paper.pdf">9</a>]) $$ \frac{1}{2\pi d}  \|x\|_2   \| x’\|_2 \big[ ( \pi \, – \varphi) \cos \varphi + \sin \varphi \big],$$ where \(\cos \varphi = \frac{ x^\top x’  }{{ \|x\|_2  } { \| x’\|_2   } }\). It can also be seen (see, e.g., [<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>] for details) as using predictors of the form $$f(x) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}}  ( b^\top x)_+ d \mu(b),$$ for some measure \(\mu\) on \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\), with the penalty $$\frac{\lambda}{2} \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \big| \frac{d\mu}{d\tau}(b) \big|^2 d\tau(b),$$ for the uniform probability measure \(d\tau\) on the hypersphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\). This representation will be useful for the comparison with neural networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that here we use random features in a different way from their common use [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2007/file/013a006f03dbc5392effeb8f18fda755-Paper.pdf">8</a>], where the kernel \(k\) comes first and is approximated by \(\hat{k}\) to obtain fast algorithms, typically with \(m &lt; n\). Here we start from \(\hat{k}\) and find the limiting \(k\) to understand the behavior of overparameterization. The resulting function space is a (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev</a>) space of functions on the sphere with all \(s\)-th order derivatives which are square-integrable, with \(s = d/2+3/2\) [<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>].</p>



<p>Finally, the number of neurons \(m\) needed to reach the kernel regime is well understood, at least in simple situations [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/03e0704b5690a2dee1861dc3ad3316c9-Paper.pdf">15</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/61b1fb3f59e28c67f3925f3c79be81a1-Paper.pdf">16</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now look at the various forms of adaptivity of kernel methods based on Sobolev spaces.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptivity to reduced support.</strong> Like model averaging techniques, adaptivity to input data supported on a subspace is rather straightforward, and it extends to smooth manifolds (see, e.g., [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06202.pdf">12</a>] for a proof for the Gaussian kernel).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive to smoothness.</strong> A key attractive feature of kernel methods is that they can circumvent the curse of dimensionality for <em>smooth</em> target functions, and, by simply ajusting the regularization parameter \(\lambda\), ridge regression will typically adapt to the smoothness of the target function, and thus benefit from easy problems.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The simplest instance is when the target function is within the space of functions defined above, where we immediately get estimation rates which are independent of dimension (at least in the exponent). This however requires at least \(s&gt;d/2\) derivatives (because Sobolev spaces are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space">reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces</a> (RKHS) only in this situation), but the adaptivity extends to functions outside of the RKHS (see, e.g., [11]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptivity to linear latent variables.</strong> Unfortunately, kernel methods are not adaptive even to basic linear structures. That is, if \(f^\ast\) depends only on the first component of \(x\), then ridge regression, if not modified, will not take advantage of it. In the context of neural networks, one striking example is that a single neuron \(x \mapsto (b^\top x)_+\) <em>does not belong to the RKHS</em>, and leads to bad estimation rates (see, e.g., [<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/chizat20a/chizat20a.pdf">13</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Before looking at some experiments, let’s look at some optimization considerations, that will be important later for neural networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Avoiding overparameterized neuron representations.</strong> In the kernel regime, optimizing directly the cost function with \(m\) neurons by gradient descent is problematic for two reasons when \(m\) is large:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The optimization problem, although convex, is severely ill-conditioned as can be seen from the spectrum of the covariance matrix of the feature vector, with the \(i\)-th eigenvalue equivalent to \(i^{-1-3/d}\) for the uniform input distribution (see [14, Section 2.3]). Therefore, (stochastic) gradient descent will take a lot of time to converge.</li><li>We can use kernels directly (for \(m = +\infty\)) to avoid using \(m\) very large (which would be useless in practice). The running-time complexity is then of the order \(O(n^2)\) if done naively, with lots of ways to go below \(O(n^2)\), such as column sampling (see a nice analysis in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/03e0704b5690a2dee1861dc3ad3316c9-Paper.pdf">15</a>]).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Experiments.</strong> We first consider a very simple one-dimensional example, where we look at how the estimation with the kernel function \(k\) varies as a function of the hyperparameter \(\lambda\), from underfitting to overfitting. We can observe that all learned functions are smooth, as expected.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6045" height="252" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rff_biplot.gif" width="574"/>Regression problems in one dimension with kernels (left: smooth target, right: non-smooth target), with \(n=32\) observations, with varying regularization parameters, with the optimal one shown below.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can now compare the convergence rates for the excess risk (expected squared distance beween \(f\) and \(f^\ast\)). We can see that the rates are better for smooth functions, and with the proper choice of regularization parameter, the kernel method adapts to it.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6042" height="241" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/simulations_adaptivity_rff_subplots.png" width="925"/>Left: estimation with the optimal regularization parameter for smooth target function and kernel methods. Middle: estimation with a non-smooth target function. Right: convergence rates when the number \(n\) of observations increases, averaged over 32 replications.</figure></div>



<h2>Neural networks</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now optimize over all weights, output \(a\) <em>and</em> input \(b\). Four natural questions come to mind:</p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Where does it converge to when the number \(m\) of hidden neurons tends to infinity?</li><li>What are the adaptivity properties of the resulting predictor?</li><li>How big \(m\) needs to be to achieve the infinite width behavior?</li><li>Can we actually solve the non-convex optimization problem?</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Overparameterization limit (feature learning regime).</strong> When optimizing over both sets of weights, we can first note that the prediction function is invariant by the change of variable $$ a_j \leftarrow \mu_j a_j \ , \ \ b_j \leftarrow \mu_j^{-1} b_j.$$ Then by optimizing over \(\mu_j\) which is only involved in the penalty term \(\frac{\lambda}{2} \big( a_j^2 + \|b_j\|_2^2 \big)\), we get \(\mu_j^\ast = a_j^{-2} \| b_j \|_2^2\), and the penalty \(\lambda |a_j| \| b_j\|_2\). We thus get the equivalent optimization problem of minimizing $$\tilde{R}(a,b) = \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \Big( y_i \, – \sum_{j=1}^m a_j ( b_j^\top x_i )_+ \Big) ^2 + {\lambda} \sum_{j=1}^m |a_j| \| b_j\|_2 .$$ By restricting the \(b_j\) on the unit sphere (which is OK because by optimizing over \(\mu_j\) we become scale-invariant), we can write $$\sum_{j=1}^m a_j ( b_j^\top x_i )_+ = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (b^\top x)_+ d\mu(b), $$ for $$ \mu = \sum_{j=1}^m a_j \delta_{b_j}$$ a weighted sum of Diracs, and \(\sum_{j=1}^m |a_j| \| b_j\|_2 = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \! | d\mu(b)|\) the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation">total variation</a> of \(\mu\). Thus, letting \(m\) go to infinity, the infinite sums become integrals of general measures, and we end up considering the set of functions that can be written as (see [<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>] and the many references therein for details): $$f(x) = \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}}   ( b^\top x)_+ d \mu(b),$$ with the penalty $$\lambda \int_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} \! | d\mu(b)|.$$ It has an \(\ell_1\)-norm flavor (as opposed to the \(\ell_2\)-norm for kernels), and leads to further adaptivity, if optimization problems are resolved (which is itself not easy in polynomial time, see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The minimal number of neurons to achieve the limiting behavior in terms of predictive performance (assuming optimization problems are resolved) can also be characterized, and grows exponentially in dimension without strong assumptions like the ones made in this blog post (see [<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>]). We will now study the adaptivity properties of using the function space above.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive to low-dimensional support and smoothness.</strong> It turns out that the adaptivity properties of kernel methods are preserved, both with respect to the support and the smoothness of the target function (see, e.g., [17, <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>]). However, neural networks can do better!</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Adaptive to linear substructures for one hidden layer.</strong> Given that the training of neural networks involves finding the best possible input weights, which are involved in the first linear layer, it is no surprise that we obtain adaptivity to linear latent variables. That is, if we can write \(f^\ast(x) = g(c_1^\top x, \dots, c_r^\top x)\) for some function \(g: \mathbb{R}^r \to \mathbb{R}\), then the vectors \(c_j\)’s will be essentially estimated among the \(b_j\)’s by the optimization algorithm. Therefore, when using the \(\ell_1\)-based function space, the convergence rate in the excess risk will depend on \(r\) and not \(d\) in the exponent [<a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">10</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/chizat20a/chizat20a.pdf">13</a>]. In particular, neural networks can perform <em>non-linear</em> variable selection (while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">Lasso</a> only performs <em>linear</em> variable selection). See a nice experiment in [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/chizat20a/chizat20a.pdf">13</a>] for binary classification.</p>



<p class="justify-text">One could imagine that with more hidden layers, this extends to non-linear smooth projections of the data, that is, to cases where we assume that \(f^\ast(x) = g(h(x))\) where \(h: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^r\) is a smooth function. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Thus, we obtain a stronger adaptivity for infinite \(m\) and the good choice of regularization parameter \(\lambda\). We could then try to reproduce for neural networks the figures obtained for kernel methods with varying \(\lambda\). Unfortunately, this is where non-convex optimization will make everything harder.</p>



<h2>Overfitting with a single hidden layer is hard!</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Global convergence of gradient flow for infinite width. </strong>The traditional algorithm to minimize the empirical risk is gradient descent and its stochastic extensions. In this blog post, we consider gradient descent with small step-sizes, which can be approximated by a gradient flow (as explained in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">last June blog post</a>). All parameters are randomly initialized, and we consider \(b_j\) uniformly distributed on the sphere of radius \(1/\sqrt{m}\), and \(a_j\) uniformly distributed in \(\{-1/\sqrt{m},1/\sqrt{m}\}\) (this is essentially equivalent to the traditional “Glorot” initialization [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf">18</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This corresponds to the “mean-field” scaling of initialization where neurons from both layers move (see more details in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">last </a><a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-for-wide-two-layer-neural-networks-implicit-bias/">July</a><a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/"> blog post</a> for other scalings). As shown in a joint work with Lénaïc Chizat [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">19</a>] and explained in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-descent-neural-networks-global-convergence/">last June blog post</a>, when \(m\) tends to infinity, then the gradient flow can only converge to the global minimum of the objective function, which is a non-trivial result because the cost function is not convex in \((a,b)\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Apparent good properties for small \(m\).</strong> A key property which is not yet well understood is that the global convergence behavior can be observed for \(m\) relatively small. For example, considering the one-dimensional regression example below, where the target function is the combination of 5 hidden neurons, with \(m=32\) hidden neurons, it is already possible to learn a good function with high probability (this would not be the case with \(m=5\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6048" height="292" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/regular_flow_triangular_noisy_32.png" width="319"/>One-dimensional regression from \(n = 64\) observations, by minimizing with gradient descent (and small step-size) the unregularized empirical risk.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">One extra benefit here is that no regularization (e.g., no penalty) seems needed to obtain this good behavior. Therefore it seems that we get the best of both worlds: reasonably small \(m\) (so not too costly algorithmically), and no need to regularize.</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, like in any situation where overfitting is not observed, there is the possibility of <em>underfitting</em>. To study this, let us consider a noiseless problem where \(y\) is a deterministic function of \(x\), and with a sligthly more complicated target function, which now requires 9 hidden neurons.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6077" height="277" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/regular_flow_hard_noiseless_8192.png" width="327"/>One-dimensional noiseless regression from \(n = 64\) observations, by minimizing with gradient descent (and small step-size) the unregularized empirical risk.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Even with \(m = 8192\) hidden neurons, the resulting function is not able to fit the data, which is one extreme form of simplicity bias [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/6cfe0e6127fa25df2a0ef2ae1067d915-Paper.pdf">21</a>]. There is thus strong underfitting with a single hidden layer (the situation seems to be different with deeper networks). How can this be alleviated? </p>



<h2>Kernel learning to the rescue</h2>



<p class="justify-text">A simple way to avoid the underfitting phenomenon above (but potentially get overfitting, see below) is to minimize the cost \(R(a,b)\) by leveraging a convex sub-problem, as done in the glorious days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel methods</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In the cost function $$R(a,b) = \frac{1}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^n \Big( y_i \, – \sum_{j=1}^m a_j ( b_j^\top x_i )_+ \Big) ^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^m \Big\{ a_j^2 + \| b_j\|_2^2 \Big\},$$ the problem is convex with respect to all \((a_j)\)’s; moreover, it is a least-squares problems which can be solved in closed form by matrix inversion (with algorithms that are much more robust to ill-conditioning than gradient descent). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, if we denote by \(\Phi(b) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}\) the matrix with elements \((b_j^\top x_i)_+\), the cost function can be written as a function of \(a \in \mathbb{R}^m\) as $$R(a,b) = \frac{1}{2n} \| y \, – \Phi(b) a \|_2^2 +\frac{\lambda}{2}\| a\|_2^2 +  \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^m \| b_j\|_2^2.$$ It can be minimized in closed form as $$ a = ( \Phi(b)^\top \Phi(b) + n \lambda I)^{-1} \Phi(b)^\top y = \Phi(b)^\top ( \Phi(b)\Phi(b)^\top + n \lambda I)^{-1} y,$$ where the matrix inversion lemma has been used. This leads to: $$S(b) = \inf_{a \in \mathbb{R}^m} R(a,b) = \frac{\lambda}{2} y^\top  ( \Phi(b)\Phi(b)^\top + n \lambda I)^{-1} y + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^m \| b_j\|_2^2.$$ The matrix \(\Phi(b)\Phi(b)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) is the traditional kernel matrix of the associated non-linear features. The resulting optimization problem is exactly one used in kernel learning [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/a:1012450327387.pdf">20</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Computing \(S(b)\) and its gradient with respect to \(b\) can be done in time \(O(n^2 m)\) when \(m\) is large. Since given the hidden neurons, we get the global optimum, we avoid the underfitting problem as well as the ill-conditioning issues.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) tends to infinity, then the optimization problem fits our analysis in [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">19</a>], that is, we can see the limiting flow as a Wasserstein gradient flow that can only converge to the global optimum of the associated cost function although the overall problem is not convex (as opposed to what happens in multiple kernel learning described in this <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-eta-trick-reloaded-multiple-kernel-learning/">older post</a>). While there is currently no further quantitative theoretical evidence that a good optimization behavior can be reached for a smaller \(m\), it empirically solves the underfitting issue above, as shown below.</p>

<p class="justify-text">We can now compare the convergence rates for the excess risk (expected squared distance beween \(f\) and \(f^\ast\)). We can see that the rates are better for smooth functions, and with the proper choice of regularization parameter, neural networks adapt to it.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As I tried to show in this blog post, adaptivity is a key driver of good predictive performance of learning methods. It turns out that for the three classes of methods I considered, the more complex algorithms led to more adaptivity: no optimization for local averaging, finite-dimensional convex optimization for kernel methods and then non-convex optimization for neural networks (or equivalently infinite-dimensional convex optimization).</p>



<p class="justify-text">While neural networks led to more adaptivity, they are still not totally well understood, in particular in terms of the various biases that their training implies, both for shallow and deep networks. This makes a lot of research directions to follow!</p>

Luca Trevisan had a <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2021/06/10/benny-chor/">blog post</a> on the news.<p/><p>We present a guest post on Benny Chor's life and works by Oded Goldreich. The post has many refs to papers. They will appear at the end with pointers to them.</p><hr/><p>Benny Chor was born on December 23rd 1956  and grew-up in Tel-Aviv, Israel. He studied Mathematics in the Hebrew University, receiving a B.Sc. in 1980 and an M.Sc. in 1981. He then switched to studying Computer Science at MIT, and graduated in 1985 with a PhD thesis titled</p><p> <i>Two Issues in Public Key Cryptography -- RSA Bit Security and a New Knapsack Type System</i></p><p>which received an ACM Distinguished Dissertation award. After post-doctoral periods at MIT and Harvard, he took a faculty position at the Computer Science Department of the Technion (1987-2001), and then at Tel-Aviv University, where he served as the chairman of the department for two years. He died on June 10th 2021, from a terminal disease.</p><p>Although Benny was a very articulated and verbal person, I find it impossible to describe his personality in words. The point is that words cannot capture the experience of interacting with him, which was always sheer fun. Still, I guess I should say something personal as a close friend of his. So I will just mention that he lived happily with Metsada, whom he met in the summer of 1981, and that they lovingly raised three kids: Arnon, Omer and Aya. Actually, let me also mention his life-long close relationship with his brother, Kobi.</p><p>Focusing on his contributions to science, I will confine myself to the areas of cryptography and randomized computation. Still, let me mention that in the mid 1990s, Benny's research interests gradually shifted to computational biology, but I will not review his contributions to that area, since it is very remote from my own expertise.</p><div><div>In my opinion, Benny's most important contribution to cryptography is the fundamental</div><div>paper on Verifiable Secret Sharing [CGMA].  Loosely speaking, Verifiable Secret Sharing</div><div>is a method to share a secret so that any majority of share-holders may reconstruct the</div><div>secret, whereas no minority may do so, and still each share-holder can verify that the</div><div>share that they got is a valid one.  This primitive had a tremendous impact on the</div><div>development of secure multi-party protocols, and almost all subsequent works in this</div><div>area utilize it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Additional research milestones of Benny, in the area of Cryptography, include the proof</div><div>of the existence of a ``hard-core'' in the RSA and Rabin functions [BCS, ACGS], the</div><div>introduction and design of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes [CGKS] (as well</div><div>as their computational counterparts [CG97]), and the introduction and design of</div><div>Tracing Traitor schemes [CFNP].  Each of these works deserves more than the foregoing</div><div>brief mention, yet I'm not even mentioning other important works like [CK].</div><div><br/></div><div>Turning to the area of Randomized Computation, Benny's contributions span diverse areas</div><div>ranging from the manipulation of randomness to the use of randomness in complexity theory</div><div>and distributed computing.  In particular, his work on weak sources of randomness [CG88]</div><div>identified min-entropy (of the source) as the key parameter for randomness extraction and</div><div>presented a simple two-source extractor.  Distilling an aspect of [ACGS], his work on</div><div>pairwise-independent sampling [CG89] demonstrates the general applicability of this method. His works in distributed computing include a randomized Byzantine Agreement protocol [CC] that beats the deterministic bound without using unproven assumptions.  Lastly, let me just mention a couple of his complexity-theoretic works: [BCGL, CCGHHRR].</div><div><br/></div><div>Benny was a superb teacher and a devoted graduate student adviser.  It is tempting to try</div><div>listing the numerous educational projects that he initiated, and his former students, but</div><div>these lists will be too long and the risk of a crucial omissions is too high.  So let me</div><div>end by expressing the feeling of loss that is shared by many in our community,</div><div>which adds to my personal sorrow.</div></div><div><br/></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VxGM4xSHMwU/YMtBVdfDCMI/AAAAAAAB8Vo/47D34yqw-pEpjSLuzOk-lvHn6HFOPTyVACLcBGAsYHQ/s634/benny2.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VxGM4xSHMwU/YMtBVdfDCMI/AAAAAAAB8Vo/47D34yqw-pEpjSLuzOk-lvHn6HFOPTyVACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/benny2.jpg" width="320"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Oded and Benny</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TJNVzF4e9HE/YMtBVWGdtXI/AAAAAAAB8Vs/jvxumCSZxPw-Oqr4cqQGf35n8ds3KLaDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1415/benny4.jpg" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TJNVzF4e9HE/YMtBVWGdtXI/AAAAAAAB8Vs/jvxumCSZxPw-Oqr4cqQGf35n8ds3KLaDwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/benny4.jpg" width="320"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Benny with his family's namesake (Chor = Bull)</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><div>[ACGS] Werner Alexi, Benny Chor, Oded Goldreich, Claus-Peter Schnorr:</div><div><div>RSA and Rabin Functions: Certain Parts are as Hard as the Whole.</div><div>SIAM J.

    <title>TR21-082 |  Hardness on any Samplable Distribution Suffices: New Characterizations of One-Way Functions by Meta-Complexity | 

	Rahul Santhanam, 

	Hanlin Ren, 

	Rahul Ilango</title>
    <summary>We show that one-way functions exist if and only if there is some samplable distribution D such that it is hard to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity of a string sampled from D. Thus we characterize the existence of one-way functions by the average-case hardness of a natural \emph{uncomputable} problem on samplable distributions, extending a recent line of work by Liu and Pass (FOCS'20, STOC'21) and Ren and Santhanam (CCC'21).

    We also show that the average-case hardness of approximating Minimum Circuit Size on a locally samplable distribution (where the sampler runs in sub-linear time by using random access to its input) is equivalent to the existence of one-way functions. This is the first characterization of one-way functions by a natural average-case hardness assumption on the Minimum Circuit Size Problem. We present several other characterizations and connections between one-way functions and average-case hardness of meta-complexity problems (problems about complexity) on samplable distributions.

    We give various applications of these results to the foundations of cryptography and the theory of meta-complexity. We show that the average-case hardness of deciding k-SAT or Clique on any samplable distribution of high enough entropy implies the existence of one-way functions. Thus one-way functions follow from general assumptions on the average-case hardness of NP-complete problems. We observe that our assumptions are implied by standard cryptographic assumptions such as the Planted Clique hypothesis and the pseudorandomness of Goldreich's local functions.

    Our results imply a range of \emph{equivalences} between various meta-complexity problems, showing that the theory of meta-complexity is very \emph{robust} when considering average-case complexity. We use our results to unconditionally solve various meta-complexity problems in CZK (computational zero-knowledge) on average, and give implications of our results for the classic question of proving NP-hardness for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem.</summary>

</p><h2> The Paper </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Perlis and Rich DeMillo and I wrote the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> “Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems<br/>
and Programs” in the middle of the second half of the last century—pushing towards fifty years ago. We were responding to the then-common view that programs should be proved correct—proved in the same manner that one proves theorems like: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Euclid)</b> <em> There are an infinite number of prime numbers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We begged to object: We felt that correctness of programs was fundamentally a different issue. This is what the debate is all about. </p>
<p>
The debate will give us all a chance to reflect now almost 50 years later when programs enrich and regulate so much more of our lives.  Perhaps the real winner in society goes according to the proverb: “the one who ends up with the most toys.”  In that case, Harry the moderator will win hands down:</p>

</p><p/><h2> The Writing </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Mary-Claire van Leunen is an expert on writing, especially for technical articles. See her famous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&amp;rh=p_27%3AMary-Claire+van+Leunen&amp;s=relevancerank&amp;text=Mary-Claire+van+Leunen&amp;ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1">book</a>.</p>
<p>
The article was heavily written by Rich with input from Alan and myself. The ideas are due to all of us. The actual details, the words, the punctuation owe more to Rich with strong input from Mary-Claire. </p>
<p>
Our paper is one of forty-six papers included in the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future">book</a> <i>Ideas That Created the Future: Classic Papers of Computer Science</i>, which was edited by Harry for MIT Press (2020).  They are presented in chronological order beginning with Aristotle (~350 BCE).  The median year is 1962-63.  </p>

    <title>TR21-081 |  Superpolynomial Lower Bounds Against Low-Depth Algebraic Circuits | 

	Sébastien Tavenas, 

	Srikanth Srinivasan, 

	Nutan Limaye</title>
    <summary>An Algebraic Circuit for a polynomial $P\in F[x_1,\ldots,x_N]$ is a computational model for constructing the polynomial $P$ using only additions and multiplications. It is a \emph{syntactic} model of computation, as opposed to the Boolean Circuit model, and hence lower bounds for this model are widely expected to be easier to prove than lower bounds for Boolean circuits. Despite this, we do not have superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of depth 3 (except over constant-sized finite fields) and depth 4 (over any field), while constant-depth Boolean circuit lower bounds have been known since the early 1980s.

In this paper, we prove the first superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of all constant depths over all fields of characteristic $0$ (or large). We also prove the first lower bounds against homogeneous algebraic circuits of constant depth over any field.

Our approach is surprisingly simple. We first prove superpolynomial lower bounds for constant-depth Set-Multilinear circuits. While strong lower bounds were already known against such circuits, most previous lower bounds were of the form $f(d)\cdot poly(N)$, where $d$ denotes the degree of the polynomial.  In analogy with Parameterized complexity, we call this an FPT lower bound. We extend a well-known technique of Nisan and Wigderson (FOCS 1995) to prove non-FPT lower bounds against constant-depth set-multilinear circuits computing the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$ (which computes a fixed entry of the product of $d$ $n\times n$ matrices). More precisely, we prove that  any set-multilinear circuit of depth $\Delta$ computing $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size at least $n^{d^{\exp(-O(\Delta))}}.$ This result holds over any field.

We then show how to convert any constant-depth algebraic circuit of size $s$ to a constant-depth set-multilinear circuit with a blow-up in size that is exponential in $d$ but only polynomial in $s$ over fields of characteristic $0$. (For depths greater than $3$, previous results of this form increased the depth of the resulting circuit to $\Omega(\log s)$.) This implies our constant-depth circuit lower bounds for $d$ that is a slow-growing function of $n$.

Finally, we observe that our superpolynomial lower bound for constant-depth circuits  implies the first deterministic sub-exponential time algorithm for solving the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem for all small depth circuits  using the known connection between algebraic hardness and randomness.</summary>

<p>In recent years there has been increasing interest in using machine<br/>learning to improve the performance of classical algorithms in<br/>computer science, by fine-tuning their behavior to adapt to the<br/>properties of the input distribution. This “data-driven” or<br/>“learning-based” approach to algorithm design has the potential to<br/>significantly improve the efficiency of some of the most widely used<br/>algorithms. For example, it has been used to design better data<br/>structures, online algorithms, streaming and sketching algorithms,<br/>market mechanisms and algorithms for combinatorial optimization,<br/>similarity search and inverse problems. This virtual workshop will<br/>feature talks from experts at the forefront of this exciting area.</p>

<h1 id="the-chip-firing-antimatroid">The chip-firing antimatroid</h1>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-firing_game">Chip-firing games</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">sandpile models</a>, are systems described by a graph, with markers of some kind such as coins on its vertices. The graph may possibly be directed, although in the simplest examples it is undirected, and it may be infinite. Each vertex may have arbitrarily many coins on it. But, if a vertex has at least as many coins as it has outgoing edges, we can “fire” the vertex, moving one coin to each neighbor. This repeats until no more such events are possible. Doing this on an infinite square grid with an initial state that piles many coins on a single vertex leads to pretty fractals; here’s a detail of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sandpile_on_infinite_grid,_3e7_grains.png">the result of starting with 30 million coins</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Detail of abelian sandpile model on square grid with 3x10^7 starting coins, extracted from CC-BY-SA image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sandpile_on_infinite_grid,_3e7_grains.png by colt_browning" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/sandpile-30M-detail.png" width="80%"/></p>

<p>However, we’ll be looking at this sort of system on one-dimensional infinite graphs, where their behavior is not quite as complicated.</p>

<p>Chip-firing, on any graph and any placement of coins for which it terminates, forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>.<sup id="fnref:bls"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:bls" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:k"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:k" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> A vertex \(v\) can fire for the \(i\)th time, as long as it has already fired \(i-1\) times and a total of \(i\cdot\deg(v)\) coins have reached it. Once these conditions are met, they remain true until \(v\) fires. This idea, that once the item \((v,i)\) becomes available to be added to the sequence of firings it remains available until it is added, is the defining principle of an antimatroid. From it one can prove that, if any firing sequence terminates in a stable configuration, then all sequences terminate, they all fire the same vertices the same numbers of times, and they all end in the same stable configuration.</p>

<h1 id="binary-carrying-as-chip-firing">Binary carrying as chip-firing</h1>

<p>A binary representation of a number \(x\) is just a set of distinct powers of two, summing to \(x\). If you add two binary numbers \(x\) and \(y\), you can combine their sets into a single multiset; carrying can be thought of as a systematic method of getting rid of the duplicate powers of two in this multiset. Whenever you have two equal powers of two in a multiset, whose sum you are trying to represent, you can merge them with the fusion rule</p>

\[2^i+2^i \Rightarrow 2^{i+1}.\]

<p>This can be thought of as a chip-firing game on a graph where there is a vertex for every power of two, an edge to the next larger power of two, and an edge to a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_bucket">bit bucket</a>” vertex with no outgoing edges (which cannot be fired). Each instantiation of the fusion rule fires vertex \(2^i\), moving one coin to \(2^{i+1}\) and one to the bit bucket.</p>

<p>This is exactly what we are doing when we carry a term in binary addition: taking two powers of two from a column of the addition problem and fusing them into a single power of two in the next column. We can also think of this physically, using a one-dimensional array of cells with poker chips or coins on them, with a coin on cell \(i\) representing the number \(2^i\). The fusion rule takes two coins from any cell and replaces them by a single coin in the next cell. In binary addition of pairs of numbers, there are at most three coins per cell (the two that started out there and one carry), but you could use the same fusion rule for addition of more than two numbers, using an array of cells that can each contain a large pile of coins.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Five stacks of coins. Image Money-2180330 1920.jpg on Wikimedia commons, uploaded by Stella Vogt from pixabay free images, described as &quot;probably free&quot; but tagged with a CC-BY-SA license." src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/stacks-of-coins.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" width="80%"/></p>

<p>Carrying the coin analogy further, we might imagine that the coins have values that are powers of two, and that we are making change by replacing pairs of small coins by a single larger coin of equal value.</p>

<p>Conventional binary arithmetic does these fusion steps in a systematic order, from low-order bits of the binary representation (smaller powers of two) to higher-order bits (larger powers of two). It’s that systematic order, together with the observation that each pile has at most three coins, that makes this method suitable for a finite state machine. But actually, you could apply the fusion rule in any order, and it would work equally well. Each step reduces the number of coins by one, so you can never do more steps than your starting number of coins. We can only halt when we reach the binary representation of the sum, which is uniquely determined, so this process is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)">confluent</a>: every sequence of choices leads to the same eventual outcome. In this case, confluence can also be seen from the antimatroid property of chip-firing games.</p>

<p>This observation about reducing the number of powers of two gives an immediate proof of a fact about binary representations that you may not have known: the binary representation of \(x+y\) has at most as many nonzero bits as there are in \(x\) and \(y\) separately.</p>

<h1 id="chip-firing-for-fibonacci-numbers">Chip-firing for Fibonacci numbers</h1>

<p>Now, instead of coins with power-of-two values, let’s suppose that they have Fibonacci numbers as their values, representing any multiset of Fibonacci numbers. We can still combine pairs of Fibonacci numbers by a fusion rule, that now applies when we have two coins in adjacent piles:</p>

\[F_i + F_{i+1} \Rightarrow F_{i+2}.\]

<p>But in order to get the Zeckendorf representation of the sum of the multiset, we also need to deal with pairs of coins that have the same value, because repeated copies of the same Fibonacci number are not allowed in the Zeckendorf representation. We can accomplish this by a “fission” rule, that steps backwards according to the fusion rule in order to take a bigger step forwards:</p>

\[F_i+F_i \Rightarrow F_{i-2}+F_{i-1}+F_i\Rightarrow F_{i-2}+F_{i+1}.\]

<p>This makes sense even when \(F_i\) is \(1\) or \(2\): for \(F_i=1\), the \(F_{i-2}\) term is zero and can be dropped from the sum, and for \(F_i=2\) it equals one, a Fibonacci number. So as special cases of this rule we have \(1+1\Rightarrow 2\) and \(2+2\Rightarrow 1+3\).</p>

<p>Several issues complicate the analysis of this replacement system. First, although fission by itself is a chip-firing rule on an infinite graph with outdegree two, fission and fusion together make a more complicated system that is not an antimatroid, so different orderings of choosing what to do may lead to different numbers of steps. Second, the fission rule changes the piles of coins both to the left and to the right of the pile to which it applies, making it harder to find a consistent ordering in which to apply these rules. And third, fission preserves the number of coins rather than reducing them, making both the eventual termination of the system and the analysis of how many steps it takes less obvious. But assuming it does terminate, it can only terminate at the Zeckendorf representation, which is unique. So termination implies confluence.</p>

<h1 id="fission-without-fusion">Fission without fusion</h1>

<p>First let’s see what happens if we just use the fission rule, forgetting about the fusion rule. Because fission by itself is a chip-firing rule, any initial state has an invariant number of firings and an invariant final state, regardless of the order of operations. For an initial state with \(n\) copies of \(F_i\), the final state gives us an expansion of \(F_i\) into a sum of \(n\) distinct Fibonacci numbers:</p>

\[F_i = F_i\]

\[2\,F_i = F_{i-2}+F_{i+1}\]

\[3\,F_i=F_{i-2}+F_i+F_{i+1}\]

\[4\,F_i=F_{i-4}+F_{i-3}+F_i+F_{i+2}\]

\[\vdots\]

<p>The indexes appearing in these identities can be summarized in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Triangles_of_numbers">triangle of numbers</a>:</p>

\[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;\ 1\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 1\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;&amp;\\
&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;\\
-6&amp;&amp;-5&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-1&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 3\ \\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
\end{array}\]

<p>The largest number in each row grows only logarithmically with \(n\), because of the way the values of the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially as a function of their index. The fission rule cannot create gaps of three or more empty cells,
so consecutive numbers in a row differ by at most three, implying that the smallest number in each row is greater than \(-3n\). Because of this linear bound on how far fission can move the coins, we get a quadratic bound on the total number of firing events: each firing decreases the total distance of the coins from cell \(-3n\). This total distance starts at \(3n^2\) and remains positive, so there can  be at most \(3n^2\) firings. In computational experiments up to \(n=10000\) the actual number of firings never exceeded \(n^2\) and appeared to be growing as \(n^2\bigl(1-o(1)\bigr)\). This is a big contrast from the behavior of the similar-looking chip-firing rule on a line of cells that replaces pairs of coins by a coin one cell to the left and a coin one cell to the right, which (with \(n\) chips starting in a pile on one cell) produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramidal_number">square pyramidal number</a> of firings, cubic in \(n\).</p>

<p>For initial coins that are not all in one big pile, it remains impossible for fission to produce new long gaps, and we can decompose the sequence of cells into subsequences of linear length separated by gaps too long to be crossed. The same analysis of total distance of coins from the starts of sequences of cells shows that, regardless of starting state, and even if we also allow fusion rules, we get an \(O(n^2)\) bound on the total number of steps. In particular, this system always terminates.</p>

<h1 id="taking-few-steps">Taking few steps</h1>

<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to take quadratic time to simplify sums of Fibonacci numbers into their Zeckendorf representations using these rules. The problem with the previous analysis was that we were doing too much fission before we did any fusion. Suppose we sidestep that with the following prioritization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If any fusion step would put a coin into a pile that is currently empty, do it.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, perform a fission step at the pile with the largest possible index.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any fusion steps are possible, there must be at least one (for instance, the one with the largest index) that is prioritized. To analyze these prioritized steps, define \(N\) to be the current number of coins, and \(M\) to be the number of coins that are at or below a pile with two or more coins on it. The key insight is that whenever a step moves a coin to a pile with a larger index, it cannot form a new larger-index multi-coin pile, so both \(M\) and \(N\) are non-decreasing. They can stay the same only for a fission step at a pile of three or more coins, but in that case the next step must be a fusion. \(M\) and \(N\) are both \(\le n\), and their sum decreases at least once for every two steps, so the total number of steps is \(\le 4n\). Thus, this prioritized chip-firing method can reduce any sum of Fibonacci numbers to its Zeckendorf representation in a linear number of steps. It’s also not difficult to implement so that it takes linear time.</p>

<h1 id="zeckendorf-arithmetic">Zeckendorf arithmetic</h1>

<p>Anyway, now that we have a way of simplifying sums of Fibonacci numbers to their Zeckendorf form, let’s use it for arithmetic on Zeckendorf representations, without the need to reduce them to simpler forms.</p>

<p>First, addition. This is very easy: Add the two Zeckendorf representations as multisets (producing piles of coins that might be adjacent, or might have two coins in them) and then simplify. The result is a linear time for adding two Zeckendorf representations, as was already known. But because it isn’t based on finite state machines, it can also handle more than two coins, for instance by adding multiple numbers at once rather than having to reduce the problem to multiple pairwise additions. As with binary arithmetic, the chip-firing method gives a quick proof of a non-obvious fact: the Zeckendorf representation of \(x+y\) has at most as many nonzero terms as there are in \(x\) and \(y\) put together.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use this technique (or really, any linear-time Zeckendorf addition algorithm) as part of a long multiplication algorithm for Zeckendorf representations. To multiply two numbers \(x\) and \(y\), both given by their Zeckendorf representations, first perform a sequence of additions to compute the representations of the numbers \(F_i\cdot x\), each computed as \((F_{i-1}\cdot x)+(F_{i-2}\cdot x)\) in a single addition from earlier numbers in the sequence. Then pick out the subset of these representations for which \(F_i\) belongs to the Zeckendorf representation of \(y\), and add them together. (Or interleave the computation of \(F_i\cdot x\) and the sum of these representations, to save space.) The total time for \(\ell\)-bit inputs is \(O(\ell^2)\), as it is for the usual long multiplication algorithm. I’m using the different variable \(\ell\), because the time here is a function of all the bits in the input Zeckendorf representation, rather than just the number of nonzero bits.</p>

<p>You can convert a binary number to Zeckendorf with the same idea, computing the sequence of powers of two and then picking out and adding together the subset of these powers used in the binary representation of the input. In the other direction, you can convert a Zeckendorf representation to binary by computing the Fibonacci sequence in binary, picking out the terms from the given Zeckendorf representation, and adding them. Both directions of conversion take time \(O(\ell^2)\). A recent paper by Sergeev shows how to do these conversions much more efficient, only logarithmically slower than binary-number multiplication.<sup id="fnref:s"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:s" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Based on Sergeev’s results it would also be much more efficient (in theory at least, if not necessarily in practice) to multiply Zeckendorf representations by converting to binary, multiplying in binary, and converting back.</p>

<p>As the article I linked at the start hints, the direct algorithms described here are a bit unsatisfactory from the point of view of circuit complexity: the circuit size is ok but the circuit depth is much larger than it would be for binary arithmetic. I’m not convinced that this is a serious deficiency, because we’re not likely to build computers that use this arithmetic at the circuit level. Any algorithms like this are more likely to be used only in specialized situations where Zeckendorf arithmetic is relevant, like the analysis of certain combinatorial games.</p>

<h1>Causality</h1>



<p>We may have heard that <strong>“correlation does not imply causation”</strong>. How can we mathematically represent this statement, and furthermore differentiate the two rigorously?</p>



<p>Roughly speaking, <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are correlated if <img alt="P(B=b|A=a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%3Db%7CA%3Da%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is different for different values of <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. To represent causation, we change the second part of the formula: <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> causes <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if <em>intervening</em> to change <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to some value <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> changes the probability of <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. That is,</p>



<p><img alt="Pr(B=b|\text{ do }A\leftarrow a)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Pr%28B%3Db%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DA%5Cleftarrow+a%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>depends on <img alt="a" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<h2>Example of Causality</h2>



<p>Suppose we have the random variables <img alt="X,W,H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CW%2CH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (taken over choice of a random person), which represent e<strong>X</strong>ercising, being over<strong>W</strong>eight and having <strong>H</strong>eart disease, respectively. We put forth the following (hypothetical! this is not medical advice!) scenarios for their relationships:</p>



<p><strong>Scenario 1.</strong> <img alt="X\sim Bern(1/2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csim+Bern%281%2F2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the overweight indicator, follows the causal relation:</p>



<p><img alt="W \sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } X = 1\\ Bern(1/2) &amp; \text{if } X=0\end{cases}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W+%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X+%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%281%2F2%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X%3D0%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>and the heart disease indicator <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> follows the same rule</p>



<p><img alt="H \sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } X = 1\\ Bern(1/2) &amp; \text{if } X=0\end{cases}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X+%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%281%2F2%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X%3D0%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>So, in this scenario, exercise prevents heart disease and being overweight, while if we don’t exercise, we may be overweight or suffer from heart disease with probability 1/2 independently..</p>



<p><strong>Scenario 2.</strong> <img alt="W\sim Bern(1/4)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%5Csim+Bern%281%2F4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p><img alt="X\sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } W= 1\\ Bern(2/3) &amp; \text{if } W=0 \end{cases}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+W%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%282%2F3%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+W%3D0+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>and <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> still depends on <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the same rule in the previous scenario. So, in this scenario, people are naturally prone to being overweight with probability 1/4, and being overweight makes you less likely to exercise, rather than the causal relation being in the other way around. As before, exercise prevents heart disease, and someone who did not exercise will get heart disease with probability 1/2.</p>



<p>We find that in scenario 1, <img alt="P(W=1|X=0)=1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7CX%3D0%29%3D1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In scenario 2,</p>



<p><img alt="P(W=1|X=0)=\frac{P(W=1)P(X=0|W=1)}{P(X=0)}=\frac{\frac14\cdot 1}{\frac14+\frac34\frac13}=\frac12." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7CX%3D0%29%3D%5Cfrac%7BP%28W%3D1%29P%28X%3D0%7CW%3D1%29%7D%7BP%28X%3D0%29%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac14%5Ccdot+1%7D%7B%5Cfrac14%2B%5Cfrac34%5Cfrac13%7D%3D%5Cfrac12.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>In fact, as this table shows, the probabilities for all combinations of <img alt="X,W,H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CW%2CH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are identical in the two scenarios!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/HGYQ4eh.png"/></figure>



<p>Now, consider the intervention of setting <img alt="X=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, i.e. stop exercising. That is, we change the generating model for <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to be <img alt="X:=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3A%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In scenario 1, <img alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is still <img alt="1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. In scenario 2, <img alt="X=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> tells us nothing about <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> now so we get <img alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)=1/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29%3D1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now that we added in an intervention, the two scenarios are different!</p>



<p>This is an example of why <strong>correlations are not causations</strong>: while the conditional probabilities <img alt="\Pr( W=1 |X=0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr%28+W%3D1+%7CX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> identical in the two scenarios, the causal probabilities are diffent <img alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/LGEGtvR.png"/></figure>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color" style="color: #a30000;">NOTE:</span></strong> Working out this example,  and understanding <strong>(a)</strong> why the two scenarios induce identical probabilities, and in particular all conditional probabilities are identical and <strong>(b)</strong> why the causal probabilities differ from the conditional probabilities in Scenario 2, is a great way to get intuition for causality and its pitfalls.</p>



<h2>Causal Probabilities and confounders</h2>



<p>Consider Scenario 1, where the causal structure is as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/FJlQyaO.png"/></figure>



<p>Looking at the table above, we see that the unconditional probability <img alt="P(H=1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> equals <img alt="1/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Since in this scenario, there is no causal relation between being overweight and suffering from heat disease, the causal probability  <img alt="P(H=1 | \text{ do } W \leftarrow 0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1+%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+W+%5Cleftarrow+0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>  is also equal to  <img alt="1/4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>However, we can calculate the conditional probability from the table and see that <img alt="P(H=1|W=0)=1/6" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1%7CW%3D0%29%3D1%2F6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/>That means that even though in this scenario, there is no causal relation between being overweight and getting heart disease, conditioning on not being overweight reduces the probability of getting heart disease.<br/>Once again we see here a <strong>gap</strong> between the <strong>conditional </strong>and <strong>causal</strong> probabilities.</p>



<p>The reason is for this gap is that there is a <strong>counfounding variable</strong>, namely <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is a common cause of both <img alt="H" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <img alt="H,W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2CW&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are <em>confounded</em> if there are values <img alt="h,w" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%2Cw&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that</p>



<p><img alt="P(H=h|\text{ do }W=w)\neq P(H=h|W=e)," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DW%3Dw%29%5Cneq+P%28H%3Dh%7CW%3De%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>To fix the effect of a confounder, we condition on <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It also allows us to find the probability of an intervention. The general <strong>deconfounding formula</strong> is</p>



<p><img alt="P(H=h|\text{ do }W=w)=\sum_x P(H=h|W=w, X=x) P(X=x)\;\;" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DW%3Dw%29%3D%5Csum_x+P%28H%3Dh%7CW%3Dw%2C+X%3Dx%29+P%28X%3Dx%29%5C%3B%5C%3B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>   (★),</p>



<p>where <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> ranges over all the immediate causes of <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the formula for computing the conditional probability which is</p>



<p><img alt="P(H=h | W=w) = \sum_x P(H=h | W=w, X=x) P(X=x | W=w)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh+%7C+W%3Dw%29+%3D+%5Csum_x+P%28H%3Dh+%7C+W%3Dw%2C+X%3Dx%29+P%28X%3Dx+%7C+W%3Dw%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Using the deconfounding formula (★) requires <strong>(a)</strong> knowing the causal graph, and <strong>(b)</strong> observing the confounders. If we get this wrong and control for the wrong confounders we can get the causal probabilities wrong, as demonstrated by the following example.</p>



<p><br/>One way to describe causality theory is that it aims to clarify the situations under which <strong>correlation does in fact equal causation</strong> (i.e., the <strong>conditional probabilities are equal to the causal probabilities</strong>), and how (by appropriately controlling for confounders) we can get to such a situation.</p>



<p><strong>Example (two diseases)</strong> Consider the diagram below where there are two diseases <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> such that each occurs independently with probability <img alt="p" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We assume each will send you to the hospital (variable <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) and those are the only reason to arrive at the hospital.</p>



<p>If you control for <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (i.e look at only people who went to the hospital), we find that the probabilities are now correlated: A priori the probability is <img alt="p/(2p-p^2)\approx 1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2F%282p-p%5E2%29%5Capprox+1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and conditioned on <img alt="X=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, the probability is <img alt="p^2/p=p &lt;1/2" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2%2Fp%3Dp+%3C1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/9mETSEo.png"/></figure>



<p>This relates to the joke “the probability of having 2 bombs on a plane is very low, so if I bring a bomb then it is very unlikely that there will be another bomb.”</p>



<p>In general, the causal graph can look as one of the following shapes:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/ARygORn.png"/></figure>



<p>If <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a fork then controlling for <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can tease out the causal relation. If <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a mediator or collider then controlling for <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can actually make things worse. –&gt;</p>



<p><strong>Backdoor paths:</strong> If <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are two random variables, we say that there is a “backdoor path” from <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if there is direct ancestor <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is connected in the undirected version of the causal graph in a path not going through <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/n45KXt9.png"/></figure>



<p>We can show the following theorem:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If there is no backdoor path then <img alt="P(Y=y | \text{ do } X \leftarrow X) = P(Y=y|X=x)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28Y%3Dy+%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+X+%5Cleftarrow+X%29+%3D+P%28Y%3Dy%7CX%3Dx%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Here is a “proof by picture”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/UAC2lWE.png"/></figure>



<p>If there isn’t a backdoor path, we sort the graph in topological order, so that all the events that happen before <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are not connected to <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> except through <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. So we can first generate all the variables <img alt="A" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that result in <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Then the probability distribution of the events <img alt="B" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> between <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> only depends on the value <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="X" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so similarly <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is generated from some probability distribution that only depends on <img alt="x" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<h2>Experimental Design</h2>



<p>When we design experiments, we often want to estimate <em>causal effects</em>, and to do so we try to make sure we eliminate backdoor paths.<br/>Consider the example of a COVID vaccine trial.<br/>We let <img alt="V=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the event that a trial participant obtained a vaccine, and <img alt="C=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> be the event that the participant was infected with COVID.<br/>We want to figure out <img alt="P(C=1|\text{ do }V=1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28C%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DV%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/>However, there is a “backdoor path”.<br/>You will not get the vaccine if you don’t participate in the trial (which we denote by <img alt="V=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), but particpating in the trial could change your behavior and hence have a causal effect on <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>To fix this we can cut the backdoor path using a placebo: it cuts the backward path by removing the confounding variable of participation, since it ensure that (conditioning on <img alt="P=1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>), <img alt="V" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is now an independent variable from any behavioral changes that might impact <img alt="C" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/TfH4Bzn.png"/></figure>



<h2>Conditioning</h2>



<p>In general, how does conditioning on some variable <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> affect correlations? It may introduce correlations in events that occur before <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but cuts any path that depends on <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.<br/><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Qk5p0s7.png"/></p>



<h2>Average Treatment Effect and Propensity Score</h2>



<p>Suppose we have some treatment variable <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that we don’t get to control (e.g. in a natural experiment). Let <img alt="Y_t = Y| \text{ do } T=t" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_t+%3D+Y%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+T%3Dt&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> , and we hope to estimate <img alt="E(Y_1)-E(Y_0)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y_1%29-E%28Y_0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> which is known as the the <strong>treatment effect</strong>.<br/>However, we worry that some underlying variable <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> (e.g. healthy lifestyle) can affect both <img alt="Y" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>The <em>propensity score</em>, defined as <img alt="e(z)=E(T|Z=z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%28z%29%3DE%28T%7CZ%3Dz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, allows us to calculate <img alt="E(Y|\text{ do T}=1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+T%7D%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We claim that as long as <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a valid confounder (for which the formula (★) holds)</p>



<p><img alt="E(Y|\text{ do T}=1)=E(YT/e(Z))." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+T%7D%3D1%29%3DE%28YT%2Fe%28Z%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>The proof is obtained by expanding out the claim, see below</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/gyKYlZn.png"/></figure>



<p>Intuitively, knowing the probability that different groups of people get treatment allows us to make <img alt="T" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> independent from <img alt="(Y_0,Y_1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Y_0%2CY_1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and calculate the treatment effect.</p>



<p><strong>Calculating treatment effect using ML.</strong> Suppose that the treatment effect is <img alt="\tau" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="Y=\psi(Z)+\tau T+\text{ noise}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5Cpsi%28Z%29%2B%5Ctau+T%2B%5Ctext%7B+noise%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Now, if we learn a model <img alt="f(z)\approx E(Y|Z=z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28z%29%5Capprox+E%28Y%7CZ%3Dz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, then</p>



<p><img alt="Y-f(z)\approx \tau(T-e(z))." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y-f%28z%29%5Capprox+%5Ctau%28T-e%28z%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Since both <img alt="Y-f(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y-f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="T-e(z)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T-e%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are calculable, we only need to do a linear regression.</p>



<h2>Instrumental Variables</h2>



<p>When we cannot observe the counfounding variable, we can still sometimes use <em>instrumental variables</em> to estimate a causal effect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/XHo3Q5e.png"/></figure>



<p>Assume a linear model <img alt="Y=\tau T+f(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5Ctau+T%2Bf%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, where <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the stuff we don’t observe. If <img alt="Z" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is some variable that satisfies <img alt="Cov(Z,f(W))=0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Cov%28Z%2Cf%28W%29%29%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> then</p>



<p><img alt="\tau=\frac{Cov(Z,Y)}{Cov(Z,T)}," class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D%5Cfrac%7BCov%28Z%2CY%29%7D%7BCov%28Z%2CT%29%7D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>which is the ratio between two observable quantities.</p>



<h1>Fairness</h1>



<p>We focus on fairness in classification problems, rather than fairness in learning generative models or representation (which also have their own issues, see in particular <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">this paper</a> by Bender, Gebru, McMillan-Major, and “Shmitchell”).</p>



<p>In the public image, AI has been perceived to be very successful for some tasks, and some people might hope that it is more “objective” or “impartial” than human decisions which are known to be <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873">fraught with bias</a>). However, there are some works suggesting this might not be the case:</p>



<ul><li>Usage in prediciting recidivism for bail decisions. For example in ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">Angwin, Larson, Mattu, and Kirchner</a> showed that 44.9% of African Americans who didn’t reoffend were labeled higher risk, whereas only 23.5% of white defendants who didn’t reoffend were labeled as such.</li><li>Machine vision can sometimes work better on some segments of population than others. For example, <a href="http://gendershades.org/">Buolamwini and Gebrue</a> showed that some “gender classifiers” achieve 99.7% accuracy on white men but only 65.3% accuracy (not much better than coin toss) on black women.</li><li><a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x">Lum and Isaac</a> gave an example of a “positive feedback loop” in predictive policing in Oakland, CA. While drug use is fairly uniform across the city, the arrests are centered on particular neighborhood (that have more minority residents). In predictive policing, more police would be sent out to the places where arrests occured, hence only exercabating this disparate treatment.</li></ul>

<p>While algorithms can sometimes also help, the populations they help might not be distributed equally. For example, see this table from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10511482.2002.9521447">Gates, Perry and Zorn</a>. A more accurate underwriting model (that can better predict the default probability) enables a lender to use a more agressive risk cut off and so end up lending to more people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/xxms8Jk.png"/></figure>



<p>However, this is true within each subpopulation too, so it may be that if the model is less accurate in a certain subpopulation, then a profit-maximizing lender will unfairly offer fewer loans to this subpopulation.</p>



<h2>Formalizing Unfairness</h2>



<p>In the case of employment discrimination in the U.S., we have the following components:</p>



<ul><li>Protected class<ul><li>categories such as race, sex, nationality, citizenship, veteran status, etc.</li></ul></li><li>An unfairness metric, measuring either:<ul><li>disparate treatment</li><li>disparate impact.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Employers are not allowed to discriminate across protected classes when hiring. The unfairness metric gives us a way to measure if there is discrimination with respected to a protected class. In particular, disparate impacts across different protected classes is often <em>necessary</em> but <em>not sufficient</em> evidence of discrimination.</p>



<h2>Algorithms for Fairness: an Example</h2>



<p>To see why algorithms, which at first glance seem agnostic to group membership, may exhibit disparate treatment or impact, we consider the following <a href="https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/">Google visualization by Wattenberg, Viégas, and Hardt</a>.</p>



<p>Consider a blue population and an orange population for which there is no difference in the probability of a member of either population paying back the loan, but for which our model has different accuracies—in particular, the model is more accurate on the orange population. This is described by the plot below, in which the scores correspond to the model’s prediction of the probability of paying back the loan and opaque circles correspond to those who actually do not pay back the loan, whereas filled in circles correspond to those who do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/BEy6yqi.png"/></figure>



<p>Suppose we are in charge of making a lending decision given the model prediction.<br/>A scenario in which we give everyone a loan would be fair, but would be bad us —we would go bankrupt!</p>



<p>Profit when giving everyone a loan:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/1uCdp2Q.png"/></figure>



<p>If we wanted to <strong>maximize profit</strong>, we would, however, give more loans to the orange population (since we’re more sure about which members of the orange population would actually pay back their loans) by setting a lower threshold (in terms of the score given by our algorithm) above which we give out loans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/Njtg1FU.png"/></figure>



<p>This maximizes profit but is blatantly unfair. We are treating the identical blue and orange groups differently, just because our model is more accurate on one than the other, and we also have disparate impact on the two groups. A non-defaulting applicant would be 78% likely to get a loan if they are a member of the orange group, but only 60% likely to get a loan if they are a member of the orange group.</p>



<p>This “profit maximization” is likely the end result of any sufficiently complex lending algorithm in the absence of a fairness intervention. Even if the algorithm does not explicitly rely on the group membership attribute, by simply optimizing it to maximize profit, it may well pick up on attributes that are correlated with group membership.</p>



<p>Suppose on the other hand that we wanted to mandate “equal treatment” in the sense of keeping the same thresholds for the blue and orange group. The result would be the following:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/c13O4Ly.png"/></figure>



<p>In this case, since the threshold are identical, the algorithm will be <strong>calibrated</strong>. 79% of the decisions we make will be the correct ones, for both the blue and orange population. So, from our point of view, the algorithm is fair and treats the blue and orange populations identically. However, from the point of view of the applicants, this is not the case. If you are a blue applicant that will pay your loan, you have 81% chance of getting a loan, but if you are an orange customer you only have 60% of getting it. This demonstrates that defining fairness is quite delicate. In particular the above “color blind” algorithm is still arguable unfair.</p>



<p>This difference between the point of view of the lender and lendee also arose in the recidivism case mentioned above. From the point of view of the defendant that would not recidivate, the algorithm was more likely to label them as “high risk” if they were Black than if they were white. From the point of view of the decision maker, the algorithm was calibrated, and if anything it was a bit more likely that a white defendant labeled high risk would not recidivate than a Black defendant. See (slightly rounded and simplified) data below</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/M73xLoe.png"/></figure>



<p/>



<p>If we wanted to achieve demographic parity (both populations get same total number of loans) or equal opportunity (true positive rate same for both) then we can do so, but again using different thresholds for each group:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/uMHsFPz.png"/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/pAnbY6m.png"/></figure>



<h2>Fico Scores and Different Types of Fairness</h2>



<p>While the above was a hypothetical scenario, a real life example was shown by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413">Hardt, Price and Srebro</a> using credit (also known as FICO) scores, as described by the plot below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/S8H0gjj.png"/></figure>



<p>For a single threshold, around 75% of Asian candidates will get loans, whereas only around 20% of Black candidates will get loans. To ensure that all groups get loans at the same rate, we would need to set the thresholds differently. In order to equalize opportunity, we’d also need to initialize the thresholds differently as well.</p>



<p>We see that we have different notions of what it means to be <em>fair</em> and that each of these different notions result in different algorithms.</p>



<h2>Fairness and Causality</h2>



<p>Berkeley graduate admissions in 1973 had the following statistics:</p>



<ul><li>44% male applicants admitted, 35% female applicants admitted;</li><li>However, female acceptance rate was higher at the <em>department level</em>, for most departments.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/MizH3NY.png"/></figure>



<p>This paradox is commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson’s Paradox</a>.</p>



<p>A “fair” causal model for this scenario might be as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/sVG4l7l.png"/></figure>



<p>In the above, perhaps gender has a causal impact on the choice of department to which the applicant applies. However, a fair application process would, conditional on the department, be independent of gender of the applicant.</p>



<p>However, not all models that follow this causal structure are necessarily <em>fair</em>. In the case Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 1971, the court ruled that decision-making under the following causal model was <em>unfair</em>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/9f6iEKH.png"/></figure>



<p>While the model appears to be fair, since the job offer is conditionall independent of race, given the diploma, the court ruled that the job did not actually require a high school diploma. Hence, using the diploma as a factor in hiring decisions was really just a proxy for race, resulting in essentially purposeful unfair discrimination based on race. This creation of proxies is referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>.</p>



<h1>Bottom Line</h1>



<p>We cannot come up with universal fairness criteria. The notion of fairness itself is based on assumptions about:</p>



<ul><li>representation of data</li><li>relationships to unmeasured inputs and outcomes</li><li>causal relation of inputs, predictions, outcomes.</li></ul>



<p>Fairness depends on what we choose to measure to observe, in both inputs and outputs, and how we choose to act upon them. In particular, we have the following causal structure, wherein measure inputs, decision-making, and measured outcomes all play a role in affecting the real-world and function together in a feedback cycle:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/LcW07id.png"/></figure>



<p>A more comprehensive illustration is given in this paper of <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/4/251365-the-impossibility-of-fairness/fulltext">Friedler, Scheidegger, and Venkatasubramanian</a>:</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I just heard that Benny Chor died this morning. Chor did very important work on computational biology and distributed algorithms, but I (and probably many of my readers) know him primarily for his work on cryptography, for his work on randomness extraction and for introducing the notion of private information retrieval.</p>



<p>I only met him once, at the event for <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/04/20/fests/">Oded Goldreich’s 60th birthday</a>. On the occasion, he gave a talk on the Chor-Goldreich paper, which introduced the problem of randomness extraction from independent sources, and which introduced min-entropy as the right parameter by which to quantify the randomness content of random sources. He did so using the original slides used for the FOCS 1985 talk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6726.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-3735" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6726.jpg?w=768"/></a></figure>



<p>I took a picture during the talk, which I posted online, and later he sent me an email asking for the original. Sadly, this was the totality of our correspondence. I heard that besides being a brilliant and generous researchers, he was a very playful, likeable and nice person. My thoughts are with his family and his friends.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The other night Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ">“The Internet’s Own Boy,”</a> the 2014 documentary about the life and work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, which I’d somehow missed when it came out.  Swartz, for anyone who doesn’t remember, was the child prodigy who helped create RSS and Reddit, who then became a campaigner for an open Internet, who was arrested for using a laptop in an MIT supply closet to download millions of journal articles and threatened with decades in prison, and who then committed suicide at age 26.  I regret that I never knew Swartz, though he did once send me a fan email about <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>.</p>



<p>Say whatever you want about the tactical wisdom or the legality of Swartz’s actions; it seems inarguable to me that he was <em>morally</em> correct, that certain categories of information (e.g. legal opinions and taxpayer-funded scientific papers) need to be made freely available, and that sooner or later our civilization will catch up to Swartz and regard his position as completely obvious.  The beautifully-made documentary filled me with rage and guilt not only that the world had failed Swartz, but that I personally had failed him.</p>



<p>At the time of Swartz’s arrest, prosecution, and suicide, I was an MIT CS professor who’d previously <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.html">written</a> in strong support of open access to scientific literature, and who had the platform of this blog.  Had I understood what was going on with Swartz—had I <em>taken the time to find out</em> what was going on—I could have been in a good position to help organize a grassroots campaign to pressure the MIT administration to urge prosecutors to drop the case (like JSTOR had already done), which could plausibly have made a difference.  As it was, I was preoccupied in those years with BosonSampling, getting married, etc., I didn’t bother to learn whether anything was being done or <em>could</em> be done about the Aaron Swartz matter, and then before I knew it, Swartz had joined Alan Turing in computer science’s pantheon of lost geniuses.</p>



<p>But maybe there was something deeper to my inaction.  If I’d strongly defended the substance of what Swartz had done, it would’ve raised the question: <em>why wasn’t I doing the same?</em>  Why was I merely complaining about paywalled journals from the comfort of my professor’s office, rather than putting my own freedom on the line like Swartz was?  It was as though I <em>had</em> to put some psychological distance between myself and the situation, in order to justify my life choices to myself.</p>



<p>Even though I see the error in that way of “thinking,” it keeps recurring, keeps causing me to make choices that I feel guilt or at least regret about later.  In February 2020, there were a few smart people saying that a new viral pneumonia from Wuhan was about to upend life on earth, but the people around me certainly weren’t <em>acting</em> that way, and <em>I</em> wasn’t acting that way either … and so, “for the sake of internal consistency,” I didn’t spend much time thinking about it or investigating it.  After all, if the fears of a global pandemic had a good chance of being true, I should be dropping everything else and panicking, shouldn’t I?  But I <em>wasn’t</em> dropping everything else and panicking … so how could the fears be true?</p>



<p>Then I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">publicly repented</a>, and resolved not to make such an error again.  And now, 15 months later, I realize that I <em>have</em> made such an error again.</p>



<p>All throughout the pandemic, I’d ask my friends, privately, why the hypothesis that the virus had accidentally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology wasn’t being taken far more seriously, given what seemed like a shockingly strong <em>prima facie</em> case.  But I didn’t discuss the lab leak scenario on this blog, except once in passing.  I could <em>say</em> I didn’t discuss it because I’m not a virologist and I had nothing new to contribute.  But I worry that I also didn’t discuss it because it seemed incompatible with my self-conception as a cautious scientist who’s skeptical of lurid coverups and conspiracies—and because I’d already spent my “weirdness capital” on other issues, and didn’t relish the prospect of being sneered at on social media yet again.  Instead I simply waited for discussion of the lab leak hypothesis to become “safe” and “respectable,” as today it finally has, thanks to writers who were more courageous than I was.  I became, basically, another sheep in one of the conformist herds that we rightly despise when we read about them in history.</p>



<p>(For all that, it’s still plausible to me that the virus had a natural origin after all.  What’s become clear is simply that, <em>even if so</em>, the failure to take the possibility of a lab escape more seriously back when the trail of evidence was fresher will stand as a major intellectual scandal of our time.)</p>



<p>Sometimes people are wracked with guilt, but over completely different things than the world <em>wants</em> them to be wracked with guilt over.  This was one of the great lessons that I learned from reading Richard Rhodes’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1451677618">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a></em>.  Many of the Manhattan Project physicists felt lifelong guilt, <em>not</em> that they’d participated in building the bomb, but only that they hadn’t <em>finished</em> the bomb by 1943, when it could have ended the war in Europe and the Holocaust.</p>



<p>On a much smaller scale, I suppose some readers would still like me to feel guilt about comment 171, or some of the other stuff I wrote about nerds, dating, and feminism … or if not that, then maybe about my defense of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, or of standardized tests and accelerated math programs, or maybe my vehement condemnation of Trump and his failed insurrection.  Or any of the dozens of other times when I stood up and said something I actually believed, or when I recounted my experiences as accurately as I could.  The truth is, though, I don’t.</p>



<p>Looking back—which, now that I’m 40, I confess is an increasingly large fraction of my time—the pattern seems consistent.  I feel guilty, not for having stood up for what I strongly believed in, but for having <em>failed</em> to do so.  This suggests that, if I want fewer regrets, then I should click “Publish” on more potentially controversial posts!  I don’t know how to force myself to do that, but maybe this post itself is a step.</p></div>

    <title>The Future of Faculty Hiring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Faculty hiring in computer science is a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/12/fixing-academic-job-market.html">process long due for an overhaul</a>. The pandemic certainly changed some of the dynamics moving most of the interviews online and saving a ton of money and time. Will this be the start of a fresh approach to recruiting?</p><p>A typical search in the past few years had some schools flying in 30-40 candidates, typically costing over a $1000 each and a full-time job for a staff member during the search. We'd justify the expense as small compared to the millions we'd invest in a faculty member throughout their career, but it is generally the largest discretionary expense for a CS department. It also gives advantages to rich departments over others.</p><p>During the pandemic all those interviews moved online and worked reasonably well at virtually no additional cost. Also no need to scrounge around to find faculty willing to skip family meals to have dinner with the candidates. And if a faculty had a conflict with a candidate on the interview day, they could schedule on a different day. There really is no reason to have all the meetings on the same day.</p><p>With the pandemic mostly behind us, will we go back to in-person interviews moving forward. I suspect the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/whiffing-the-airport-interview/">airport interview</a>, where you fly out 20 or so candidates to have hour long interviews in a hotel near an airport with a search committee for an administrative position, will be the first to go completely virtual. </p><p>Even for regular faculty interviews, there will be great pressure to reduce the number of in-person visits, perhaps to just the top candidates, or just the ones who have offers--make the "second visit" the only visit. Richer departments may find the expense worthwhile to make a bigger impression on the candidates and that will only expand the advantage of wealthier universities.</p><p>Times like this are the perfect opportunity for CS leadership to come in and give some sanity to the hiring process but I'm not holding my breath.</p></div>

    <title>TR21-080 |  Hardness vs Randomness, Revised: Uniform, Non-Black-Box, and Instance-Wise | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Roei Tell</title>
    <summary>We propose a new approach to the hardness-to-randomness framework and to the promise-BPP=promise-P conjecture. Classical results rely on non-uniform hardness assumptions to construct derandomization algorithms that work in the worst-case, or rely on uniform hardness assumptions to construct derandomization algorithms that work only in the average-case. In both types of results, the derandomization algorithm is ``black-box'' and uses the standard PRG approach. In this work we present results that closely relate **new and natural uniform hardness assumptions** to **worst-case derandomization** of promise-BPP, where the algorithms underlying the latter derandomization are **non-black-box**.

In our main result, we show that promise-BPP=promise-P if the following holds: There exists a multi-output function computable by logspace-uniform circuits of polynomial size and depth $n^2$ that cannot be computed by uniform probabilistic algorithms in time $n^c$, for some universal constant $c&gt;1$, on **almost all inputs**. The required failure on ``almost all inputs'' is stronger than the standard requirement of failing on one input of each length; however, the same assumption without the depth restriction on $f$ is **necessary** for the conclusion. This suggests a potential equivalence between worst-case derandomization of promise-BPP of any form (i.e., not necessarily by a black-box algorithm) and the existence of efficiently computable functions that are hard for probabilistic algorithms on almost all inputs.

In our second result, we introduce a new and uniform hardness-to-randomness tradeoff for the setting of **superfast average-case derandomization**; prior to this work, superfast average-case derandomization was known only under non-uniform hardness assumptions. In an extreme instantiation of our new tradeoff, under appealing uniform hardness assumptions, we show that for every polynomial $T(n)$ and constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ it holds that $BPTIME[T]\subseteq heur-DTIME[T\cdot n^{\epsilon}]$, where the ``heur'' prefix means that no polynomial-time algorithm can find, with non-negligible probability, an input on which the deterministic simulation errs.

Technically, our approach is to design **targeted PRGs and HSGs**, as introduced by Goldreich (LNCS, 2011). The targeted PRGs/HSGs ``produce randomness from the input'', as suggested by Goldreich and Wigderson (RANDOM 2002); and their analysis relies on non-black-box versions of the reconstruction procedure of Impagliazzo and Wigderson (FOCS 1998). Our main reconstruction procedure crucially relies on the ideas underlying the proof system of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum (J. ACM 2015).</summary>

    <title>TR21-079 |  The zero-rate threshold for adversarial bit-deletions is less than 1/2 | 

	Venkatesan Guruswami, 

	Xiaoyu He, 

	Ray Li</title>
    <summary>We prove that there exists an absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$ such any binary code $C\subset\{0,1\}^N$ tolerating $(1/2-\delta)N$ adversarial deletions must satisfy $|C|\le 2^{\poly\log N}$ and thus have rate asymptotically approaching $0$. This is the first constant fraction improvement over the trivial bound that codes tolerating $N/2$ adversarial deletions must have rate going to $0$ asymptotically.  Equivalently, we show that there exists absolute constants $A$ and $\delta&gt;0$ such that any set $C\subset\{0,1\}^N$ of $2^{\log^A N}$ binary strings must contain two strings $c$ and $c'$ whose longest common subsequence has length at least $(1/2+\delta)N$. As an immediate corollary, we show that $q$-ary codes tolerating a fraction $1-(1+2\delta)/q$ of adversarial deletions must also have rate approaching $0$.
 
Our techniques include string regularity arguments and a structural lemma that classifies binary strings by their oscillation patterns.  Leveraging these tools, we find in any large code two strings with similar oscillation patterns, which is exploited to find a long common subsequence.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After 16 months without lecturing to an audience in my same location, I gave yesterday two lectures at the Technion in front of a live audience (and some additional audience in remote locations). The main lecture was in <a href="https://comsoc2021.net.technion.ac.il/">COMSOC 2021,</a> an international conference on computational social choice,  and earlier I gave a guest lecture in Roy Meshulam’s class about simple polytopes. I also met many friends. </p>
<p><a href="https://reshef.net.technion.ac.il/">Reshef Meir</a> who organized (with Bill Zwicker) COMSOC 2021 wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #993366;"><em>Hi all, </em></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #993366;"><em>today was beyond expectations – the first feeling of a real actual conference after almost a year and a half!  We had about 40 people attending, viewing posters, and listening to talks. I truly hope this will return to be a common scene and that we can all meet face to face soon.</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<p>In my COMSOC lecture I talked about some earlier ideas and results in my work on social choice, starting with my paper with Ariel Rubinstein and Rani Spiegler on rationalizing individual choice by multiple rationals, and my subsequent attempt to use learnability as a tool for understanding choices of economic agents. This led to interesting questions on social choice <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/social-choice-preview/">that are discussed in this 2009 post.</a></p>
<p>In Roy’s course I explained <img alt="h" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-vectors of polytopes and the Dehn-Sommerville relations based on counting outdegrees of the graph of the polytope when we direct its edges based on a generic abstract objective function. I moved on to present a proof of Blind-Mani’s theorem that the graph of the polytope determines the full combinatorics. This proof is probably the one proof I presented the most and it is given in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/telling-a-simple-polytope-from-its-graph/">this 2009 post</a>.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We hope you are all staying safe. With massive vaccination programs across the globe we hope you and your loved ones are getting back to what used to be normal. With that out of the way, let us circle back to Property Testing. This month was less sleepy as compared to the two preceding months and we saw six papers in total (two of them explore problems in quantum property testing). Without further ado, let us take a deeper dive.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>GSF-locality is not sufficient for proximity-oblivious testing</strong>, by Isolde Adler, Noleen Kohler, Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08490">arXiv</a>) The notion of proximity oblivious testers was made explicit in the seminal work of Goldreich and Ron in 2009 [GR09]. A proximity oblivious tester for a graph property is a constant query tester that rejects a graph with probability that monotonically increases with distance to the property. (<strong>Edit</strong>: <em>Correction</em>) A property is called proximity oblivious testable (or PO testable) if it has a one sided proximity oblivious tester. [GR09] gave a characterization of which properties \(\Pi\) are PO testable in the bounded degree model <em>if and only if</em> it is a “local” property of some kind which satisfies a certain non propagation condition. [GR09] conjectured that all such “local” properties satisfy this non propagation condition. This paper refutes the above conjecture from [GR09].</p>



<p/>



<p>Coming up next. More action on triangle freeness.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Triangle Freeness in the General Model in Graphs with Arboricity \(O(\sqrt n)\)</strong>, by Reut Levi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04809">arXiv</a>) PTReview readers are likely to be aware that triangle freeness has been a rich source of problems for developing new sublinear time algorithms. This paper considers the classic problem of testing triangle freeness in general graphs. In the dense case, algorithms with running time depending only on \(\varepsilon\) are known thanks to the work of Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich and Szegedy. In the bounded degree case, Goldreich and Ron gave testers with query complexity \(O(1/\varepsilon)\). This paper explores the problem in general graph case and proves an upper bound of \(O(\Gamma/d_{avg} + \Gamma)\) where \(\Gamma\) is the arboricity of the graph. The author also shows that this upperbound is tight for graphs with arboricity at most \(O(\sqrt n)\). Curiously enough, the algorithm does not take arboricity of the graph as an input and yet \(\Gamma\) (the arboricity) shows up in the upper and lower bounds.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Testing Dynamic Environments: Back to Basics</strong>, by Yonatan Nakar and Dana Ron (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00759">arXiv</a>) Goldreich and Ron introduced the problem of testing “dynamic environments” in 2014. Here is the setup for this problem. You are given an environment that evolves according to a local rule.  Your goal is to query some of the states in the system at some point of time and determine if the system is evolving according to some fixed rule or is far from it. In this paper, the authors consider environments defined by elementary cellular automata which evolve according to threshold rules as one of the first steps towards understanding what makes a dynamic environment tested efficiently.  The main result proves the following: if your local rules satisfy some <em>conditions</em>, you can use a meta algorithm with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\) which is non adaptive and has one sided error. And all the threshold rules indeed satisfy these <em>conditions</em> which means they can be tested efficiently. </p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Identity testing under label mismatch</strong>, by Clement Canonne and Karl Wimmer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01856">arXiv</a>) This paper considers a classic problem distribution testing with the following twist. Let \(q\) denote a distribution supported on \([n]\). You are given access to samples from another distribution \(p\) where \(p  = q \circ \pi\) where \(\pi\) is some unknown permutation. Thus, I relabel the data and I give you access to samples from the relabeled dataset. Under this promise, note that identity testing becomes a trivial problem if \(q\) is known to be uniform over \([n]\). The authors develop algorithms for testing and tolerant testing of distributions under this additional promise of \(p\) being a permutation of some known distribution \(q\). The main result shows as exponential gap between the sample complexity of testing and tolerant testing under this promise. In particular, identity testing under the promise of permutation has sample complexity \(\Theta(\log^2 n)\) whereas tolerant identity testing under this promise has sample complexity \(\Theta(n^{1-o(1)})\).</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Testing symmetry on quantum computers</strong>, by Margarite L. LaBorde and Mark M. Wilde (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12758">arXiv</a>) This paper develops algorithms which test symmetries of a quantum states and changes generated by quantum circuits. These tests additionally also quantify how symmetric these states (or channels) are. For testing what are called “Bose states” the paper presents efficient algorithms. The tests for other kinds of symmetry presented in the paper rely on some aid from a quantum prover.</p>



<p/>



<p><strong>Quantum proofs of proximity</strong>, by Marcel Dall’Agnol, Tom Gur, Subhayan Roy Moulik, Justin Thaler (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/068/">ECCC</a>) The sublinear time (quantum) computation model has been gathering momentum steadily over the past several years. This paper seeks to understand the power of \({\sf QMA}\) proofs of proximity for property testing (recall \({\sf QMA}\) is the quantum analogue of \({\sf NP}\)). On the algorithmic front, the paper develops sufficient conditions for properties to admit efficient \({\sf QMA}\) proofs of proximity. On the complexity front, the paper demonstrates a property which admits  an efficient \({\sf QMA}\) proof but does not admit a \({\sf MA}\) or an interactive proof of proximity.</p></div>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">I now have a feature article up at Quanta magazine, entitled “What Makes Quantum Computing So Hard To Explain?” I.e., why do journalists, investors, etc. so consistently get central points wrong, even after the subject has been in public consciousness for more than 25 years?

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I now have a feature article up at <em>Quanta</em> magazine, entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-quantum-computing-so-hard-to-explain-20210608/">“What Makes Quantum Computing So Hard To Explain?”</a>  I.e., why do journalists, investors, etc. so consistently get central points wrong, even after the subject has been in public consciousness for more than 25 years?  Perhaps unsurprisingly, I found it hard to discuss that meta-level question, as <em>Quanta</em>‘s editors asked me to do, without also engaging in the object-level task of actually explaining QC.  For regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers, there will be nothing new here, but I’m happy with how the piece turned out.</p>



<p>Accompanying the <em>Quanta</em> piece is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHoEjvuPoB8&amp;t=6s">10-minute YouTube explainer on quantum computing</a>, which (besides snazzy graphics) features interviews with me, John Preskill, and Dorit Aharonov.</p>



<p>On a different note, my colleague <a href="https://www.markwilde.com/">Mark Wilde</a> has recorded a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mark-m-wilde/quantum-computer">punk-rock song about BosonSampling</a>.  I can honestly report that it’s some of the finest boson-themed music I’ve heard in years.  It includes the following lyrics:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Quantum computer, Ain’t no loser<br/>Quantum computer, Quantum computer</p><p>People out on the streets<br/>They don’t know what it is<br/>They think it finds the cliques<br/>Or finds graph colorings<br/>But it don’t solve anything<br/>Said it don’t solve anything<br/>Bosonic slot machine<br/>My lil’ photonic dream</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking of BosonSampling, A. S. Popova and A. N. Rubtsov, of the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow, have a new preprint entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01445">Cracking the Quantum Advantage threshold for Gaussian Boson Sampling</a>.  In it, they claim to give an efficient classical algorithm to simulate noisy GBS experiments, like the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">one six months ago</a> from USTC in China.  I’m still unsure how well this scales from 30-40 photons up to 50-70 photons; which imperfections of the USTC experiment are primarily being taken advantage of (photon losses?); and how this relates to the earlier proposed classical algorithms for simulating noisy BosonSampling, like the one by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093">Kalai and Kindler</a>.  Anyone with any insight is welcome to share!</p>



<p>OK, one last announcement: the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, in Berkeley, has a new online lecture series called <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/institute-launches-breakthroughs-lecture-series">“Breakthroughs,”</a> which many readers of this blog might want to check out.</p></div>
