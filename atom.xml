    <title>A Spectral Approach to the Shortest Path Problem</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1585872000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Steinerberger:Stefan.html">Stefan Steinerberger</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01163">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple, connected graph. One is often interested in a
short path between two vertices $u,v$. We propose a spectral algorithm:
construct the function $\phi:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ $$ \phi =
\arg\min_{f:V \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \atop f(u) = 0, f \not\equiv 0}
\frac{\sum_{(w_1, w_2) \in E}{(f(w_1)-f(w_2))^2}}{\sum_{w \in V}{f(w)^2}}.$$
$\phi$ can also be understood as the smallest eigenvector of the Laplacian
Matrix $L=D-A$ after the $u-$th row and column have been removed. We start in
the point $v$ and construct a path from $v$ to $u$: at each step, we move to
the neighbor for which $\phi$ is the smallest. This algorithm provably
terminates and results in a short path from $v$ to $u$, often the shortest. The
efficiency of this method is due to a discrete analogue of a phenomenon in
Partial Differential Equations that is not well understood. We prove optimality
for trees and discuss a number of open questions.

    <title>No Repetition: Fast Streaming with Highly Concentrated Hashing</title>

probability, a common strategy is to design one that works with constant
probability, and then boost the probability using independent repetitions.
Important examples of this approach are small space algorithms for estimating
the number of distinct elements in a stream, or estimating the set similarity
between large sets. Using standard strongly universal hashing to process each
element, we get a sketch based estimator where the probability of a too large
error is, say, 1/4. By performing $r$ independent repetitions and taking the
median of the estimators, the error probability falls exponentially in $r$.
However, running $r$ independent experiments increases the processing time by a
factor $r$.
</p>
<p>Here we make the point that if we have a hash function with strong
concentration bounds, then we get the same high probability bounds without any
need for repetitions. Instead of $r$ independent sketches, we have a single
sketch that is $r$ times bigger, so the total space is the same. However, we
only apply a single hash function, so we save a factor $r$ in time, and the
overall algorithms just get simpler.
</p>
<p>Fast practical hash functions with strong concentration bounds were recently
proposed by Aamand em et al. (to appear in STOC 2020). Using their hashing
schemes, the algorithms thus become very fast and practical, suitable for
online processing of high volume data streams.

    <title>On Locating Paths in Compressed Cardinal Trees</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1585872000</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Prezza:Nicola.html">Nicola Prezza</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01120">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>A compressed index is a data structure representing a text within compressed
space and supporting fast indexing queries: given a pattern, count/return all
positions where the pattern occurs. In recent years, powerful compressed
indexes have emerged. These are based on Entropy, the Lempel-Ziv factorization,
the run-length Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), context-free grammars and, more
recently, string attractors. Trees add a whole new dimension to the problem:
one needs not only to compress the labels, but also the tree's topology. On
this side, less is known. Jacobson showed how to represent the topology of a
tree with $n$ nodes in $2n+o(n)$ bits of space (succinct) while also supporting
constant-time navigation queries. Ferragina et al. presented the first
entropy-compressed labeled tree representation (the XBWT) able to count, but
not locate, paths labeled with a given pattern. Grammars and the Lempel-Ziv
factorization have been extended to trees, but those representations do not
support indexing queries. In this paper, we extend to cardinal trees (i.e.
tries) the most powerful string compression and indexing tools known to date.
We start by proposing suitable generalizations of run-length BWT, high-order
entropy, and string attractors to cardinal trees. We show that the number
$r\leq n$ of XBWT-runs upper-bounds the size of the smallest tree attractor and
lower-bounds the trie's high-order worst-case entropy $\mathcal H^{wc}_k$. The
main result of this paper is the first tree index able to \emph{locate} in
pre-order nodes reached by a path labeled with a given pattern. Our index
locates path occurrences in constant time each and takes $2n + o(n) + O(r\log
n) \leq 2n + o(n) + O(\mathcal H^{wc}_k\log n)$ bits of space: the reporting
time is optimal and the locate machinery fits within compressed space on top of
the tree's topology.

machine learning applications. The capacity of these models (i.e., number of
parameters), endows them with expressive power and allows them to reach the
desired performance. In recent years, there is an increasing interest in
deploying DNNs to resource-constrained devices (i.e., mobile devices) with
limited energy, memory, and computational budget. To address this problem, we
propose Entropy-Constrained Trained Ternarization (EC2T), a general framework
to create sparse and ternary neural networks which are efficient in terms of
storage (e.g., at most two binary-masks and two full-precision values are
required to save a weight matrix) and computation (e.g., MAC operations are
reduced to a few accumulations plus two multiplications). This approach
consists of two steps. First, a super-network is created by scaling the
dimensions of a pre-trained model (i.e., its width and depth). Subsequently,
this super-network is simultaneously pruned (using an entropy constraint) and
quantized (that is, ternary values are assigned layer-wise) in a training
process, resulting in a sparse and ternary network representation. We validate
the proposed approach in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, showing
its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

    <title>Terrain Visibility Graphs: Persistence is Not Enough</title>

Reconstruction problems in the context of terrains. Here, we are given a graph
$G$ with labeled vertices $v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{n-1}$ such that the labeling
corresponds with a Hamiltonian path $H$. $G$ also may contain other edges. We
are interested in determining if there is a terrain $T$ with vertices $p_0,
p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1}$ such that $G$ is the visibility graph of $T$ and the
boundary of $T$ corresponds with $H$. $G$ is said to be persistent if and only
if it satisfies the so-called X-property and Bar-property. It is known that
every "pseudo-terrain" has a persistent visibility graph and that every
persistent graph is the visibility graph for some pseudo-terrain. The
connection is not as clear for (geometric) terrains. It is known that the
visibility graph of any terrain $T$ is persistent, but it has been unclear
whether every persistent graph $G$ has a terrain $T$ such that $G$ is the
visibility graph of $T$. There actually have been several papers that claim
this to be the case (although no formal proof has ever been published), and
recent works made steps towards building a terrain reconstruction algorithm for
any persistent graph. In this paper, we show that there exists a persistent
graph $G$ that is not the visibility graph for any terrain $T$. This means
persistence is not enough by itself to characterize the visibility graphs of
terrains, and implies that pseudo-terrains are not stretchable.

from the perspective of Parameterized Complexity. Here, we consider several
natural parameters such as the number of layers, number of agents, number of

    <title>An interview with Davide Sangiorgi, CONCUR Test-of-Time Award recipient</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/">International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR)</a> and the I<a href="https://concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip">FIP 1.8 Working Group on Concurrency Theory</a> are happy to announce the first edition of the CONCUR  Test-of-Time Award. The purpose of the award is to recognize important  achievements in Concurrency Theory that were published at the CONCUR  conference and have stood the test of time. All papers published in  CONCUR between 1990 and 1995 were eligible.<br/><br/>The award winners for the  CONCUR ToT Awards 2020 may be found <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/test-of-time/index.html">here</a>, together with the citations for the awars. They were selected by a jury composed of Jos Baeten, Patricia  Bouyer-Decitre, Holger Hermanns, and Alexandra Silva and myself.<br/><br/>This post is the first of a series in which I interview the recipients of the  CONCUR ToT Awards 2020. I asked <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/">Davide Sangiorgi </a>(University of Bologna, Italy) a small number of questions via email and I report his answers below in a slightly edited form. Let  me thank Davide for his willingness to take part in an interview and for his inspiring answers, which I hope will be of interest to readers of this blog and will inspire young researchers to tak up work on Concurrency Theory.<br/><br/>In what follows, LA stands for Luca Aceto and DS for Davide Sangiorgi.<br/><br/>LA: You receive one of the two CONCUR ToT Awards for the period 1992-1995 for your paper "<a href="http://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/reports/93/ECS-LFCS-93-270/">A Theory of Bisimulation for the pi-Calculus</a>", presented at CONCUR 1993. Could you tell us briefly what spurred you to develop open bisimilarity and how the ideas underlying that notion came about?<br/><br/>DS: I developed the paper on open bisimulation during 1992 and 1993.  I was in Robin Milner's group, in Edinburgh.  We were studying and questioning basic aspects of the theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">pi-calculus</a>. One such aspect was the definition of equality on processes; thus a very fundamental aspect, underlying the whole theory.  The equality had to be a form of bisimulation, in the same way as it was for CCS.  The two forms of bisimilarity that were around for the pi-calculus, late and early bisimilarity, are not congruence relations.  In both cases, the input clause of bisimilarity uses a universal quantification on the possible instantiations of the bound name. As  a consequence, neither bisimilarity is preserved by the input prefix (forbidding substitutions in the input clause would make things worse, as congruence  would fail for parallel composition). Therefore, one has to introduce separately the induced congruence, by universally quantifying the bisimilarities over all name substitutions.  In other words,  the two bisimilarities are  not fully substitutive ('equal' terms cannot not replaced, one for the other,  in an arbitrary context).   On the other hand, the  congruences induced by the bisimilarities  are not themselves  bisimilarities. Hence in this case 'equal' terms, after some actions,  need not be 'equal' anymore.  Thus, for instance, such relations do not support dynamic modifications of the context surrounding related terms.<br/><br/>This situation was not fully satisfactory. The same could be said for the algebraic theory: there were proof systems for the two bisimilarities (of course, on finitary processes) but, because of the above congruence issue, there were no axiomatisations.  (In those years I was also working with Joachim Parrow on axiomatisations of these relations.)<br/><br/>The universal quantification on substitutions in the input clause of the bisimilarites and in the definitions of the induced congruences was also unsatisfactory because it  could make checking equalities cumbersome.<br/><br/>All these were  motivations for looking at possible variations of the definition of bisimulation. The specific hints towards open bisimulation came from thinking at two key facets of the pi-calculus model that were somehow neglected in the definitions of  early and late bisimilarities.  The first facet has to do with the pi-calculus rejection of the separation between channels and variables (`channel' here meaning a 'constant identifier'). In the pi-calculus ,there is only one syntactic category, that of <i>names</i>, with no formal distinction between channels and variables. This contributes to the elegance of the model and its theory. However, both in early and in late bisimilarity, the free names of processes are treated as channels, whereas the bound names of  inputs are treated as variables because of their immediate  instantiation  in the bisimilarity clause.   There was somehow a discrepancy between the syntax and the semantics. <br/><br/>The second facet of the pi-calculus that contributed is the lack of the mismatch operator: the pi-calculus, at least in its original proposal, has a match operator to test equality between names, but not the dual mismatch, to test for inequality.  Mismatching had been excluded for the preservation of a monotonicity property on transitions, intuitively asserting that substitutions may only increase the action capabilities of a  process.  (Both facets above represented major differences between the pi-calculus and its closest ancestor----Engberg and Nielsen's Extended CCS.)  Thus I started playing with the idea of avoiding the name instantiation in the input clause and, instead, allowing, at any moment, for arbitrary instantiations (i.e., substitutions) of the names of the processes---the latter justified by the above monotonicity property of transitions. By adding the requirement of being a congruence, the definition of open bisimilarity came about.<br/><br/>Still, I was not sure that such a bisimulation could be interesting and robust.  Two further developments helped here. One was the axiomatisation (over recursion-free terms).  It was a pure axiomatisation, it was  simple,  and with a completeness proof that leads to the construction of canonical and minimal (in some syntactic sense) representatives for the equivalence classes of the bisimilarity.  For other bisimilarities, or related congruences, obtaining canonical representatives seems hard; at best such representatives are parametrised upon a set of free names and even in these cases minimality is not guaranteed.<br/><br/>The other development has to do with a symbolic or "efficient" characterisation of the bisimilarity. The initial definition of open bisimulation makes heavy use of substitutions.  In the symbolic characterisation, substitutions are performed only when needed (for instance, the unification of two names $a$ and $b$ is required if there is an input at $a$ and an output at $b$ that can interact), somehow echoing the call-by-need style of  functional languages.  Such a charaterisation seemed promising for automated or semi-automated verification. <br/><br/>LA: How much of your later work has built on your CONCUR 1993 paper? What results of yours are you most proud of and why?<br/><br/>DS: The most basic idea in open bisimulation is to avoid the instantiation of the bound name of an input, possibly making such a bound name a free name of the derivative term.  The use of substitutions, elsewhere in the definition, is necessary to obtain a congruence relation for the pi-calculus.  I was surprised to discover, in the following years, that such substitutions are not necessary in two relevant subsets of the pi-calculus.  I called the variant of open bisimulation without substitutions <i>ground</i> bisimulation (I think the name came from Robin).  One subset is Honda and <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00076939/en">Boudol</a>'s Asynchronous pi-calculus, whose main constraint is to make outputs floating particles that do not trigger the activation of a continuation (other limitations concern sum and matching).  The other subset is the Internal (or Private) pi-calculus, in which only private (i.e., restricted) names may be transmitted.  I designed the Internal pi-calculus with ground bisimilarity in mind.  People seem to have found this calculus useful in many ways, partly because of its expressiveness combined with its  simple theory (in many aspects similar to that of CCS), partly because it allows one to limit or control aliasing between names, which can be useful for carrying out proofs about behavioural properties of processes, or for designing and reasoning about type systems, or for representing the calculus in logical systems.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the possibility of using ground bisimulation can considerably simplify proofs of equalities of terms. For instance, in my works on comparisons between pi-calculus and lambda-calculus, when I had to translate the latter into the former I have always used one of the above subcalculi (sometimes even combining them, e.g., the Asynchronous Internal pi-calculus), precisely for being able to use ground bisimilarity.<br/><br/>I  consider both ground bisimilarity and the Internal pi-calculus spin-offs of the work on open bisimilarity.<br/><br/>While working on open bisimilarity for the pi-calculus, in a different paper, I applied the idea of open bisimilarity to the lambda-calculus.  I kept the name 'open'  but the bisimulation is really 'ground', as there are no substitutions involved.  I remember Robin encouraging me to keep the name 'open' because it conveyed well the idea of setting a bisimulation on open terms, rather than on closed terms as usually done. In  open bisimulation for the lambda-calculus, a lambda-abstraction<i> lambda x. M</i> yields an action with label <i>lambda x</i> that should be matched (modulo  alpha-conversion) by the same action by a bisimilar term. (Of course additional bisimulation clauses are needed when a free variable is found in evaluation position.) In contrast, in the ordinary bisimulation for the lambda-calculus,  Abramsky's applicative bisimilarity, the bound variable of an abstraction has to be instantiated with all closed terms, which is heavy. In general, open bisimilarity is finer than applicative bisimilarity and contextual equivalence (the reference equivalence in the lambda-calculus) but they often coincide in examples of concrete interest. Moreover, open bisimilarity does coincide with contextual equivalence in appropriate extensions of the lambda-calculus.  In short, open bisimilarity offers us a technique for reasoning on higher-order languages  using  'first-order' tools, somehow similarly to what game semantics does.<br/><br/>This line of work about open bisimilarity in higher-order languages has been very fruitful, and is still studied a lot, for various forms of higher-order languages, sometimes under the name of 'normal-form' bisimulation. <br/><br/>LA: In your opinion, what is the most interesting or unexpected use in the literature of the notions and techniques you developed in your award-winning paper?<br/><br/>DS: I mentioned the hope, when working on open bisimilarity, that its symbolic "efficient" characterisation could be useful for automated or semi-automated tools for reasoning about behavioural properties.  Shortly after introducing open bisimulation,   Björn Victor and Faron Moller, both in Edinburgh at the time,   exploited it to design the Mobility Workbench. I also worked on an algorithm and a prototype tool for on-the-fly checking, with Marco Pistore.  <br/><br/>However the most surprising applications in this direction have arrived later, when the 'lazy' instantiation of bound names of open bisimilarity has been applied to languages richer than pi-calculus.  For instance, Chaki, Rajamani, Rehof have used open similarity in their methods and tools for model checking distributed message-passing software.  Others have applied open bisimilarity to languages for security and cryptography, like the spi-calculus and applied pi-calculus. These include S. Brias, U. Nestmann and colleagues at EPFL and Berlin.   R. Horne, A. Tiu and colleagues in Singapore and Luxembourg have pushed significantly in this direction, with verification techniques and tools. For instance very recently they have discovered a privacy vulnerability for e-passports.  <br/><br/>Similarly, Yuxin Deng and colleagues have applied the idea of open bisimulation to quantum processes, with analogous motivations --- avoiding the universal quantification in the  instantiation of variables, algorithmically unfeasible in the quantum setting as quantum states constitute a continuum.<br/><br/>Another line of work that I found interesting and surprising concerns abstract frameworks for concurrency, including logical frameworks. Here forms of open bisimulation are often the 'natural' bisimulation that come up. These frameworks may be based, for instance on  coalgebras and category theory  (e.g., works by M. Fiore and S. Staton, N. Ghani,   K. Yemane, and B. Victor), category theory for reactive systems (e.g., works by F. Bonchi, B. König and U. Montanari), nominal SOS rule formats  (e.g., works by M. Cimini,  M. R. Mousavi, and  M. A. Reniers), higher-order logic languages (e.g., works by A Tiu, G. Nadathur, and D. Miller). <br/><br/>There have been works that have pushed the idea of open bisimulation of avoiding the instantiation of  bound names in interactions with an external observers one step further: such bound names are not instantiated even in interactions<i> internal </i>to the processes. The substitutions produced by the interactions are added to the calculus, producing particles sometimes called fusions.  This mechanism resembles the explicit substitutions of the lambda-calculus, but it goes beyond that; for instance the addition of fusions leads to modifications of  input and output prefixes that produce pleasant syntactic and semantic symmetry properties.  Various people have worked on this, including B. Victor, J. Parrow, Y. Fu, C. Laneve, P. Gardner and L. Wischik.<br/><br/>I should also mention the recent work by K. Y. Ahn, R. Horne, and A. Tiu  on logical interpretations of open bisimilarity. Remarkably, they explain the difference between the original (late and early)  formulations of bisimilarity in the pi-calculus  and open bisimilarity as the difference between  intuitionistic and classical versions of modal logics. <br/><br/>Apologies for not mentioning everybody!<br/><br/>LA: To your mind, how has the focus of CONCUR changed since its first edition in 1990?<br/><br/>DS: I remember that in the early years of CONCUR there was  a tremendous excitement about the conference.  A forum for grouping the (fast-growing) community had been long-awaited.  In Edinburgh, every year after the conference,   the people with an interest in concurrency   would meet (multiple times!)  and discuss the contents of the proceedings.  Several of us every year would attend the conference. Attending the conference was very useful and interesting: one was sure to meet a lot of people, hear about excellent papers, have lively discussions.  We would  try to go,  even without  a paper in the proceedings.   I vividly remember the 1993 edition, where I presented the paper on open bisimulation.  It had been organised by Eike Best in Hildesheim, Germany. It was an  enjoyable and exciting week,  I met and knew a number of people of our community, and learned a lot. (How sad and unwise that the Computer Science department in Hildesheim, so strong in concurrency  at the time, was shut down a few years later.)  Over the years, the CONCUR community has kept increasing its size. The conference has substantially broadened its scope,  rightly including new emerging topics. Perhaps it is more difficult than in the past to (more or less) understand most of the presented papers, both because of the diversity of the topics and of their technical specialisation.  On the other hand, there are now satellite events, covering  a number of areas. Hence  there are always plenty of interesting presentations and talks to attend (this definitely occurred to me in the last edition, in Amsterdam!).  I should also mention here the activity on the IFIP WG 1.8 on Concurrency Theory, currently chaired by Ilaria Castellani, that in many ways  supports and promotes CONCUR.<br/><br/>The quality of the papers at CONCUR is still very high. This is very important. As a community we should strive to maintain, and possibly even increase, the excellence and prestige of the conference, first of all, by submitting our best papers to the conference. CONCUR must be a reference conference in Computer Science, which is essential for injecting new people and energy into the community.</div>

search number where a team of cops is pursuing a robber that is lazy, visible
and has the ability to move at infinite speed via unguarded path. In recent
papers, connected node search strategies have been considered. A search
stratregy is connected if at each step the set of vertices that is or has been
occupied by the team of cops, induced a connected subgraph of $G$. It has been
shown that the connected search number of a graph $G$ can be expressed as the
connected treewidth, denoted $\mathbf{ctw}(G),$ that is defined as the minimum
width of a rooted tree-decomposition $({{\cal X},T,r})$ such that the union of
the bags corresponding to the nodes of a path of $T$ containing the root $r$ is
connected. Clearly we have that $\mathbf{tw}(G)\leqslant \mathbf{ctw}(G)$. It
is paper, we initiate the algorithmic study of connected treewidth. We design a
$O(n^2\cdot\log n)$-time dynamic programming algorithm to compute the connected
treewidth of a biconnected series-parallel graphs. At the price of an extra $n$
factor in the running time, our algorithm genralizes to graphs of treewidth at
most $2$.

single global complex using an equivalence relation of congruence of cells,
solving topologically the numerical inaccuracies of floating-point arithmetics.
While computing the space arrangement generated by a collection of cellular
complexes, one may start from independently and efficiently computing the
intersection of each single input 2-cell with the others. The topology of these
intersections is codified within a set of (0-2)-dimensional chain complexes.
The target of this paper is to merge the local chains by using the equivalence
relations of {\epsilon}-congruence between 0-, 1-, and 2-cells (elementary
chains). In particular, we reduce the block-diagonal coboundary matrices
[\Delta_0] and [\Delta_1], used as matrix accumulators of the local coboundary
chains, to the global matrices [\delta_0] and [\delta_1], representative of
congruence topology, i.e., of congruence quotients between all 0-,1-,2-cells,
via elementary algebraic operations on their columns. This algorithm is
codified using the Julia porting of the SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS implementation of
the GraphBLAS standard, conceived to efficiently compute algorithms on large
graphs using linear algebra and sparse matrices [1, 2].

    <title>Magnus M. Halldorsson: EATCS Fellow 2020</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As announced <a href="http://eatcs.org/index.php/component/content/article/1-news/2851--eatcs-fellows-class-of-2020-named">here</a>, the EATCS Fellows vintage 2020 are<br/><ul><li><a href="http://pages.di.unipi.it/degano/">Pierpaolo Degano</a>, Universita di Pisa, Italy: for his contributions in concurrency theory and applications in security and for biological systems. </li><li><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/">Mohammad Taghi Hajiaghayi,</a> University of Maryland, USA: for his contributions to the theory of algorithms, in particular algorithmic graph theory, game theory, and distributed computing. </li><li><a href="https://www.ru.is/~mmh/">Magnus Mar Halldorsson</a>, Reyjavik University, Iceland: for his contributions to the theory of approximation and graph algorithms as well as to the study of wireless algorithmics. </li></ul>Congratulations to all of them! However, I trust that Mohammad and Pierpaolo will forgive me if I devote this post to celebrate Magnus, his work and his contributions to the TCS community.<br/><br/>So, why was Magnus chosen as one of the EATCS Fellows 2020? Here are some reasons why.<br/><br/>Magnús has offered seminal contributions to the theory of approximation and graph algorithms as well as to the study of wireless algorithmics. His research career and contributions so far can be roughly divided into two phases. The first phase spans the time from the beginning of his career until roughly ten years ago. During that time, Magnús made significant contributions to approximation algorithms for maximum independent set and graph colouring, amongst many other problems. In the second phase, which started a bit more than ten years ago, he has worked on the algorithmics of realistic models for wireless computation. I think that it is fair to say that Magnús is currently <i>the</i> expert on wireless algorithmics based on the SINR model.<br/><br/>These two phases are not at all disjoint. Indeed, the typical problems studied in the SINR model, such as determining the capacity of wireless networks or how to schedule messages in such networks, can be seen as independent set and colouring problems, respectively, and his experience with those problems in graph algorithmics certainly helped Magnús in obtaining breakthrough results in wireless algorithmics. Throughout his career, Magnús has also given significant contributions to the computation of independent sets and colourings in restricted computational models, such as the online model of computation and the data streaming model. His sustained research productivity, both in quality and in quantity, is all the more remarkable since it has largely been achieved working in the difficult research environment in Iceland, where he was largely isolated until the establishment of the <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/">Icelandic Centre of Excellent in Theoretical Computer Science (ICE-TCS)</a> in 2005. (Magnus has been the scientific director of the centre for 15 years.)<br/><br/>In addition to his seminal research achievements, Magnús has served the theoretical computer science community by sitting on prestigious award committees, organizing conferences and workshops in Iceland and elsewhere, serving on steering committees and by acting as an inspiring mentor for young researchers in computer science who have come to Iceland explicitly to work with him. By way of example, Magnús is a member of the steering committees for SIROCCO (chair), ALGOSENSORS and SWAT, Scandinavian Symposium and Workshops on Algorithm Theory (chair). He was a member of the Council of the EATCS and has organized the best attended ICALP conference to date (ICALP 2008). Amongst many other such duties, he was PC chair for Track C of ICALP 2015 and of ESA 2011.<br/><br/>Magnús was also one of the initiators and first editors of “<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/%20%CC%83viggo/wwwcompendium/">A compendium of NP optimization problems”</a>, which is catalog of approximability results for NP optimization problems and has been a useful resource for researchers in that field for a long time. <br/><br/>Summing up, Magnús is a true stalwart of the algorithmics research community, and a great example for many of us. In my, admittedly biased, opinion, he richly deserves the recognition of being named an EATCS Fellow. I have no doubt that he will continue to lead by example in the coming years.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><h3>A small update about the situation here in Israel</h3>
<p>Eight weeks ago <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/02/03/thinking-about-the-people-of-wuhan-and-china/">I wrote</a> that my heart goes out to the people of Wuhan and China, and these days my heart goes out to people in Italy, Spain, the US, Iran, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Netherland and many other countries all over the world. Of course, I am especially worried about the situation here in my beloved country Israel, and let me tell you a little about it.</p>
<p>The pandemic started here late but it hit us pretty hard with 5,358 identified cases yesterday. Severe measures of social distancing were gradually introduced, and right now it is too early to tell if the pandemic is under control.</p>
<p>My part in this struggle is to stay at home. (Many Israeli scientists are making various endeavors and proposing ideas of various kind for fighting the disease and I salute them all for their efforts.) Like all of us I am very thankful to medical and other essential workers who are in the front-lines. As a scientist, I am especially impressed by the people from the Ministry of Health who manage the crisis and communicate with the public. They represent the very best we can offer in terms of science and medicine, decision making, gathering information, communicating with the public, and managing the crisis. In the picture below you can see three of the leaders – Moshe Bar Siman Tov (middle) Prof. Itamar Grotto (right) and Professor Sigal Sadetzki (left).</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/listen.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19695" height="371" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/listen.png?w=640&amp;h=371" width="640"/></a></p>
<h2>And now for today’s post</h2>
<p>We had a tradition of sharing entertaining taxi-and-more stories and this post belongs to this category. We note that our highest quality story teller Michal Linial, a prominent Israeli biologist, is now involved in various aspects of the struggle against the disease. Our post today is part of<a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gil-michal.docx"> a report by Michal Feldman and me on our experience from the ICA3 conferences in Singapore and Birmingham</a>.</p>
<h2>Partha Dasgupta, Robin Mason, Frank Ramsey, and James Bond</h2>
<p>After hearing about him for many years, it was a great pleasure for both Michal Feldman and myself to finally meet Partha Dasgupta in person and to listen to his lecture. Partha who is the Frank Ramsey Professor of Economics at Cambridge was introduced by a person, who entered the room directly from an intercontinental flight, whom we did not know but who made a strong impression on us. He devoted part of his introduction to Frank Ramsey who was a mathematician, philosopher and economist, and who had made fundamental contributions to algebra and had developed the canonical model of saving in economic growth, before he died at the young age of 26. (And yes! also Ramsey’s theorem!)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/james-bond.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19699" height="423" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/james-bond.png?w=640&amp;h=423" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Seeing the introducer, Robin Mason, three words came into our minds (more precisely two words, one repeated twice): “Bond, James Bond.”</p>
<p>Indeed, this has led to the following sequence of profound ideas:</p>
<p>1) Robin Mason is a perfect choice for a new generation James Bond.</p>
<p>2) The name “James Bond” is overused. “Robin Mason” is a perfect name to replace the name “James Bond”.</p>
<p>3) Espionage is a little obsolete and it lost much of its prestige and charm. Science and academia is the new thing! An international interdisciplinary academics is the perfect profession which, at present, deserves the prestige formely associated with espionage.</p>
<p>In summary, we came a full circle. Robin Mason is the perfect new choice for James Bond, “Robin Mason” is the perfect new name to replace the name “James Bond,” and Mason’s academic activities and title of Pro-Vice-Chancellor (International) are the perfect replacement for Bond’s activities and the title ‘007’.</p>
<p>(The option of Mason playing his role on the movies rather than in real life should be considered. ‘Q’ could be handy for science as well. )</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This is the first entry in a (planned) series of at least three, potentially four or five, posts about lattice block reduction. The purpose of this series is to give a high level introduction to the most popular algorithms and their analysis, with pointers to the literature for more details. The idea is to start with the obvious – the classic BKZ algorithm. In the next two posts we will look at two lesser known algorithm, which allow to highlight useful tools in lattice reduction. These three posts will focus on provable results. I have not decided how to proceed from there, but I could see the series being extended to topics involving heuristic analyses, practical considerations, and/or a survey of more exotic algorithms that have been considered in the literature.</p>
<h4 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h4>
<p>I will assume that readers of this series are already familiar with basic concepts of lattices, e.g. bases, determinants, successive minima, Minkowski’s bound, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, dual lattices and dual bases, etc. If any of these concepts seem new to you, there are great resources to familiarize yourself with them first (see e.g. lecture notes by <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa19/cse206A-a/">Daniele</a>, <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~regev/teaching/lattices_fall_2009/index.html">Oded</a>, <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/teaching/lattices-2018/">Daniel/Léo</a>). It will probably help if you are familiar with the LLL algorithm (also covered in aforementioned notes), but I’ll try to phrase everything so it is understandable even if if you aren’t.</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s get started. Before we look at BKZ in particular, first some comments about lattice block reduction in general.</p>
<h1 id="sec:basics">The Basics</h1>
<h4 id="the-goal">The Goal</h4>
<p>Why would anyone use block reduction? There are (at least) two reasons.</p>
<h4 id="section"/>
<p>1) Block reduction allows you to find short vectors in a lattice. Recall that finding the shortest vector in a lattice (i.e. solving SVP) is really hard (as far as we know, this takes at least <span class="math inline">\(2^{\Omega(n)}\)</span> time or even <span class="math inline">\(n^{\Omega(n)}\)</span> if you are not willing to also spend exponential amounts of memory). On the other hand, finding somewhat short vectors that are longer than the shortest vector by “only” an exponential factor is really easy (see LLL). So what do you do if you need something that is shorter than what LLL gives you, but you don’t have enough time to actually find the shortest vector? (This situation arises practically every time you use lattice reduction for cryptanalysis.) You can try to find something in between and hope that it doesn’t take as long. This is where lattice reduction comes in: it gives you a smooth trade-off between the two settings. It is worth mentioning that when it comes to approximation algorithms, block reduction is essentially the only game in town, i.e. there are, as far as I know, no non-trivial approximation algorithms that cannot be viewed as block reduction. (In fact, this is related to an open problem that Noah stated during the program: to come up with a non-trivial approximation algorithm that does not rely on a subroutine to find the shortest lattice vector in smaller dimensions.) The only exception to this are quantum algorithms that are able to find subexponential approximations in polynomial time in lattices with certain (cryptographically highly relevant) structure (see <span class="citation">[CDPR16]</span> and follow up work).</p>
<h4 id="section-1"/>
<p>2) Block reduction actually gives you more than just short vectors. It gives you guarantees on the “quality” of the basis. What do we mean by the quality of the basis? Consider the Gram-Schmidt vectors <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}_i^*\)</span> (GSO vectors) associated to a lattice basis <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span>. What we want is that the length of these Gram-Schmidt vectors (the GSO norms) does not drop off too quickly. The reason why this is a useful measure of quality for lattice bases is that it gives a sense of how orthogonal the basis vectors are: conditioned on being bases of the same lattice, the less accentuated the drop off in the GSO vectors, the more orthogonal the basis, and the more useful this basis is to solve several problems in a lattice. In fact, recall that the product of the GSO norms is equal to the determinant of the lattice and thus remains constant. Accordingly, if the GSO norms do not drop off too quickly, the first vector can be shown to be relatively short. So by analyzing the quality of the basis that block reduction achieves, a guarantee on the length of the first vector comes for free (see goal 1)). If you are familiar with the analysis of LLL, this should not come as a surprise to you.</p>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p>In order to ensure that the GSO norms do not drop off to quickly, it seems useful to be able to reduce them locally. To this end, we will work with projected lattice blocks (this is where the term “block” in block reduction comes from). More formally, given a basis <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span> we will consider the block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i,j]}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i &lt; j\)</span> as the basis formed by the basis vectors <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}_i, {\mathbf{b}}_{i+1}, \dots, {\mathbf{b}}_{j}\)</span> <em>projected orthogonally to the first <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span> basis vectors</em>. So <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i,j]}\)</span> is a basis for the lattice given by the sublattice formed by <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}_1, {\mathbf{b}}_{2}, \dots, {\mathbf{b}}_{j}\)</span> projected onto the orthogonal subspace of the vectors <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}_1, {\mathbf{b}}_{2}, \dots, {\mathbf{b}}_{i-1}\)</span>. Notice that the first vector of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i,j]}\)</span> is exactly <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}^*_i\)</span> – the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th GSO vector. Another way to view this is to consider the QR-factorization of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}} = {\mathbf{Q}} {\mathbf{R}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span> is the matrix whose columns are the basis vectors <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}_i\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{Q}}\)</span> is orthonormal, it represents a rotation of the lattice and we can consider the lattice generated by the columns of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{R}}\)</span> instead, which is an upper triangular matrix. For an upper triangular basis, the projection of a basis vector orthogonal to the previous basis vectors simply results in dropping the first entries from the vector. So considering a projected block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{R}}_{i,j}\)</span> is simply to consider the square submatrix of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{R}}\)</span> consisting of the rows and columns with index <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(i \leq k \leq j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we need a tool that allows us to control these GSO vectors, which we view as the first basis vectors in projected sublattices. For this, we will fall back to algorithms that solve SVP. Recall that this is very expensive, so we will not call this on the basis <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span> but rather on the projected blocks <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i,j]}\)</span>, where we ensure that the dimension <span class="math inline">\(k = j-i+1\)</span> of the lattice generated by this projected block is not too large. In fact, the maximum dimension <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> that we call the SVP algorithm on will control the time/quality trade-off achieved by our block reduction algorithms and is usually denoted by the block size. So we will assume that we have access to such an SVP algorithm. Actually, we will assume something slightly stronger: we will assume access to a subroutine that takes as input the basis <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span> and indices <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> and outputs a basis <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{C}}\)</span> such that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the lattice generated by the basis remains the same</p></li>
<li><p>the first <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span> and the last vectors starting from <span class="math inline">\(j+1\)</span> remain unchanged</p></li>
<li><p>the projected block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{C}}_{[i,j]}\)</span> is <em>SVP reduced</em>, meaning that <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{c}}^*_i\)</span> is the shortest vector in the lattice generated by <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{C}}_{[i,j]}\)</span>. Additionally, if <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i,j]}\)</span> is already SVP reduced, we assume that the basis <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span> is left unchanged.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will call an algorithm that achieves this an <em>SVP oracle</em>. Such an oracle can be implemented given any algorithm that solves SVP (for arbitrary lattices). The technical detail of filling in the gap is left as homework to the reader.</p>

GSO log norms of the input in black, of the output in red. Note that the sum of the GSO log norms is a constant, so reducing the first vector, increases the (average of the) remaining vectors.</figure></div>



<p>For the analysis we need to know what such an SVP oracle buys us. This is where Minkowski’s theorem comes in: we know that for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional lattice <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1(\Lambda) \leq \sqrt{\gamma_n} \det(\Lambda)^{1/n}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1(\Lambda)\)</span> is the length of the shortest vector in <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_n = \Theta(n)\)</span> is Hermite’s constant). This tells us that after we’ve applied the SVP oracle to a projected block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i,i+k-1]}\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_i \| \leq \sqrt{\gamma_{k}} \left(\prod_{j = i}^{i+k-1} \|{\mathbf{b}}_j^* \| \right)^{1/k}.\]</span> Almost all of the analyses of block reduction algorithms, at least in terms of their output quality, rely on this single inequality.</p>
<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Before we finally get to talk about BKZ, I want to remark that throughout this series I will punt on a technical (but very important) topic: the number of arithmetic operations (outside of the oracle calls) and the size of the numbers. The number of arithmetic operations is usually not a problem, since it will be dominated by the calls to the SVP oracle. We will only compute projections of sublattices corresponding to projected blocks as described above to pass them to the oracle, which can be done efficiently using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. The size of the numbers is a more delicate issue. We need to ensure that the required precision for these projections does not explode somehow. This is usually addressed by interleaving the calls to the SVP oracle with calls to LLL. If you are familiar with the LLL algorithm, it should be intuitive that this allows to control the size of the number. For a clean example of how this can be handled, we refer to e.g. <span class="citation">[GN08a]</span>. So, in summary, we will measure the running time of our algorithms thoughout simply in the number of calls to the SVP oracle.</p>
<h1 id="sec:bkz">BKZ</h1>
<p>Schnorr <span class="citation">[S87]</span> introduced the concept of BKZ reduction in the 80’s as a generalization of LLL. The first version of the BKZ algorithm as we consider it today was proposed by Schnorr and Euchner <span class="citation">[SE94]</span> a few years later. With our setup above, the algorithm can be described in a very simple way. Let <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}\)</span> be a lattice basis of an <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-dimensional lattice and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> be the block size. Recall that this is a parameter that will determine the time/quality trade-off as we shall see in the analysis. We start by calling the SVP oracle on the first block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[1,k]}\)</span> of size <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Once this block is SVP reduced, we shift our attention to the next block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[2,k+1]}\)</span> and call the oracle on that. Notice that SVP reduction of <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[2,k+1]}\)</span> may change the lattice generated by <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[1,k]}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{b}}_1\)</span> may not be the shortest vector in the first block anymore, i.e. it can potentially be reduced even further. However, instead of going back and fixing that, we will simply leave this as a problem to “future us”. For now, we continue in this fashion until we reach the end of the basis, i.e. until we called the oracle on <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{n-k,n}\)</span>. Note that so far this can be viewed as considering a constant sized window moving from the start of the basis to the end and reducing the first vector of the projected block in this window as much as possible using the oracle. Once we have reached the end of the basis, we start reducing the window size, i.e. we call the oracle on <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{n-k+1,n}\)</span>, then on <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{n-k+2,n}\)</span>, etc. This whole process is called a <em>BKZ tour</em>.</p>
<p>Now that we have finished a tour, it is time to go back and fix the blocks that are not SVP reduced anymore. We do this simply by running another tour. Again, if the second tour modified the basis, there is no guarantee that all the blocks are SVP redcued. So we simply repeat, and repeat, and … you get the idea. We run as many tours as required until the basis does not change anymore. That’s it. If this looks familiar to you, that’s not a coincidence: if we plug in <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> as our block size, we obtain (a version of) LLL! So BKZ is a proper generalization of LLL.</p>

<p>The obvious questions now are: what can we expect from the output? And how long does it take?</p>
<h4 id="the-good">The Good</h4>
<p>We will now take a closer look at the approximation factor achieved by BKZ. If you want to follow this analysis along, you might want to get out pen and paper. Otherwise, feel free to trust me on the calculations (I wouldn’t!) and/or jump ahead to the end of this section for the result (no spoilers!). Let’s assume for now that the BKZ algorithm terminates. If it does, we know that the projected block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[i, i+k-1]}\)</span> is SVP reduced for every <span class="math inline">\(i \in [1,\dots,n-k+1]\)</span>. This means that we have <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_i \|^k \leq \gamma_{k}^{k/2} \prod_{j = i}^{i+k-1} \|{\mathbf{b}}_j^* \|\]</span> for all these <span class="math inline">\(n-k+1\)</span> values of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Multiplying all of these inequalities and canceling terms gives the inequality <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \|^{k-1}\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_2 \|^{k-2} \dots \|{\mathbf{b}}^*_{k-1} \| \leq \gamma_{k}^{\frac{(n-k+1)k}{2}} \|{\mathbf{b}}_{n-k+2}^* \|^{k-1} \|{\mathbf{b}}_{n-k+3}^* \|^{k-2} \dots \|{\mathbf{b}}_{n}^* \|.\]</span> Now we make two more observations: 1) not only is <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[1, k]}\)</span> SVP reduced, but so is <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{[1, i]}\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(i &lt; k\)</span>. (Why? Think about it for 2 seconds!) This means we can multiply the inequalities <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \|^i \leq \gamma_{i}^{i/2} \prod_{j = 1}^{i} \|{\mathbf{b}}_j^* \|\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i \in [2,k-1]\)</span> together with the trivial inequality <span class="math inline">\(\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \| \leq \|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \|\)</span>, which gives <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \|^{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} \leq \left(\prod_{i = 2}^{k-1} \gamma_{i}^{i/2} \right) \prod_{i = 1}^{k-1} \|{\mathbf{b}}_i^* \|^{k-1}\]</span> Now we use the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_k^k \geq \gamma_i^i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i \leq k\)</span> (Why? Homework!) and combine with our long inequality above to get <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \|^{\frac{k(k-1)}{2}} \leq \gamma_k^{\frac{k(n-1)}{2}} \|{\mathbf{b}}_{n-k+2}^* \|^{k-1} \|{\mathbf{b}}_{n-k+3}^* \|^{k-2} \dots \|{\mathbf{b}}_{n}^* \|.\]</span> (I’m aware that this is a lengthy calculation for a blog post, but we’re almost there, so bear with me. It’s worth it!)</p>
<p>We now use one final observation, which is a pretty common trick in lattice algorithms: w.l.o.g. assume that for some shortest vector <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{v}}\)</span> in our lattice its projection orthogonal to the first <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> basis vectors is non-zero (if it is zero for all of the shortest vectors, simply drop the last vector from the basis, the result is still BKZ reduced, so use induction). Then we must have that <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1 = \| {\mathbf{v}} \| \geq \|{\mathbf{b}}_i^* \|\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i \in [n-k+2, \dots, n]\)</span>, since otherwise the projected block <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf{B}}_{i,n}\)</span> would not be SVP reduced. This means, we have <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_1 \geq \max_{i \in [n-k+2, \dots, n]} \|{\mathbf{b}}_i^* \|\)</span>. This is the final puzzle piece to get our approximation bound: <span class="math display">\[\|{\mathbf{b}}^*_1 \| \leq \gamma_{k}^{\frac{n-1}{k-1}} \lambda_1.\]</span> Note that this analysis (dating back to Schnorr <span class="citation">[S94]</span>) is reminiscent of the analysis of LLL and if we plug in <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>, we get exactly what we’d expect from LLL. Though we do note a gap in the other extreme: if we plug in <span class="math inline">\(k=n\)</span>, we know that the approximation factor is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (we are solving SVP in the entire lattice), but the bound above yields a factor <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_n = \Theta(n)\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="the-bad">The Bad</h4>
<p>Now that we’ve looked at the output quality of the basis, let’s see what we can say about the running time (recall that our focus is on the number of calls to the SVP oracle). The short answer is: not much and that’s very unfortunate. Ideally, we’d want a bound on the number of SVP calls that is polynomial in <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This would mean that the overall running time for large <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is dominated by the running time of the SVP oracle in dimension <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and the block size would give us exactly the expected trade-off. However, an LLL style analysis has so far only yielded a bound on the number of tours which is <span class="math inline">\(O(k^n)\)</span> <span class="citation">[HPS11, Appendix]</span>. This is quite bad – for large <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> the number of calls will be the dominating factor in the running time.</p>
<h4 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h4>
<p>Recall that the analysis of LLL does not only provide a bound on the approximation factor, but also on the Hermite factor, i.e. on the ratio of <span class="math inline">\(\| {\mathbf{b}}_1\|/\det(\Lambda)^{1/n}\)</span>. Since an LLL-style analysis worked out nicely for the approximation factor of BKZ, it stands to reason that a similar analysis should yield a similar bound for BKZ. By extrapolating from LLL, one could expect a bound along the lines of <span class="math inline">\(\| {\mathbf{b}}_1\|/\det(\Lambda)^{1/n} \leq \gamma_{k}^{n/2k}\)</span> (note the square root improvement w.r.t. the trivial bound obtained from the approximation factor). And, in fact, a bound of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{k}^{\frac{n-1}{2(k-1)} + 1}\)</span> has been claimed in <span class="citation">[GN08b]</span> but without proof (as pointed out in <span class="citation">[HPS11]</span>) and it is not clear, how one would prove this. (<span class="citation">[GN08b]</span> claims that one can use a similar argument as we did for the approximation factor, but I don’t see it.)</p>
<h4 id="the-rescue">The Rescue</h4>
<p>So it seems different techniques are necessary to complete the analysis of BKZ. The work of <span class="citation">[HPS11]</span> introduced such a new technique based on the analysis of dynamical systems. This work applied the technique successfully to BKZ, but the analysis is quite involved. What it shows is that one can terminate BKZ after a polynomial number of tours and still get a guarantee on the output quality, which is very close to the conjectured bound on the Hermite factor above. (Caveat: Technically, <span class="citation">[HPS11]</span> only showed this result for a slight variant of BKZ, but the difference to the standard BKZ algorithm only lies in the scope of the interleaving LLL applications, which is something that we glossed over above.) This is in line with experimental studies <span class="citation">[SE94,GN08b,MW16]</span>, which show that BKZ produces high quality bases after a few tours already.</p>
<p>We will revisit this approach when considering a different block reduction variant, SDBKZ, where the analysis is much cleaner. As a teaser for the next post though, recall that BKZ can be viewed as a generalization of LLL (which corresponds to BKZ with block size <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>). Since the analysis of LLL did not carry entirely to BKZ, one could wonder if there is a different generalization of LLL such that an LLL-style analysis also generalizes naturally. The answer to this is yes, and we will consider such an algorithm in the next post.</p>

<p>
Dr. Lofa Polir is, like many of us, working from home. When we last <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/the-entropy-of-baseball/">wrote</a> about her two years ago, she had started work for the Livingston, Louisiana branch of <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/about">LIGO</a>. They sent her and the rest of the staff home on March 19 and <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20200326">suspended</a> observations on the 26th. Since Polir’s duties already included public outreach, she is looking to continue that online.</p>
<p>
Today we helped Dr. Polir interview another pandemic-affected researcher.</p>
<p>
We liked her idea of interviewing young people just starting their careers, who are facing unexpected uncertainties. Her first choice was a new graduate of Cambridge University doing fundamental work related to LIGO. Unfortunately, he had been unable to install a current version of Zoom on his handheld device, or maybe afraid owing to security <a href="https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/1244987617676050434?s=11">issues</a>. So she requested the special equipment we have used to <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/an-interview-with-kurt-gdel/">interview</a> people <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/03/more-interview-with-kurt-godel/">in</a> the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">past</a>. </p>
<p>
He replied at the speed of light that he was willing to do the interview so long as we respected some privacy measures. As for what name to use, he said we could just call him Izzy—Izzy Jr., in fact. So Dick, I, and Dr. Polir all used our own Zoom to port into our machine’s console room. The connection worked right away as Izzy’s head glimmered into view.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Starting The Interview </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
At first glimpse, all we could see was his long, light-brown hippie hair. This really surprised us—not the image we had of Cambridge—and we gasped about it before even saying hello. He replied that it was fashion from the Sixties. We asked how his family was doing and he said his fathers had passed on but mother and young siblings were at home and fine. We think he said “fathers” plural—the machine rendered him in a drawl like Mick Jagger and he was hard to follow.</p>
<p>
Izzy picked up on our discomfort and immediately assured us he hadn’t been doing any drugs: “You can’t get them anyway because they’re all being diverted to treat the sick.” But he did open up to us that he was in some kind of withdrawal. He confessed that he had resorted to looking at the sun with one eye. “It was ecstasy but bad—I still can see only reds and blues with that eye, and I need to use an extra-large rectangular cursor to read text.” We were curious what brand of handheld device he was using because of his problems with Zoom, and he told us it was a Napier 1660 by <a href="http://www.oughtred.org/history.shtml">Oughtred, Ltd.</a> We hadn’t heard of that model but he said he’d connected three of them into a good home lab setup.</p>
<p>
We asked how he was coping with distance teaching, but he said he hadn’t yet started his faculty position at Trinity College. We were surprised to learn that lecture attendance at Cambridge University is optional. “I shall be required to give the lectures but nobody will come to them so that’s all the same now—at least here I’ll have a cat for audience. No dogs and not my mother or siblings—I’d sooner burn the house down.” He quickly added, “Oh, my mother and I get along fine now and I love playing teatime with my little sisters.”</p>
<p>
We really didn’t want to go into Izzy’s personal life, and I tried to shift the small-talk by noting a little chess set on a shelf behind him. He snapped that he shouldn’t have spent money on it and he was a poor player anyway. We thought, wow, either this guy’s really down on himself or the cabin fever of the pandemic is getting to him. So Dick, always quick to pick up on things and find ways of encouragement, said:</p>
<p>
“Dr. Polir here works on gravity and we’re told you have some great new ideas about it. We’d love to hear them.”</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do—or did. But something happened yesterday that is making me realize that it’s all wrong, rubbish really…”</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> In the Garden </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Izzy started by explaining that it’s a basic principle of alchemy that all objects have humors that can manifest as kinds of magnetism. (“Alchemy”? did we hear him right?) If you realize that the Earth and Sun are objects just like any other then you can model gravity that way. You just need to assign each object a number called its “mass” and then you get the equation </p>

<p>
“We understand all that,” said Dr. Polir.</p>
<p>
Izzy said the point is that <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> depends <b>only</b> on your units and is the same regardless of where you are on Earth or on the Moon or wherever. It is very small, though. Then he went into his story of yesterday.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I was in our garden by the path to the neighbor’s farm. I was supposed to be watching my little brother Benjamin who wanted to help harvest squash but I hate farming so I let him go without me. I was lying under an apple tree for shade when an apple fell and I realized all my mistakes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
“What?,” we thought silently. We didn’t need to speak up—Izzy launched right into his litany of error:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “First, I’d thought the force was in what made the apple fall, but that’s nonsense. The apple would fall naturally because down is the shortest path it would be on if the tree branch were not holding it back. The only force is the tensile strength of the branch which was restraining it. I think that the tensile force really is magnetism, by the way.”</em></p><em>
<p>
“Second, it’s ridiculous to think the force is coming <b>from</b> the Earth. On first principles, it could come from the ground, but that’s not what the equations say. They could have it all coming from one point in the <b>center</b> of the Earth. Just one point—four thousand miles deep!”</p>
</em><p><em>
“Third and worst, though, is when you apply it to the Sun and the Earth. My equation means they are exerting force on each other instantaneously. But they are millions of miles apart. Whereas, the tree was <b>touching</b> the apple. Force can work only by touch, not by some kind of spooky action at a distance.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We realized what he was driving at. Dick again always likes to encourage, so he said:</p>
<p>
“But the math you developed for this force theory—surely it is good for calculations…?”</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “No it’s not—it’s the Devil’s own box. I can calculate two bodies—the Earth and the Sun, or the Moon and the Earth if you suppose there is no Sun, but as soon as you have all three bodies it’s a bog. Worst of all, I can arrange five bodies so that one of them gets accelerated to infinite velocity—<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/31/hobgoblins-in-our-equations/">in finite time</a>. This is a clear impossibility, a contradiction, so by <em>modus tollens</em>… it can all go in the bin.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We didn’t think it would help to tell him that his math was good enough to <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19720022040.pdf">calculate</a> a Moon landing but not to locate a friend’s house while driving. He supplied his own <em>coup-de-grâce</em> anyway:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “And even the two-body calculations are tainted. I can calculate the orbits of the planets but the equations I get aren’t stable. I would wind up having to postulate something like God keeps the planets on their tracks. Yes, you need an intelligent Agent to start the planets going—all in one plane, basically—but to need such intervention all the time defeats the point of having equations.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Inklings </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We asked Izzy what he was going to do. He said that the one blessing of enforced solitude is that one gets time to reflect on things and deepen the foundations. And he said he’d had an idea later that afternoon.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Toward supper I realized I needed to get Benjamin home. The path to the farm is straight except it goes over a mound. I was sauntering along and when I got to the hill I realized that if I didn’t watch it I’d have fallen right into it. So that got me thinking. First, what I thought was straight on the path was really a curve—the Earth is after all a ball. We think space is straight, but maybe it too is curved. So when I’m standing here, perhaps I would really be moving in a diagonally down direction, but the Earth is stopping me. The Irish blessing says, ‘may the road rise up to meet you.’ Perhaps it does.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
“So are you doing math to work that out?,” I ventured.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I started after supper. One good thing is that it allows light to be affected by gravity—which I was already convinced of—even if light has no mass. But a problem is that it appears Time would have to be included as curved. That does not make sense either.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We asked when he might write up all this. He said he didn’t want to be quick to publish something so flawed on the one hand, or incomplete on the other, “unless someone else be about to publish the same.” We noted that there weren’t going to be any in-person conferences to present papers at for awhile anyway.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Besides, that’s not what I’m most eager to do. What the respite is really giving me time for is to start writing up my work on Theology. That’s most important—it could have stopped thirty years of war. For one thing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiousios">homoiousios</a>, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoousios">homoousios</a>, is the right rendering. There will be a time and times and the dividing of times in under 400 years <a href="https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-116141910/a-time-and-times-and-the-dividing-of-time-isaac">anyway</a>.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
That last statement somehow did not reassure us. We thanked Izzy Jr. for the interview and he gave consent to publish it posthumously.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We hope that your April Fool’s Day is such as to allow a time to laugh. But also seriously, would you be interested in the idea of our interviewing people during these times? Is there anyone you would like to suggest?</p>

    <title>Length of Descriptions for DFA, NFA, CFG</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
We will be looking at the size of descriptions<br/>
<br/>
 For DFAs and NFAs this is the number of states.<br/>
<br/>
For CFG's we will assume they are in Chomsky Normal Form. So for this post CFG means CFG in Chomsky normal form. The length of a Chomsky Normal Form CFL is the number of rules.<br/>
<br/>
1) It is known there is a family of languages L_n such that<br/>
<br/>
DFA for L_n requires roughly 2^n states.<br/>
<br/>
NFA for L_n can be done with roughly n states.<br/>
<br/>
L_n =  (a,b)^* a (a,b)^n<br/>
<br/>
Also note that there is a CFG for L_n with roughly n rules. (one can show this directly or by some theorem that goes from an NFA of size s to a CFG of size roughly s).<br/>
<br/>
So L_n shows there is an exp blowup between DFAs and NFA's<br/>
<br/>
2) It is known that there is a family of languages L_n such that<br/>
<br/>
DFA for L_n requires roughly 2^n states<br/>
<br/>
NFA for L_n requires roughly 2^n states<br/>
<br/>
CFG for L_n can be done with roughly n rules<br/>
<br/>
L_n = { a^{2^n}  }<br/>
<br/>
So L_n shows there is an exp blowup between NFAs and CFGs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) Is there a family of languages L_n such that<br/>
<br/>
NFA for L_n requires 2^{2^n} states<br/>
<br/>
CFG for L_n can be done with roughly n rules.<br/>
<br/>
The answer is not quite- and perhaps open.  There is a set of family of languages L_n such that for infinitely many n he above holds. These languages have to do with Turing Machines. In fact, you can replace<br/>
<br/>
2^{2^n}} with any function f  \le_T  INF (so second level of undecidability).<br/>
<br/>
For this blog this is NOT what we are looking for. (For more on this angle see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08847.pdf">here</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
4) OPEN (I think) Is there a family of langs L_n such that for ALL n<br/>
<br/>
NFA for L_n requires 2^{2^n} (or some other fast growing function<br/>
<br/>
CFG for L_n can be done with roughly n states (we'll take n^{O(1)})<br/>
<br/>
5) OPEN (I think) Is there a family of langs L_n such that for ALL n<br/>
(or even for just inf many n)<br/>
<br/>
DFA for L_n requires 2^{2^n}} states<br/>
<br/>
NFA for L_n requires 2^n states and can be done in 2^n<br/>
<br/>
CFG for L_n can be done with n rules.<br/>
<br/>
(we'll settle for not quite as drastic, but still want to see DFA, NFA, CFG all<br/>
far apart).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

    <title>TR20-042 |  Poly-time blackbox identity testing for sum of log-variate constant-width ROABPs | 

	Pranav Bisht, 

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Blackbox polynomial identity testing (PIT) affords 'extreme variable-bootstrapping' (Agrawal et al, STOC'18; PNAS'19; Guo et al, FOCS'19). This motivates us to study log-variate read-once oblivious algebraic branching programs (ROABP). We restrict width of ROABP to a constant and study the more general sum-of-ROABPs model. We give the first poly($s$)-time blackbox PIT for sum of constant-many, size-$s$, $O(\log s)$-variate constant-width ROABPs. The previous best for this model was quasi-polynomial time (Gurjar et al, CCC'15; CC'16) which is comparable to brute-force in the log-variate setting. Also, we handle unbounded-many such ROABPs if each ROABP computes a homogeneous polynomial. 

Our new techniques comprise-- (1) an ROABP computing a homogeneous polynomial can be made syntactically homogeneous in the same width; and (2) overcome the hurdle of unknown variable order in sum-of-ROABPs in the log-variate setting (over any field).</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong><font color="red">Update (March 31):</font></strong> Since commenter after commenter seems to have missed my point—or rather, rounded the point to something different that I didn’t say—let me try one more time.  My faith in official pronouncements from health authorities, and in institutions like the CDC and the FDA, was clearly <em>catastrophically </em>misplaced—and if that doesn’t force significant revisions to my worldview, then I’m beyond hope.  Maybe the failures are because these organizations are at the mercy of political incompetents—meaning ultimately Trump and the people who put him in office.  Or maybe the rot started long before Trump.  Maybe it’s specific to the US, or maybe it’s everywhere.  I still don’t know the answers to those questions.</p>



<p>On the other hand, my faith in my ability to listen to individual people, whether they’re expert epidemiologists or virologists or just technologists or rationalists or anyone else (who in turn listened to the experts), and to say “yes, this person clearly has good judgment and has thought about it carefully, and if they’re worried then I should be too”—my faith in <em>that</em> has only gone up.  The problem is simply that I didn’t do enough of that back in January and February, and when I did, I didn’t sufficiently act on it.</p>



<p><strong><font color="red">End of Update</font></strong></p>



<p>On Feb. 4, a friend sent me an email that read, in part:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Dr. A,<br/>What do you make of this coronavirus risk? …  I don’t know what level of precaution is necessary!  Please share your view.  </p></blockquote>



<p>This was the first time that I’d been prompted to give this subject any thought whatsoever.  I sent a quick reply two minutes later:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>For now, I think the risk from the ordinary flu is much much greater!  But worth watching to see if it becomes a real pandemic. </p></blockquote>



<p>Strictly speaking, this reply was “correct”—even “reasonable” and “balanced,” admitting the possibility of changing circumstances.  Yet if I could go back in time, I’d probably send a slightly different message—one that would fare better in the judgment of history.  Something like this, maybe:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong>HOLY SHIT!!!!!—GET YOUR PARENTS SOMEWHERE SAFE—CANCEL ALL TRAVEL PLANS—STOCK UP ON FOOD AND MASKS AND HAND SANITIZERS.  SELL ALL STOCK YOU OWN!!!  SHORT THE MARKET IF YOU KNOW HOW, OTHERWISE GET CASH AND BONDS.  HAVE AN ISOLATED PLACE TO ESCAPE TO.  IF YOU’RE FEELING ALTRUISTIC, JOIN GROUPS MAKING THEIR OWN MASKS AND VENTILATORS.</strong></p><p><strong>DO NOT RELY ON OFFICIAL PRONOUNCEMENTS, OR REASSURING ARTICLES FROM MAINSTREAM SOURCES LIKE <em>VOX</em> OR <em>THE WASHINGTON POST</em>.  THEY’RE FULL OF IT.  THE CDC AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL, HOLLOWED-OUT SHELLS OF WHAT YOU IMAGINE THEM TO BE.  FOR ALL IT WILL DO IN ITS MOMENT OF ULTIMATE NEED, IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE CDC NEVER EXISTED.</strong></p><p><strong>WHO THEN SHOULD YOU LISTEN TO?  CONTRARIAN, RATIONALIST NERDS AND TECH TYCOONS ON SOCIAL MEDIA.  BILL GATES, BALAJI SRINIVASAN, PAUL GRAHAM, GREG COCHRAN, ROBIN HANSON, SARAH CONSTANTIN, ELIEZER YUDKOWSKY, NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS, ERIC WEINSTEIN.  NO, NOT ALL SUCH PEOPLE—NOT ELON MUSK, FOR EXAMPLE—BUT YOU’LL DO RIDICULOUSLY BETTER THAN AVERAGE THIS WAY. </strong></p><p><strong>BASICALLY, THE MORE SNEERCLUB WOULD SNEER AT A GIVEN PERSON, THE MORE THEY’D CALL THEM AN AUTODIDACT STEMLORD DUNNING-KRUGER ASSHOLE WHO’S THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERYTHING WRONG WITH NEOLIBERAL CAPITALISM, THE MORE YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT PERSON RIGHT NOW FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR AND YOUR LOVED ONES’ FUCKING LIVES.  </strong></p><p><strong>DON’T WORRY: WITHIN 6-8 WEEKS, WHAT THE CONTRARIANS ARE SAYING TODAY WILL <em>BE</em> CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.  THE PUBLICATIONS THAT NOW SNEER AT PANDEMIC PREPPERS WILL TURN AROUND AND SNEER AT THE IRRESPONSIBLE NON-PREPPERS, WITHOUT EVER ADMITTING ERROR.  WE’LL ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AT WAR WITH OCEANIA—OR RATHER CORONIA.  TRUTH, OFFICIAL RECOMMENDATIONS, AND PROGRESSIVE POLITICS WILL GET BACK INTO ALIGNMENT JUST LIKE THEY NORMALLY ARE, AND WE’LL ALL BE SHARING MEMES JUSTLY DENOUNCING TRUMP AND THE CRAVEN REPUBLICAN SENATORS AND EVANGELICAL PASTORS AND NUTTY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS WHO DON’T CARE HOW MANY LIVES THEY SACRIFICE WITH THEIR DENIALS.</strong></p><p><strong>BUT EVEN THOUGH THE ENLIGHTENED MAINSTREAM WILL FIGURE OUT THE TRUTH IN A MONTH OR SO—AND EVEN THOUGH THAT’S FAR BETTER THAN OUR IDIOT PRESIDENT AND MILLIONS OF HIS FOLLOWERS, WHO WILL UNDERSTAND ONLY AFTER THE TRENCHES OVERFLOW WITH BODIES, IF THEN—EVEN SO, WE DON’T HAVE A MONTH.  IF YOU WANT TO BE AHEAD OF THE SENSIBLE MAINSTREAM, THEN ALMOST BY DEFINITION, THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT, CRAZY-SOUNDING ICONOCLASTS: TO THOSE WHO, UNLIKE YOU AND ALSO UNLIKE ME, HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY DON’T CARE IF PEOPLE SNEER AT THEM. </strong> </p></blockquote>



<p>Of course, I would never have sent such an email, and not only because of the bold and all-caps.  My whole personality stands against every sentence.  I’ve always taken my cues from “mainstream, reasonable, balanced” authorities, in any subject where I’m not personally expert.  That heuristic has generally been an excellent way to maximize expected rightness.  But when it fails … holy crap!</p>



<p>Now, and for the rest of my life, I’ll face the question: what was wrong with me, such that I would never have sent a “nutty” email like the one above?  Can I fix it?</p>



<p>More specifically, was my problem intellectual or emotional?  I lean toward the latter.  By mid-to-late February, as more and more of my smartest friends started panicking and telling me why I should too, I got intellectually fully on board with the idea that millions of people might die as the new virus spread around the world, and I affirmed as much on Facebook and elsewhere.  And yet it still took me a few more weeks to get from “millions could die” to “<strong>HOLY SHIT MILLIONS COULD DIE—PANIC—DROP EVERYTHING ELSE—BUILD MORE VENTILATORS!!!!</strong>“</p>



<p>A <a href="https://medium.com/@noahhaber/flatten-the-curve-of-armchair-epidemiology-9aa8cf92d652">viral article</a> implores us to “flatten the curve of armchair epidemiology”—that is, to listen only to authoritive sources like the CDC, not random people spouting on social media.  This was notable to me for being the diametric opposite of the <em>actual</em> lesson of the past two months.  It would be like taking the lesson from the 2008 financial crisis that from now on, you would only trust serious rating agencies, like Moody’s or Standard &amp; Poor.</p>



<p>Oh, but I forgot to tell you the punchline.  A couple days ago, the same friend who emailed me on February 4, emailed again to tell me that both of her parents (who live outside the US) now have covid-19.  Her father had to go to the emergency room and tested positive.  Her mother stayed home with somewhat milder symptoms.  Given the overloaded medical system in their country, neither can expect a high standard of care.  My friend has spent the past few days desperately trying to get anyone from the hospital on the phone.</p>



<p>This post represents my apology to her.  Like, it’s one thing to be so afraid of the jeers of the enlightened that you feign asexuality and live as an ascetic for a decade.  It’s worse to be so afraid that you fail adequately to warn your friends when you see an exponential function coming to kill their loved ones.</p></div>

Dominique Perrin and Jean-Éric Pin are French mathematicians who have done significant work in automata theory. Their 1986 <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82354218.pdf">paper</a> “First-Order Logic and Star-Free Sets” gave a new proof that first-order logic plus the <img alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{&lt;}"/> relation characterizes star-free regular sets.</p>
<p>
Today we present their proof in a new visual way, using “stacked words” rather than their “marked words.” We also sidestep algebra by appealing to the familiar theorem that every regular language has a unique minimal deterministic finite automaton (DFA).<br/>

<p>
The first <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/21/star-free-regular-languages-and-logic/">post</a> in this series defined the classes <img alt="{\mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{SF}}"/> for star-free regular and <img alt="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/> for first-order logic where variables <img alt="{u,v,w,\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%2Cv%2Cw%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u,v,w,\dots}"/> range over the indices <img alt="{0,\dots,n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2C%5Cdots%2Cn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0,\dots,n-1}"/> of a string <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. For any character <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> in the alphabet <img alt="{\Sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CSigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Sigma}"/> there is the predicate <img alt="{X_c(u)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX_c%28u%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X_c(u)}"/> saying that the character in position <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> equals <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/>. The first part proved that for any language <img alt="{A \in \mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cin+%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \in \mathsf{SF}}"/> there is a sentence <img alt="{\psi_A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_A}"/> using only predicates <img alt="{X_c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX_c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X_c}"/> and the relation <img alt="{u &lt; v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu+%3C+v%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u &lt; v}"/> besides the usual quantifiers and Boolean operations of first-order logic. such that <img alt="{\psi_A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_A}"/> defined <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>. That is, it proved <img alt="{\mathsf{SF}\subseteq\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%5Csubseteq%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{SF}\subseteq\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/>.</p>
<p>
A key trick was to focus not on <img alt="{\psi_A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_A}"/> but on a formula <img alt="{\phi_A(i,j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi_A%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi_A(i,j)}"/> expressing that the part of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> from position <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> (inclusive) to <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j}"/> (exclusive) belongs to <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>. To prove the converse direction, <img alt="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]\subseteq\mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%5Csubseteq%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]\subseteq\mathsf{SF}}"/>, we focus not on middles of strings but on prefixes and suffixes. The previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/21/star-free-regular-languages-and-logic/">post</a> proved two lemmas showing that if <img alt="{L}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L}"/> is star-free then for any string <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/>, so are its prefix and suffix languages: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}  L\backslash y &amp;=&amp; \{z: yz \in L\}\\ L/y &amp;=&amp; \{x: xy \in L\}. \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++L%5Cbackslash+y+%26%3D%26+%5C%7Bz%3A+yz+%5Cin+L%5C%7D%5C%5C+L%2Fy+%26%3D%26+%5C%7Bx%3A+xy+%5Cin+L%5C%7D.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}  L\backslash y &amp;=&amp; \{z: yz \in L\}\\ L/y &amp;=&amp; \{x: xy \in L\}. \end{array} "/></p>

</p><p/><h2> Stacked Words and FO Formulas </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We implement the “marked words” idea of Perrin and Pin by using extra dimensions rather than marks. Consider any formula <img alt="{\phi(u_1, \dots, u_j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%28u_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+u_j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi(u_1, \dots, u_j)}"/> in FO[<img alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{&lt;}"/>] where <img alt="{u_1,\dots,u_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cu_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u_1,\dots,u_j}"/> are the free variables. Our "stacked words" have <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j}"/> extra rows underneath the top level holding the string <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Each row <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> has the same length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> as <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and contains a single <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> and <img alt="{(n-1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n-1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(n-1)}"/> <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>s. The column <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> in which the <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> lies gives the value of the variable <img alt="{u_i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u_i}"/>. Thus the alphabet of our stacked words is <img alt="{\Sigma^{(j)} = \Sigma\times\{0,1\}^j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CSigma%5E%7B%28j%29%7D+%3D+%5CSigma%5Ctimes%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5Ej%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Sigma^{(j)} = \Sigma\times\{0,1\}^j}"/>. Here is an example:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/logic-and-star-free-part-deux/stackedword/" rel="attachment wp-att-16865"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16865" height="248" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/stackedword.jpg?w=242&amp;h=248" width="242"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Each column is really a single character <img alt="{C \in \Sigma^{(j)}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC+%5Cin+%5CSigma%5E%7B%28j%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C \in \Sigma^{(j)}}"/>, but we picture its entries as characters in <img alt="{\Sigma}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CSigma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Sigma}"/> or <img alt="{\{0,1\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{0,1\}}"/>. For any row <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>, define <img alt="{Y_{i,0}(\cdot)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY_%7Bi%2C0%7D%28%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y_{i,0}(\cdot)}"/> to be the disjunction of <img alt="{X_C(\cdot)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX_C%28%5Ccdot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X_C(\cdot)}"/> over all <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/> that have a <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> in entry <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>, and define <img alt="{Y_{i,1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY_%7Bi%2C1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y_{i,1}}"/> similarly. Then the following sentence expresses the “format condition” that row <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> has exactly one <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (\exists k)[Y_{i,1}(k) \land (\forall \ell) [\ell \neq k \rightarrow Y_{i,0}(k)]]. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28%5Cexists+k%29%5BY_%7Bi%2C1%7D%28k%29+%5Cland+%28%5Cforall+%5Cell%29+%5B%5Cell+%5Cneq+k+%5Crightarrow+Y_%7Bi%2C0%7D%28k%29%5D%5D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (\exists k)[Y_{i,1}(k) \land (\forall \ell) [\ell \neq k \rightarrow Y_{i,0}(k)]]. "/></p>
<p>This readily transforms into a star-free expression for the language of stacked words with exactly one <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> in row <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \alpha_i = C_{i,0}^* C_{i,1} C_{i,0}^*, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Calpha_i+%3D+C_%7Bi%2C0%7D%5E%2A+C_%7Bi%2C1%7D+C_%7Bi%2C0%7D%5E%2A%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \alpha_i = C_{i,0}^* C_{i,1} C_{i,0}^*, "/></p>
<p>Here <img alt="{C_{i,0}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_%7Bi%2C0%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_{i,0}}"/> is the union of all stacked characters that have a <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> in entry <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>, and <img alt="{C_{i,1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_%7Bi%2C1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C_{i,1}}"/> is similarly defined. This is where the examples in the previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/21/star-free-regular-languages-and-logic/">post</a> about finite unions inside stars come in handy. The upshot is that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \alpha_0 = \bigcap_{i=1}^j \alpha_i " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Calpha_0+%3D+%5Cbigcap_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Ej+%5Calpha_i+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \alpha_0 = \bigcap_{i=1}^j \alpha_i "/></p>
<p>is a <img alt="{\mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{SF}}"/> expression that enforces the “format condition” over all rows. We will use this at the crux of the proof; whether <img alt="{\alpha_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_0}"/> is really needed is a question at the end. If we take the format for granted, then the main advantage of our stacked words will be visualizing how to decompose automata according to when the <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> in a critical row is read.</p>

As illustrated above, using the initial lemma in the part-1 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/21/star-free-regular-languages-and-logic/">post</a>, this is equivalent to a star-free regular expression.

Their values <img alt="{k_1,k_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk_1%2Ck_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k_1,k_2}"/> must obey <img alt="{k_1 &lt; k_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk_1+%3C+k_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k_1 &lt; k_2}"/>, meaning that the <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> in row <img alt="{h}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{h}"/> comes in an earlier column than the <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> in row <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>.

Again by the lemma in Part 1, this yields a star-free expression. To complete the basis, we note that if <img alt="{L_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_1}"/> and <img alt="{L_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_2}"/> have star-free expressions <img alt="{\alpha_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_1}"/> and <img alt="{\alpha_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_2}"/> corresponding to <img alt="{\phi_1, \phi_2\in \mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi_1%2C+%5Cphi_2%5Cin+%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi_1, \phi_2\in \mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/>, then <img alt="{\lnot\phi_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clnot%5Cphi_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\lnot\phi_1}"/> is represented by <img alt="{\sim{\alpha_1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csim%7B%5Calpha_1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sim{\alpha_1}}"/> and <img alt="{\phi_1\lor\phi_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi_1%5Clor%5Cphi_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi_1\lor\phi_2}"/> by <img alt="{\alpha_1\cup\alpha_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_1%5Ccup%5Calpha_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_1\cup\alpha_2}"/>, both of which are clearly star-free. </p>

</p><p/><h2> Strategy For the Induction Case </h2><p/>

Assume that all formulas in <img alt="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/> with <img alt="{\ell = r - j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%3D+r+-+j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell = r - j}"/> quantifiers have star-free translations. We will show that any formula in <img alt="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/> with <img alt="{\ell+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell+1}"/> quantifiers also has a star-free translation. Let <img alt="{\psi(u_1,... ,u_{j-1})=\exists u_j \phi(u_1,..., u_j)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%28u_1%2C...+%2Cu_%7Bj-1%7D%29%3D%5Cexists+u_j+%5Cphi%28u_1%2C...%2C+u_j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi(u_1,... ,u_{j-1})=\exists u_j \phi(u_1,..., u_j)}"/> where <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> is a formula in <img alt="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/> that has <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> total variables, <img alt="{j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{j}"/> free variables and <img alt="{m-j=\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm-j%3D%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m-j=\ell}"/> quantifiers. We are allowed to assume the first quantifier in <img alt="{\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi}"/> is existential as <img alt="{\exists \equiv \lnot (\forall \lnot)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cexists+%5Cequiv+%5Clnot+%28%5Cforall+%5Clnot%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\exists \equiv \lnot (\forall \lnot)}"/> and we observed above that the star-free expressible formulas in <img alt="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BFO%7D%5B%3C%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{FO}[&lt;]}"/> are closed under negation. </p>
<p>
The language of <img alt="{\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi}"/> is given by: </p>
<p>
<img alt="{L_\psi=\{z\in(\Sigma\times \{0,1\}^{j-1})^*:}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cpsi%3D%5C%7Bz%5Cin%28%5CSigma%5Ctimes+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7Bj-1%7D%29%5E%2A%3A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\psi=\{z\in(\Sigma\times \{0,1\}^{j-1})^*:}"/> we can add a <img alt="{{(j+1)}^{th}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%28j%2B1%29%7D%5E%7Bth%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{{(j+1)}^{th}}"/> row to each of the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> characters of <img alt="{z}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z}"/> using <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> minus one <img alt="{0'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0'}"/>s and one <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> such that the resulting string <img alt="{z'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z'}"/> belongs to <img alt="{L_\phi\}.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%5C%7D.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi\}.}"/> </p>
<p>We must show that <img alt="{L_\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\psi}"/> is star-free. As <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> has <img alt="{\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\ell}"/> quantifiers, then by assumption <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/> is star-free regular. </p>
<p>
Note that <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/> has one more row than <img alt="{L_\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\psi}"/> because it has one more free variable. Without loss of generality we may suppose it is the bottom row. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> The Tricky Point </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
Since we have an existential quantifier we might think we can simply delete the last row of <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/>. But here is a counterexample to show why we must be careful not to “lose information”:</p>
<p>
Let <img alt="{\alpha=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha=}"/> </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/logic-and-star-free-part-deux/alphastackedexp/" rel="attachment wp-att-16875"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16875" height="56" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/alphastackedexp.jpg?w=600&amp;h=56" width="600"/></a></p>
<p>
and <img alt="{\alpha'=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%27%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha'=}"/> </p>

<p>
Notice that <img alt="{\alpha'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha'}"/> equals <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha}"/> with its final row removed. We have <img alt="{L_\alpha=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Calpha%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\alpha=}"/></p>

<p>
and <img alt="{L_{\alpha'}=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7B%5Calpha%27%7D%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{\alpha'}=}"/></p>

<p/><p><br/>
Then <img alt="{L_\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\alpha}"/> is the language of strings with at least three zeroes in a row and <img alt="{L_{\alpha'}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7B%5Calpha%27%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{\alpha'}}"/> is the language of strings with at least two zeroes in a row.</p>
<p>
We cannot add a second row consisting of zeroes and one 1 to each word <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> in <img alt="{L_\alpha'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Calpha%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\alpha'}"/> to force <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> to be in <img alt="{L_\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\alpha}"/>. For a trivial example, consider the word <img alt="{w=}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w=}"/></p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/03/29/logic-and-star-free-part-deux/w00/" rel="attachment wp-att-16881"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16881" height="36" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/w00.jpg?w=75&amp;h=36" width="75"/></a></p>
<p/><p/>
<p>
The fault can be interpreted as <img alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha}"/> not being recoverable uniquely from <img alt="{\alpha'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha'}"/> owing to a loss of information. We could also pin the fault in this case on the central <img alt="{\cap}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccap%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cap}"/>, noting that <img alt="{(\exists u)(f(u) \wedge g(u))}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cexists+u%29%28f%28u%29+%5Cwedge+g%28u%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\exists u)(f(u) \wedge g(u))}"/> is generally not equivalent to <img alt="{(\exists u)f(u) \wedge (\exists u)g(u)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cexists+u%29f%28u%29+%5Cwedge+%28%5Cexists+u%29g%28u%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\exists u)f(u) \wedge (\exists u)g(u)}"/>. </p>
<p>
Either way, this means we must be careful with how we express (the final row of) <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/>. The idea is to give <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/> in segments such that the final row of each segment is all-zero or a single <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, so that the act of removing the final row could be inverted. This is the crux of the proof. To handle it we employ the unique DFA for the regular expression already obtained by induction for <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/>. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Main Part of the Proof </h2><p/>

By the Myhill-Nerode Theorem, there must exist a unique minimal automaton <img alt="{M_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M_\phi}"/> over the alphabet of our stacked words defining the language <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/> of <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. </p>

</a><p><a name="expansion"/> What remains is to find <img alt="{\mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{SF}}"/> expressions for <img alt="{L_{s,p_e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e}}"/> and <img alt="{L_{r_e,F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Br_e%2CF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{r_e,F}}"/> for each <img alt="{e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{e}"/>. The latter is easy: Pick any string <img alt="{y_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y_e}"/> in <img alt="{L_{s,p_e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e}}"/>.

<p>The closure of <img alt="{\mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{SF}}"/> under left quotients supplies expressions <img alt="{\beta_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta_e}"/> for <img alt="{L_{r_e,F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Br_e%2CF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{r_e,F}}"/>. </p>
<p>
The case of <img alt="{L_{s,p_e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e}}"/>, however, is harder. What we would like to do is choose some (any) string <img alt="{w_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w_e}"/> that goes from <img alt="{r_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_e}"/> to an accepting state and claim that <img alt="{L_{s,p_e} = L(M)/c_e w_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D+%3D+L%28M%29%2Fc_e+w_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e} = L(M)/c_e w_e}"/>. The problem is that <img alt="{w_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w_e}"/> might be accepted from some state <img alt="{r_d \neq r_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_d+%5Cneq+r_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_d \neq r_e}"/> that has an incoming arc on the same character <img alt="{c_d = c_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_d+%3D+c_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_d = c_e}"/> from some other state <img alt="{p_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_d}"/>. Then <img alt="{L_{s,p_d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_d}}"/>, which is disjoint from <img alt="{L_{s,p_e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e}}"/>, is included also in <img alt="{L(M)/c_e w_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28M%29%2Fc_e+w_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L(M)/c_e w_e}"/>. There may, however, be strings <img alt="{y_d \in L_{s,p_d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_d+%5Cin+L_%7Bs%2Cp_d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y_d \in L_{s,p_d}}"/> and <img alt="{w'_e \in L_{r_e,F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27_e+%5Cin+L_%7Br_e%2CF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'_e \in L_{r_e,F}}"/> such that <img alt="{y = y_d c_e w'_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By+%3D+y_d+c_e+w%27_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y = y_d c_e w'_e}"/> is <b>not</b> accepted by <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>. Then the string <img alt="{y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{y}"/> would be wrongly included if we substituted <img alt="{L(M)/c_e z_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28M%29%2Fc_e+z_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L(M)/c_e z_e}"/> for <img alt="{L_{s,p_e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e}}"/> (or for <img alt="{L_{s,p_e} \cup L_{s,p_d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D+%5Ccup+L_%7Bs%2Cp_d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e} \cup L_{s,p_d}}"/>) in (1). </p>
<p>
There is also a second issue when crossing edges on the same character <img alt="{c_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_e}"/> come in from distinct states <img alt="{p_d,p_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_d%2Cp_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_d,p_e}"/> to the same state <img alt="{r_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_e}"/>. To fix all this, we need to use sets of strings that distinguish <img alt="{p_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_e}"/> from all the other states <img alt="{p_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_d}"/>. This requires the most particular use of the minimality of <img alt="{M}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{M}"/>: If <img alt="{p_d \neq p_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_d+%5Cneq+p_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_d \neq p_e}"/>, then there is either (or both):</p>
<ul>
<li>
a string <img alt="{z_{e,d}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_%7Be%2Cd%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z_{e,d}}"/> in <img alt="{L_{p_e,F} - L_{p_d,F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bp_e%2CF%7D+-+L_%7Bp_d%2CF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{p_e,F} - L_{p_d,F}}"/>, or <p/>

a string <img alt="{z_{d,e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz_%7Bd%2Ce%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z_{d,e}}"/> in <img alt="{L_{p_d,F} - L_{p_e,F}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bp_d%2CF%7D+-+L_%7Bp_e%2CF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{p_d,F} - L_{p_e,F}}"/>.

<p>
The strings in question need not begin with a character in <img alt="{C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C}"/>—they need not cross right away.

<p>
Either way, the closure of <img alt="{\mathsf{SF}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BSF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{SF}}"/> under right quotients yields a star-free expression <img alt="{\alpha_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_e}"/> for <img alt="{L_{s,p_e}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%7Bs%2Cp_e%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_{s,p_e}}"/>. Then we just have to plug our expressions <img alt="{\alpha_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_e}"/> and <img alt="{\beta_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta_e}"/> into (1) to get a star-free expression <img alt="{\beta_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta_\phi}"/> for <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/>.

<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Form <img alt="{\beta'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%27%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta'}"/> by knocking out the last entry in every character occurring in <img alt="{\beta_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta_\phi}"/>.

</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
To prove this final statement, first suppose <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> is a stacked word in <img alt="{L_\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\psi}"/>. Then <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> satisfies <img alt="{(\exists u)\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cexists+u%29%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\exists u)\phi}"/>, so there is a value <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> so that <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> satisfies <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> with <img alt="{u}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u}"/> set equal to the value <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>. This means that the stacked word <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> formed from <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> and a last row with <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> in position <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> belongs to <img alt="{L_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L_\phi}"/> and hence matches <img alt="{\beta_\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta_\phi}"/>. Since <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> is obtained by knocking out the last row of <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/>, <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> matches <img alt="{\beta'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta'}"/>. </p>
<p>
The converse is the part where the tricky point we noted at the outset could trip us up. Suppose <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> matches <img alt="{\beta'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta'}"/>. From the form of (1) as a union of terms <img alt="{\alpha_e c_e \beta_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_e+c_e+%5Cbeta_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_e c_e \beta_e}"/>, we can trace how <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> is matched to identify a place in <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> that matches a “middle character” <img alt="{c'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c'}"/> obtained from a <img alt="{c_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c_e}"/> in a crossing edge. Putting a <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> in a new row underneath this place and <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>s elsewhere hence makes a word <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> that matches the unique regular expression <img alt="{\beta''}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%27%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta''}"/> obtained by appending a <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> component to every “middle character” <img alt="{c'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c'}"/> and a <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> to all other characters in <img alt="{\beta'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta'}"/>. Then <img alt="{\beta''}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%27%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta''}"/> is equivalent to <img alt="{\beta}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\beta}"/>, so <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> satisfies <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. Since the last row that was added to <img alt="{w}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w}"/> amounts to supplying a value <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> for the variable <img alt="{u_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u_j}"/>, it follows that <img alt="{w'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w'}"/> satisfies <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> with <img alt="{u_j = k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu_j+%3D+k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{u_j = k}"/>, hence satisfies <img alt="{\psi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi}"/>. This yields <img alt="{L(\beta') = L_{\psi}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28%5Cbeta%27%29+%3D+L_%7B%5Cpsi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{L(\beta') = L_{\psi}}"/> and so the entire induction goes through. <img alt="\Box" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\Box"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
First, as an end note, the end of the proof wound up different from what we envisioned until polishing this post. It originally applied the distinct-states argument to states <img alt="{r_d,r_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br_d%2Cr_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{r_d,r_e}"/> on the far side of the crossing, but we had to backtrack on having previously thought that the “second issue” did not matter. Two other questions we pose for our readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do the definitions of <img alt="{Z_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Z_e}"/> and <img alt="{Z'_e}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%27_e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Z'_e}"/> need to extend over all states <img alt="{p \in Q_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%5Cin+Q_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p \in Q_1}"/>, not just the other states <img alt="{p_d}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_d}"/> on the border? <p/>
</li><li>
Is <img alt="{\alpha_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_0}"/> needed in (2), or in the proof overall?
</li></ul>
<p>
A larger question concerns how the size of the translated expressions increases as we add more quantifiers. We discuss the blowup in terms of quantifier depth <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> and length <img alt="{n=|x|}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%7Cx%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n=|x|}"/>. Let <img alt="{\psi_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_0}"/> be a first-order formula with no quantifiers and let <img alt="{\psi_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_m}"/> denote <img alt="{\psi_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_0}"/> with <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> quantifiers applied to it. Also let <img alt="{\alpha_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_m}"/> be a star-free translation of <img alt="{\psi_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpsi_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\psi_m}"/> and the length of <img alt="{\alpha_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_0}"/>, denoted by len<img alt="{(\alpha_0)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Calpha_0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\alpha_0)}"/>, equal <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. </p>
<p>
To obtain <img alt="{\alpha_{1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_%7B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_{1}}"/> from <img alt="{\alpha_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_0}"/> we represent <img alt="{\alpha_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha_0}"/> by a union over crossing edges between <img alt="{Q_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_1}"/> and <img alt="{Q_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q_2}"/> and the final states of <img alt="{Q}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Q}"/> of the concatenation of prefix and suffix languages and a crossing character between them. We have that <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> gives a decent approximation for—worst-case—length of the prefix languages, suffix languages and the product of crossing edges and final states. Using these approximations we have <img alt="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_1)\approx(2n+1)(n)\approx n^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathit%7Blen%7D%28%5Calpha_1%29%5Capprox%282n%2B1%29%28n%29%5Capprox+n%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_1)\approx(2n+1)(n)\approx n^2}"/>. Iterating gives <img alt="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_2)\approx(2\mathit{len}(\alpha_1)+1)\mathit{len}(\alpha_1)\approx n^4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathit%7Blen%7D%28%5Calpha_2%29%5Capprox%282%5Cmathit%7Blen%7D%28%5Calpha_1%29%2B1%29%5Cmathit%7Blen%7D%28%5Calpha_1%29%5Capprox+n%5E4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_2)\approx(2\mathit{len}(\alpha_1)+1)\mathit{len}(\alpha_1)\approx n^4}"/>, <img alt="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_3)\approx n^8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathit%7Blen%7D%28%5Calpha_3%29%5Capprox+n%5E8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_3)\approx n^8}"/>, and in general, <img alt="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_m)\approx ({n^{2^m}})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathit%7Blen%7D%28%5Calpha_m%29%5Capprox+%28%7Bn%5E%7B2%5Em%7D%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathit{len}(\alpha_m)\approx ({n^{2^m}})}"/>. This says that our blowup could be doubly exponential. Is there a tighter estimate?</p>
<p>
Our final question is: how well do our “stacked words” help to visualize the proof? Are they helpful for framing proofs of equivalences between language classes and logics that are higher up?</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>By virtue of being one or two weeks ahead of the rest of the Western world, Italy has been giving advance notices to other countries about what to expect in the covid19 epidemic. For this reason, friends from other countries have been frequently asking me some questions, whose answers I would like to share.</p>
<p><span id="more-4346"/></p>
<p><b>Will lockdowns work in countries that are not big on rules-following?</b></p>
<p>Apparently, yes. The number of confirmed cases is not a very reliable signal of what is happening, because it is tied as much to the testing capacity as to the actual diffusion of the infection, while the number of deaths is a more informative one (although read below about some issues with how this number is reported). Schools were closed 34 days ago in Lombardy, which went on lockdown 21 days ago, and all of Italy went on lockdown 19 days ago. For the last several days there has been a slowing down in the number of reported deaths, and daily numbers have been decreasing for the last two days. This is a graph updated today of the cumulative number of deaths:</p>
<p><img alt="italy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4349" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/italy.png?w=584"/><br/>
(Data from Protezione Civile, chart by me)</p>
<p><b>How does this compare to other places?</b></p>
<p>This graph shows cumulative number of deaths in NYC and in Lombardy, which have a similar population, shifting the NYC data by 17 days:</p>
<p><img alt="lombardy-nyc" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4350" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/lombardy-nyc.png?w=584"/><br/>
(Data from Protezione Civile and NYT, chart by me)</p>
<p>In Lombardy, schools were closed on February 24 (along with universities, museums, cinemas and several other places) and the lockdown started on March 8; in the shifted timeline, the New York lockdown started on March 3, so one should hope for an earlier slowdown and that NYC will do a lot better than Lombardy.</p>
<p><b>But how bad would things be without restrictive measures?</b></p>
<p>Some smaller towns in Lombardy, where the virus might have circulated for several weeks before the lockdown, have had substantial increases in all-cause deaths. These go from 4x the usual number over the last three months to 7x the usual number during the first three weeks of March. These excess deaths are more than the number of reported covid19 deaths from such towns, and this should be taken into account when looking at reported mortality in Lombardy. Already, the excess deaths in these small towns account for about 0.7% of the population, suggesting that worst-case scenarios of 2 million deaths in the US and of half a million in the UK without mitigation/containment measures made sense.</p>
<p><b>What’s it like after three weeks of lockdown?</b></p>
<p>The mood in the country seems to be shifting: after all  the singing from the balconies, and the baking of cakes, and the practicing of yoga and the posting on Instagram of all of the above, the mood is souring a bit. Unions and employers are at odds on when to reopen factories and many families are living on their savings and wondering how long they can manage to do so. People whose work relates to tourism and hospitality (which accounts for a  very large fraction of the country’s GDP) are wondering not just when  they will be able to reopen their business or return to their job, but if they will be able to do so.</p>
<p>Because of the way the Euro works, Italy cannot just decide to embark on a massive stimulus program. This is because each state’s budget deficit “creates” Euros, and so there is a common policy in the “Eurozone” that limits each state deficit-spending. While this is being negotiated, the Italian government has committed to 25 billions of extra spending, and there is already a big scramble to lobby for who and how should get various parts of this stimulus program.</p>
<p><b>What will it be like after the lockdown is lifted?</b></p>
<p>I am worried that there is no official plan for that. </p>
<p>I hope that there are lots of competent experts working in secret on a plan that takes the best of the contact-tracing and isolation strategies of Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, injects in it the strong tradition of privacy laws that (little known fact) Italy pioneered in Europe even before the GDPR, and creates a wonderfully functioning system.</p>
<p>Hey, once you are hoping, you may as well hope big!</p>
<p><b>What are good sources for predictions of future scenarios?</b></p>
<p>Memes! It has been mind-bending how yesterday’s satire becomes tomorrow’s news.</p>
<p>For example, this meme started circulating on March 14, in which Johnson says “because of the coronavirus, we should prepare to lose some of our loved ones,” to which the queen replies “I am sorry for you and your family.” Johnson tested positive two weeks later.</p>
<p><img alt="fullsizeoutput_18d8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4351" src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/fullsizeoutput_18d8.jpeg?w=584"/></p>
<p>On March 15, the Pope visited a church in (a deserted) central Rome, where there is a crucifix that, according to tradition, survived unscathed a fire in 1519 and, in 1522, was taken around the city and stopped an epidemic of bubonic plague. The pope prayed for the end of the covid19 epidemic.</p>
<p>On March 24, Lercio, the Italian equivalent of The Onion, published an article titled <a href="https://www.lercio.it/forse-non-ha-capito-bene-papa-francesco-chiede-di-nuovo-a-dio-di-fermare-lepidemia/">“‘Maybe He didn’t hear me the first time’: Pope Francis asks God again to stop the epidemic”</a>.</p>
<p>Sure enough, on March 27 the Pope prayed again for the end of the epidemic, alone in a deserted Saint Peter square.</p>

<p>The images of the pope walking alone at dusk toward the stage on which he prayed were something no disaster movie had prepared us for. Of course people were able to see the humor in that as well.</p>

<p><b>Edited to add:</b> On March 13, The Onion published an article titled <a href="https://www.theonion.com/health-experts-worry-coronavirus-will-overwhelm-america-1842314132">Health Experts Worry Coronavirus Will Overwhelm America’s GoFundMe System</a>. On March 26, The New York Times published an article titled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/style/gofundme-coronavirus.html">GoFundMe Confronts Coronavirus Demand</a>.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-041 |  A Polynomial Degree Bound on Defining Equations of Non-rigid Matrices and  Small Linear Circuits | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Ben Lee Volk</title>
    <summary>We show that there is a defining equation of degree at most poly(n) for the (Zariski closure of the) set of the non-rigid matrices: that is, we show that for every large enough field $\mathbb{F}$, there is a non-zero $n^2$-variate polynomial $P \in \mathbb{F}(x_{1, 1}, \ldots, x_{n, n})$ of degree at most poly(n) such that  every matrix $M$ which can be written as a sum of a matrix of rank at most $n/100$ and sparsity at most $n^2/100$ satisfies $P(M) = 0$. This  confirms a conjecture of Gesmundo, Hauenstein, Ikenmeyer and Landsberg [GHIL16] and improves the best upper bound known for this problem down from $\exp(n^2)$ [KLPS14, GHIL16] to $poly(n)$. 

We also show a similar polynomial degree bound for the (Zariski closure of the) set of all matrices $M$ such that the linear transformation represented by $M$ can be computed by an algebraic circuit with at most  $n^2/200$ edges (without any restriction on the depth). As far as we are aware, no such bound was known prior to this work when the depth of the circuits is unbounded. 

Our methods are elementary and short and rely on a polynomial map of Shpilka and Volkovich [SV15] to construct low degree ``universal'' maps for non-rigid matrices and small linear circuits. Combining this construction with a simple dimension counting argument to show that any such polynomial map has a low degree annihilating polynomial completes the proof.</summary>

<p>A small memory: In 1970 there was a strike in Israelis’ high schools and I took a few classes at the university. One of these classes was Game theory and it was taught by <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/?s=Michael+Maschler">Michael Maschler</a>. (I also took that trimester a course on art taught by Ziva <span class="st"><span dir="ltr">Meisels</span></span>.) Our department at HUJI is very strong in game theory, but once all the “professional” game theorists retired, I gave twice a game theory course which I enjoyed a lot and it was well accepted by students. In term of the number of registered students, it seems that this year’s course at IDC is quite popular and I hope it will be successful.</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: We establish a constructive version of Shannon’s noisy coding theorem for binary codes, with information rate converging near-optimally fast to channel capacity as a function of code length. Specifically, let <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="W"/> be an arbitrary binary-input memoryless symmetric channel with Shannon capacity <img alt="I(W)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28W%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="I(W)"/>, and fix any <img alt="\delta &gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3E0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\delta &gt;0"/>. We construct, for any sufficiently small <img alt="\varepsilon &gt;0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarepsilon+%3E0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\varepsilon &gt;0"/>, binary linear codes of block length <img alt="O(1/\varepsilon^{2+\delta})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%2F%5Cvarepsilon%5E%7B2%2B%5Cdelta%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(1/\varepsilon^{2+\delta})"/> and rate <img alt="I(W)-\varepsilon" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I%28W%29-%5Cvarepsilon&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="I(W)-\varepsilon"/> that enable reliable communication on <img alt="W" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="W"/> with quasi-linear time encoding and decoding. Shannon’s theorem implies the existence of such codes (without efficient constructions or decoding) with block length <img alt="O(1/\varepsilon^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%2F%5Cvarepsilon%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(1/\varepsilon^2)"/>. This quadratic dependence on the gap epsilon to capacity is known to be best possible. Previously such a construction was only known for the case of the erasure channel.</p>
<p>Our codes are a variant of Arıkan’s polar codes based on multiple carefully constructed local kernels, one for each intermediate channel that arises in the decoding. A key technical ingredient in the analysis is a strong converse to the noisy coding theorem that shows extreme unpredictability of even a single message bit when communicating via random linear codes at rates slightly above capacity.</p>

<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i5UN1hxg7RI/Xn9uVPL8h1I/AAAAAAABygU/5THjPemeT9UhN3yQenJkO_3cM_c2Awi5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Thomas.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-i5UN1hxg7RI/Xn9uVPL8h1I/AAAAAAABygU/5THjPemeT9UhN3yQenJkO_3cM_c2Awi5QCLcBGAsYHQ/s200/Thomas.jpg" width="133"/></a></div>
Graph Theorist and Georgia Tech Math Professor Robin Thomas passed away Thursday after his long battle with ALS. He was one of the giants of the field and a rare double winner of the Fulkerson Prize, for the six-color case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger_conjecture_(graph_theory)">Hadwiger Conjecture</a> and the proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_perfect_graph_theorem">strong perfect graph theorem</a>.<br/>
<br/>
If you start with a graph G and either delete some vertices or merge vertices connected by an edge, you get a minor of G. The Hadwiger conjecture asks whether every graph that is not (k+1)-colorable graph has a clique of size k as a minor. Neil Robertson, Paul Seymour and Thomas proved the k=6 case in 1993 and still the k&gt;6 cases remain open.<br/>
<br/>
A graph is perfect if its maximum clique size is equal to its chromatic number. In 2002 Maria Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas showed that a graph G is not perfect if and only if either G or the complement of G has an induced odd cycle of length greater than 3.<br/>
<br/>
Robin Thomas was already confined to a wheelchair when I arrived at Georgia Tech in 2012. He was incredibly inspiring as he continued to teach and lead the Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization PhD program until quite recently. Our department <a href="https://youtu.be/e4FdY9eiWDs">did the ALS challenge</a> for him. In 2016 he <a href="https://provost.gatech.edu/updates/thomas-earns-top-faculty-honor">received</a> the Class of 1934 Distinguished Professor Award, the highest honor for a professor at Georgia Tech.  He'll be terribly missed.</div>

    <summary>The approximate graph colouring problem concerns colouring a $k$-colourable
  graph with $c$ colours, where $c\geq k$. This problem naturally generalises
  to promise graph homomorphism and further to promise constraint satisfaction
  problems. Complexity analysis of all these problems is notoriously difficult.
  In this paper, we introduce two new techniques to analyse the complexity of
  promise CSPs: one is based on topology and the other on adjunction. We apply
  these techniques, together with the previously introduced algebraic approach,
  to obtain new NP-hardness results for a significant class of approximate
  graph colouring and promise graph homomorphism problems.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The new coronavirus upended much of society, including our little corner of it. I believe at this point almost all theorists are teaching and doing research at home, and I thought it would be good to share some of the tools we use for doing so. Below I will describe my setup, but I hope other people share theirs too.</p>



<h2>Teaching and virtual whiteboards</h2>



<p>I am teaching using Zoom and using an iPad pro with a pencil to simulate a whiteboard. I use a laptop to connect to Zoom and for the camera, laptop, and chat window, and then join the iPad.There are several ways to connect an iPad to a Zoom session:</p>



<ol><li>Join the session from the iPad separately using the iPad Zoom app. (To do so you <em>might</em> need to logout of your other account.)</li><li>Within the Zoom program on your computer you can choose “share screen” and then one of the option is to join an iPad connected to the same wireless network as the laptop/desktop and use “screen mirroring” on the iPad. (You can find the screen mirroring option on the iPad by swiping from the top right corner in a diagonal motion.)</li><li>Another variant of this is to use a third party app such as <a href="https://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector">Reflector 3</a>. Reflector 3 sets up an airplay server on your PC so you can mirror the iPad screen to it. You can then share the Reflector 3 window from Zoom (see screen shorts below). If you do use Reflector 3, you can remove its annoying iPad like frame.</li><li>You can use a wired connection, which is either by just connecting through USB (in a Mac) or a complex combination of combining an adapter to take an HDMI signal out of an iPad with an HDMI capture card to stream this signal to the computer.</li></ol>



<p>I use either option 2 or 3. (Might have used 4 if I had a Mac.) The main reason I prefer these to option 1 is because the application I use for a whiteboard –  <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">GoodNotes</a> – has a <a href="https://support.goodnotes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001100576-How-to-use-Presentation-Mode">presentation mode</a> that behaves differently when you are connected to an external display or use AirPlay (which is what options 2 and 3 do). In this presentation mode the students don’t see your interface, and so you can Zoom, go to the page selector and more without it disturbing what they see. GoodNotes also has a great “laser pointer”. I set the pages at a landscape orientation,  and pre-write a good chunk of what I plan to present before the lecture. I also use the ability to “duplicate pages” to achieve the PowerPoint like effect of gradual reveal.</p>



<p>It is not perfect – I’ve discovered that the screen share sometimes stops refreshing and I need to leave GoodNotes and return to it for it to go back (this seems to works better in Reflector 3 so far for me).</p>



<p>Monitoring the chat window and raised hands in Zoom is non-trivial. It helps a lot that I have a teaching assistant that participates in lecture and notices if I missed something. </p>



<p>Some people say that a “matte screen protector” such as <a href="https://paperlike.com/">PaperLike</a> makes the iPad more comfortable to write on – haven’t yet tried it. (Update 4/1/2020: I now tried PaperLike and can vouch for it – it greatly improves my handwriting! shipping from the UK did take some time though.)</p>



<p>I have a good Webcam (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-BRIO-Conferencing-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01N5UOYC4">Logitech Brio</a>) but at the moment I’m not using it since it seems too taxing on my laptop and so I went back to the native webcam. I have a very nice wireless headset/mic combo (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Bluetooth-Headphones-Including-Packaging/dp/B072JWYJMC">Jabra Evolve 75</a>) that I am constantly using and have been very happy with. I particularly like the feature of being able to unmute and mute yourself by raising and lowering the mike. </p>

<h2>Research</h2>



<p>For research Slack continues to extremely useful. For working jointly on a paper <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf </a> is of course great, but for maintaining a shared document it sometimes useful to use simpler platform that are not full fledged LaTeX. Some options include:</p>

<h2>Keeping children busy</h2>



<p>For many people I imagine childcare is one of the most challenging aspects. At the moment at least the Cambridge Public Schools are not keeping my kids too busy. While probably most of their time is spent in non educational pursuits, we try to also encourage (i.e., bribe/extort/threaten/beg) them to do some learning. If your kids are interested in math, I highly recommend the courses offered by the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">Art of Problem Solving</a> (they also have a theory connection: one of their books was co-authored by theorist Ravi Boppana). For younger kids you can also try their <a href="https://beastacademy.com/">Beast Academy</a>.</p>



<p>The AOPS program is not free but over the years my kids (especially my 13 year old daughter Alma) have also spent a lot of time on the free and amazing <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>. In fact, last year she was inspired enough by Khan’s JavaScript course to write the following poem which (for obvious reasons)  moved me very much:</p>



<p>Tending / Alma Barak</p>



<p>My mind is a desert<br/>of boredom<br/>of blankness<br/>of leaning-back-in-your-chairness<br/>and of simply-staring-at-the-ceilingness<br/>I kick at a crumpled<br/>deserted baby-blonde post-it<br/>with my spotted socked feet<br/>waiting for Aba to come.</p>



<p>We dive when he comes<br/>into the seas of Khan<br/>free-styling our way<br/>into the lakes of Java<br/>we pass codes we already<br/>knew<br/>while loops<br/>for loops<br/>arrays<br/>reminding me of what I’d learned</p>



<p>We frog-kick to an<br/>uncharted<br/>unfamiliar<br/>lagoon of code I don’t know<br/>sometimes I get swept away by currents<br/>of confusion<br/>but my aba, my dad<br/>grabs my hand<br/>and shows me the way through<br/>teaching me<br/>tending to me<br/>washing away the sands of boredom with the sea of Khan.</p>

    <title>TR20-039 |  Lower bounds on the sum of 25th-powers of univariates lead to complete derandomization of PIT | 

	Pranjal Dutta, 

	Nitin Saxena, 

	Thomas Thierauf</title>
    <summary>We consider the univariate polynomial $f_d:=(x+1)^d$ when represented as a sum of constant-powers of univariate polynomials. We define a natural measure for the model, the support-union, and conjecture that it is $\Omega(d)$ for $f_d$. 

We show a stunning connection of the conjecture to the two main problems in algebraic complexity: Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) and VP vs VNP. Our conjecture on $f_d$ implies blackbox-PIT in P. Assuming the  Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), it also implies VP $\neq$ VNP. No such connection to PIT, from lower bounds on constant-powers representation of polynomials was known before. We establish that studying the expression of $(x+1)^d$, as the sum of $25^{th}$-powers of univariates, suffices to solve the two major open questions.   

In support, we show that our conjecture holds over the integer ring of any number field. We also establish a connection with the well-studied notion of matrix rigidity.</summary>
