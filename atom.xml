<h3><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kazhdan’s seminar: Computation, quantization, symplectic geometry, and information.</span></strong></h3>
<p>In the fall of 2019 Aharonov, Kalai, Kindler and Polterovich intend to run a new<br/>
one semester course (as a Kazhdan seminar) attempting to connect questions about noise and complexity in quantum computation, with ideas and methods about “classical-quantum correspondence”.that are well studied in symplectic geometry. The course will be<br/>
highly research-oriented, and will attempt to teach the basics in both areas, and define and clarify the interesting research questions related to the connections between these areas, with the hope that this will lead to interesting insights.</p>
<p>The course is oriented to grad students (and faculty), with reasonable background in mathematics, and with interest in the connections between mathematical and computational aspects of quantum mechanics. Students who attend it will be awarded two N”Z after passing an exam. The goal of the course is to initiate and lead to new connections between the seemingly unrelated areas of quantum computation and symplectic geometry.</p>
<p>The topics will include:</p>
<p>– Introduction to quantum computation, quantum universality, quantum algorithms<br/>
and quantum computational complexity classes such as BQP and Quantum NP (QMA)</p>
<p>– quantum measurement and quantum noise explained using the standard quantum computational model.</p>
<p>– questions about quantum error correction and quantum noise – fault tolerance,<br/>
quantum error correcting codes, and the breakdown of robustness when the locality of<br/>
the noise does not hold.</p>
<p>– quantum measurement/quantum information (noise and speed limit) having classical counterparts, studied from the symplectic geometry perspective.</p>
<p>– Konsevich theorem and quantization,</p>
<p>– towards a the semi classical approximation of quantum computers.</p>
<p>Examples of questions we would like to initiate research on are:</p>
<p>1) what would be a semi classical model of quantum computation, and what would be<br/>
its computational power?</p>
<p>2) what is a good notion of complexity in a symplextic geometry computational model?</p>
<p>3) What can we learn from basic symplectic geometry results (such as non squeezing)<br/>
about the limitations on quantum computation in the semi classical limit?</p>
<p>4) Can noise in quantum computation be related in any way with the semi classical limit<br/>
of quantum computing systems?</p>
<p>5) can we learn anything about the possible noise models in quantum computers,<br/>
using our knowledge from symplectic geometry?</p>
<p>Hope to see you in the course!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Mathematics of Quantum Computation -The 4th Advanced School in Computer Science and Engineering</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 15-19 December 2019, we will be organizing a math-oriented quantum computation school in the IIAS at the Hebrew university. No prior knowledge on quantum will be assumed.  The school will introduce TCS and math students and faculty, who are interested in the more mathematical side of the area, to the beautiful and fascinating mathematical open questions in quantum computation, starting from scratch. We hope to reach a point where participants gain initial tools and basic perspective to start working in this area.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we will have several mini-courses, each of two or three hours, about central topics in the area.   These will include quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, quantum supremacy, delegation and verification, interactive proofs, cryptography, and Hamiltonian complexity. We will emphasize concepts, open questions, and links to mathematics. We will have daily TA sessions with hands-on exercises, to allow for a serious process of learning.</p>
<p>There will be two rounds of registration. The first deadline is 23rd of August. If there is room, there will be another deadline sometime in October; please follow <a href="http://ias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4">this page</a> for further announcements.</p>
<p>Hope to see you this coming December!</p></div>

$O(1)$ crossings suffice in a crossing-minimal drawing without restrictions on

graphs that allow for representations satisfying certain local geometric or
topological constraints on their edge crossings. Beside the study of a specific
graph class for its maximum edge density, another parameter that is often
considered in the literature is the size of the largest complete or complete
bipartite graph belonging to it.
</p>
<p>Overcoming the limitations of standard combinatorial arguments, we present a
technique to systematically generate all non-isomorphic topological
representations of complete and complete bipartite graphs, taking into account
the constraints of the specific class. As a proof of concept, we apply our
technique to various beyond-planarity classes and achieve new tight bounds for
the aforementioned parameter.

    <title>Small Cuts and Connectivity Certificates: A Fault Tolerant Approach</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Parter:Merav.html">Merav Parter</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03022">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We revisit classical connectivity problems in the CONGEST model of
distributed computing. By using techniques from fault tolerant network design,
we show improved constructions, some of which are even "local" (i.e., with
$\widetilde{O}(1)$ rounds) for problems that are closely related to hard global
problems (i.e., with a lower bound of $\Omega(Diam+\sqrt{n})$ rounds).
</p>
<p>Our main results are:
</p>
<p>(1) For $D$-diameter unweighted graphs with constant edge connectivity, we
show an exact distributed deterministic computation of the minimum cut in
$poly(D)$ rounds. This resolves one the open problems recently raised in Daga,
Henzinger, Nanongkai and Saranurak, STOC'19.
</p>
<p>(2) For $D$-diameter unweighted graphs, we present a deterministic algorithm
that computes of all edge connectivities up to constant in $poly(D)\cdot
2^{O(\sqrt{\log n\log\log n})}$ rounds.
</p>
<p>(3) Computation of sparse $\lambda$ connectivity certificates in
$\widetilde{O}(\lambda)$ rounds. Previous constructions where known only for
$\lambda \leq 3$ and required $O(D)$ rounds. This resolves the problem raised
by Dori PODC'18.

accessibility/strong accessibility index are obtained, which can be computed
easier. In each approach, the entire set of accessibility/strong accessibility

with Index Modulation (OFDM-IM) while preserving polynomial time and space
computational complexities. Enabling \emph{all OFDM-IM waveforms} maximizes the
spectral efficiency (SE) gain over the classic OFDM but, as far as we know, the
computational overhead of the resulting mapper remains conjectured as
prohibitive across the OFDM-IM literature. For an $N$-subcarrier symbol, we
show that OFDM-IM needs a $\Theta(2^N/\sqrt{N})$-entry LUT to ensure that any
sequence of $N/2+\lfloor \log_2{N\choose N/2}\rfloor$ bits can be mapped in the
same asymptotic time of the classic OFDM mapper i.e., $O(N)$. We demonstrate
this trade-off between SE and computational complexity can be improved if one
stores $\Theta(N^2)$ binomial coefficients (the so-called Pascal's triangle)
instead of the classic LUT. With this, we show the OFDM-IM mapper can achieve
its maximal SE in the same time complexity of the OFDM's mapper under
polynomial (rather than exponential) space resources.

    <title>Obstacles to improving Classical Factoring Algorithms</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Samuel Wagstaff's excellent book The Joy of Factoring (see <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~fgreen/SIGACTReviews/bookrev/47-2.pdf">here</a> for a review) there is a discussion towards the end about why factoring algorithms have not made much progress recently. I<br/>
paraphrase it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The time complexities of the fastest known algorithms can be expressed as a formula of the following form (where N is the number to be factored):<br/>
<br/>
(*)                      exp(c(ln N)^t (ln(ln N))^{1-t})<br/>
<br/>
for some constants c and for 0 &lt; t &lt; 1.  For the Quadratic Sieve (QS) and Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) t=1/2. For the Number Field Sieve (NFS) t=1/3. The reason for this shape for the time complexity is the requirement of finding one or more smooth numbers (numbers that have only small primes as factors).<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This got me thinking: Okay, there may not be a drastic improvement anytime soon but what about just improving t? Is there a mathematical reason<br/>
why an algorithm with (say) t=1/4 has not been discovered? In an earlier era I would have had to write a letter to Dr. Wagstaff to ask him. Buy an envelope, buy a  stamp, find his address, the whole nine yards (my younger readers should ask their grandparents what envelopes and stamps were). In the current era I emailed him. And got a response.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Samuel Wagstaff:<br/>
<br/>
The fastest known factoring algorithms find smooth numbers subject to parameter choice(s).  In all these algorithms, one parameter choice is the smoothness bound B:  a number is smooth if all its prime factors are &lt; B. The NFS has the degree of a polynomial as an additional parameter.<br/>
<br/>
One analyzes the complexity of these algorithms by estimating the total work required (to find enough smooth numbers) for an arbitrary parameter choice using Dickman's function to predict the density of smooth numbers.  Then one uses calculus to find the parameter choice(s) that minimize the total work function.  Calculus also yields the optimal values for the parameter(s).<br/>
<br/>
If you have k parameters to choose, you will get the time complexity (*) with t = 1/(1+k).  If you have no parameters (k = 0),you get (*) with t = 1, basically exponential time N^c.  With one parameter to optimize, as in CFRAC  (continued fractions algorithm) and QS, you get t = 1/2.  NFS has two parameters, so t = 1/3. ECM also has t = 1/2 because it uses only one parameter, the smoothness bound B. If you want to get t = 1/4, you have to find a third parameter to optimize.  No one has found one yet. That is the answer to your question.<br/>
<br/>
Note that some choices made in some factoring algorithms don't count as parameters.  For example, the number of polynomials used in the multiple-polynomial quadratic sieve, and the upper bound on large primes kept, don't affect t.  They affect the running time only in making c smaller.  So you have to find a third parameter that matters in order to get (*) with t = 1/4.  Or find three completely different new parameters.<br/>
<br/>

    <title>Report from WADS</title>
    <summary>I’m in Edmonton, Canada for WADS, which just finished, and CCCG, which is just about to begin.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m in Edmonton, Canada for <a href="http://wads.org/">WADS</a>, which just finished, and <a href="http://cccg.ca/">CCCG</a>, which is just about to begin.</p>

<p>The three invited talks at WADS were by Rasmus Pagh, Bob Tarjan, and me. Pagh spoke on methods for representing sets of elements by concise sketches so that the size of intersections or unions of the sets could be rapidly and accurately estimated. A famous method for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash">MinHash</a>, in which one represents a set by the  elements with the smallest values of some hash function; the size of the overlap in representations is then an accurate estimator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard similarity</a> of pairs of sets. New to me were -bit variations of MinHash, in which you can get almost as accurate a representation in much less space by mapping each element of the MinHash set to  by another hash function. This works well when the Jaccard similarity is bounded away from both  and , and Pagh spoke about some recent research he and others had done on finding even more accurate methods when it is near  or near .</p>

<p>Tarjan spoke about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06177">parallel algorithms for connected components in graphs</a>, an old area but one in which apparently there have been frequent published mistakes. He presented a modular analysis of the algorithms in this area according to some basic operations they perform (hooking together roots of trees on components, propagating that root information downwards through the trees, flattening the trees to make the information propagate more quickly, and the like) and showed that simple combinations of these operations lead to new, simple, efficient and more importantly provably-correct algorithms.</p>

<p>My talk, “Graphs in Nature”, was about finding graph-theoretic characterizations of surface-embedded graphs arising in natural processes, and using those characterizations to find algorithms to reconstruct synthetic geometric structures of the same type from their graphs. I also gave roughly the same talk a month earlier, at the Symposium on Geometry Processing in Milan. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-WADS-19.pdf">I’ve put my talk slides online</a> in case anyone else is interested.</p>

<p>The best paper award went to Hüseyin Acan, Sankardeep Chakraborty, Seungbum Jo and Srinivasa Rao Satti for their paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09228">Succinct Data Structures for Families of Interval Graphs</a>”. I can’t tell you much about the talk because, unfortunately, I missed it. I didn’t know it was the best paper until the business meeting that evening, so I went to the other parallel session instead.</p>

<p>I think the contributed talk from Tuesday that most stood out to me was Bryce Sandlund’s, on offline dynamic graph algorithms. This is a type of problem <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jagm.1994.1033">I worked on long ago for minimum spanning trees</a> in which you get as input a whole sequence of edge insertions and deletions in a graph, and must produce as output the sequence of changes to the solution to whatever you’re trying to solve. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24766-9_40">Bryce’s new paper with Peng and Sleator</a> solves similar problems for higher-order graph connectivity. The main idea is to hierarchically decompose the update sequence into intervals, and then represent the non-dynamic part of the graph within each interval by a smaller equivalent replacement graph whose size is proportional to the interval length. At the end of his talk, Bryce hinted that he could also solve incremental problems (where the updates are given one at a time rather than all in advance, but are only insertions) using similar methods in a forthcoming paper.</p>

<p>I was inspired by Caleb Levy’s talk on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree">splay trees</a> (in which he showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06309">inserting elements in either the preorder or postorder of another binary search tree takes linear time</a>) to ask the following question: we know either by time-reversing the tree rotation operations or from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_of_binary_search_trees">geometric model of dynamic search trees</a> that any given access sequence should have the same optimal cost as its reverse. So from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_binary_search_tree">dynamic optimality conjecture</a> it should also be true that (up to constant factors) splay trees have the same performance on the reverse of any access sequence as they do on the unreversed sequence. Can this be proven?</p>

<p>From the business meeting, we learned that attendance and paper submissions were down by around 15% from the previous WADS. The acceptance rate is roughly the same, just under 50%. I suspect the smaller size is because the location is not as appealing, but it turns out to be a perfectly pleasant place to have a conference: the weather in Edmonton is pleasant this time of year (except for the thunderstorm), and there are abundant restaurants, good coffee shops, and lodging within walking distance of the conference center. WADS alternates with SWAT, which next year will be in the Faroe Islands. And then WADS 2021 (and CCCG 2021) will be in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which is both more touristy than Edmonton and easier to reach from the east coast and Europe. So I suspect the numbers will improve again.</p>

<p>WADS is moving towards a more democratically elected steering committee formed from some combination of past PC chairs and at-large elections. They have already started implementing the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">SafeTOC recommendations</a> for combatting harassment and discrimination in theory conferences. And in a show of hands at the business meeting, the attendees were strongly in favor of moving towards double blind peer review for submissions. The conference is not really open access, though (its proceedings are published by Springer LNCS with special issues in Springer’s <em>Algorithmica</em> and Elsevier’s <em>Computational Geometry</em>) and there seems to be little pressure for that to change any time soon.</p>

<p>On to CCCG!</p>

<p>
James Randi is a magician who has challenged paranormal claims of all kinds.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to make a suggestion to those who claim they have proved P=NP.</p>
<p>
No the claim to have a proof that P=NP is not a paranormal claim. But such claims are related to Randi—or the Amazing Randi as he is called. We talked about him before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/02/23/an-amazing-result/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Randi once helped run a contest to see who could find gold with their dowsing rod. He explained why he doubted one contestant: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If they really could find gold, why were they dressed so poorly, and why were they so interested in winning the prize? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I have the same question about those who claim that they have a proof that P=NP. Usually the proof is constructive and I agree with Randi:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If they really could solve P=NP, why <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
You get the idea.</p>
<p>
Ken adds the obvious remark that if a foreign power or intelligence agency discovered P=NP, or factoring in P, they would still keep the lean-and-hungry look. But they are not the kind we are addressing here.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Coding Helps </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Let’s look at a claims that P=NP is resolved. Yes, such a result is unlikely—many would say impossible. But we do get claims like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The following <img alt="{\cal H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal H}"/> is known to be a NP-complete problem; the following <img alt="{\cal E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal E}"/> is known to be a polynomial time problem. I can reduce <img alt="{\cal H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal H}"/> to <img alt="{\cal E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal E}"/> in polynomial time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Usually the reduction is the reason their proof fails. Their claims about <img alt="{\cal H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal H}"/> and <img alt="{\cal E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal E}"/> are usually correct, since they are in the literature. </p>
<p>
The reduction is often complicated, often poorly defined, often defined by example. Giving a precise definition for the reduction is critical. This is the reason we suggest the following: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Write the reduction down in code.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even better, write it as a program in a real language such as Python. </p>
<p>
There are two advantages in doing this. </p>
<ul>
<li>
Writing it as a program in a real language will likely force one to define it precisely. <p/>
</li><li>
Writing it down will also allow one to run the program on examples.
</li></ul>
<p>
The later point is the key point. Even trying your method on tiny examples is useful. Even better if you can say the following we might read the proof: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>I have tried my code on the following public set of difficult SAT problems. The code solved all in less than three minutes each.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This claim would greatly improve the likelihood that people might take your claims seriously. That your code worked correctly, forgetting the running time, would improve confidence. Greatly. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Animal Farm View<img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken worries that some NP-complete problems are more equal than others. That is some problems, even though they are NP-complete may require reductions that blow up when encoding SAT. </p>
<p>
We wrote about this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/the-travelling-salesmans-power/">before</a> regarding the “Power Index” idea of Richard Stearns and Harry Hunt III. In their <a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~res/powerindex.pdf">paper</a> they gave evidence that the reductions from SAT <em>to</em> many familiar NP-complete problems <em>must</em> expand the size of instances quadratically, insofar as those problems have <em>power index</em> <img alt="{0.5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.5}"/>. This was based on their “SAT Hypothesis” which anticipated current forms of the Exponential Time Hypothesis, which we have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">discussed</a>.</p>
<p>
Ken ponders a related issue. Even problems with power index <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> run into the success of practical solvers. This means: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Anyone citing algorithmic success as evidence toward a claim of P=NP must compete with the real-world success of algorithms that do not represent claims of P=NP. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/practically-pnp/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/rankings-versus-ratings/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/07/10/the-world-turned-upside-down/">discussed</a> the practical success of SAT-solvers on myriad real-world instances. </p>
<p>
This situation has become real in the argument over achieving quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy">supremacy</a>. One who claims that quantum is superior to classic must worry that that classical algorithms can improve without making P=NP. A headline example from last year was when Ewin Tang—as a high-school senior—<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04271">found</a> a classical way to remove a plausible quantum advantage in a matrix-completion problem that <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/teenager-finds-classical-alternative-to-quantum-recommendation-algorithm-20180731/">underlies</a> recommender systems.  There are many “industrial strength” examples in this argument—see this May 2019 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613507/the-new-benchmark-quantum-computers-must-beat-to-achieve-quantum-supremacy/">story</a> for a start.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> But… </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken’s insightful comments aside, the key point is still: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Coding up your claimed algorithm for that NP-complete problem will still enhance belief.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This will happen even if the algorithm only succeeds on tiny examples. Indeed, if you cannot do this then I suggest that you will have an impossible time getting anyone to listen.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
How useful is this advice for the vast majority of us who are <em>not</em> claiming P=NP or the opposite?</p>

    <title>TR19-101 |  Streaming Verification of Graph Computations via Graph Structure | 

	Amit Chakrabarti, 

	Prantar Ghosh</title>
    <summary>We give new algorithms in the annotated data streaming setting---also known as verifiable data stream computation---for certain graph problems. This setting is meant to model outsourced computation, where a space-bounded verifier limited to sequential data access seeks to overcome its computational limitations by engaging a powerful prover, without needing to trust the prover. As is well established, several problems that admit no sublinear-space algorithms under traditional streaming do allow protocols using a sublinear amount of prover/verifier communication and sublinear-space verification.  We give algorithms for many well-studied graph problems including triangle counting, its generalization to subgraph counting, maximum matching, problems about the existence (or not) of short paths, finding the shortest path between two vertices, and testing for an independent set. While some of these problems have been studied before, our results achieve new tradeoffs between space and communication costs that were hitherto unknown. In particular, two of our results disprove explicit conjectures of Thaler (ICALP, 2016) by giving triangle counting and maximum matching algorithms for $n$-vertex graphs, using $o(n)$ space and $o(n^2)$ communication.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Perhaps conferences made sense fifty years ago. We did not have internet, and the pollution was not as bad. Today, we can have effective virtual meetings, while the pollution has reached a level of crisis, see this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_school_strike_for_climate_save_the_world_by_changing_the_rules/transcript?language=en">moving talk by Greta_Thunberg</a>. Moving to a system of virtual conferences is I believe a duty of every scientist. Doing so will cut the significant air travel emissions that come from shipping scientists across the world. To attend a climate summit in the USofA, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/07/29/gretha-thunberg-will-sail-across-the-atlantic-to-attend-un-climate-conferences/#27e93f87c3b2">Greta will sail across the Atlantic ocean on a zero emission boat</a><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_school_strike_for_climate_save_the_world_by_changing_the_rules/transcript?language=en">.</a></p>
<p>We can keep everything the way it is, but simply give the talks online. This change doesn’t involve anybody higher up in the political ladder. It only involves us, the program chairs, the steering committees.</p>
<p>While we wait for that, we can begin by virtualizing the physical STOC/FOCS PC meetings,<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/stocfocs-pc-meetings-does-nature-of-decisions-justify-cost/"> whose added value over a virtual meeting, if any, does not justify the cost</a>; and by holding conferences where the center of mass is, instead of exotic places where one can combine the trip with a vacation at the expense of tax payers’ money and everybody’s health. And that is also why I put a bid to hold the 2021 Conference on Computational Complexity in Boston.</p>
<p>NSF panels, making decisions worth millions, routinely have virtual panelists (I was the last few times). So why do we insist on shipping scientists across the globe multiple times a year to give 15-minute talks which to most people are less useful than spending 20 minutes reading the paper on the arxiv?</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> </p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/avi-book-cover.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17611" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/avi-book-cover.png?w=640"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The cover of Avi Wigderson’s book “Mathematics and computation” as was first exposed to the public in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zxctNw-mA3hOT1tktE_dYjnmvOzZmC_A/view">Avi’s Knuth Prize videotaped lecture</a>. (I had trouble with 3 of the words: What is EGDE L WONK 0?  what is GCAAG?GTAACTC ?  TACGTTC ?  I only figured out the first.)</span></p>
<p>Avi Wigderson’s book  “<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book">Mathematics and computation, a theory revolutionizing technology and science</a>” is about to be published by Princeton University Press. The link is to a free copy of the book which will always be available on Avi’s homepage. (See also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/must-read-book-by-avi-wigderson/">this re-blogged post here</a> of Boaz Barak.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One main theme of the book is the rich connection between the theory of computing and other areas (in fact, most areas) of mathematics. See also this self contained survey (based on Chapter 13 of the book) by Avi <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09780">Interactions of Computational Complexity Theory and Mathematics,</a> which in 27 pages overviews relations to number theory, Geometry, Operator Theory, Metric Geometry, Group Theory, Statistical Physics, Analysis and Probability, Lattice Theory and Invariant Theory. Of course, Avi himself is among the main heroes in finding many paths between mathematics and the theory of computing over the last four decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Another theme of the book and of several talks by Avi is that the theory of computing has revolutionary connections with many fields of science and technology. Again, this theme is present in the entire book and is emphasized in Chapter 20, which also appeared as a self contained paper  “<a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/Wigderson2018.pdf">On the nature of the Theory of Computation (ToC).</a>”  Let me quote one sentence from Avi’s book that I propose for discussion. (For the complete quote see the end of the post.)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The intrinsic study of computation transcends human-made artifacts, and its expanding connections and interactions with all sciences, integrating computational modeling, algorithms,  and complexity into theories of nature and society, marks a new scientific revolution!</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, <span style="color: #000000;">similar ideas were also expressed by several other prominent scientists, and let me mention Bernard Chazelle’s essay: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/algorithm.html">The Algorithm: Idiom of Modern Science</a>. (Feel free to give further examples and links in the comment section.)</span></p>
<h3>Let’s discuss:  Integrating computational modeling, algorithms,  and complexity into theories of nature, marks a new scientific revolution!</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I propose to discuss in the comment section the idea that the theory of computing offers a scientific revolution. Very nice cases to examine are the computational study of randomness and connections to statistics, connections with economy and connections with biology. Comments on the relations between the theory of computation and other areas of mathematics are also very welcome.</span></p>

<h3>The full quote of Avi:</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>The Theory of Computation is as revolutionary, fundamental and beautiful as major theories of mathematics, physics, biology, economics… that are regularly hailed as such. Its impact has been similarly staggering. The mysteries still baffling ToC are as challenging as those left open in other fields. And quite uniquely, the theory of computation is central to most other sciences. In creating the theoretical foundations of computing systems ToC has already played, and continues to play a major part in one of the greatest scientific and technological revolutions in human history. But the intrinsic study of computation transcends man-made artifacts. ToC has already established itself as an important mathematical discipline, with growing connections to nearly all mathematical areas. And its expanding connections and interactions with all sciences, naturally integrating computational modeling, algorithms and complexity into theories of nature and society, marks the beginning of another scientific revolution!</em></p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We saw quite an activity last month, with a total of 9 papers on property testing or related areas.</p>



<p>Let’s start with a paper on PCPs:<br/><strong>Revisiting Alphabet Reduction in Dinur’s PCP</strong>, by Venkatesan Guruswami, Jakub Opršal, and Sai Sandeep  (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/092/">ECCC</a>). As mentioned in the title, this work provides an alternate proof of one of the two parts of the Dinur’s PCP theorem proof. In that proof, the argument goes by alternating two main steps: (i) amplifying the soundness gap, at the price of increasing the alphabet size (and the instance size); (ii) reducing the alphabet size, at the price of increasing the  instance size. From the observation that step (i) creates some structure in the instances that can be leveraged, the authors provide an alternative construction for (ii), leading to an arguably simpler analysis of the soundness of the underlying test. A nice throwback to some of the roots of property testing.</p>



<p>Then, four papers on distribution testing:<br/><strong>Testing Mixtures of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Ravi Kumar, Ronitt Rubinfeld (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03190">arXiv</a>). One of the most studied problems in distribution testing is <em>identity testing</em> (a.k.a., goodness-of-fit): given a reference distribution \(q\) over a domain of size \(n\) and i.i.d. samples from an unknown \(p\), decide between \(p=q\) and \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &gt; \varepsilon\). While this is now well-understood and can be done with a strongly sublinear number of samples (namely, \(\sqrt{n})\)), the case of <em>tolerant</em> testing is much sadder: Valiant and Valiant proved that \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) samples were required for distinguishing \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &lt; \varepsilon/2\) from \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &gt; \varepsilon\). So, noise-tolerance is almost as hard as it gets… <em>except</em>, as this works suggests and studies, if one has some guarantees on the noise! What if the noise in the completeness case was just that \(q\) is perturbed by some (known, or available via samples as well) noise coming from a second distribution \(\eta\)? I.e., the question is now to test whether \(p\) if of the form \(\alpha q + (1-\alpha) \eta\) for some \(\alpha\in [0,1]\), or if it is \(\varepsilon\)-far from all mixtures of \(q\) and \(\eta\). The authors have various results on this question and some extensions, but the upshot is: “with structured noise, strongly sublinear sample complexity is once again possible.”<br/><strong><br/>Can Distributed Uniformity Testing Be Local?</strong>, by Uri Meir, Dor Mintzer, and Rotem Oshman (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3331613">ACM PODC Proceedings</a>). More on identity testing, specifically uniformity testing. No noise here, but another constraint: the samples are distributed. There are \(k\) players, each holding \(q\) i.i.d. samples from a distribution \(p\) over \([n]\); each can send \(\ell=1\) bit to a central referee, in a non-interactive fashion. Is \(p\) the uniform distribution, or is it \(\varepsilon\)-far from it? The authors here consider the case where \(k,n,\varepsilon\) are fixed, and prove lower bounds on the number \(q=q(k,n,\varepsilon)\) of samples each player must hold in order to perform this uniformity testing task. (Note: their lower bounds hold even in the public-randomness setting.) Motivated by the LOCAL model, they focus on 3 cases of interest, for which they obtain tight or near-tight bounds on \(q\) (in view of upper bounds from previous work of a subset of the authors): (1)  when the referee’s decision has to be the \(\textsf{AND}\) of all \(n\) bits she receives; (2) when the referee can do something more involved, and use a threshold function; and (3) when the referee can use an arbitrary function of those \(n\) messages. Underlying those lower bounds is a neat application of Boolean Fourier analysis, recasting the analysis of the standard “Paninski” lower bound instance and the player’s decision functions as a question on Boolean functions.<br/><br/><strong>Domain Compression and its Application to Randomness-Optimal  Distributed Goodness-of-Fit</strong>, by Jayadev Acharya, Clément Canonne, Yanjun Han, Ziteng Sun, and Himanshu Tyagi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08743">arXiv</a>,<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/098/">ECCC</a>). Remember the paper just above? Now, focus on the case (3), where the referee can use any function of the message, allow each player to send \(\ell\) bits instead of one, but give only one sample (instead of \(q\)) to each player. This becomes a setting we have talked about before on this blog (specifically, with three papers on <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=990">these</a> <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1030">three</a> <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1075">months</a>). Those three papers established the optimal number of player \(k\), in terms of  the domain size \(n\), the distance parameter \(\varepsilon\), and the number of bits per player \(\ell\), in both the private-coin and public-coin settings. This new work interpolates between those two extremes, and gives the tight answer to the general question: if there are \( 0\leq s \leq \log n\) bits of public randomness available, what is the optimal number of players to perform identity testing? Behind the upper bounds is a new notion of (randomness-efficient) <em>domain compression</em> they introduce: how to reduce the domain size of the probability distributions while preserving the \(\ell_1\) distances between them as much as possible?<br/><br/><strong>Towards Testing Monotonicity of Distributions Over General Posets</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Themis Gouleakis, John Peebles, Ronitt Rubinfeld, and Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03182">arXiv</a>). Away from identity testing, let’s now consider another central question, testing <em>monotonicity</em> of distributions. Specifically, a distribution \(p\) over a given poset \((\mathcal{X}, \prec)\) is said to be monotone if \(p(x) \leq p(y)\) whenever \(x\prec y\). While the question is fully understood for the familiar case of the line \(\mathcal{X} = \{1,2,\dots,n\}\), the case of general posets is much murkier, and more or less uncharted. This paper initiates a general study of the question, improving on previously known bounds for the matching poset and Boolean hypercube, and providing several new results and techniques for the general case, to establish both upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity.</p>



<p>And now… graphs!<br/><strong>Expansion Testing using Quantum Fast-Forwarding and Seed Sets</strong>, by Simon Apers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02369">arXiv</a>). This paper is concerned with (bicriteria) testing of vertex expansion of a given graph \(G=(V,E)\) in the bounded-degree graph model. Loosely speaking, given a value \(\Phi\) and query access <em>(i.e., sampling a node u.a.r., querying the degree of a node, and querying the \(i\)-th neighbor of a node) </em>to a graph \(G\) with maximum degree \(d=\Theta(1)\), the goal is to distinguish between (i) \(G\) has vertex expansion at most \(\Phi\) and (ii) \(G\) is \(\varepsilon\)-far from any \(G’\) with vertex expansion at most \(\Phi^2\) <em>(simplifying and dropping some technicalities)</em>. The previous state-of-the-art was a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/2}/\Phi^2)\) query complexity for classical algorithms, and a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(\min(n^{1/3}/\Phi^2),n^{1/2}/\Phi^2))\) query complexity upper bound for quantum testers. The current work improves on this by providing a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/3}/\Phi)\) quantum tester. Graphs expand—and so does the gap between classical and quantum testing.<br/><br/><strong>Walking Randomly, Massively, and Efficiently</strong>, by Jakub Łącki, Slobodan Mitrović, Krzysztof Onak, and Piotr Sankowski  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05391">arXiv</a>). One very useful primitive, in many graph property testing results and of course well beyond property testing, is the ability to perform random walks on graphs. In the case of large, distributed (or merely impractically massive) graphs, however, it is not clear how to implement this primitive efficiently. This work addresses this question in the MPC (Massive Parallel Computation) model, and shows how to perform independently, from all of the \(n\) nodes of a graph (i.e., machine), an \(\ell\)-length random walk with only \(O(\log \ell)\) rounds of communication and \(O(n^\alpha)\) space per machine, for any constant \(\alpha \in(0,1)\). This round complexity matches a known (conditional) lower bound, and thus the result is as good as it gets — further, the authors obtain such MPC algorithms for both undirected and directed graph, somehow leveraging the latter case to handle the (significantly more complicated) directed case. As an application of this efficient random walk primitive, they provide MPC property testing algorithms for both bipartiteness and vertex expansion<em> (same definition as in the paper above: vertex expansion \(\Phi\) vs. \(\varepsilon\)-far from any \(G’\) with vertex expansion \(\Phi^2\))</em> in the general graph model. (Beyond property testing, another application—the main one in the paper— is computing PageRank in both graphs and directed graphs.)<br/><strong><br/>A Lower Bound on Cycle-Finding in Sparse Digraphs</strong>, by Xi Chen, Tim Randolph, Rocco Servedio, and Timothy Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12106">arXiv</a>). In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of one-sided testing of acyclicity of directed graphs, in the bounded-degree graph model (equivalently, on the task of finding a cycle in a digraph promised to be far from acyclic). Previously, an \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) lower bound for this task had been shown by Bender and Ron, based on a birthday-paradox-type argument; this work improves on this hardness result, showing that \(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{5/9})\) queries are necessary. Interestingly, whether achieving any \(o(n)\) query complexity is possible remains open.<br/><br/><strong>Constant-Time Dynamic \((\Delta+1)\)-Coloring and Weight Approximation for  Minimum Spanning Forest: Dynamic Algorithms Meet Property Testing</strong>, by Monika Henzinger and Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04745">arXiv</a>). Finally, the last paper covered this month is concerned with <em>dynamic graph algorithms</em>: where updates to a graph (which can be both edge additions <em>and</em> deletions) come sequentially, and the objective is to maintain, e.g., a coloring, or an approximation of some function of the graph, at any time using as little time per update. This paper advocates the use of techniques from property testing <em>(loosely speaking, as their locality and query-efficiency translates to fast update times)</em> to design better dynamic graph algorithms. It illustrates this idea by obtaining several new results, in particular an (amortized) \(O(1)\)-update-time randomized algorithm to maintain a \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring in a graph with degree bound \(\Delta\). The algorithm relies on a random ranking of the nodes which, combined with a suitable randomized update rule for recoloring a vertex when needed, ensure that the recolorings will not (with high probability) “propagate” to much. This is the first time that this idea, previously used in several testing and sublinear-time papers, is used in the context of dynamic graph algorithms—adding an edge between the two areas, hopefully only the first of many.<br/></p>

Alexander Hamilton was a framer of the U.S. Constitution. He wrote the bulk of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">Federalist Papers</a> (FP) defending the Constitution. Today he is best known for the playbill—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)">musical</a> on his life—and the bill, the US ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we would discuss the U.S. electoral college (EC).<br/>
<span id="more-16133"/></p>
<p>
We are in the midst of the run-up to next year’s President election. An on-going discussion is the issue of the EC. Should it be modified? Should it be replaced? Is it a good idea? </p>
<p>
So let’s recall how the EC works. Then we will look at it from a theory viewpoint. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The College </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The electoral college is how every four years we elect the President of the United States. It is not a direct popular vote. The Constitution created it as a compromise between a direct popular vote and a vote by the members of Congress. Back then, the framers of the Constitution, including Hamilton, did not trust the electorate. Hence, the rationale for the EC.</p>
<p>
Today the EC consists of 538 electors. Voters in each state pick electors, who then vote in EC for the President. Thus by high math, 270 electors are required to win. A state gets one electoral vote for each member in the House of Representatives plus two. The latter rule ensures that no state gets too few votes. It is some times called the “two-plus rule”.</p>
<p>
The arguments for the EC are distilled in FP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68">No. 68</a>. Although the collaboration/authorship status of numerous FP remains unclear, Hamilton’s claim in his last testament to sole authorship of FP 68 is not seriously disputed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68">Quoting</a> Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Entitled “The Mode of Electing the President”, No. 68 describes a perspective on the process of selecting the Chief Executive of the United States. In writing this essay, the author sought to convince the people of New York of the merits of the proposed Constitution. Number 68 is the second in a series of 11 essays discussing the powers and limitations of the Executive branch and the only one to describe the method of selecting the president. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Opponents today argue against the EC. They point out that it allows one to win without getting the most votes. This has happened in two of the last five elections, in 2000 and 2016. The EC rewards uneven allocations of campaigning to the few “swing-states”. It also gives voters in less populated states more voting power. A vote from Wyoming has over three times the influence on the EC tally as a vote from California. The battle over FP 68 has even been <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/hamilton-68">internationalized</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> My College </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Years ago. Decades ago. Eons ago. When I was in college, I almost flunked a required one-credit course in my senior year. The course was on issues of the election that year of the President. No it did not involve Hamilton. </p>
<p>
The grade of the course was based on a term paper. Mine, which got a <img alt="{\cal D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal D}"/>, was based on an argument for the EC. Thankfully, the grade was just enough to get me a pass in the course, and allow me to graduate. I did not take the course seriously—my attendance was spotty, at best.</p>
<p>
My idea was that there was an argument for the EC based on a connection with the ability to manage elections. My central thesis was: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The ability to accurately predict the outcome of a Presidential election is inherently undesirable</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Let’s agree that we will call this the <i>Prediction Assumption</i> (PA). Predicting the outcome of elections may not be a good idea. If predictions could be accurate, then one could argue that this would allow candidates to manipulate the election. I think you could make the case that this could be a problem. Candidates would be able to manage their opinions to optimize their chances of winning the election. </p>
<p>
In any event I then proved a result that showed that given PA, one could argue that the EC was better than a popular election. Note, the usual math arguments against the EC are based on the power of individual voters. See <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01616.pdf?ver=2019-02-12-215230-620">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-funky-math-of-the-electoral-college/">here</a> for some of their insights.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> My College Paper </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The central point of my paper was informally this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem:</b> <em> Prediction of an election using EC is more difficult than one using the popular vote. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
A simple example should help. Imagine an election with three states: Northeast, West, and South. Let them each have one electoral vote. Clearly <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> are needed to win. Suppose the states are arranged like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Northeast: Almost all for A; <p/>
</li><li>
West: Almost all for B; <p/>
</li><li>
South: Close between A and B.
</li></ul>
<p>
Then prediction requires the polling to be able to tell the outcome of the South vote. The point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The smaller the number of voters in the ensemble being predicted, the more uncertain the prediction. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Ken argues that simply having a multiplicity of component elections—one in each state plus DC—also increases the uncertainty. This may happen technically just because the result is a kind of average over unequal-sized averages. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Their Papers </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Modern results in Boolean function theory actually have studied the noise sensitivity of the EC. They have studied how errors in voting can flip an election. Look at Gil Kalai’s 2010 <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/CHAOS.pdf">paper</a>, “Noise Sensitivity And Chaos In Social Choice Theory.” He shows that majority is more stable in the presence of noise than the EC. Look at Ryan O’Donnell’s <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/analysis-survey.pdf">paper</a>, “Some Topics in Analysis of Boolean Functions.” He shows a related point that errors in EC—in a simple model—can increase the chance that errors flip the election factor of about <img alt="{5.7}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5.7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5.7}"/>.</p>
<p>
Neither paper strikes me as studying whether predictions are easier with the simple majority rule than with the EC.<br/>
I believe that their new results can be used to prove the same type of theorems on prediction. </p>

Did I deserve a better grade than a <img alt="{\cal D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal D}"/>? Or should I have flunked? Should I have published something?</p>
<p>
For comparison, the college term paper which eventually became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">27th Amendment</a> to the Constitution received a better grade: <img alt="{\cal C}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\cal C}"/>. Oh well.</p>

The affine perimeter of a convex curve is an affine-equivariant number in units of length, zero for polygons and larger for smooth curves. And the limit shape of a convex set is what you get by taking a uniformly random convex subset of a grid within the set, in the limit as the grid becomes very fine; it turns out to be the max-affine-perimeter curve contained in the set.</p>

    <title>An interview with Noga Alon</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Update: and here is a great interview of Noga in English and the interviewer is Narkis Alon, Noga’s youngest daughter and Amalya Duek.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Update</strong>: and here is a <a href="http://www.careeryoga.life/440ebcdf?fbclid=IwAR2BWeyMdhTg2fbdHp5U-D9gCy2oqLZBk2ljRBMhjtyAEtSgqBCt7kMlSFk">great interview</a> of Noga in English and the interviewer is Narkis Alon, Noga’s youngest daughter and Amalya Duek.</p>
<p>I was very happy to interview my academic doctoral  twin and long-time friend Noga Alon.  <a href="https://youtu.be/9PhckP9eJhg">The interview</a> is an initiative of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. (This is my second interview of this kind. See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/15/an-interview-with-yisrael-robert-aumann/">here</a> for an interview with Yisrael Aumann.) The interview is in Hebrew. (Update: Automatically-produced  English subtitles are available.)</p>
<p/>
<p>For our English speaking readers here is a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/rwiEiGqgetU">Numberphile video</a> with Noga.</p>
<p>We agreed in advance that most of the interview would be about mathematics, and  most of the time  we courageously (and perhaps somewhat recklessly)  tried to explain to a large audience  (starting from scratch) some of Noga’s research directions and results. We hope that people will enjoy the beauty of it even with the missing details and background.</p>
<h3>Noga’s parents, family and childhood</h3>
<p>In the first part of the  interview  Noga talked about his family, his parents, Dror and Hemda, his great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Allon">Yigal Alon</a>, his early childhood, and his early interest in mathematics. Noga liked to solve mathematical riddles from a young age. One reason Noga was drawn to mathematics is that unlike other topics, in mathematics there are absolute truths, and a mathematical proof (when such exists)  is perhaps the only way you can settle a debate. Noga gave an amusing example from his youth regarding the Eurovision song context. Then he mentioned the <a href="https://www.reali.org.il/en/%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%94-%d7%a9%d7%a0%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%a8%d7%99%d7%90%d7%9c%d7%99/">Hebrew Reali school in Haifa</a>, a mathematics teacher there, Yaakov Kaplan,  newly immigrated from the former Soviet Union, who greatly influenced Noga. Noga also talked about his participation in the Israeli Mathematical Olympiad where the two of us first met 45 years ago.  Next, the two of us met during our military service, and in parallel to his service, Noga finished his M. Sc. and Ph. D with Micha A. Perles, who was also my supervisor.</p>
<h3>An hour of mathematics</h3>
<p>The mathematical part of the video starts with Noga’s  overview of combinatorics. Then we moved to specific topics.</p>
<p>(22:40- 33:30) Noga’s negative solution to Shannon’s conjecture about the capacity of two graphs (and a little about Claude Shannon and information theory)</p>
<p>(33:30- 40:25) The combinatorial nullstellensatz and the polynomial method and a little about the game SET</p>
<p>(40:25 – 46:50) The probabilistic method and a little on the history of probability and about Paul Erdos.</p>
<p>(46:50-  54:50)  Streaming algorithms, a topic introduced by Noga Alon, Yossi Matias, and Mario Szegedy, and more generally, about positive and negative results in computer science, and their practical applications.</p>
<p>(54:50 – 59:25)    Expander graphs and “spectroscopy of graphs”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17717" height="326" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png?w=640&amp;h=326" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>59:25  -1:05:40 Ramsey theory</p>
<p>1:05:40-1:12:20 Factoring integers with quantum computers and with classical methods</p>
<p>1:12:00-1:20:00 Combinatorics, economics and game theory:  Noga’s theorem that large committees require a large budget!</p>
<h3>Going back from mathematics to life itself</h3>
<p>After a full hour of mathematics, we returned to life itself. Memories from our years as postdocs at MIT, and our 1993 conference in Jerusalem. Noga talked a little about women in science and in society, about his three daughters, about  the possibility that science, like sport,  can bridge different groups and different peoples, and about politics and prospects for better relations with our Arab neighbors and Iran (Noga is somewhat optimistic and so am I),  prospects about getting old (we are hopeful about it), and advice to young researchers. Noga’s message at the end was that there are many paths to mathematical research and he encouraged young people that like mathematics to follow and enjoy them.</p>

    <title>TR19-100 |  Nonnegative rank measures and monotone algebraic branching programs | 

	Hervé Fournier, 

	Guillaume Malod, 

	Maud Szusterman, 

	Sébastien Tavenas</title>
    <summary>Inspired by Nisan's characterization of noncommutative complexity (Nisan 1991), we study different notions of nonnegative rank, associated complexity measures and their link with monotone computations. In particular we answer negatively an open question of Nisan asking whether nonnegative rank characterizes monotone noncommutative complexity for algebraic branching programs. We also prove a rather tight lower bound for the computation of elementary symmetric polynomials by algebraic branching programs in the monotone setting or, equivalently, in the homogeneous syntactically multilinear setting.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>For those who haven’t yet seen it, Erica Klarreich has a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/">wonderful article in </a><em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/">Quanta</a></em> on Hao Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture.  <em>This</em> is how good popular writing about math can be.</p>



<p>Klarreich quotes my line from this blog, “I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.”  However, even if God doesn’t know a simpler proof, that of course doesn’t rule out the possibility that <strong>Don Knuth</strong> does!  And indeed, a couple days ago Knuth posted <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/huang.pdf">his own variant of Huang’s proof</a> on his homepage—in Knuth’s words, fleshing out the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813084">argument</a> that Shalev Ben-David previously posted on this blog—and then left a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1815290">comment</a> about it here, the first comment by Knuth that I know about on this blog or any other blog.  I’m honored—although as for whether the variants that avoid the Cauchy Interlacing Theorem are actually “simpler,” I guess I’ll leave that between Huang, Ben-David, Knuth, and God.</p>



<p>In <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, Samuel Greengard has a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238339-the-algorithm-that-changed-quantum-machine-learning/fulltext?mobile=false">good, detailed article</a> on Ewin Tang and her dequantization of the quantum recommendation systems algorithm.  One warning (with thanks to commenter Ted): the sentence “The only known provable separation theorem between quantum and classical is sqrt(<em>n</em>) vs. <em>n</em>” is mistaken, though it gestures in the direction of a truth.  In the <em>black-box</em> setting, we can rigorously prove all sorts of separations: sqrt(<em>n</em>) vs. <em>n</em> (for Grover search), exponential (for period-finding), and more.  In the non-black-box setting, we can’t prove any such separations at all.</p>



<p>Last week I returned to the US from the <a href="https://fqxi.org/conference/home/2019">FQXi meeting</a> in the Tuscan countryside.  This year’s theme was “Mind Matters: Intelligence and Agency in the Physical World.”  I gave a talk entitled “The Search for Physical Correlates of Consciousness: Lessons from the Failure of Integrated Information Theory” (<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/iitfail.ppt">PowerPoint slides here</a>), which reprised my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799">blog</a> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1823">posts</a> critical of IIT from five years ago.  There were thought-provoking talks by many others who might be known to readers of this blog, including Sean Carroll, David Chalmers, Max Tegmark, Seth Lloyd, Carlo Rovelli, Karl Friston … you can see the full schedule <a href="https://fqxi.org/conference/schedule/2019">here</a>.  Apparently video of the talks is not available yet but will be soon.</p>



<p>Let me close this post by sharing two important new insights about quantum mechanics that emerged from my conversations at the FQXi meeting:</p>



<p>(1) In Hilbert space, no one can hear you scream. Unless, that is, you scream the exact same way everywhere, or unless you split into separate copies, one for each different way of screaming.</p>



<p>(2) It’s true that, as a matter of logic, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a> does not imply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born Rule</a>.  Having said that, if the Schrödinger equation were leading a rally, and the crowd started a chant of “BORN RULE! BORN RULE! BORN RULE!”—the Schrödinger equation would just smile and wait 13 seconds for the chant to die down before continuing.</p></div>

    <title>A zipless polycube</title>
    <summary>My latest arXiv preprint is “Some polycubes have no edge-unzipping” (arXiv:1907.08433, with Erik and Marty Demaine and Joe O’Rourke). It’s about polyhedral unfolding, the problem of cutting a polyhedron along some of its edges into a surface that unfolds into a flat polygon in the plane (a “net”). Although it dates back to the work of Albrecht Dürer, we still don’t know a lot about this problem, in general. We don’t know whether every convex polyhedron has an unfolding, and we don’t know whether every polycube has a folding (allowing cuts in the middle of flat faces as long as they are on boundary edges of the cubes making up the polycube).</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My latest arXiv preprint is “Some polycubes have no edge-unzipping” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08433">arXiv:1907.08433</a>, with Erik and Marty Demaine and Joe O’Rourke). It’s about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)">polyhedral unfolding</a>, the problem of cutting a polyhedron along some of its edges into a surface that unfolds into a flat polygon in the plane (a “net”). Although it dates back to the work of Albrecht Dürer, we still don’t know a lot about this problem, in general. We don’t know whether every convex polyhedron has an unfolding, and we don’t know whether every polycube has a folding (allowing cuts in the middle of flat faces as long as they are on boundary edges of the cubes making up the polycube).</p>

<p>The preprint is about a variation of unfolding in which the cut has to form a path through the graph of vertices and edges. If the polyhedron has the topology of a sphere and there are no flat vertices (with a full  total angle of surrounding faces) then all vertices must be touched by a cut, and it’s the same thing to ask for an unfolding that forms a Hamiltonian path. These zipper-unfoldings have previously been studied, notably in joint work by two parent-child groups, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2010/08/12/more-from-cccg.html">Marty and his son Erik, and Anna Lubiw and her two sons Arlo and Jonah from CCCG 2010</a>. The new preprint shows that they don’t always exist for (topologically spherical) polycubes. In particular, the following shape has no flat vertices, but its graph is bipartite and unbalanced enough that it also has no Hamiltonian path.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A zipless polycube" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/zipless.png"/></p>

<p>It does have an unfolding, though (figure made by Erik using <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/OrigamiSimulator">OrigamiSimulator</a>):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Unfolding a zipless polycube" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/zipless.gif"/></p>

<p>The paper also has a smaller example that’s a little tricker to prove zipless. It’s a small enough advance that we probably won’t bother trying to turn it into a conference or journal paper. (If it were just me, I’d probably have just made a blog post about it. And here we are!)</p>

    <title>TR19-099 |  Nearly Optimal Pseudorandomness From Hardness | 

	Dean Doron, 

	David Zuckerman, 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Justin Oh</title>
    <summary>Existing proofs that deduce $\mathbf{BPP}=\mathbf{P}$ from circuit lower bounds convert randomized algorithms into deterministic algorithms with a large polynomial slowdown. We convert randomized algorithms into deterministic ones with little slowdown. Specifically, assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we convert any randomized algorithm over inputs of length $n$ running in time $t \ge n$ to a deterministic one running in time $t^{2+\alpha}$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\alpha &gt; 0$. Such a slowdown is nearly optimal, as, under complexity-theoretic assumptions, there are problems with an inherent quadratic derandomization slowdown. We also convert any randomized algorithm that errs rarely into a deterministic algorithm having a similar running time (with pre-processing).

Our results follow from a new, nearly optimal, explicit pseudorandom generator fooling circuits of size $s$ with seed length $(1+\alpha)\log s$, under the assumption that there exists a function $f \in \mathbf{E}$ that requires nondeterministic circuits of size at least $2^{(1-\alpha')n}$, where $\alpha = O(\alpha')$. The construction uses, among other ideas, a new connection between pseudoentropy generators and locally list recoverable codes.</summary>

    <title>Turing to be on the Bank of England 50 pound note, giving me an excuse to talk about Turing</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">BILL: Darling, guess who is soon going to be on the Bank of England 50 pound note?<br/>
<br/>
DARLING: Alan Turing. <br/>
<br/>
BILL: How did you deduce that? (She is right, see  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48962557">here</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
DARLING: Since you asked it, it couldn't be a member of the Royal Family (you don't care about that) or some British Politician (you don't care about that either). It had to be a mathematician or computer scientist.<br/>
<br/>
BILL: It could have been Hardy. I wonder if Ramanujan could qualify---do they need to be British? At <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/banknote-characters">this website</a> it says<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Of course, banknotes need to be universally accepted. We therefore look for UK characters who have made an important contribution to our society and culture through their innovation, leadership or values. We do not include fictional characters, or people who are still living (except the monarch on the front of the note). Finally, we need to have a suitable portrait of the person which will be easy to recognise.</i><br/>
<br/>
(They spell <i>recognise</i> with an s instead of a z, so spellcheck flagged it, but I won't change it.) <br/>
<br/>
Note that people on the banknotes have to be <i>UK characters</i>. I honestly don't know if that means they must be citizens.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, so here are a few thoughts on Turing.<br/>
<br/>
1) When I visited Bletchley Park there was a booklet that bragged about the fact that Bletchley Park was much better at cracking codes than Germany because  they allowed people to work there based only on ability (unlike Germany) - women worked there, Turing who was Gay worked there. I think this is simplistic. Did any Jews work there (anti-semitism was widespread in England, and the world, at the time)? I doubt any blacks worked there since if they did that would be well known by now (if I am wrong let me know). Women DID work there but was their work respected and used? (I honestly don't know). Did Germany also use women at their codebreaking centers? Was Turing known to be gay (if not then Bletchley gets no points for tolerating him). Was JUST having Turing the reason they could crack codes. Plus I am sure there were other factors aside from merit-only.<br/>
<br/>
2) Turing was given a Pardon for his ``crimes'' in August 2014. When I see things like this I wonder who was against it and why and if they were an obstacle.<br/>
<br/>
a) Human Rights Advocate Peter Tatchell noted that its wrong to just single out Turing. Other people prosecuted under that law who did not help beat the German's in WW II should also be pardoned. The government later DID such a pardon in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
b) Judge Minister Lord McNally objected to the pardon:<br/>
<br/>
<i>A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.<br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
While I disagree with him, I do note that, based on what he wrote and his general record, I think he is not saying this from being anti-gay.  There is  a hard general question here: how does a society right past wrongs? I think pardoning and apologizing is certainly fine, but frankly it seems to weak. What else could a society due? Financial renumeration to living relatives? I don't think giving Inagh Payne (Turing's niece, who I think is still alive) would really help here.<br/>
<br/>
c) <i>At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage<br/>
</i><br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find Chope's reasons. On the one hand, they may be similar to McNally's. On the other hand he is against same sex marriage so its possible (though I do not know this) that he anti-gay and that is why he is against the pardon. If someone can find what his explanation for blocking the Turing bill is, or other evidence that he is anti-gay, please leave it in the comments.<br/>
<br/>
3) Did the delay matter? I was surprised to find out---Yes. Here is the full passage from Wikipedia:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[175] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[176] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect.[17] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal conviction.[16][18] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[177] The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.[178] Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.[179]</i><br/>
<br/>
This amazed me! I thought the Queen had NO power (too bad--- I wish she could just say NO BREXIT). Or that she formally has power but if she ever used it, it might be blocked somehow and  taken away. So I am surprised she has a power she can use at all.<br/>
<br/>
4) I wonder if the Pardon had to happen before they put him on the Banknote. I have been told that this is a very American Question--- England has no Constitution and operates more on Custom and Tradition than on written rules. <br/>
<br/>
5) I had always assumed that Turing committed suicide. Without going into detail, the Wikipedia site on Turing does give intelligent counterarguments to this. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">here</a><br/></div>

    <title>Any-order puzzle deduction</title>
    <summary>I recently wrote here about a complication in puzzle-solving where, in using deductive rules based on the assumption that the puzzle has a unique solution, the ordering of the rules could make a difference in how far you get in the solution. And avoiding this ordering issue by keeping track of more information than just the state of the partially solved puzzle leads to its own difficulties. It seemed like keeping this information could lose you in a maze of undecidable modal logic. For instance in the map coloring puzzle described in that post, we might record information about a partial solution like “I don’t know that this cell is forced to be red, but it is necessary for it to be red in order to prevent a non-unique solution”, with the complexity of these statements growing as the solution progressed. Instead, what I wanted was a way to make decisions without worrying about the order of deduction while only remembering a finite amount of state for each puzzle cell. In the ensuing discussion, @axiom suggested that the extra information should be the order of deductions. That’s not a constant amount of information per cell, but as we’ll see below it works to simplify this even more and remember only which cells were the initial givens and which were deduced later.</summary>

That’s not a constant amount of information per cell, but as we’ll see below it works to simplify this even more and remember only which cells were the initial givens and which were deduced later.</p>

<p>To clarify the intuition that deduction order should not matter, I want to formalize the state of a partially-solved puzzle as a collection of bits, initially all true. In map coloring, each bit could represent the possibility that a given cell is a particular color, and we want to eventually have one true bit per cell and the rest false. A deduction is a change to a single bit. Each deduction is triggered by a rule, which typically searches for certain patterns in the state. For instance, in map coloring, the pattern that one cell has only one remaining color whose bit is true can trigger the deduction that the same color’s bit in a neighboring cell must be false. Any given deduction could be triggered by more than one rule, or by more than one instance of the same rule. Then these rules and deductions should obey some natural properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The deductions can only go in one direction. If we deduce that a bit is false, we won’t later change it back to true.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The deductions are always valid for the intended puzzle. That is, when a puzzle has a unique solution, we won’t ever deduce anything inconsistent with that solution. (However, when that assumption is violated, anything can happen.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It should be possible to efficiently identify all deductions that can be triggered from the current state. Ideally this should take polynomial time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a deduction is triggered by one of the rules, it remains triggered until that deduction step is performed.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not assuming that the deduction system is complete, i.e., that it will  reach the intended puzzle solution for all puzzles. For most natural puzzle types and most efficiently-searchable sets of deduction rules, it won’t be complete, and most likely (because of NP-completeness or related complexity issues) cannot be both complete and efficiently searchable. But nevertheless, a system of rules obeying these properties always reaches a unique state, independent of deduction order. It is the last of these properties that enforces this order-invariance. By induction on the values in the triggering patterns, each deduction that could be made by some order of deduction steps will eventually be made by a greedy algorithm that chooses deductions in an arbitrary order until it gets stuck.</p>

<p>The “remains triggered until performed” criterion should sound familiar. It is the defining property of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>, a collection of orderings of items (here, orderings of deductions that could be made by the greedy algorithm) with the property that once an item becomes available to be added to an ordering, it remains available until it actually is added. The antimatroid name is a bit technical and off-putting, but these structures come up all the time in many different applications. I’ve written here about

So why not add puzzle deduction to the list?</p>

<p>A nice side-effect of using deduction rules with these properties is that, if the rules are ordered by difficulty, then a greedy algorithm that always chooses the easiest rule at each step will automatically find a deduction sequence minimizing the difficulty of the hardest rule that it uses. This can be helpful in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0507053">using deduction algorithms to automatically estimate the difficulty of a puzzle for a human solver</a>.</p>

<p>A natural way to achieve the “remains triggered until performed” property for a deduction rule is to use a pattern in the form of a monotonic Boolean combination of state bits (a function that can be expressed using only Boolean and and or operations, without negation) and to trigger a deduction when that combination becomes false. In this way, we achieve a stronger property, that once triggered the deduction remains triggered forever (even after it has already been performed). But as we’ll see below, other kinds of rules can also have the same property.</p>

<p>Now back to map coloring.</p>

<p>We saw in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/06/07/little-knowledge-can.html">my earlier post</a> that it doesn’t work well to use rules like “if one cell has already-colored neighbors of two colors, and only one uncolored neighbor, then that neighbor cannot be either of the same two colors”. These rules are valid (under the assumption that the puzzle solution is unique) but lose information about why the deduction on the neighboring vertex was made, preventing later deductions from being made.</p>

<p>Instead, the insight I ended up using involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempe_chain">Kempe chains</a>. A Kempe chain, in a colored map, is a maximal connected subset of the cells of two of the colors. If the coloring is to be unique, every Kempe chain must be anchored by one of the original givens of the puzzle, for otherwise we could swap the two colors in the chain without affecting the rest of the graph. So, I’ve started using rules of the form “if this Kempe chain in the partially colored map is not yet anchored, and can reach an anchor only by extending through this other cell, then that cell cannot be a third color”. Here, the Kempe chains that I examine to trigger this rule are maximal connected subsets of the cells whose colors are limited to some set of two colors, allowing cells that are already known to have only one of those two colors. Until we add the extension cell to the chain, the same rule will continue to be triggered, so this passes the any-order requirements above.</p>

<p>This deduction method also fits well into the visualization tools available for manual puzzle-solving in <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">Simon Tatham’s puzzle collection</a>, where I found the map puzzle. This collection’s implementation of the map puzzle shows the givens and solved cells as solid colors, and allows unsolved cells to be marked by dots of any combination of the four colors. So I’ve been using these dots to indicate the remaining colors available for each cell, in cases when the deductions get complicated enough that I can’t just remember them without marking them. A cell that has dots of only one color rather than a solid color is effectively solved (we know what color it is going to end up being) but might still belong to some unanchored Kempe chains. Once all three Kempe chains through a cell of known color have been anchored, I color that cell as solid. In this way, the parts of the solution that might include unanchored Kempe chains typically remain small and distinctively colored, making the chains easy to spot.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot of the map puzzle from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/map-puzzle-kempe-chain.png"/></p>

<p>The image above shows an example, from one of the hardest built-in difficulty levels of the puzzle (“20x15, 30 regions, Unreasonable”). An orange-brown Kempe chain can be seen in the bottom left, in the two cells colored by orange and brown dots. (Yes, I know these two colors are hard to tell apart; I can’t change them.) Its only escape cell has yellow and brown neighbors, and cannot be green (leaving the orange-brown chain unanchored), so it must be orange. This set of deductions allows us in turn to infer the colors of the other two cells in the chain, and to make them solid (their three Kempe chains all become anchored). The orange escape cell becomes dotted rather than solid, because it is part of a different Kempe chain (colored orange-green) that remains unanchored.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Screenshot of the map puzzle from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/map-puzzle-kempe-chain-2.png"/></p>

<p>This extended deduction rule seems to be working well for the puzzles I’ve tried it on. And by obeying the requirement that deductions remain triggered until performed, it gives me confidence that I’m not hiding any usable information by doing my deductions in the wrong order. There is no wrong order: any order in which I make my deductions will eventually lead me to the same state.</p>

    <summary>We study goodness-of-fit of discrete distributions in the distributed setting, where samples are divided between multiple users who can only release a limited amount of information about their samples due to various information constraints. Recently, a subset of the authors showed that having access to a common random seed (i.e., shared randomness) leads to a significant reduction in the sample complexity of this problem. In this work, we provide a complete understanding of the interplay between the amount of shared randomness available, the stringency of information constraints, and the sample complexity of the testing problem by characterizing a tight trade-off between these three parameters. We provide a general distributed goodness-of-fit protocol that as a function of the amount of shared randomness interpolates smoothly between the private- and public-coin sample complexities. We complement our upper bound with a general framework to prove lower bounds on the sample complexity of this testing problems under limited shared randomness. Finally, we instantiate our bounds for the two archetypal information constraints of communication and local privacy, and show that our sample complexity bounds are optimal as a function of all the parameters of the problem, including the amount of shared randomness.

A key component of our upper bounds is a new primitive of domain compression, a tool that allows us to map distributions to a much smaller domain size while preserving their pairwise distances, using a limited amount of randomness.</summary>

    <title>Three stories about U.C. administration</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few months ago, I was delighted to see the University of California holding on to its demands in its negotiations with Elsevier.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few months ago, I was delighted to see the University of California <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/03/uc-elsevier-publisher/583909/">holding on to its demands</a> in its negotiations with Elsevier. The U.C. wanted to renegotiate its contract so that, in addition to having access to the subscribed journals, U.C. scholars could publish in them with open access (that is, so that anybody in the world would have free access to the articles written by U.C. scholars).</p>
<p>This seemed like a reasonable model to balance profitability for publishers and open access, but there was no way to agree on it with Elsevier. Meanwhile, U.C. has not renewed its Elsevier subscriptions and Elsevier has cut off access to U.C. libraries.</p>
<p>I was very impressed to see the University of California central administration do something right, so I wondered if this was the kind of portent that is a harbinger of the apocalypse, or just a fluke. Subsequent events suggest the latter.</p>
<p>The University of California has spent a lot of time and money to build a centralized system for job applications and for job applicant review. I was first made aware of this when I chaired the recruiting committee for the Simons Director position. At first we were told that we could solicit applications through the (vastly superior) EECS-built system for job applications and reviews. After the application deadline passed, we were told that, in fact, we could <i>not</i> use the EECS system, and so the already overworked EECS faculty HR person had to manually copy all the data in the central campus system. </p>
<p>The American Mathematical Society has created a wonderfully functional system, called <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs">Mathjobs</a> where applicants for academic mathematics jobs (ranging from postdocs to professorship) can upload their application material once, and their recommenders can upload their letters once, and then all the universities that the candidate applies to have access to this material. Furthermore, if needed, both applicants and recommenders can tailor-make their material for a particular university or universities, if they want to.</p>
<p>Everybody was living happily, but not ever after, because the U.C. central campus administration decided that <i>everybody</i> in the University of California had to use the centralized system for <i>all</i> jobs. Both the AMS and U.C. mathematicians tried to find a reasonable accommodation, such as allowing the U.C. system to access the letters posted on mathjobs. The campus administration reasoned response was roughly “sucks to be you.” There is more of the story in an <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201907/rnoti-p1085.pdf">AMS notices article</a> by the chair of math at U.C. Davis.</p>
<p>Finally, this year <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/nation/article/UC-Berkeley-booted-from-U-S-News-World-Report-14189464.php">U.C. Berkeley</a> will not be listed in the US News and World Report rankings because it has submitted wrong data in the past.</p></div>

    <title>The Advisor/Advisee Relationship</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I've always felt a strong advisor/advisee relationship is the single most important factor in a successful PhD career. At its best, the advisor works closely with the student to successful research agenda and help mentor them through their graduate career and beyond. The advisor/advisee relationship can feel like a parent/child relationship that lasts an entire career. Nothing gives me more pleasure as an academic than to see the success of my current and former students.<br/>
<br/>
Take your time when picking an advisor. Don't choose an advisor based solely on research area or because they are "famous". Pick the advisor that will best guide you to a successful academic career.<br/>
<br/>
At its worst, a bad advisor/advisee relationship will destroy your graduate career, making you feel miserable, perhaps dropping out of graduate school or worse, particularly if a student doesn't feel like they are being treated fairly.<br/>
<br/>
Two incidents prompted this post. On TCS-Stack Exchange, a student has <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/42704/single-author-papers-against-my-advisors-will/42711">authorship issues</a> with their advisor. Unfortunately these kinds of incidents happen more often than one suspects. If you can't work it out with the advisor, go talk to someone about it, another faculty, the graduate or department chair, a grad student ombudsperson if your institution has one. We care about our students, and will work hard to resolve problems.<br/>
<br/>
In a much more <a href="https://medium.com/@huixiangvoice/the-hidden-story-behind-the-suicide-phd-candidate-huixiang-chen-236cd39f79d3">tragic event</a>, a student felt it easier to take his own life than feeling that he had to cover up potential academic misconduct. Again, if you ever find yourself in such a situation please reach out. Giving up is never the answer.</div>

Joel Spencer gave the closing talk of last week’s Random Structures and Algorithms <a href="https://math.ethz.ch/fim/conferences/19th-int-conf-random-structures-algorithms/schedule.html">conference</a> at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss his talk and the one that preceded it, which was by Hao Huang on his proof this month of the Boolean sensitivity conjecture.</p>
<p>
Spencer’s <a href="https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/math/mathematical-research/fim-dam/Conferences/2019/19th Int Conf on Random Structures and Algorithms/Abstracts/Spencer_Joel.pdf">talk</a> was titled “Four Discrepancies” and based on a joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06898.pdf">paper</a> with Nikhil Bansal. The main new result in the talk was a case where a bound of <img alt="{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%5Clog+n%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}"/> arising from reasoning about normal distribution can, surprisingly, be improved to a sharp <img alt="{O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(\sqrt{n})}"/>. </p>
<p>
We will talk about this first, but then progress to the talk that preceded Spencer’s. It was by Hao Huang, who was extended an invitation right after his announced <a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~hhuan30/papers/sensitivity_1.pdf">proof</a> of the Boolean Sensitivity Conjecture earlier this month. Our ulterior purpose is to ask whether any concrete connections can be found besides both talks addressing problems on the <img alt="{\{-1,+1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B-1%2C%2B1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{-1,+1\}^n}"/> hypercube.<span id="more-16124"/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Discrepancy Games </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
First suppose you get a stream of single bits <img alt="{v_t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv_t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{v_t}"/>, each <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1}"/> or <img alt="{+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+1}"/>. For each bit, you can say “Keep it” or “Flip it.” In the latter case, your bit <img alt="{w_t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw_t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{w_t}"/> is <img alt="{-v_t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-v_t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-v_t}"/>. Your goal is to keep the sum <img alt="{\sum_{k=1}^t w_k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5Et+w_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sum_{k=1}^t w_k}"/> within a bounded range. OK, this is easy: you can make the sum always be <img alt="{+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+1}"/> when <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> is odd and <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> when <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> is even by flipping when needed.</p>
<p>
Now suppose the bits come in pairs <img alt="{(v_{t,1},v_{t,2})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28v_%7Bt%2C1%7D%2Cv_%7Bt%2C2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(v_{t,1},v_{t,2})}"/> and your goal is to keep the sum in each coordinate bounded. Again there is a simple strategy: There are four kinds of vectors. For each kind, every time you see it for the second time, flip it. That keeps the contribution of each kind within <img alt="{-1 \ldots +1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1+%5Cldots+%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1 \ldots +1}"/> in each coordinate. Thus simple reasoning says each coordinate stays within <img alt="{-4 \ldots +4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-4+%5Cldots+%2B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-4 \ldots +4}"/>. </p>
<p>
The trouble with extending this idea to vectors of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> is that the number of kinds is <img alt="{2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^n}"/> and our simple-minded bounds, while constant in terms of the number <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of vectors given, are exponential in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. Well, we can certainly do better. Going back to the <img alt="{n = 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 2}"/> case, we can maintain a policy of never letting both coordinates become <img alt="{+2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{+2}"/> or both become <img alt="{-2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-2}"/>. This keeps both sums within <img alt="{-2 \ldots +2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-2+%5Cldots+%2B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-2 \ldots +2}"/> regardless of the sequence of the vectors. But for larger vector lengths <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>, how large can the <em>discrepancy</em> among the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> coordinate sums—relative to zero or to each other—become?</p>
<p>
A final help is if we know the number <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of vectors in any sequence we might be given is bounded. In fact, Spencer’s paper with Bhansal first considers the case <img alt="{T = n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%3D+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T = n}"/>. There are two main questions about randomness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Does it matter whether the sequence of vectors given is random or worst-case? <p/>
</li><li>
Can you do better than choosing “keep” or “flip” randomly?
</li></ol>
<p>
Long back, Spencer <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/spencer/sixsigma.pdf">proved</a> that if you can see the whole sequence of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> vectors in advance, then you can always keep the sums within <img alt="{-5.32 \sqrt{n} \ldots +5.32\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-5.32+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D+%5Cldots+%2B5.32%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-5.32 \sqrt{n} \ldots +5.32\sqrt{n}}"/>, whatever the sequence. If not—if you must decide “keep” or “flip” for each vector before seeing the next—then Spencer had also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=HTxo3kP7_5gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Ten+Lectures+on+the+Probabilistic+Method+Spencer&amp;ots=hGDS5tiCgB&amp;sig=qP53Ty3AQgVJF2J4wzcmT948mmY#v=onepage&amp;q=Ten Lectures on the Probabilistic Method Spencer&amp;f=false">proved</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If an adversary can choose the next vector based on your current sums, then the best bound <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> such that you can keep all your sums within absolute value <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> grows as <img alt="{\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%5Clog+n%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Theta(\sqrt{n\log n})}"/>. Moreover, up to the constant in the “<img alt="{\Theta,}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%2C%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Theta,}"/>” with high probability you cannot do any better than choosing the sign for each vector randomly. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
See also his famous <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Probabilistic+Method/+4th+Edition-p-9781119061953">book</a>, <em>The Probabilistic Method</em>, with Noga Alon. The new theorem is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> If the adversary presents vectors uniformly at random, then you <b>can</b> achieve <img alt="{B = O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB+%3D+O%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B = O(\sqrt{n})}"/> with high probability—and not by choosing the signs randomly. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The algorithm defines a kind of <em>potential function</em> and has you play “keep” or “flip” according to which has the lesser growth in potential. The analysis is quite complicated. As usual we refer to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06898.pdf">paper</a> for details. Instead we ask: are there insights to mine here for further advances on the Boolean sensitivity problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Boolean Sensitivity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
We didn’t talk about Boolean sensitivity in our previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/tools-and-sensitivity/">post</a> on it. Our purpose now is to convey how many concepts are related, hence how they might connect to discrepancy on the hypercube. </p>
<p>
To get the idea of sensitivity, first consider the parity function <img alt="{f_{\oplus}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Coplus%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\oplus}}"/>. If you change one bit of any argument <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> you change the value of <img alt="{f_{\oplus}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Coplus%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\oplus}(x)}"/>. Define <img alt="{x^i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^i}"/> to mean <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> with bit <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/> flipped. Then for any <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>, <img alt="{f_{\oplus}(x^i) \neq f_{\oplus}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Coplus%7D%28x%5Ei%29+%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Coplus%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\oplus}(x^i) \neq f_{\oplus}(x)}"/>. This means parity is extremely sensitive.</p>
<p>
The OR function <img alt="{f_{\vee}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Cvee%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\vee}}"/> is intuitively less sensitive, but it too has an argument <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> such that <img alt="{f_{\vee}(x^i) \neq f_{\vee}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B%5Cvee%7D%28x%5Ei%29+%5Cneq+f_%7B%5Cvee%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_{\vee}(x^i) \neq f_{\vee}(x)}"/> for all <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{i}"/>, namely <img alt="{x = 0^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+0%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x = 0^n}"/>. For any Boolean function <img alt="{f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%3A+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}}"/> define its <em>sensitivity</em> (at <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) by </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  s(f) = s_n(f) = \max_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} ||\{i: f(x^i) \neq f(x)\}||. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++s%28f%29+%3D+s_n%28f%29+%3D+%5Cmax_%7Bx+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D+%7C%7C%5C%7Bi%3A+f%28x%5Ei%29+%5Cneq+f%28x%29%5C%7D%7C%7C.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  s(f) = s_n(f) = \max_{x \in \{0,1\}^n} ||\{i: f(x^i) \neq f(x)\}||. "/></p>
<p>The OR-of-AND function <img alt="{f_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2}"/> is less sensitive. Say it is an OR of <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> blocks, each of <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> variables, and the blocks use disjoint variables so <img alt="{n = km}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+km%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = km}"/>. If <img alt="{f_2(x) = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%28x%29+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2(x) = 1}"/>, then some block is all <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, so flipping any other bit makes no difference, and the most sensitive we can get is <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>. If <img alt="{f_2(x) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%28x%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2(x) = 0}"/> then the most sensitive case is when all blocks have exactly one 0. So <img alt="{s(f_2) = \max\{k,m\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f_2%29+%3D+%5Cmax%5C%7Bk%2Cm%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s(f_2) = \max\{k,m\}}"/>. When <img alt="{k = m = \sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+m+%3D+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k = m = \sqrt{n}}"/>, <img alt="{s_n(f) = \sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_n%28f%29+%3D+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s_n(f) = \sqrt{n}}"/>.</p>
<p>
If we make each block of <img alt="{f_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2}"/> return <em>true</em> if exactly one bit is <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>, then we again get sensitivity <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> on the all-<img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> assignment. Now, however, consider the related function <img alt="{f'_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'_2}"/> (with <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/> even, <img alt="{k = 2\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+2%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k = 2\ell}"/>) that is still an OR over blocks, but each block is true when some consecutive pair <img alt="{x_{2\ell - 1},x_{2\ell}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7B2%5Cell+-+1%7D%2Cx_%7B2%5Cell%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x_{2\ell - 1},x_{2\ell}}"/> are both <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> with all other pairs being both <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/>. Then we can’t do the same trick with the all-<img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> assignment changing just one bit. So when <img alt="{n = 4\ell^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+4%5Cell%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 4\ell^2}"/> and <img alt="{m = k = 2\ell}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+k+%3D+2%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m = k = 2\ell}"/> we again get sensitivity (no more than) <img alt="{\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{n}}"/>. </p>
<p>
We can, however, consider <img alt="{f'_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'_2}"/> to be more sensitive if we can flip more than one bit at a time. Partition <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/> into <em>blocks</em> <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of two consecutive bit-places each, and given any <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>, define <img alt="{x^B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5EB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^B}"/> to be the result of flipping the bits in <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>. We get <img alt="{n/2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n/2}"/> blocks, and the all-<img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> assignment becomes a <em>true</em> case of <img alt="{f'_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%27_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f'_2}"/> if any block is flipped. Generally define the <em>block sensitivity</em> by considering any partitions <img alt="{\mathcal{B} = \{B_j\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BB%7D+%3D+%5C%7BB_j%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathcal{B} = \{B_j\}}"/> of <img alt="{[n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{[n]}"/> into disjoint subsets and writing </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  bs(f) = \max_{x,\mathcal{B}} ||\{j: f(x^{B_j}) \neq f(x)\}||.

"/></p>
<p>Note that not every member of the partition has to flip the function—we can discard the ones that don’t flip and count only the disjoint subsets that do flip the value. So back to our example, we have </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  bs(f'_2) = \frac{n}{2} = \frac{1}{2}s(f'_2)^2. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++bs%28f%27_2%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7Ds%28f%27_2%29%5E2.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  bs(f'_2) = \frac{n}{2} = \frac{1}{2}s(f'_2)^2.

<p>Andris Ambainis and Xiaoming Sun <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3494">improved</a> the constant from <img alt="{\frac{1}{2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{1}{2}}"/> asymptotically to <img alt="{\frac{2}{3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{2}{3}}"/>, but their relation is still quadratic.</p>

</p><p/><h2> Some Boolean Complexity Connections </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01200762">example</a> of quadratic discrepancy is still the best known lower bound on <img alt="{bs(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f)}"/> in terms of <img alt="{s(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s(f)}"/>. But no one had proved anything better than an exponential upper bound until Huang’s result, from which it follows that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 3</b> <em><a name="Huang"/> For all Boolean functions <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/>, <img alt="{bs(f) \leq 2s(f)^4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29+%5Cleq+2s%28f%29%5E4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f) \leq 2s(f)^4}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This bound is concrete, not just asymptotic. It still leaves a gap between quadratic and quartic. It is, however, the combination of two quadratic upper bounds. One was shown by Nisan and Szegedy in their <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2508255_On_the_Degree_of_Boolean_Functions_as_Real_Polynomials">paper</a>: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  bs(f) \leq 2\deg(f)^2, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++bs%28f%29+%5Cleq+2%5Cdeg%28f%29%5E2%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  bs(f) \leq 2\deg(f)^2, "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{\deg(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdeg%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\deg(f)}"/> means the degree of the unique multi-linear real polynomial that agrees with <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> on the cube <img alt="{\{-1,1\}^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\{-1,1\}^n}"/> with <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{-1}"/> for <em>true</em>. The other is the conjecture </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \deg(f) \leq s(f)^2 " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cdeg%28f%29+%5Cleq+s%28f%29%5E2+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \deg(f) \leq s(f)^2 "/></p>
<p>in a 1992 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316592900608">paper</a> by Craig Gotsman and Nati Linial. Huang proved this by exploiting a connection to graphs that was also shown by Gotsman and Linial. Consider any red-or-white coloring of the <img alt="{2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^n}"/> nodes of the hypercube, let <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> be the graph induced by the red nodes, and define <img alt="{g(x) = 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x) = 1}"/> if node <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> is red, <img alt="{g(x) = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g(x) = 0}"/> otherwise. Now if the maximum degree <img alt="{d(G)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(G)}"/> of a node in <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> is small then every red node has many white neighbors, so the Boolean function <img alt="{g}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{g}"/> is very sensitive. However, going to each neighbor in the hypercube flips the parity. Hence the function </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  g'(x) = g(x) \oplus f_{\oplus}(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%27%28x%29+%3D+g%28x%29+%5Coplus+f_%7B%5Coplus%7D%28x%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  g'(x) = g(x) \oplus f_{\oplus}(x) "/></p>
<p>is <b>not</b> very sensitive. Moreover, it has the same sensitivity as the function <img alt="{h'(x) = h(x) \oplus f_{\oplus}(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%27%28x%29+%3D+h%28x%29+%5Coplus+f_%7B%5Coplus%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{h'(x) = h(x) \oplus f_{\oplus}(x)}"/> where <img alt="{h(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{h(x)}"/> is true on the white nodes. This nice duality between <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> and the graph <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{H}"/> induced by the white nodes enables us to fix “<img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/>” to mean whichever of the two has more nodes in the following theorem statement: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 4</b> <em> Provided <img alt="{m &gt; 2^{n-1}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3E+2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m &gt; 2^{n-1}}"/>, every graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{G}"/> induced by <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> nodes of the <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>-cube has <img alt="{d(G) \geq \sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%28G%29+%5Cgeq+%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{d(G) \geq \sqrt{n}}"/> if and only if every Boolean function <img alt="{f}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f}"/> has <img alt="{\deg(f) \leq s(f)^2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdeg%28f%29+%5Cleq+s%28f%29%5E2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\deg(f) \leq s(f)^2}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The proof uses some Fourier analysis with <img alt="{f = g'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf+%3D+g%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f = g'}"/> as above. It, too, takes only one page of a really short paper. </p>
<p>
The main open question now is whether the 4th-power upper bound in Huang’s theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#Huang">3</a> can be improved to quadratic. It is possible that a deeper application of Fourier analysis may show that cases of quadratic separation from <em>block-sensitivity</em> to <em>degree</em> and <em>degree</em> to <em>sensitivity</em> cannot “amplify” any more than quadratic. This is where there might be some commonality with discrepancy. </p>
<p>
There is a much wider suite of Boolean complexity measures besides <img alt="{s(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{s(f)}"/>, <img alt="{bs(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bbs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{bs(f)}"/>, and <img alt="{\deg(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdeg%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\deg(f)}"/> discussed here. For example, consider how many bits of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> you need to fix in order to preserve the value <img alt="{f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x)}"/>. That is, define <img alt="{C(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(f)}"/> to be the maximum over <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> of the minimum size of a set <img alt="{I \subseteq [n]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI+%5Csubseteq+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{I \subseteq [n]}"/> such that whenever <img alt="{x'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x'}"/> agrees with <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> on <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{I}"/>, <img alt="{f(x') = f(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%27%29+%3D+f%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f(x') = f(x)}"/>. Clearly <img alt="{I}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{I}"/> needs to include at least one bit from each <img alt="{B_j.}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB_j.%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B_j.}"/> This proves <img alt="{C(f) \geq bs(f)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28f%29+%5Cgeq+bs%28f%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(f) \geq bs(f)}"/>. There are many other relations that might be improved. We end by considering ways of broadening Huang’s techniques.</p>

<p>There is a class of children that have just finished elementary school. Now they all move from elementary school to high school and classes are reshuffled. Each child lists three friends, and the assignment of children into classes ensures that each child will have at least one of these three friends in his class.</p>
<p>One of the children heard from five of his schoolmates that they found that they can make their selections in a way that will ensure that all five will be assigned to the same class!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #993366;">Test your intuition: Is there a strategy for five of the children that will ensure that all five will be assigned to the same class?</span></h3>
<p>Can a larger group of children coordinate their choices to ensure that they will all necessarily be assigned to the same class?</p>

<p><span id="more-17669"/></p>
<p><strong>Bonus question:</strong> In case that every child lists only two friends and one of them is guaranteed to be in the same class. Is there a strategy of five children that will ensure they are in the same class?</p>
<p><strong>Answer to Bonus question</strong>: Yes. For three children you let every one choose the other two. For the remaining children you let each one choose two among the three.</p></div>

    <title>TR19-097 |  Reversible Pebble Games and the Relation Between Tree-Like and General Resolution Space | 

	Florian Wörz, 

	Jacobo Toran</title>
    <summary>We show a new connection between the space measure in tree-like resolution and the reversible pebble game in graphs. Using this connection we provide several formula classes for which there is a logarithmic factor separation between the space complexity measure in tree-like and general resolution. We show that these separations are almost optimal by proving upper bounds for tree-like resolution space in terms of general resolution clause and variable space. In particular we show that for any formula F, its tree-like resolution is upper bounded by space(?)log time(?) where ? is any general resolution refutation of F. This holds considering as space(?) the clause space of the refutation as well as considering its variable space. For the concrete case of Tseitin formulas we are able to improve this bound to the optimal bound space(?)log(n), where n is the number of vertices of the corresponding graph.</summary>

    <title>TR19-096 |  On the $\text{AC}^0[\oplus]$ complexity of Andreev&amp;#39;s Problem | 

	Aditya Potukuchi</title>
    <summary>Andreev's Problem asks the following: Given an integer $d$ and a subset of $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q$, is there a polynomial $y = p(x)$ of degree at most $d$ such that  for every $a \in \mathbb{F}_q$, $(a,p(a)) \in S$? We show an $\text{AC}^0[\oplus]$ lower bound for this problem. 

This problem appears to be similar to the list recovery problem for degree $d$-Reed-Solomon codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ which asks the following: Given subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_q$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$, output all (if any) Reed-Solomon codewords contained in $A_1\times \cdots \times A_q$. For our purpose, we study this problem when $A_1, \ldots, A_q$ are random subsets of a given size, which may be of independent interest.</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Suppose that <em>X</em> is a bounded-degree polynomial with nonnegative coefficients on the <em>p</em>-biased discrete hypercube. Our main result gives sharp estimates on the logarithmic upper tail probability of X whenever an associated extremal problem satisfies a certain entropic stability property. We apply this result to solve two long-standing open problems in probabilistic combinatorics: the upper tail problem for the number of arithmetic progressions of a fixed length in the <em>p</em>-random subset of the integers and the upper tail problem for the number of cliques of a fixed size in the random graph <img alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}"/>. We also make significant progress on the upper tail problem for the number of copies of a fixed regular graph <em>H</em> in <img alt="G_{n,p}." class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}."/> To accommodate readers who are interested in learning the basic method, we include a short, self-contained solution to the upper tail problem for the number of triangles in <img alt="G_{n,p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_%7Bn%2Cp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="G_{n,p}"/> for all <em>p=p(n)</em> satisfying <img alt="\frac {\log n}{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7B%5Clog+n%7D%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\frac {\log n}{n}"/> <img alt="\ll" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cll&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\ll"/> <img alt="p \ll 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cll+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="p \ll 1"/>.</p>
<p>The introduction does a very nice job of presenting the rich history of the problem.  Here is a 2002 paper by Svante Janson and Andrzej Ruciński on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rsa.10031?casa_token=7FoHUVq0w5IAAAAA:AqmK_4tpjDzXErWnGh4qnE2kn4NTupyoW27eSXW7Uwr5l0JgpBP5SG7PaVnJ6Lvr4JhCaSIH2HPv-QTsUg">the infamous upper tail</a>.  (And a lot has happened since then with regard to this problem and on non linear large deviation theory). Following, there is a lovely section with a short solution for the case of triangles.</p>
<p>Forthcoming reference [48] talks about lower tails! Stay tuned!</p></div>

    <title>Answer to both Infinite Hats Problems from the last post</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
(This is a joint post with David Marcus. You'll see why later.)<br/>
<br/>
In a prior  I posed two infinite hat problems. Today I post the solutions. Actually this is a copy of my last post with the solutions added, so it is self contained.<br/>
<br/>
A Hat Problem that you have probably seen:<br/>
<br/>
1) There are an infinite number of people, numbered 1,2,3,...  There are 2 colors of hats. They can all see everyone's hat but their own. <br/>
<br/>
2) The adversary is going to put hats on all the people. They will guess their own hat color<i> at the same time</i>. <br/>
<br/>
3) The people can discuss strategy ahead of time, but must use a deterministic strategy and the adversary knows the strategy.<br/>
<br/>
4) The people want to minimize how many they get wrong. <br/>
<br/>
5) The adversary puts on hats to maximize how many they get wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I ask two questions (the answers are in a document I point to) and one meta-question:<br/>
<br/>
Q1: Is there a solution where they get all but a finite number of the guesses right? (If you have read my prior post on hat puzzles, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/07/two-hat-problems-you-may-or-may-not.html">here</a> then you can do this one.) <br/>
<br/>
Q2: Is there a solution where they get all but at most (say) 18 wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Answers to Q1 and Q2 are <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/infinitehats.pdf">here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
How did I get into this problem? I was looking at hat problems a while back. Then  I began discussing Q1 and Q2 by email  (Does the term <i>discussing</i> have as a default that it is by email?) with David Marcus who had just read the chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974">Problems with a Point</a> on hat puzzles. After a few emails back and fourth, he began looking on the web for answers. He found one. There is a website of hat puzzles! It was MY website papers on  Hat Puzzles! It is  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/TOPICS/hats/hats.html">here</a>. And on it was a relevant paper <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/TOPICS/hats/infinite-hats-and-ac.pdf">here</a>. We did not find any other source of the problem or its solution. <br/>
<br/>
Q3: How well known is problem Q2 and the solution?  I've seen Q1 around but the only source on Q2 that I know of is that paper, and now this blog post. So, please leave a comment telling me if you have seen Q2 and/or the solution someplace else, and if so where.<br/>
<br/>
The responses to my last post indicated that YES the problem was out there, but the proof that you could not get all-but-18 was not well known. <br/>
<br/>
I THINK that all of the proofs that you can't do all-but-18 in the comment of the last post were essentially the same as the solution I pointed to in this blog. I would be interested if there is an alternative proof. <br/></div>
