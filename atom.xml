any mixed computation qubit in a quantum system - represented by a diagonal
density matrix - towards a particular state of the computational basis which,
in effect, increases its purity are presented. Quantum circuits that achieve
this by implementing the above data compression technique - a generalization of
the 3B-Comp [Fernandez, Lloyd, Mor, Roychowdhury (2004); arXiv:
<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401135">quant-ph/0401135</a>] used before are described. These circuits enable purity
increment in the computation qubit by maximally transferring part of its von
Neumann or Shannon entropy to any number of surrounding qubits and are valid
for the complete range of initial biases. Using the optswaps, a practicable new
method that algorithmically achieves hierarchy-dependent cooling of qubits to
their respective limits in an engineered quantum register opened to the
heat-bath in delineated. In addition to multi-qubit purification and satisfying
two of DiVincenzo's criteria for quantum computation in some architectures, the
implications of this work for quantum data compression are discussed.

non-blocking concurrent interpolation search tree (C-IST) data structure. We
then analyze the individual operations of the C-IST, and show that they are
correct and linearizable. We furthermore show that lookup (and several other
non-destructive operations) are wait-free, and that the insert and delete
operations are lock-free. We continue by showing that the C-IST has the
following properties. For arbitrary key distributions, this data structure
ensures worst-case $O(\log n + p)$ amortized time for search, insertion and
deletion traversals. When the input key distributions are smooth, lookups run
in expected $O(\log \log n + p)$ time, and insertion and deletion run in
expected amortized $O(\log \log n + p)$ time, where $p$ is a bound on the
number of threads. Finally, we present an extended experimental evaluation of
the non-blocking IST performance.

induced by this protocol have $n$ vertices, $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ edges, and are
decomposable into $n^{1+O(1/\log \log n)}$ induced matchings. Another protocol
is an explicit (and slightly simpler) version of the construction of Alon,
Moitra and Sudakov, producing graphs with similar properties. We also
generalize the above protocols to more than three players, in order to
construct dense uniform hypergraphs in which every edge lies in a positive
small number of simplices.

is via fine-grained complexity arguments. These arguments rely on strong
assumptions about specific problems such as the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH) and the Online Matrix-Vector Multiplication Conjecture (OMv).
While they have led to many exciting discoveries, dynamic algorithms still miss
out some benefits and lessons from the traditional ``coarse-grained'' approach
that relates together classes of problems such as P and NP. In this paper we
initiate the study of coarse-grained complexity theory for dynamic algorithms.
Below are among questions that this theory can answer.
</p>
<p>What if dynamic Orthogonal Vector (OV) is easy in the cell-probe model? A
research program for proving polynomial unconditional lower bounds for dynamic
OV in the cell-probe model is motivated by the fact that many conditional lower
bounds can be shown via reductions from the dynamic OV problem. Since the
cell-probe model is more powerful than word RAM and has historically allowed
smaller upper bounds, it might turn out that dynamic OV is easy in the
cell-probe model, making this research direction infeasible. Our theory implies
that if this is the case, there will be very interesting algorithmic
consequences: If dynamic OV can be maintained in polylogarithmic worst-case
update time in the cell-probe model, then so are several important dynamic
problems such as $k$-edge connectivity, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate mincut,
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate matching, planar nearest neighbors, Chan's subset
union and 3-vs-4 diameter. The same conclusion can be made when we replace
dynamic OV by, e.g., subgraph connectivity, single source reachability, Chan's
subset union, and 3-vs-4 diameter.

associated correlation matrix has a bounded largest eigenvalue for the
distribution and all of its conditional distributions. We prove that if $\mu$
is spectrally independent, then the corresponding high dimensional simplicial
complex is a local spectral expander. Using a line of recent works on mixing
time of high dimensional walks on simplicial complexes
\cite{KM17,DK17,KO18,AL19}, this implies that the corresponding Glauber
dynamics mixes rapidly and generates (approximate) samples from $\mu$.
</p>
<p>As an application, we show that natural Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly (in
polynomial time) to generate a random independent set from the hardcore model
up to the uniqueness threshold. This improves the quasi-polynomial running time
of Weitz's deterministic correlation decay algorithm \cite{Wei06} for
estimating the hardcore partition function, also answering a long-standing open
problem of mixing time of Glauber dynamics \cite{LV97,LV99,DG00,Vig01,EHSVY16}.

any graph $G$, let $\nu(G)$ be the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in
$G$, and $\tau(G)$ be the minimum subset $F$ of edges such that $G \setminus F$
is triangle-free. It is easy to see that $\nu(G) \leq \tau(G) \leq 3 \nu(G)$,
and in fact, this rather obvious inequality holds for a much more general
primal-dual relation between $k$-hyper matching and covering in hypergraphs.
Tuza conjectured in $1981$ that $\tau(G) \leq 2 \nu(G)$, and this question has
received attention from various groups of researchers in discrete mathematics,
settling various special cases such as planar graphs and generalized to bounded
maximum average degree graphs, some cases of minor-free graphs, and very dense
graphs. Despite these efforts, the conjecture in general graphs has remained
wide open for almost four decades.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide a proof of a non-trivial consequence of the
conjecture; that is, for every $k \geq 2$, there exist a (multi)-set $F
\subseteq E(G): |F| \leq 2k \nu(G)$ such that each triangle in $G$ overlaps at
least $k$ elements in $F$. Our result can be seen as a strengthened statement
of Krivelevich's result on the fractional version of Tuza's conjecture (and we
give some examples illustrating this.) The main technical ingredient of our
result is a charging argument, that locally identifies edges in $F$ based on a
local view of the packing solution. This idea might be useful in further
studying the primal-dual relations in general and the Tuza's conjecture in
particular.

such as image and language recognition, where large neural networks are often
used to obtain good accuracy. Consequently, it is challenging to deploy these
networks under limited computational resources, such as in mobile devices. In
this work, we introduce an algorithm that removes units and layers of a neural
network while not changing the output that is produced, which thus implies a
lossless compression. This algorithm, which we denote as LEO (Lossless
Expressiveness Optimization), relies on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
to identify Rectifier Linear Units (ReLUs) with linear behavior over the input
domain. By using L1 regularization to induce such behavior, we can benefit from
training over a larger architecture than we would later use in the environment
where the trained neural network is deployed.

length m and a text of length n, both over an alphabet of size $\sigma$,
compute the Hamming distance between the pattern and the text at every
location. Several $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms have been proposed in
the literature, with running time of the form $O(\epsilon^{-O(1)}n\log n\log
m)$, all using fast Fourier transform (FFT). We describe a simple
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that is faster and does not need FFT.
Combining our approach with additional ideas leads to numerous new results:
</p>
<p>- We obtain the first linear-time approximation algorithm; the running time
is $O(\epsilon^{-2}n)$.
</p>
<p>- We obtain a faster exact algorithm computing all Hamming distances up to a
given threshold k; its running time improves previous results by logarithmic
factors and is linear if $k\le\sqrt m$.
</p>
<p>- We obtain approximation algorithms with better $\epsilon$-dependence using
rectangular matrix multiplication. The time-bound is $\~O(n)$ when the pattern
is sufficiently long: $m\ge \epsilon^{-28}$. Previous algorithms require
$\~O(\epsilon^{-1}n)$ time.
</p>
<p>- When k is not too small, we obtain a truly sublinear-time algorithm to find
all locations with Hamming distance approximately (up to a constant factor)
less than k, in $O((n/k^{\Omega(1)}+occ)n^{o(1)})$ time, where occ is the
output size. The algorithm leads to a property tester, returning true if an
exact match exists and false if the Hamming distance is more than $\delta m$ at
every location, running in $\~O(\delta^{-1/3}n^{2/3}+\delta^{-1}n/m)$ time.
</p>
<p>- We obtain a streaming algorithm to report all locations with Hamming
distance approximately less than k, using $\~O(\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt k)$ space.
Previously, streaming algorithms were known for the exact problem with \~O(k)
space or for the approximate problem with $\~O(\epsilon^{-O(1)}\sqrt m)$ space.

minimal resp. maximal number of clusters such that every cluster fulfills the
following weight condition: the weight of each cluster should to be at least
$l$ and at most $u$. These kind of partitioning problems are NP-hard for
series-parallel graphs but can be solved in polynomial time on trees. In this
paper we present partitioning algorithms for cactus graphs to show that these
partition problems are polynomial-time solvable for this graph class as well.

clustering with general linkage functions that compute arbitrary similarity
between two point sets. The key components of Grinch are its rotate and graft
subroutines that efficiently reconfigure the hierarchy as new points arrive,
supporting discovery of clusters with complex structure. Grinch is motivated by
a new notion of separability for clustering with linkage functions: we prove
that when the model is consistent with a ground-truth clustering, Grinch is
guaranteed to produce a cluster tree containing the ground-truth, independent
of data arrival order. Our empirical results on benchmark and author
coreference datasets (with standard and learned linkage functions) show that
Grinch is more accurate than other scalable methods, and orders of magnitude
faster than hierarchical agglomerative clustering.

multicasts, in which multiple packets have to be forwarded along given trees as
fast as possible.
</p>
<p>This is a natural generalization of the seminal work of Leighton, Maggs and
Rao, which solved this problem for unicasts, i.e. the case where all trees are
paths. They showed the existence of asymptotically optimal $O(C + D)$-length
schedules, where the congestion $C$ is the maximum number of packets sent over
an edge and the dilation $D$ is the maximum depth of a tree. This improves over
the trivial $O(CD)$ length schedules.
</p>
<p>We prove a lower bound for multicasts, which shows that there do not always
exist schedules of non-trivial length, $o(CD)$. On the positive side, we
construct $O(C+D+\log^2 n)$-length schedules in any $n$-node network. These
schedules are near-optimal, since our lower bound shows that this length cannot
be improved to $O(C+D) + o(\log n)$.

optical spectrum, there is a continuous need to optimize the usage of this
resource. In the process of provisioning elastic optical networks using the
flexible frequency grid paradigm, telecommunication operators must deal with a
combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-complete namely the Routing and
Spectrum Allocation(RSA) problem.Following on our previous study (Enoch &amp;
Jaumard, 2018), where we used Integer Linear Programming, and proposed a Column
Generation algorithm based on a Lightpath decomposition, which proved to be the
most efficient so far,we now consider the traditional Configuration
decomposition that has been studied in other works in the past. In the process,
we created an new mathematical model using two variable sets instead of a
single variable set. Equally important,we independently rediscovered the Nested
Column Generation technique, and we used it to propose an algorithm that led to
a considerable improvement on the previous algorithms that use the same
Configuration decomposition. When compared to the latest such existing study
(Jaumard &amp; Daryalal, 2016), our algorithm achieved an accuracy gap of 1% as
opposed to 14.3% for the previous study, and a running time two orders of
magnitude faster on average.

    <title>Efficient classical simulation of random shallow 2D quantum circuits</title>

Harrow <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.00021">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Random quantum circuits are commonly viewed as hard to simulate classically.
In some regimes this has been formally conjectured, and there had been no
evidence against the more general possibility that for circuits with uniformly
random gates, approximate simulation of typical instances is almost as hard as
exact simulation. We prove that this is not the case by exhibiting a shallow
circuit family with uniformly random gates that cannot be efficiently
classically simulated near-exactly under standard hardness assumptions, but can
be simulated approximately for all but a superpolynomially small fraction of
circuit instances in time linear in the number of qubits and gates. We
furthermore conjecture that sufficiently shallow random circuits are
efficiently simulable more generally. To this end, we propose and analyze two
simulation algorithms. Implementing one of our algorithms numerically, we give
strong evidence that it is efficient both asymptotically and, in some cases, in
practice. To argue analytically for efficiency, we reduce the simulation of 2D
shallow random circuits to the simulation of a form of 1D dynamics consisting
of alternating rounds of random local unitaries and weak measurements -- a type
of process that has generally been observed to undergo a phase transition from
an efficient-to-simulate regime to an inefficient-to-simulate regime as
measurement strength is varied. Using a mapping from quantum circuits to
statistical mechanical models, we give evidence that a similar computational
phase transition occurs for our algorithms as parameters of the circuit
architecture like the local Hilbert space dimension and circuit depth are
varied.

various domains of computer science. The online $m$-machine list scheduling
problem introduced by Graham has gained theoretical as well as practical
significance in the development of competitive analysis as a performance
measure for online algorithms. In this paper, we study and explore the
performance of Graham's online \textit{list scheduling algorithm(LSA)} for
independent jobs. In the literature, \textit{LSA} has already been proved to be
$2-\frac{1}{m}$ competitive, where $m$ is the number of machines. We present
two new upper bound results on competitive analysis of \textit{LSA}. We obtain
upper bounds on the competitive ratio of $2-\frac{2}{m}$ and
$2-\frac{m^2-m+1}{m^2}$ respectively for practically significant two special
classes of input job sequences. Our analytical results can motivate the
practitioners to design improved competitive online algorithms for the
$m$-machine list scheduling problem by characterization of real life input
sequences.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">Moshe Vardi’s latest insight in the Communications of the ACM </a>(whose title we adopt for this post) agrees with our previous post “<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2019/08/04/because-of-pollution-conferences-should-be-virtual/">Because of pollution, conferences should be virtual.</a>” Vardi calls for “sweeping policy change […] requiring that authors of accepted papers that must fly to  participate in a conference may opt out from in-person involvement and  contribute instead by video.”  Vardi gives some indication of the environmental impact of the travel-based system, and further suspects that in-person conference participation is “much less valuable than we would like to believe.”</p>



<p>These issues are closely related to the decades-old discussion of journals vs. conferences. <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia/">Several older posts on this blog </a>were devoted to that. Lance Fortnow, back in 2009, wrote that it’s <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/abstract">Time for computer science to grow up</a>.  The full text of this article is premium content, but you can read a pre-publication version <a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/growup.pdf">here</a>. Basically, he argues in favor of a journal-based publication system.</p>



<p>Apparently in response, judging from the title, Boaz Barak wrote a piece titled <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/6/202644-computer-science-should-stay-young/abstract">Computer science should stay young.</a> I can’t quickly find a link to the whole thing, but his bottom line is online “I disagree with the conclusion that we should transition to a classical journal-based model similar to that of other fields. I believe conferences offer a number of unique advantages that have helped make computer science dynamic and successful, and can continue to do so in the future.”</p>



<p>I disagree that conferences are young. They belong to the BI (before internet) era, and so look rather anchored in the past to me.  Historically, I also suppose in-person discussion predates writing, though this is irrelevant.  What is young is the health impact of pollution (Fortnow and Barak’s pieces don’t touch on health issues). (By health impact I include climate change, but I prefer not to use that term for various reasons.)</p>



<p>And what is young and cool is arxiv overlay journals, TCS+ talks, videoconferences,  <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/">ECCC</a>, etc.</p>



<p>Instead, we impose on our community most inconvenient transoceanic flights.  To end I’ll quote from <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/MC/269.html">Oded Goldreich’s my choices</a>:</p>



<p><b>Phoenix in June:</b> […] One must be out of their mind to hold a conference under such weather conditions. I guess humans can endure such weather conditions and even worse ones, but why choose to do so? Why call upon people from all over the world to travel to one of the least comfortable locations (per the timing)?</p>

    <title>TR20-001 |  Nullstellensatz Size-Degree Trade-offs from Reversible Pebbling | 

	Or Meir, 

	Susanna de Rezende, 

	Jakob Nordström, 

	Robert Robere</title>
    <summary>We establish an exactly tight relation between reversible pebblings of graphs and Nullstellensatz refutations of pebbling formulas, showing that a graph $G$ can be reversibly pebbled in time $t$ and space $s$ if and only if there is a Nullstellensatz refutation of the pebbling formula over $G$ in size $t+1$ and degree $s$ (independently of the field in which the Nullstellensatz refutation  is made). We use this correspondence to prove a number of strong size-degree trade-offs for Nullstellensatz, which to the best of our   knowledge are the first such results for this proof system.</summary>

Ben Orlin is a funny mathematician. His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Only-Constant-Wisdom-Calculus/dp/0316509086/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=math0b2-20&amp;linkId=4b0342416ae54d5080032b8cc09bfc93&amp;language=en_US">book</a> title <i>Change Is the Only Constant</i> was <a href="https://math-frolic.blogspot.com/2019/12/books-closing-out-2019-with-some-faves.html">selected</a> by the blog <em>Math-Frolic</em> as the best mathematics book of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to try to get you to at least smile, if not laugh.</p>
<p>
Orlin is a funny chap—okay I just got back from London—so forgive me for using “chap”. Check Orlin’s site out for <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/12/30/a-mathematicians-new-years-resolutions/">proof</a> that he is funny. Here are some of his <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/13/literatures-greatest-opening-lines-as-written-by-mathematicians/">examples</a> of math types rewriting famous opening lines from books. We will make this into a kind of quiz. You must guess the book title from the modified quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The times had high variance. <p/>
</li><li>
Up to isomorphism there is one happy family. <p/>
</li><li>
It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were not mod 12. <p/>
</li><li>
All this happened, but not with equality. <p/>
</li><li>
<img alt="{2^2 \cdot 31}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E2+%5Ccdot+31%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^2 \cdot 31}"/> was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom. <p/>
</li><li>
It was zero at the leading ordinal of viewing.
</li></ol>
<p>
The third is the first hard one—I did not get it. The last one (of three from Ken not Ben) is probably unfair. All six of them, however, are on the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Lines-Literature-Coffee-Slaughterhouse/dp/B01D6TGVHW">First Lines Literature Coffee Mug</a>” which Ken received a year ago as a Christmas present from his sister. I did not know this when I chose the first three.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Orlin’s Resolutions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Many of us make resolutions for the new year. Here are some examples from Orlin:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Be better at explaining what I do to family and friends. I, Dick, have trouble with this one.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Not to prove by contradiction what can be proved directly. Assume that <img alt="{1+1 \neq 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1+%5Cneq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1+1 \neq 2}"/> and <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/></p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Stop using the word “obviously.” Here at GLL we try to avoid this, at least when it is not obvious. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/">posted</a> about phrases to avoid a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Our Resolutions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are some of ours:</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Stop doubting quantum computer claims. Unless, adds Ken, you have a possible concrete way of challenging them…</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Start trying to apply AI methods to complexity theory. Could there be a new learning approach to 3-SAT? Note that PAC learning kind-of came from there. See for instance the end of <a href="https://elmos.scripts.mit.edu/mathofdeeplearning/2017/05/08/mathematics-of-deep-learning-lecture-4/">this</a>.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Stop trying to understand proofs that Peano arithmetic is inconsistent. I still do not understand what logic they use to prove that Peano is inconsistent. What if that logic is inconsistent? </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> Start up some fundamental research ideas and attempts on hard problems again.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> And try to make GLL better, including making it appeal to a wider community. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The answers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy: “Happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unlike in its own way.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>1984</em> by George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> by Kurt Vonnegut: “All this happened, more or less.” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Beloved</em> by Toni Morrison, who died this year: “124 was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom.” This <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/quotes/124-was-spiteful.html">explanation</a> of the line continues: “We know all about numbers being spiteful. We took high school algebra. We’ve experienced the pain. But in this instance, the quote isn’t actually referring to a number. There’s not some mysterious mathematical entity that’s come to wreak havoc on the characters in our story. Here, ‘124’ refers to…” <p/>
</li><li>
<em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov: “It was love at first sight…” But wait—this is not the first line of the novel. The first line is maybe not suitable for a coffee mug or family-friendly blog. Instead it is the first line of chapter 29 of part II. We did say it was unfair. <b>Update: Oops</b>—as noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/resolutions-for-2020/#comment-107459">here</a>, it is the first line of <em>Catch-22</em> by Joseph Heller.  Maybe Ken’s Google engine shares his tendency toward chess-playing authors…
</li></ol>
<p>
Have a happy new year, and make some fun resolutions. Please let us know some of them, or ideas for ours.</p>

I mostly use a mix of Google Scholar (for searching), MathSciNet (for more targeted searches, reviews, and high-quality bibtex), and DBLP (for bibtex of CS papers not in MathSciNet) but maybe this will convince me to add ZB into the mix.</p>
  </li>

    <p><a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@christianp/103328394093228909">Christian Lawson-Perfect can’t explain why the Wikipedia article for “Author” was illustrated by a Ukrainian copyright certificate for a supposed proof of Fermat’s last theorem</a>. It seems to have been added in good faith there, but maybe as self-promotion to the “Copyright” article. Whatever, it’s now on “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomathematics">Pseudomathematics</a>” where it belongs.</p>

It’s fast and (for realistic error rates) uses fewer bits than Bloom or cuckoo. Cuckoo still wins if you need your sets dynamic, though: you can insert or delete elements easily, while Bloom can only insert and xor can’t handle any change.</p>

They all appear to generate random tree-like mazes in a square grid, but with different probability distributions on the trees. E.g. Kruskal and Prim generate minimum spanning trees for random weights, different from the uniformly random trees of Aldous–Broder and Wilson, and many others appear quite different from both.
The alternative algorithm at the main link of the via link is probably not the best choice.</p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1208768265830354945">It’s easy for mathematical physics crackpottery to get published in a prestigious-sounding pay-to-publish journal from an actually-prestigious publisher, <em>Nature Scientific Reports</em></a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103355963066100289"/>).
In the ensuing discussion, Flavio Nogueira reports that <a href="https://twitter.com/F_S_Nogueira/status/1208787145911152640">editors rejected papers only to see them published anyway</a>. Should we start treating <em>Nature</em> as a predatory publisher?</p>

I’ve been working on cleaning up Wikipedia’s main convex hull article (not yet finished) and added this one to fill in some details. The problem has an interesting history: it’s been known to be solvable in linear time since 1979, and many different algorithms for the same problem have been published before and since, but most of them are wrong.</p>

I can prove that (in Euclidean spaces) such sets are always Cartesian products of a line with a lower-dimensional set. But is there a reference in the literature for this, so I can add it to the Wikipedia article? If you know, please leave an answer on the MathOverflow link.</p>

We still don’t know whether the differential equations governing fluid flow lead to consistent and unique solutions for all time. But if you simplify the equations to throw away viscosity and compressability, and you allow the initial state of the fluid to have discontinuous boundaries between volumes of fluid with very different motion, you can cause it to reach a point at which it spins infinitely quickly.</p>

It’s not a good fit for my own research, and the word “fuzzy” in the title of one of the initial papers is kind of a red flag for me, but I think it’s a good thing that the move towards diamond-model open access is continuing.</p>

    <title>Complexity Year in Review 2019</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some great theorems this year including <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">non-deterministic double exponential time by quantumly entangled provers</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">integer multiplication in O(n log n) time</a>. But the result of the year has to go to a paper that gave a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/local-kid-makes-history.html">shockingly simple proof of a major longstanding conjecture</a>.<br/>

Of course 2019 will be remembered in some circles for giving us Google's claims of quantum supremacy and all the quantum hype, deserved and otherwise, that goes with it.<br/>

As we move into the 2020s, we tend to look back and look forward. The 2010s will go down as the decade computing and data transformed society, for better and worse. Google turned 21 this year as its OG leadership stepped down. I turned 21 in 1984, but 1984 seems closer than ever.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Last year we ended the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/12/complexity-year-in-review-2018.html">year in review</a> by </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
We end the year with craziness, the stock market is going through wild gyrations, we have a partial government shutdown including all of NSF and an uncertain political landscape with different parties leading the two houses of congress. We're still in the midst of a technological revolution and governments around the world try to figure how to regulate it. I find it hard to predict 2019 but it will not be quiet.</blockquote>
2019 was not quiet and we're about to head into an impeachment trial, Brexit and a critical US presidential election. The real challenges of the twenties will come from massive transformation from automation, climate change and deepening divisions in our society. How will academia cope with changing demographics, financial challenges and educating to manage the technological revolution?<br/>
<br/>
Let's all take a deep breath, roll up our sleeves and get the decade going.</div>

    <title>TR19-186 |  Lifting with Simple Gadgets and Applications to Circuit and Proof Complexity | 

	Or Meir, 

	Susanna de Rezende, 

	Jakob Nordström, 

	Robert Robere, 

	Toniann Pitassi</title>
    <summary>We significantly strengthen and generalize the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and  Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as  equality and greater-than. We apply our generalized theorem to solve two open problems:

* We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded    coefficients.
Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.

* We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Specifically, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.  
  
An important technical ingredient, which may be of independent interest, is that we show that the Nullstellensatz degree of refuting the pebbling formula over a DAG $G$ over any field coincides exactly with the reversible pebbling price of $G$. 
In particular, this implies that the standard decision tree complexity and the parity  decision tree complexity of the corresponding falsified clause search problem are equal.</summary>

    <title>A bet for the new decade</title>
    <summary>I am in Tel Aviv Theory Fest this week – a fantastic collection of talks and workshops organized by Yuval Filmus , Gil Kalai, Ronen Eldan, and Muli Safra.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I am in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tau-theory-fest/home">Tel Aviv Theory Fest</a> this week – a fantastic collection of talks and workshops organized by Yuval Filmus , Gil Kalai, Ronen Eldan, and Muli Safra.</p>



<p>It was a good chance to catch up with many friends and colleagues. In particular I met Elchanan Mossel and Subhash Khot, who asked me to serve as a “witness” for their bet on the unique games conjecture. I am recording it here so we can remember it a decade from noe.</p>



<p>Specifically, Elchanan bets that the Unique Games conjecture will be proven in the next decade – sometime between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2029 there will be a paper uploaded to the arxiv with a correct proof of the conjecture. Subhash bets that this won’t happen. They were not sure what to bet on, but eventually agreed to take my offer that the loser will have to collaborate on a problem chosen by the winner, so I think science will win in either case. (For what it’s worth, I think there is a good chance that Subhash will lose the bet because he himself will prove the UGC in this decade, though it’s always possible Subhash can both win the bet and prove the UGC if he manages to do it by tomorrow <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> )</p>

<p>The conference itself is, as I mentioned, wonderful with an amazing collection of speakers.  Let me mention just a couple of talks from this morning. Shafi Goldwasser talked about “Law and Algorithms”. There is a recent area of research studying how to regulate algorithms, but Shafi’s talk focused mostly on the other direction: how algorithms and cryptography can help achieve legal objectives such as the “right to be forgotten” or the ability to monitor secret proceedings such as wiretap requests. </p>



<p>Christos Papadimitriou  talked about “Language, Brain, and Computation”.  Christos is obviously excited about understanding the language mechanisms in the brain. He said that studying the brain gives him the same feeling that you get when you sit in a coffee shop in Cambridge and hear intellectual discussions all around you: you don’t understand why everyone is not dropping everything they are doing and come here. (Well, his actual words were “sunsets over the Berkeley hills” but I think the Cambridge coffee shops are a better metaphor <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> )</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I started out this decade with the project of writing a survey of the multi-armed bandit literature, which I had read thoroughly during the graduate studies that I was about to finish. At the time we resisted the temptation to name the survey “modern banditology”, which was indeed the right call given how much this “modern” picture has evolved over the decade! It is truly wonderful to now end the decade with two new iterations on the work we did in that survey: </p>
<ol>
<li><a class="lipdf" href="https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf">Bandit algorithms</a> by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari</li>
<li><a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07272">Introduction to bandits</a> by Alex Slivkins</li>
</ol>
<p>These new references very significantly expand the 2012 survey, and they are wonderful starting points for anyone who wants to enter the field.</p>
<p>Here are some of the discoveries in the world of bandits that stood out for me this decade:</p>
<ol>
<li>We now understand very precisely Thompson Sampling, the first bandit strategy that was proposed back in 1933. The most beautiful reference here is the one by Dan Russo and Ben Van Roy: <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-087/14-087.pdf">An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling</a>, JMLR 2016. Another one that stands out is <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v23/agrawal12/agrawal12.pdf">Analysis of thompson sampling for the multi-armed bandit problem</a> by S. Agrawal and N. Goyal at COLT 2012.</li>
<li>T^{2/3} lower bound for  *non-stochastic* bandit with switching cost by Dekel, Ding, Koren and Peres at <u><font color="#000121"><a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997">STOC 201</a></font></u><a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997">4</a>. This is a striking result for several reasons. In particular the proof has to be based on a non-trivial stochastic process, since for the classical stochastic i.i.d. model one can obtain \sqrt{T} (very easily in fact). </li>
<li>We now know that bandit convex optimization is “easy”, in the sense that it is a \sqrt{T}-regret type problem. What’s more is that in our <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03084">STOC 2017 paper</a> with Y.T. Lee and R. Eldan we introduced a new way to do function estimation based on bandit feedback, using kernels (I have written at length about this on <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/08/06/kernel-based-methods-for-bandit-convex-optimization-part-1/">this blog</a>).</li>
<li>A very intriguing model of computation for contextual bandit was proposed, where one can access the policy space only through an offline optimization oracle. With such access, the classical Exp4 algorithm cannot be simulated, and thus one needs new strategies. We now have a reasonable understanding that \sqrt{T} is doable with mild assumptions (see e.g. this ICML 2014 paper on “<u><font color="#000117"><a class="liexternal" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0555">Taming the Monster</a></font>“</u> by Hsu, Kale, Langford, L. Li and Schapire) and that it is impossible with no assumptions (work of Hazan and Koren at <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02089">STOC 2016</a>).</li>
<li>Honorable mentions also go to the work of Wei and Luo showing that very strong variation bounds are possible in bandits (see this <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03265">COLT 2018 paper</a>), and Zimmert and Seldin who made striking progress on the best of both worlds phenomenon that we discovered with Slivkins at the beginning of the decade (I blogged about it <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/">here</a> already).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Life beyond bandits</h2>
<p>In addition to starting the decade with the bandit survey, I also started it with being bored with the bandit topic altogether. I thought that many (if not most) of the fundamental results were now known, and it was a good idea to move on to something else. Obviously I was totally wrong, as you can see with all the works cited above (and many many more for stochastic bandits, including much deeper understanding of best arm identification, a topic very close to my heart, see e.g., <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/kaufman16a/kaufman16a.pdf">[Kaufmann, Cappe, Garivier, JMLR 16]</a>). In fact I am now optimistic that there is probably another decade-worth of exploration left for the bandit problem(s). Nevertheless I ventured outside, and explored the world of optimization (out of which first came <a class="lipdf" href="http://sbubeck.com/Bubeck15.pdf">a survey</a>, and more recently <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0oZPbS-UD_kwT4ePZQx_CiME">video lectures</a>) and briefly networks (another <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03511">modest survey</a> came out of this too). </p>
<p>Here are some of the landmark optimization results of this decade in my view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perhaps the most striking result of the decade in optimization is the observation that for finite sum problems, one can reduce the variance in stochastic gradient descent by somehow centering the estimates (e.g., using a slowly moving sequence on which we can afford to compute full gradients; but this is not the only way to perform such variance reduction). This idea, while very simple, has a lot of implications, both in practice and in theory! The origin of the idea are in the SAG algorithm of <a class="liexternal" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4633-a-stochastic-gradient-method-with-an-exponential-convergence-_ra">[Schmidt, Le Roux, Bach, NIPS 2012]</a> and SDCA <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/shalev-shwartz13a/shalev-shwartz13a.pdf">[Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, JMLR 2013]</a>. A simpler instantiation of the idea, called SVRG appeared shortly after in <a class="lipdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf">[Johnson and Zhang, NIPS 2013]</a> (and also independently at the same NeurIPS, in <a class="liinternal" href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4941-mixed-optimization-for-smooth-functions">[M. Madhavi, L. Zhang, R. Li, NIPS 2013]</a>).</li>
<li>An intriguing direction that I pursued fervently is the use of convex optimization for problems that have a priori nothing to do with convex optimization. A big inspiration for me was the COLT 2008 paper by Abernethy, Hazan and Rakhlin, who showed how mirror descent naturally solves bandit problems. In this decade, we (this we includes myself and co-authors, but also various other teams) explored how to use mirror descent for other online decision making problems, and made progress on some long-standing problems (k-server and MTS), see for example this set of <a class="liinternal" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0obG1b3w4k41JMLFbyBJS5AQ">video lectures</a> on the “Five miracles of mirror descent”.</li>
<li>Arnak Dalalyan showed how to use ideas inspired from convex optimization to <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7392">analyze the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm</a>. This was absolutely beautiful work, that led to many many follow-ups.</li>
<li>There has been a lot of rewriting of Nesterov’s acceleration, to try to demystify it. Overall the enterprise is not yet a resounding success in my opinion, but certainly a lot of progress has been made (again I have written a lot about it on this blog already). We now even have optimal acceleration for higher order of smoothness (see this 15 authors <u><font color="#000117"/><font><a class="lipdf" href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/gasnikov19b/gasnikov19b.pdf">paper at COLT 2019</a></font></u>), but these techniques are clouded with the same shroud of mystery as was Nesterov’s original method.</li>
<li>Yin Tat Lee and Aaron Sidford obtained an <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08033">efficient construction of a universal barrier</a>.</li>
<li>We now know that certain problems cannot be efficiently represented by SDPs (the so-called “extension complexity), see e.g. this work by <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6317">Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer</a>.</li>
<li>We now know how to chase convex bodies, and we can even do so very elegantly with <a class="liinternal" href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/11/05/convex-body-chasing-steiner-point-sellke-point-and-soda-2020-best-papers/">the Steiner/Sellke point</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Some other things that captivated me</h2>
<p>The papers above are mostly topics on which I tried to work at some point. Here are some questions that I didn’t work on but followed closely and was fascinated by the progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stochastic block model was essentially solved during this decade, see for example <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~eabbe/publications/abbe_FNT_2.pdf">this survey</a> by Emmanuel Abbe.</li>
<li>The computational/statistical tradeoffs were extensively explored, yet they remain mysterious. A nice impulse to the field was given by this <a class="liinternal" href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1378386239">COLT 2013 paper</a> by Berthet and Rigollet relating sparse PCA and planted clique. In a similar spirit I also enjoyed the more recent work by Moitra, Jerry Li, and many co-authors on computationally efficient robust estimation (see e.g., <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11366">this recent paper</a>)</li>
<li>Adaptive data analysis strikes me as both very important in practice, and quite deep theoretically, see e.g. <a class="lipdf" href="http://nematilab.info/bmijc/assets/091218_paper.pdf">the reusable holdout by Dwork et al</a>. A related paper that I liked a lot is this <a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585">ICML 2015 paper</a> by Blum and Hardt, which essentially explores the regularization effect of publishing only models that beat the state of the art significantly (more generally this is an extremely interesting question, of why we can keep using the same datasets to evaluate progress in machine learning, see this provokingly titled paper “<a class="liinternal" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?</a>“).</li>
<li>A general trend has been in finding very fast (nearly linear time) method for many classical problems. Sometimes these investigations even led to actually practical algorithm, as with this now classical paper by Marco Cuturi at NIPS 2013 titled “<a class="liexternal" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4927-sinkhorn-distances-lightspeed-computation-of-optimal-transport">Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport</a>“.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Oh, one last thing</h2>
<p>I also heard that, surprisingly, gradient descent can work to optimize highly non-convex functions such as training loss for neural networks. Not sure what this is about, it’s a pretty obscure topic, maybe it will catch up in the decade 2020-2029…</p>
<h2>Share some more in the comments!</h2>
<p>The above is only a tiny sample, there were many many more interesting directions being explored (tensor methods for latent variable models <a class="lipdf" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/anandkumar14b/anandkumar14b.pdf">[Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, Telgarsky, JMLR 14]</a>; phenomenon of “all local minima are good” for various non-convex learning problems, see e.g., <a class="liexternal" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6048-matrix-completion-has-no-spurious-local-minimum">[Ge, Lee, Ma, NIPS 2016]</a>; etc etc).

    <title>TR19-185 |  Strategy-Stealing is Non-Constructive | 

	Greg Bodwin, 

	Ofer Grossman</title>
    <summary>In many combinatorial games, one can prove that the first player wins under best play using a simple but non-constructive argument called strategy-stealing.
This work is about the complexity behind these proofs: how hard is it to actually find a winning move in a game, when you know by strategy-stealing that one exists? 
We prove that this problem is PSPACE-Complete already for Minimum Poset Games and Symmetric Maker-Maker Games, which are simple classes of games that capture two of the main types of strategy-stealing arguments in the current literature.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>[The post below is by Dorit Aharonov who co-organized the wonderful school on quantum computing last week which I attended and greatly enjoyed. –Boaz] </em></p>



<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong> Last week we had a wonderful one-week intro course into the math of quantum computing at Hebrew U;  It included a one day crash course on the basics, and 7 mini-courses on math-oriented research topics (quantum delegation, Hamiltonian complexity, algorithms and more) by top-notch speakers. Most importantly – it is all online, and could be very useful if you want to take a week or two to enter the area and don’t know <a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">where to start</a>.   </p>



<p><br/><br/><br/></p>



<p>Hi Theory people!  </p>



<p>I want to tell you about a 5-days winter school called “<a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The Mathematics of Quantum Computation</a>“, which we (me, Zvika Brakerski, Or Sattath and Amnon Ta-Shma) organized last week at the Institute for advanced studies (IIAS) at the Hebrew university in Jerusalem. </p>



<p>There were two reasons I happily agreed to Boaz’s suggestion to write a guest blogpost about this school. <br/><br/>a) The school was really great fun. We enjoyed it so much, that I think you might find it interesting to hear about it even if you were not there, or are not even into quantum computation. <br/><br/>And b), it might actually be useful for you or your quantum-curious friends. We put all material online, with the goal in mind that after the school, this collection of talks+written material will constitute all that is needed for an almost self-contained <strong>very-intensive-one-week-course of introduction into the mathematical side of quantum computation</strong>; I think this might be of real use for any theoretical computer scientist or mathematician interested in entering this fascinating but hard-to-penetrate area, and not knowing where to start.<br/>Before telling you a little more about what we actually learned in this school, let’s start with some names and numbers. We had:  </p>



<ul><li>160 participants (students and faculty) from all over the world. </li><li>7 terrific speakers: Adam Bouland (UC Berkeley), Sergey Bravyi (IBM), Matthias Christandl (Coppenhagen), András Gilyén (Caltech), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), Avishay Tal (Berkeley), and Thomas Vidick (Caltech); </li><li>2 great TAs:  András Gilyén (Caltech) and Chinmay Nirkhe (UC Berkeley)</li><li>4 busy organizers: myself (Hebrew U), Zvika Brakerski (Weizmann), Or Sattath (Ben Gurion U), and Amnon Ta-Shma (Tel Aviv U)</li><li>1 exciting and very intensive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcFzE1PHxBN4l87sOQB033FZLTgY934GHxnpVKi3NaM/edit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">program</a></li><li>5 challenging and fascinating days of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"> talks</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">problem sessions</a> and really <a href="https://shvil.im/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">nice food</a>.   </li><li>1 great <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=599bc3e9-855e-42c1-ab1d-ab1f0062c481" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Rabin’s lecture</a> by Boaz Barak (Harvard)</li><li>1 beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxrxXneg3lU&amp;list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb&amp;index=21&amp;t=0s" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Quantum perspective lecture</a> by Sergey Bravyi (IBM)</li><li>8 panelists in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">supremacy panel</a> we had on the fifth day: Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), our wise moderator, and 7 panelists on stage and online: myself, Scott Aaronson (Austin, online), Boaz Barak, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo (Google, online), Gil Kalai (Hebrew U), and Umesh Vazirani (UC Berkeley, online) </li><li>8 brave speakers in the gong show, our very last session, each talking for 3 minutes;    </li><li>1 group-tour to 1 UNESCO site (<a href="https://everything-everywhere.com/caves-of-maresha-and-bet-guvrin-in-the-judean-lowlands-as-a-microcosm-of-the-land-of-the-caves/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tel Maresha</a>) and <a href="https://www.srigim-beer.co.il/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">6 beers tasted</a> by ~80 tour participants</li><li>3 problem sets with 43 <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">problems</a> and (!) their <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">solution</a>s.   </li></ul>



<p>So why did we decide to organize this particular quantum school, given the many quantum schools around? Well, the area of quantum computation is just bursting now with excitement and new mathematical challenges; But there seems to be no easy way for theoreticians to learn about all these things unless you are already in the loop… The (admittedly) very ambitious goal of the school was to assume zero background in quantum computation, and quickly bring people up to speed on six or seven of the most interesting mathematical research forefronts in the area. </p>



<p>The first day of the school was intended to put everyone essentially on the same page: it included four talks about the very basics (qubits by Or Sattath, circuits, by myself, algorithms by Adam Bouland, and error correction by Sergey Bravyi). By the end of this first day everyone was at least supposed to be familiar with the basic concepts, and capable of listening to the mini-courses to follow. The rest of the school was devoted mainly to those mini-courses, whose topics included what I think are some of the most exciting topics on the more theoretical and mathematical side of quantum computation.</p>



<p>Yes, it was extremely challenging… the good thing was that we had two great TAs, András and Chinmay, who helped prepare problem sets, which people actually seriously tried to solve (!) during the daily one+ hour TA problem-solving sessions (with the help of the team strolling around ready to answer questions…). It seems that this indeed helped people follow, despite the fact that we did get into some hard stuff in those mini-courses… The many questions that were asked throughout the school proved that many people were following and interested till the bitter end. </p>



<p>So here is a summary of the mini-courses, by order of appearance. <br/>I added some buzz words of interesting related mathematical notions so that you know where these topics might lead you if you take the paths they suggest.   <br/></p>



<ul><li> Thomas Vidick gave a three-lecture wonderfully clear mini-course providing an intro to the recently very active and exciting area of <strong>quantum verification and delegation</strong>, connecting cryptography and quantum computational complexity. [Thomas didn’t have time to talk about it, but down the road this eventually connects to  approximate representation theory, as well as to Connes embedding conjecture, and more.]</li><li> Sandy Irani gave a beautiful exposition (again, in a a three lecture mini-course) on <strong>quantum Hamiltonian complexity</strong>. Sandy started with Kitaev’s quantum version of the Cook Levin theorem, showing that the local Hamiltonian problem is quantum NP complete; she then explained how this can be extended to more physically relevant questions such as translationally invariant 1D systems, questions about the thermodynamical limit, and more. [This topic is related to open questions such as quantum PCP, which was not mentioned in the school, as well as to beautiful recent results about undecidability of the spectral gap problem, and more.]    </li><li> Matthias Christandl gave an exciting two-lecture mini-course on the fascinating connection between <strong>tensor ranks and matrix product multiplication</strong>. Starting from what seemed to be childish games with small pictures in his first talk, he cleverly used those as his building blocks in his second talk, to enable him to talk about Strassen’s universal spectral points program for approaching the complexity of matrix multiplication, asymptotic ranks, border ranks and more. That included also very beautiful pictures of polytopes! Matthias explained the connection that underlines this entire direction, between entanglement properties of three body systems, with these old combinatorial problems.  </li><li> Avishay Tal gave a really nice two-lecture exposition on his recent breakthrough result with Ran Raz, proving that <strong>quantum polynomial time computation is not contained in the polynomial Hierarchy, in the oracle model</strong>. This included talking about AC0, a problem called forrelation, Fourier expansion, Gaussians and much more.</li><li>  András Gilyén gave a wonderful talk about a recent development: the evolution of the <strong>singular value approach to quantum algorithms</strong>. He left us all in awe showing that essentially almost any quantum algorithm you can think of falls into this beautiful framework… Among other things, he mentioned Chebychev’s polynomials, quantum walks, Hamiltonian simulations, and more. What else can be done with this framework remains to be seen.</li><li>Sergey Bravyi gave two talks (on top of his intro to quantum error correction). The first was as part of a monthly series at Hebrew university, called  “quantum perspectives”; in this talk, Sergey gave a really nice exposition of his breakthrough result (with Gosset and Konig) demonstrating an <strong><em>information theoretical</em> separation between quantum and classical constant depth circuits</strong>; this uses in a clever way the well known quantum magic square game enabling quantum correlations to win with probability one, while classical correlations are always bounded away from one;  somehow this result manages to cleverly turn this game into a computational advantage. In Sergey’s last talk, he gave the basics of the beautiful topic of <strong>stoqaustic Hamiltonians </strong>–  a model in between quantum Hamiltonians and classical constrained satisfaction problems, which poses many fundamental and interesting open questions (and is tightly related to classical Markov chains, and Markov chain Monte Carlo). </li><li>Finally, Adam Bouland gave two superb talks on <strong>quantum supremacy</strong>, explaining the beautiful challenges in this area – including his recent average case to worst case hardness results about sampling using quantum circuits, which is related to Google’s supremacy experiment.  </li><li>Ah, I also gave a talk – it was about three of the many different equivalent models of quantum computation – <strong>adiabatic computation</strong>, <strong>quantum walks</strong>, and the <strong>Jones polynomial </strong>(I also briefly mentioned a differential geometry model). The talk came out way too disordered in my mind (never give a talk when you are an organizer!), but hopefully it gave some picture about the immense variety of ways to think about quantum computation and quantum algorithms.</li></ul>



<p>In addition to the main lectures, we also had some special events intertwined: </p>



<ul><li>Boaz Barak gave the distinguished annual Rabin lecture, joint with the CS colloquium; His talk, which was given the intriguing title  <strong>“Quantum computing and classical algorithms: The best of frenemies”</strong>, focused on the fickle relationships between quantum and classical algorithms. The main players in this beautiful talk were SDPs and sums of squares, and it left us with many open questions.     </li><li>Last but not least, we had an <strong>international panel about the meaning of Google’s recent experiment claiming supremacy</strong>, joined by Sergio Boixo from Google explaining the experiment, as well as Scott Aaronson and Umesh Vazirani who woke up very early in the US to join us. I feared we would have some friction and fist fights, but this actually became a deep and interesting discussion! We went with quite some depth into the most important question in my mind about the supremacy experiment, which is the issue of noise; Unbelievably, it all went well even from the technological aspect! I really recommend watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">discussion</a>. </li></ul>



<p>So, we had a great time…. and as I said, one of the best things is that it is all recorded and saved. You are welcome to follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcFzE1PHxBN4l87sOQB033FZLTgY934GHxnpVKi3NaM/edit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">program</a>, watch the recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">talks</a>, consult the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Lecture notes, slides, and the problems sets and their solutions</a>, and also read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-DLl_M-Dpqh9RdSqn6f9l01e09AaLndMlbxDEmlPrw/edit?ts=5dc7c2b3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">reading material</a> if you want to extend your knowledge beyond what is covered in the school. In case you know of any math or TCS-oriented person who wants to enter the field and start working on some problem at the forefront of research, just send him or her this post, or the link of the <a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">school’s website</a>;  It will take a very intensive week (well, maybe two) of following lectures and doing the exercises, but by the end of that time, one is guaranteed to be no longer a complete amateur to the area, as the set of topics covered gives a pretty good picture of what is going on in the field.   <br/>  </p>



<p>Last but not least, I would like to thank the Israeli quantum initiative, Vatat, and the IIAS, for their generous funding which enabled this school and the funding of students; the IIAS team for their immense help in organization;   and of course, thanks a lot to all participants who attended the school!<br/></p>



<p>Wishing everyone a very happy year of 2020,  </p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In the wake of two culture-war posts—the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">first</a> on the term “quantum supremacy,” the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4476">second</a> on the acronym “NIPS”—it’s clear that we all need to cool off with something anodyne and uncontroversial.  Fortunately, this holiday season, I know just the thing to bring everyone together: groaning about quantum computing hype!</p>



<p>When I was at the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B conference</a> in San Jose, I learned about lots of cool stuff that’s happening in the wake of Google’s quantum supremacy announcement.  I heard about the 57-qubit superconducting chip that the Google group is now building, following up on its 53-qubit one; and also about their first small-scale experimental demonstration of my certified randomness protocol.  I learned about recent progress on costing out the numbers of qubits and gates needed to do fault-tolerant quantum simulations of useful chemical reactions (IIRC, maybe a hundred thousand qubits and a few hours’ worth of gates—scary, but not Shor’s algorithm scary).</p>



<p>I also learned about two claims about quantum algorithms that startups have made, and which are being wrongly interpreted.  The basic pattern is one that I’ve come to know well over the years, and which you could call a science version of the <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/SHATVO-2.pdf">motte-and-bailey</a>.  (For those not up on nerd blogosphere terminology: in medieval times, the motte was a dank castle to which you’d retreat while under attack; the bailey was the desirable land that you’d farm once the attackers left.)</p>



<p>To wit:</p>



<ol><li>Startup makes claims that have both a true boring interpretation (e.g., you can do X with a quantum computer), as well as a false exciting interpretation (e.g., you can do X with a quantum computer, <em>and it would actually make sense to do this, because you’ll get an asymptotic speedup over the best known classical algorithm</em>).</li><li>Lots of business and government people get all excited, because they assume the false exciting interpretation must be true (or why else would everyone be talking about this?).  Some of those people ask me for comment.</li><li>I look into it, perhaps by asking the folks at the startup.  The startup folks clarify that they meant only the true boring interpretation.  To be sure, they’re actively <em>exploring</em> the false exciting interpretation—whether some parts of it might be true after all—but they’re certainly not making any claims about it that would merit, say, a harsh post on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>.</li><li>I’m satisfied to have gotten to the bottom of things, and I tell the startup folks to go their merry way.</li><li>Yet many people continue to seem as excited as if the false exciting interpretation had been shown to be true.  They continue asking me questions that presuppose its truth.</li></ol>



<p>Our first instance of this pattern is the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2227387-quantum-computer-sets-new-record-for-finding-prime-number-factors/">recent claim</a>, by <a href="https://www.zapatacomputing.com/">Zapata Computing</a>, to have set a world record for integer factoring (1,099,551,473,989 =  1,048,589 × 1,048,601) with a quantum computer, by running a QAOA/variational algorithm on IBM’s superconducting device.  Gosh!  That sure sounds a lot better than the 21 that’s been factored with Shor’s algorithm, doesn’t it?</p>



<p>I read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08927">Zapata paper</a> that this is based on, entitled “Variational Quantum Factoring,” and I don’t believe that a single word in it is false.  My issue is something the paper <em>omits</em>: namely, that once you’ve reduced factoring to a generic optimization problem, you’ve thrown away all the mathematical structure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> cleverly exploits, and that makes factoring asymptotically easy for a quantum computer.  And hence there’s no reason to expect your quantum algorithm to scale any better than brute-force trial division (or in the most optimistic scenario, trial division enhanced with Grover search).  On large numbers, your algorithm will be roundly outperformed even by <em>classical</em> algorithms that do exploit structure, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve">Number Field Sieve</a>.  Indeed, the quantum computer’s success at factoring the number will have had little or nothing to do with its being <em>quantum</em> at all—a classical optimization algorithm would’ve served as well.  And thus, the only reasons to factor a number on a quantum device in this way, would seem to be stuff like calibrating the device.</p>



<p>Admittedly, to people who work in quantum algorithms, everything above is so obvious that it doesn’t need to be said.  But I learned at Q2B that there are interested people for whom this is <em>not</em> obvious, and even comes as a revelation.  So that’s why I’m saying it.</p>



<p>Again and again over the past twenty years, I’ve seen people reinvent the notion of a “simpler alternative” to Shor’s algorithm: one that cuts out all the difficulty of building a fault-tolerant quantum computer.  In every case, the trouble, typically left unstated, has been that these alternatives <em>also</em> cut out the exponential speedup that’s Shor’s algorithm’s raison d’être.</p>



<p>Our second example today of a quantum computing motte-and-bailey is the claim, by Toronto-based quantum computing startup <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199">Gaussian BosonSampling</a> can be used to solve all sorts of graph problems, like graph isomorphism, graph similarity, and densest subgraph.  As the co-inventor of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling">BosonSampling</a>, few things would warm my heart more than finding an actual application for that model (besides quantum supremacy experiments and, perhaps, certified random number generation).  But I still regard this as an open problem—if by “application,” we mean outperforming what you could’ve done classically.</p>



<p>In papers (see for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10644">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12646">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10730">here</a>), members of the Xanadu team have given all sorts of ways to take a graph, and encode it into an instance of Gaussian BosonSampling, in such a way that the output distribution will then reveal features of the graph, like its isomorphism type or its dense subgraphs.  The trouble is that so far, I’ve seen no indications that this will actually lead to quantum algorithms that outperform the best classical algorithms, for any graph problems of practical interest.</p>



<p>In the case of Densest Subgraph, the Xanadu folks use the output of a Gaussian BosonSampler to seed (that is, provide an initial guess for) a classical local search algorithm.  They say they observe better results this way than if they seed that classical local search algorithm with completely random initial conditions.  But of course, the real question is: could we get equally good results by seeding with the output of some <em>classical</em> heuristic?  Or by solving Densest Subgraph with a different approach entirely?  Given how hard it’s turned out to be just to <em>verify</em> that the outputs of a BosonSampling device come from such a device at all, it would seem astonishing if the answer to these questions wasn’t “yes.”</p>



<p>In the case of Graph Isomorphism, the situation is even clearer.  There, the central claim made by the Xanadu folks is that given a graph G, they can use a Gaussian BosonSampling device to sample a probability distribution that encodes G’s isomorphism type.  So, isn’t this “promising” for solving GI with a quantum computer?  All you’d need to do now is invent some fast classical algorithm that could look at the samples coming from two graphs G and H, and tell you whether the probability distributions were the same.</p>



<p>Except, not really.  While the Xanadu paper never says so, if all you want is to sample a distribution that encodes a graph’s isomorphism type, that’s easy to do classically!  (I even put this on the final exam for my undergraduate Quantum Information Science course a couple weeks ago.)  Here’s how: given as input a graph G, just output G but with its vertices randomly permuted.  Indeed, this will even provide a further property, better than anything the BosonSampling approach has been shown to provide (or than it probably does provide): namely, if G and H are <em>not</em> isomorphic, then the two probability distributions will not only be different but will have disjoint supports.  Alas, this still leaves us with the problem of distinguishing which distribution a given sample came from, which is as hard as Graph Isomorphism itself.  None of these approaches, classical or quantum, seem to lead to any algorithm that’s subexponential time, let alone competitive with the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2521">“Babai approach”</a> of thinking really hard about graphs.</p>



<p>All of this stuff falls victim to what I regard as the Fundamental Error of Quantum Algorithms Research: namely, to treat it as “promising” that a quantum algorithm works at all, or works better than some brute-force classical algorithm, without asking yourself whether there are any indications that your approach will <em>ever</em> be able to exploit interference of amplitudes to outperform the <em>best</em> classical algorithm.</p>



<p>Incidentally, I’m not sure exactly why, but in practice, a major red flag that the Fundamental Error is about to be committed is when someone starts talking about “hybrid quantum/classical algorithms.”  By this they seem to mean: “outside the domain of traditional quantum algorithms, so don’t judge us by the standards of that domain.”  But I liked the way someone at Q2B put it to me: <em>every</em> quantum algorithm is a “hybrid quantum/classical algorithm,” with classical processors used wherever they can be, and qubits used only where they must be.</p>



<p>The other thing people do, when challenged, is to say “well, admittedly we have no <em>rigorous proof</em> of an asymptotic quantum speedup”—thereby brilliantly reframing the whole conversation, to make people like me look like churlish theoreticians insisting on an impossible and perhaps irrelevant standard of rigor, blind to some huge practical quantum speedup that’s about to change the world.  The real issue, of course, is not that they haven’t given a <em>proof</em> of a quantum speedup (in either the real world or the black-box world); rather, it’s that they’ve typically given no reasons whatsoever to think that there <em>might</em> be a quantum speedup, compared to the best classical algorithms available.</p>



<p>In the holiday spirit, let me end on a positive note.  When I did the Q&amp;A at Q2B—the same one where Sarah Kaiser asked me to comment on the term “quantum supremacy”—one of my answers touched on the most important theoretical open problems about sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments.  At the top of the list, I said, was whether there’s some interactive protocol by which a near-term quantum computer can not only exhibit quantum supremacy, but <em>prove</em> it to a polynomial-time-bounded classical skeptic.  I mentioned that there was <em>one</em> proposal for how to do this, in the IQP model, due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.0847">Bremner and Shepherd</a>, from way back in 2008.  I said that their proposal deserved much more attention than it had received, and that trying to break it would be one obvious thing to work on.  Little did I know that, <strong>literally while I was speaking</strong>, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05547">paper was being posted to the arXiv</a>, by Gregory Kahanamoku-Meyer, that claims to break Bremner and Shepherd’s protocol.  I haven’t yet studied the paper, but assuming it’s correct, it represents the first clear progress on this problem in years (even though of a negative kind).  Cool!!</p></div>

<p>
Kathryn Farley is my dear wife. We just celebrated Christmas together and then went off to London for a holiday.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would share a gift with you.<br/>
<span id="more-16497"/></p>
<p>
Kathryn and I exchange books for the holiday. We do not wrap them—our tradition, which she started years ago. I like doing this. Ken’s family re-uses wrapping paper year-to-year. I am pleased to see that there is a call to save wrapping on three <a href="https://frugalkite.com/zero-waste-christmas-three-genius-wrapping-methods/">gifts</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If every American family wrapped just 3 presents in reused materials, it would save enough paper to cover 45,000 football fields. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Kathryn gave me a wonderful collection of books. One of them is not the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Rigidity-Moduli-Large-Scale-Riemannian/dp/B01FJ1E910">book</a>: <i>Computers, Rigidity, and Moduli: The Large-Scale Fractal Geometry of Riemannian Moduli Space</i>. The author is Shmuel Weinberger a mathematician from the University of Chicago. I already had his book but finally took a look at it while browsing my other gifts. So it is a delayed gift, from a Christmas past.</p>
<p>
The book is a combination of computer results, basic math results, and advanced math results. The last are a variety of topics that are well outside of my zone. I did like the book. Weinberger is a terrific writer, a terrific explainer, a gifted selector of topics. I was surprised to see that his book contained a puzzle that I had not thought about before. The puzzle is, like all good puzzles, easy to state—but hard to solve. At least for me. I did not see how to solve it. I hope you like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Puzzle </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Imagine that there are <img alt="{2n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2n}"/> distinct points in the plane. No three points are collinear. Half of them, <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> are labeled <font color="red"><b>red</b></font> and the other half are labelled <font color="green"><b>green</b></font>. Festive colors. Your job is to connect each red point with a unique green point by a straight line. That is easy, of course. But we hate when lines cross. So your job is more: Please select the lines so that the fewest ones cross.</p>
<p>
Thus the problem is. Find the fewest line crossings possible. As usual we wish to know the answer as a function of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>. Is it <img alt="{\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\sqrt{n}}"/>? Or <img alt="{\log(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log(n)}"/>? What is the best possible in the worst case?</p>
<p>
The artwork on the wall behind Kathryn suggests a possible arrangement, likewise the floor. The art object directly behind her is in 3D space which is not allowed—but this is a photograph so its points are projected onto a plane anyway. Again, it’s important that no three points are collinear. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> There is a Best </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
For start we note that there is always a best. Each of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> red points can match one of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> green points. So there are only a finite number of possible matchings, namely 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n%21+%3D+n+%5Ctimes+%28n-1%29+%5Ctimes+%5Ccdots+%5Ctimes+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  n! = n \times (n-1) \times \cdots \times 1. "/></p>
<p>This shows that there is always a best answer; moreover, it can be found. But <img alt="{n!}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%21%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n!}"/> can be huge, so another part of the question is: Can you find the best answer fast? How about finding the best answer in polynomial time?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> A Solution </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The best answer is that the number of crossings is always at most 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  b(n) = c \log(n), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b%28n%29+%3D+c+%5Clog%28n%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  b(n) = c \log(n), "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is the constant 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2}- 13^{2} - 14^{2}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++10%5E%7B2%7D%2B11%5E%7B2%7D%2B12%5E%7B2%7D-+13%5E%7B2%7D+-+14%5E%7B2%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2}- 13^{2} - 14^{2}. "/></p>
<p>
Here is a proof that this bound is correct. Suppose that you have selected the fewest number of line crossings. We will argue that there are at most <img alt="{b(n)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{b(n)}"/> line crossings. The plan is to show that we can descend—that is given a matching we can try and decrease the number of lines that cross. </p>
<p>
Given any two red nodes and any two green nodes, we can define the operation <em>swap</em> by having them exchange partners. If their lines cross before the swap, then after the swap the lines will <em>not</em> cross. The following figure shows this:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/points.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16500" height="217" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/points.png?w=300&amp;h=217" width="300"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Oops. I thought the idea was to define an operation so that the number of line crossing could always be decreased. Wait the argument does not work. In the above figure the switch <em>increases</em> the number of crossings.</p>
<p>
There is a saving trick, however. Do not attempt to decrease the number of lines that cross. Instead decrease the total <i>length</i> of the lines selected. The above figure can be turned into a proof of a lemma that a <em>swap</em> of two crossing lines always decreases the sum of their lengths. The cool idea is that the swaps may actually increase the number of crossings, but they will always decrease the total length. </p>
<p>
In the end the length is minimal and there are <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> crossings. Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  b(n) = 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b%28n%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  b(n) = 0. "/></p>
<p>I cheated and used that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2} = 13^{2} + 14^{2}, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++10%5E%7B2%7D%2B11%5E%7B2%7D%2B12%5E%7B2%7D+%3D+13%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+14%5E%7B2%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  10^{2}+11^{2}+12^{2} = 13^{2} + 14^{2}, "/></p>
<p>and so the constant <img alt="{c}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{c}"/> is zero. Finally, no swap is ever undone—since the length always decreases—and so the process must finish within <img alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n^2)}"/> swaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Hope that you liked this puzzle. I think it shows that are sometimes methods that while simple may be hard to find. Is <img alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(n^2)}"/> really the needed number of swaps? Are more than a linear number of swaps ever required?<br/>
 Happy holidays to all.</p>

Later in the afternoon we had  <strong>a panel/debate on quantum supremacy </strong>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be">click for the video</a>) moderated by Sandy Irani and featuring Scott Aaronson, Dorit Aharonov, Boaz Barak, Sergio Boixo, Adam Bouland,  Umesh Vazirani, and me. It was a thoughtful and interesting discussion. (The presentation was initially prepared for the afternoon debate but at the end I gave it as a separate talk and presented just one slide at the panel itself. The plan was also to post it as a background material before the discussion, but not untypically, I was too slow, so here it is a week later.) I am thankful to Dorit for inviting me to the panel (and for organizing a great school!), to Sandy for her excellent moderation, and to all the panelists for their good spirit. (Update: <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/12/28/quantum-school-lecture-notes-videos-and-more-guest-post-by-dorit-aharonov/">A blog post by Dorit</a> at Windows on Theory)</p>

<p>(Dec 23, 2019: Following some <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">renewed discussion</a> in the last days on the terminology I proposed to replace the term “quantum supremacy” with <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">“HQCA – Huge Quantum Computational Advantage”</span></strong> and I myself may try to follow my new term in my own lectures/papers in the future and see how it goes. In fact, I already used HQCA in our Sunday’s Kazhdan seminar where I lectured about noise stability and sensitivity for Boolean functions, Boson Sampling, and quantum circuits (<a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/d7a1d7a8d799d7a7d7940006.pdf">lecture</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/d7a1d7a8d799d7a7d7940007.pdf">notes</a>).)</p>

<p>My lecture is not about quantum computers and quantum supremacy in general but about the Google quantum supremacy claims. (If you want to know more about my general argument against quantum computers, quantum supremacy and quantum error correction go to the previous post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/" rel="bookmark">Gil’s Collegial Quantum Supremacy Skepticism FAQ </a>and to <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/main-pr.pdf">several</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">my</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">papers</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/cern.pptx">presentations</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR-ufBz13Eg">linked</a> there.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide12.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18875" height="362" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide12.png?w=640&amp;h=362" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>In this presentation I will concentrate on aspects of the Google experiment that are “too good to be true”. (Which is a bad sign, not a good sign.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide13.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18874" height="350" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide13.png?w=640&amp;h=350" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>There is an amazing agreement between the fidelity as estimated from the experimental data and a very simple high-school model based on the probability of individual qubits and gates to malfunction.  (An even simplified version, below in purple, requires just three parameters – the number n of qubits, the number g1 of 1-qubit gates and the number g2 of 2-qubit gates.)</p>
<p>Formula (77) itself is not surprising but the terrific success of Formula (77) may serve as a smoking gun for the claim that the Google’s experiment has serious methodological problems.</p>
<p>I was not the only one to be amazed. Here is what John Martinis, the scientific leader of the Google supremacy experiment told about it. (Nov 1., 2019) Read carefully!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide6.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18849" height="400" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide6.png?w=640&amp;h=400" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>The accuracy of Formula (77) is the most amazing thing about the data, something that came as a big surprise, and that (jokingly) will let quantum scientists keep their jobs.</p>
<p>And here is what I think</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide7.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18851" height="367" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide7.png?w=640&amp;h=367" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>No no, you cannot estimate with precision of 10-20% the probability of failure of a physical system with 1000 interacting elements as the product of 1000 error-probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>This remarkable agreement is a major new discovery, and it is <em>not needed</em> for building quantum computers. It is only needed for the extrapolation argument leading the Google team to supremacy.</strong></p>
<p>Even if quantum computers will be built this is something that we are not going to witness. It is interesting to check if we see anything remotely like this for the IBM quantum computers.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide8.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18853" height="334" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide8.png?w=640&amp;h=334" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Here on the left you see for various values of <em>n</em>, the number of qubits, two experiments with different circuits that leads to entirely different probability distributions. Since each pair have a similar number of gates, Formula (77) leads to very close fidelity estimates which are so accurate that the green and blue lines coincide! We do not expect to see such close agreements in experimental data.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide9.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18857" height="350" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide9.png?w=640&amp;h=350" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Blue, orange and green analytic smooth curves representing three distributions. For all three you see also empirical samples from the distributions. For two of them the samples are perfect, for the other one you see a sample based on a complicated physical experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Test your intuition:</strong> can you tell the difference? Can you tell which is which?</p>
<p>(You can also test your intuition which was the single slide presented at the afternoon debate.)</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide10.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18860" height="360" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide10.png?w=640&amp;h=360" width="640"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Blind tests</strong> are standard in scientific experiments and are quite easy to implement here.</p>
<p>The meaning of the surprising statistical success of Formula (77) should be <strong>carefully examined</strong>.</p>
<h2>Two extra slides</h2>
<p>To put my view in context,  I devote one slide for my general argument against quantum computers, quantum supremacy and quantum error correction.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide2.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18839" height="363" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide2.png?w=640&amp;h=363" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>I mentioned that most experts do not agree with my argument or do not even understand it, and for some of them, this may give reasons for skepticism also about my critique on the Google experiment. I  personally think that my general argument is good, but  I don’t think it is ironclad and I am pleased to see this matter explored experimentally (properly). I also think that my critique on the Google demo stands well on its own.</p>
<p>And what may convince me to change my mind? poetry!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/dslide16.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19013" height="362" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/dslide16.png?w=640&amp;h=362" width="640"/></a></p>
<p>Let me add that all my critique as described here and elsewhere was first presented to the Google team.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/fp12.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19089" height="178" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/fp12.png?w=640&amp;h=178" width="640"/></a></p>

<p><strong>Answer to Test your intuition:</strong> The orange graph is the one that comes from the experiments.</p>
<h2>Some recollections, reactions, and comments from the debate:</h2>
<h3>Uploading data for verification</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the debate, I nudged Sergio to upload some (additional; promised) data that is needed for verification and analysis of their results.</p>
<h3>Formula (77)</h3>
<p>Formula (77) was discussed in some details in Q/A of the the informal talk and also in the panel/debate. (I raised the question if the Google experiment is correct and specifically the issue with Formula (77) at <a href="https://youtu.be/H4t2G2gay7Q?t=2097">35:00</a> and Formula (77) was discussed for the next 25 minutes.) Of course, the surprising issue is the accurate predictions that Formula (77) gives.</p>
<p>Sergio briefly explained the statistical rationale for such a precision. The way I see it, the quality of the prediction for (77) requires two assumptions: (1) No systematic errors, (2) statistical independence. Both these assumptions seem utterly unrealistic. No systematic errors means that the average error estimation say for read-out errors or for gate errors are precise and fluctuations are symmetric. This is very unrealistic. The assumption of statistical independence also seems unrealistic. (Positive correlations will actually lead to better fidelity.)  Dorit, Boaz and several other people (and also Peter Shor earlier <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/#comment-61697">here on the blog</a>) proposed that the remarkable predictive power of (77) and, in particular, the required statistical independence may follow from having a random circuit. I don’t understand that.</p>
<p>Beside the concrete attempts to understand the predictive power of Formula (77) there were some general comments about it. Adam opined that <em>in physics</em> the data fits the models very well. Scott  joked that here I am arguing that the results fits the model too well and he could imagine me arguing in another universe that the results don’t fit the model well enough. At another point he said “First the data is not good enough, and now the data is too good, what will make you happy, Gil” and I answered that the data should be <em>reliable.</em></p>
<h3>The extended Church-Turing thesis (ECTT)</h3>
<p>Does “supremacy” (or HQCA), in general and in the context of Google’s experiment violates the extended Church-Turing thesis? Dorit claimed that the answer is negative since (roughly) the experiments cannot be scaled. Sergio sort of agreed and said they only claim to <em>challenge</em> the ECCT. (Indeed the fidelity goes exponentially to zero and even if producing such samples is beyond the power of a classical computer the sample sizes need to be exponential; it is an interesting question if every scalable supremacy demonstration requires quantum fault tolerance.)  A point that I made is that if we assume further certain “naturalness” principle, namely that, in practice,  constants in computational complexity asymptotic behavior are mild, then an astronomical speed-up as claimed by Google, can be considered as violating ECCT.</p>
<h3>Trillions</h3>
<p>Actually, in the early lecture I presented another slide about my initial feeling towards the Google (then licked) paper. I was surprised by the trillions-time speed up, and regarded the 300,000,000,000 speed-up as expressing some “supremacy fever:” why not start with a more modest speed-up but with convincing direct evidence?</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide3.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18841" height="170" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/google-slide3.png?w=300&amp;h=170" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>Why the trillions speed up should not surprise us? Adam Bouland commented that this is to be expected when we think about exponential speed-up. BTW, Adam gave very nice lectures on quantum algorithms and quantum supremacy.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ol>
<li>I was slowly loosing my voice so in the earlier lecture Or Sattath read the quote from Martinis, and Adam read the poem by Renan. (I should try that also in talks where I am not loosing my voice.)</li>
<li> Sandy asked about other reasons for skepticism regarding the Google claims and Scott mentioned the possibility that much better classical algorithms will be found.</li>
<li>Both me and Scott (and perhaps others in the panel as well) emphasized the importance of replications.</li>
<li>Adam was Scott’s Ph. D student and Scott was Umesh’s Ph. D. student so we had on the panel three academic generations!</li>
<li>Toward the end Scott described briefly the decade-old history, theory+experiment, of quantum supremacy.</li>
<li>There were various other interesting issues that were raised.</li>
<li>For history: The video flipped left and right. In reality Sandy was right farthermost and I was second to the right.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Quantum error-correction</h3>
<p>Dorit asked about quantum error correction and I asked specifically about distance-3 surface code and Sergio said that the quality of gates is insufficient for that. If I understood correctly the error rate needs to be reduced by a factor of five. (The fact that good quality quantum error correction requires achieving lower error rate than what is required for quantum supremacy is an important ingredient of my general argument against quantum computers.)</p>
<h3>Noise models and the noisy data.</h3>
<p>Dorit and others raised the issue of the noise model and discussed some toy noise models.  There was some discussion on correlated errors. (This is unrelated to the statistical dependence of (77).) I pointed out that correlated errors are irrelevant to random circuits (but relevant to quantum error-correction). Later in the debate I mentioned the concern regarding not having large enough samples to determine the empirical noisy distribution.</p>
<p>At some point Umesh referred to another issue that I raised which is that the noisy model in the Google paper seems oversimplified. I came back to it briefly but we did not discuss this further. (At the Q/A part of my early lecture Boaz have made some interesting comments about identifying the effect of the errors in the last round of the computation.)</p>
<p>I also repeated my suggestion of “Beckner noise” (and correlated variants) as a good toy noise model for noisy quantum circuits.</p>
<h3>My argument against quantum computers</h3>
<p>At the panel I mentioned my general argument against quantum computers, quantum supremacy and quantum error correction only in a few sentences.</p>
<p>BTW, one way to think about the argument is as comparing four thresholds for the level of noise (on gates) <img alt="\rho_{\bf R}, \rho_{\bf S}, \rho_{\bf QEC}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+R%7D%2C+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D%2C+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+QEC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf R}, \rho_{\bf S}, \rho_{\bf QEC}"/> and <img alt="\rho_{\bf U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+U%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf U}"/>. <img alt="\rho_{\bf S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf S}"/> is what is required for <strong>HQCA</strong> (quantum supremacy); <img alt="\rho_{\bf QEC}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+QEC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf QEC}"/> is what is required for good quality quantum error correction (say, distance-5 surface code); <img alt="\rho_{\bf U}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+U%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf U}"/> is what is required for universal quantum computing; <img alt="\rho_{\bf R}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+R%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf R}"/> is the lower error rate that can realistically be achieved. I have a computational complexity argument (based on naturalness) that <img alt="\rho_{\bf R} &gt; \rho_{\bf S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+R%7D+%3E+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf R} &gt; \rho_{\bf S}"/>. I also rely on <img alt="\rho_{\bf S} &gt; \rho_{\bf QEC}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+S%7D+%3E+%5Crho_%7B%5Cbf+QEC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" title="\rho_{\bf S} &gt; \rho_{\bf QEC}"/>.</p>
<h3>Comparisons to Wright brothers’s first flight or to Fermi’s 1942 nuclear chain reaction</h3>
<p>Nobody in the afternoon panel discussion (to the best of my memory) repeated earlier enthusiastic comparisons between Google’s experiment and the first flight in 1903, the first landing on the moon in 1968 (well, I referred to that), Fermi’s 1942 nuclear chain reaction, the first vacuum tubes computers, the discovery of the Higgs boson, etc. etc.</p>
<h3>Silver lining (after-thought)</h3>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/silverlining.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-19048" height="192" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/silverlining.png?w=300&amp;h=192" width="300"/></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The beach of Tel Aviv</span></p>
<p>Major advances in human ability to simulate quantum physics and quantum chemistry are expected both if quantum supremacy can be demonstrated and quantum computers can be built and also if quantum supremacy cannot be demonstrated and quantum computers cannot be built.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We have mentioned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxcjq-8xIDTYp3uz647V5A">Numberphile video channel</a> before (<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/01/an-interview-with-noga-alon/">here</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/8866128975287528%c2%b3-8778405442862239%c2%b3-2736111468807040%c2%b3/">here</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/beyond-the-g-conjecture-algebraic-combinatorics-of-cellular-spaces-i/">here</a>). It has amazing videos for the very general public about mathematics. And the general public is interested! The channel has more than 3 millions subscribers and a Numberphile video gets usually well over 100,000 views.  While the videos are for very general audiences it is quite common that I learn new mathematics while watching these videos. Today I mention four recent Numberphile videos on graph theory.</p>
<p>Before that, let me mention that, while combinatorics has a special appeal for general audiences, it is a hard challenge to explain to a very large audience (or even to the large audience of Quanta Magazine) some very abstract areas of mathematics. It is not impossible: Here is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/with-category-theory-mathematics-escapes-from-equality-20191010/">Kevin Hartnett’s article</a> in Quanta Magazine on ∞-categories and Jacob Lurie’s work and here is a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/peter-scholze-and-the-future-of-arithmetic-geometry-20160628/">2016 article by Erica Klarreich</a> on perfectoid spaces and Peter Schotze’s work. I hope to see Numberphile moving into these areas as well.</p>
<h2>A breakthrough in Graph theory:  Yaroslav Shitov’s counterexample to Hedetniemi’s conjecture as told by Erica Klarreich.</h2>
<p/>
<p>For more on this development see<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/sansation-in-the-morning-news-yaroslav-shitov-counterexamples-to-hedetniemis-conjecture/"> this post</a>. The video contains nice pictures of Stephen Hedetniemi and his 1966 thesis. An exciting <strong>open question</strong> is: Given two graphs of chromatic number <em>n </em>is the chromatic number of their tensor product at least some <em>f(n)</em>, where <em>f(n)</em> tends to infinity with <em>n</em>.</p>

<p>Starting with the definition and ending with the strong perfect graph theorem (conjectured by Claud Berge) by Chudnovsky, Seymour, Robertson and Thomas.</p>
<p>An exciting <strong>open question</strong>: Find a good definition for perfect <em>r</em>-uniform hypergraphs.</p>
<p>We discussed perfect graphs and related notions in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/gerard-cornuejolss-bakers-eighteen-5000-dollars-conjectures/">this post</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/02/05/extremal-combinatorics-v-posets/">this one</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/when-a-few-colors-suffice/">this one</a>.</p>
<p>(<strong>Remark:</strong> Numberphile misguidedly regarded this video as a continuation of the “planar graph” video. The truth of the matter is that these are separated topics and the perfect graph video should be a separate Numperphile video.)</p>
<h2>Maria Chudnovsky – planar graphs</h2>
<p/>
<p>Planar graphs are deep and fascinating (and miraculous, and always surprising) mathematical objects.  In Hebrew we can say about the topic that it is “Olam Umelo’o” (עולם ומלואו) (=a whole world with all its content). There are many fascinating properties of planar graphs and many open problems about them.</p>
<p>There are also many fascinating generalizations. Let me mention <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/06/coloring-simple-polytopes-and-triangulations/">Abby Thompson’s </a><strong>problem:</strong> Suppose that <em>G</em> is the graph of a simple <em>d</em>-polytope with <em>n</em> vertices. Suppose also that <em>n</em> is even (this is automatic if <em>d</em> is odd). Can we always properly color the edges of <em>G</em> with <em>d</em> colors? (For <em>d=3</em>, the answer is yes and this is the four color theorem.)</p>
<p>(We discussed planar graphs here and on MO, many times.)</p>
<h2>Discussing vertex covers and Alcuin numbers for graphs – and a famous old puzzle. Filmed at MSRI with Annie Raymond.</h2>
<p/>
<p>We <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/hardness-of-approximating-vertex-cover-polytope-integrality-gap-the-alswede-kachaterian-theorem-and-more/">discussed here</a> and in other posts the important notion of vertex covers, but the mathematics of the video was completely new to me.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>Scott’s Update (Dec. 26):</strong> Comments on this post are now closed, since I felt that whatever progress could be made, had been, and I wanted to move on to more interesting topics.  Thanks so much to everyone who came here to hash things out in good faith—which, as far as I’m concerned, included the majority of the participants on both sides.</p>



<p>If you want to see the position paper that led to the name change movement, see <a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/pubs/NIPS_Name_Debate.pdf">What’s In A Name? The Need to Nip NIPS</a>, by Daniela Witten, Elana Fertig, Anima Anandkumar, and Jeff Dean.  I apologize for not linking to this paper in the original post.</p>



<p>To recap what I said many times in this post and the comments: I myself am totally fine with the name NeurIPS.  I think several of the arguments for changing the name were good arguments—and I thank some of the commenters on this post for elucidating those arguments without shaming anybody or calling them names.  In any case the decision is done, and it belongs to the ML community, not to me and not to Steven Pinker.</p>



<p>The one part that I’m against is <em>the bullying of anyone who disagrees by smearing them as a misogynist</em>.  And then, recursively, the smearing as a misogynist of anyone who objected to <em>that</em> bullying, and so on and so on.  Most supporters of the name change did not engage in such bullying, but one leader of the movement very conspicuously did, and continues to do it even now (to, I’m told, the consternation even of many of her allies).</p>



<p>Since this post went up, something extremely interesting happened: Steven Pinker and I started getting emails from researchers in the NeurIPS community that said, in various words: “thank you for openly airing perspectives that we could not air, without jeopardizing our careers.”  We were told that even women in ML, and even those who agreed with the activists on most points, could no longer voice opposition without risking their hiring or tenure.  This put into a slightly different light, I thought, the constant claims of some movement leaders about their own marginalization and powerlessness.</p>



<p>Since I was 7 or 8 years old, the moral lodestar of my life has been my yearning (too often left unfulfilled) to stand up to the world’s bullies.  Bullies come in all shapes and sizes: some are gangsters or men who sexually exploit vulnerable women; one, alas, is even the President of the United States.  But bullying knows no bounds of ideology or gender.  Some bullies resort to whisper networks, or Twitter shaming campaigns, or their power in academic hierarchies, to shut down dissenting voices.  With the latter kinds of bully—well, to whatever extent this blog is now in a position to make some difference, I’d feel morally complicit if it didn’t.</p>



<p>As I wrote in the comments: may the 2020s be an era of intellectual freedom, compassion, and understanding for all people regardless of background. –SA</p>



<p><strong>Scott’s prologue:</strong></p>



<p>Happy Christmas and Merry Chanukah!</p>



<p>As a followup to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4450">last Thursday’s post</a> about the term “quantum supremacy,” today all of us here at <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> are humbled to host a guest post by <a href="https://stevenpinker.com/">Steven Pinker</a>: the Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard University, and author of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Language-Instinct-How-Mind-Creates/dp/1491514981">The Language Instinct</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Mind-Works-Steven-Pinker/dp/0393318486">How the Mind Works</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+blank+slate&amp;qid=1577123601&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">The Blank Slate</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress/dp/0525427570">Enlightenment Now</a></em> (which I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3654">reviewed here</a>), and other books.</p>



<p>The former NIPS—<a href="https://nips.cc/">Neural Information Processing Systems</a>—has been the premier conference for machine learning for 30 years.  As many readers might know, last year NIPS <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07476-w">changed its name to NeurIPS</a>: ironically, giving greater emphasis to an aspect that I’m told has been <em>de</em>-emphasized at that conference over time.  The reason, apparently, was that some male attendees had made puns involving the acronym “NIPS” and nipples.</p>



<p>I confess that the name change took me by surprise, simply because it had never occurred to me to make the NIPS/nipples connection—not when I gave a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1246">plenary at NIPS</a> in 2012, and not when my collaborators and I coauthored a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09025">NIPS paper</a>.  It’s not that I’m averse to puerile humor.  It’s just that neither I, nor anyone else I knew, had apparently ever felt the need for a shorthand for “nipples.”  Of course, once I <em>did</em> learn about this controversy, it became hard to hear “NIPS” without thinking about it.</p>



<p>Back when this happened, Steven Pinker <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1070364941494992896?lang=en">tweeted</a> about NIPS being “forced to change its acronym … because some thought it was sexist. ?????,” apparently as part of a longer <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1070364369207341056?lang=en">thread</a> about “the new Victorians.”  In response, a computer science professor sent Pinker an extremely stern email, saying that Pinker’s tweeting about this had “caused harm to our community” and “just [made] the world a bleaker place for everyone.”   After linking to a <em>National Academies</em> report on bias in STEM, the email ended: “I hope you will choose to inform yourself on the discussion to which you have just contributed and that you will offer a well-considered follow up.”   I won’t risk betraying confidences by quoting further.  Of course, the author is warmly welcomed to share anything they wish in the comments here (or I can add it to the main post).</p>



<p>Steve’s guest post today consists of his response to this email.  (He told me that, after sending it, he received no further responses.)</p>



<p>I don’t have any dog in the NIPS/NeurIPS debate, being at most on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_(machine_learning)">“margin”</a> (har!) of machine learning.  And in any case the debate ended a year ago: the name is now NeurIPS and it’s not changing back.  Reopening the issue would seem to invite a strong risk of social-media denunciation for no possible gain.</p>



<p>So why am I doing this?  Mostly because I thought it was in the interest of humanity to know that, even when Steven Pinker is answering someone’s email, with no expectation that his reply will be made public, he writes the same way he does in his books: with clarity, humor, and an amusing quote from his mom.</p>



<p>But also because—again, without taking a position on the NIPS vs. NeurIPS issue itself—there’s a tactic displayed by Pinker’s detractors that fundamentally grates on me.  This is where you pretend to an open mind, but it turns out that you’re open only to the possibility that your opponent might not have read enough reports and studies to “do better”—i.e., that they sinned out of ignorance rather than out of malice.  You don’t open your mind even a crack to the possibility that the opponent might have a point.</p>



<p><strong>Without further ado, here’s Steven Pinker’s email:</strong></p>



<p>I appreciate your frank comments. At the same time, I do not agree with them. Please allow me to explain.</p>



<p>If this were a matter of sexual harassment or other hostile behavior toward women, I would of course support strong measures to combat it. Any member of the Symposium who uttered demeaning comments toward or about women certainly deserves censure.</p>



<p>But that is not what is at issue here. It’s an utterly irrelevant matter: the three-decades-old acronym for the Neural Information Processing Symposium, the pleasingly pronounceable NIPS. To state what should be obvious: <em>nip</em> is not a sexual word. As Chair of the Usage Panel of the <em>American Heritage Dictionary, </em>I can <a href="https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=nip">support this claim</a>.</p>



<p>(And as my mother wrote to me: “I don’t get it. I thought Nips was a brand of caramel candy.”)  [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nips-Coffee-Candy-4-Ounce-Boxes/dp/B000V9EIEE">Indeed</a>, I enjoyed those candies as a kid. –SA]  Even if people with an adolescent mindset think of nipples when hearing the sound “nips,” the society should not endorse the idea that the concept of nipples is sexist. Men have nipples too, and women’s nipples evolved as organs of nursing, not sexual gratification. Indeed, many feminists have argued that it’s sexist to conceptualize women’s bodies from the point of view of male sexuality.</p>



<p>If some people make insulting puns that demean women, the society should condemn them for the insults, not concede to their puerility by endorsing their appropriation of an innocent sound. (The Linguistics Society of America and Boston Debate League do not change their names to disavow jejune clichés about cunning linguists and master debaters.) To act as if anything with the remotest connection to sexuality must be censored to protect delicate female sensibilities is insulting to women and reminiscent of prissy Victorian taboos against uncovered piano legs or the phrase “with the naked eye.”</p>



<p>Any harm to the community of computer scientists has been done not by me but by the pressure group and the Symposium’s surrender. As a public figure who hears from a broad range of people outside the academic bubble, I can tell you that this episode has not played well. It’s seen as the latest sign that academia has lost its mind—that it has traded reasoned argument, conceptual rigor, proportionality, and common sense for prudish censoriousness, snowflake sensibility, and virtue signaling. I often hear from intelligent non-leftists, “Why should I be impressed by the scientific consensus on climate change? Everyone knows that academics just fall into line with the politically correct position.” To secure the credibility of the academy, we have to make reasoned distinctions, and stop turning our enterprise into a laughingstock.</p>



<p>To repeat: none of this deprecates the important effort to stamp out harassment and misogyny in science, which I’m well aware of and thoroughly support, but which has nothing to do with the acronym NIPS.</p>



<p>You are welcome to share this note with interested parties.</p>



<p>Best,<br/>Steve</p></div>

Today Ken and I discuss predicting the end to mathematical conjectures. This is apart from considering odds on which way they will go, which we also talk about.<br/>
<span id="more-16481"/></p>
<p>
Nine years ago the Christmas issue of the <em>New Scientist</em> magazine analyzed a small set of solved mathematical conjectures and used it to forecast when the P vs. NP conjecture would be solved. The article estimated that the “probability for the P vs. NP problem to be solved by the year <b>2024</b> is roughly 50%”. </p>

<p>
This was done without any special insight into P vs. NP, just its prominence among the world’s best mathematicians and time since inception. How can one make the case that this argument is not silly, that it is not a wild guess? </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Time to Solve a Conjecture </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The <b>2010</b> <em>New Scientist</em> article could be considered a bagatelle since they looked at only 18 conjectures, but Hisano and Sornette took the idea seriously. They widened the data field to Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conjectures">list</a> of mathematical conjectures. They removed a dozen-plus conjectures whose origin dates and/or solution dates are not firmly known, leaving 144 conjectures: 60 solved and 84 still open as of <b>2012</b>. </p>
<p>
It should be understood that their conclusions about the whole enterprise are negative. They say in their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We find however evidence that the mathematical process of creation is too much non-stationary, with too little data and constraints, to allow for a meaningful conclusion. … In conclusion we cannot really reject the simplest model of an exponential rate of conjecture proof with a rate of 0.01/year for the dataset that we have studied, translating into an average waiting time to proof of 100 years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
They found exponential growth in notable conjectures being formulated, which they ascribe to growth in the number of mathematicians. They try adjusting for this by invoking the overall growth curve of the world population. </p>
<p>
Then they find a dearth of conjectures with midrange solution times, compared to the number needed to give strong fits to simple models. They try cutting quickly-resolved conjectures (ones solved in under 20 years) from the dataset to improve the fits, and obtain only an enhancement of evidence for a slow exponential curve of solution time. Here is a figure from their paper showing the exponential curves:</p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/conjplot.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-16486" height="360" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/conjplot.jpg?w=345&amp;h=360" width="345"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
In the end they are not able to find many hard distinctions between possible models. Most in particular, they conclude by calling the simple <img alt="{0.01}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.01}"/>-solution-chance-per-year model “our best model.”</p>
<p>
But that model in turn, without memory of the age of the conjecture, struck me—Ken writing here—as running counter to a famous controversial argument of recent vintage. So Dick and I put our heads together again…</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Doomsday For Conjectures? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">Doomsday</a> <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/doomsday_argument">Argument</a> can be phrased as a truism:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If your hearing about <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is a uniformly random event in the lifespan of <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>, which began <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> years ago, then the odds are 50-50 that the future lifetime <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> of <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> will be no less than <img alt="{\frac{t}{3}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{t}{3}}"/> years and no more than <img alt="{3t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3t%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{3t}"/> years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
This extends to say the probability is 90% that <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> will be no less than <img alt="{\frac{t}{19}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B19%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{t}{19}}"/> and no more than <img alt="{19t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B19t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{19t}"/>. The numbers come from considering the middle half or middle 90% of the span.</p>
<p>
The key word in our phrasing is <em>if</em>—if your cognizance is a uniformly random event of the lifespan. The argument’s force comes from taking your birthday as a random event in the span of humanity. We can adjust for the population growth curve and our ignorance of prehistoric times by taking <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t}"/> to be your ordinal in human lives ordered by birthday and projecting <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/> in the same units. If there were 50 billion people before you, this speaks 95% confidence that the sum of human lives will not reach a trillion.</p>
<p>
We can try the same reasoning on conjectures. Suppose you just learned about the P vs. NP problem from catching a reference to this blog. By Kurt Gödel’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/">letter</a> to John von Neumann we date the problem to <b>1956</b>, which makes <img alt="{t = 63}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+63%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t = 63}"/> years. Presuming your encounter is random, you can conclude a 50-50 chance of the conjecture being solved between the years <b>2040</b> (which is 21 years from now) and <b>2208</b> (which is still shorter than Fermat’s Last Theorem lasted). The less you knew about P vs. NP, the more random the encounter—and the stronger the inference.</p>
<p>
Perhaps Wikipedia’s <b>1971</b> origin for P vs. NP from its precise statement by Steve Cook is more realistic. Was my learning about it in <b>1979</b> (<img alt="{t=8}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t=8}"/>) a random event? If so, I should have been 75% confident of a solution by <b>2003</b>. Its lasting 16 more years and counting busts the 83.3% confidence interval. Well, Dick learned about it within weeks, at most months, after inception. If that was random then its longevity counts as a 99.9% miss. Of course, Dick’s learning about it was far from random. But.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Doomsday Conflict </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our point, however, is this: Consider <em>any</em> conjecture that has lasted <img alt="{t = 87}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+87%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t = 87}"/> years. That’s the point at which the <img alt="{0.01}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.01}"/> exponential and Doomsday models come into conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>
By Doomsday, there is 75% confidence of the conjecture lasting at least <img alt="{\frac{t}{3} = 29}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B3%7D+%3D+29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\frac{t}{3} = 29}"/> more years. <p/>
</li><li>
But since <img alt="{0.99^{29} &lt; 0.75}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.99%5E%7B29%7D+%3C+0.75%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.99^{29} &lt; 0.75}"/>, by the H-S best model, one should have less confidence.
</li></ul>
<p>
The longer a conjecture lasts, the greater this conflict. We are not addressing the issue of uniform sampling over the lifespan of the conjecture, but this conflict applies to <b>all</b> observers past the 87-year mark. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_conjecture">honeycomb</a> conjecture was documented by 36 BCE and finally solved by Thomas Hales in <b>1999</b>. </p>
<p>
Note that since <img alt="{0.99^{87} = 0.417\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.99%5E%7B87%7D+%3D+0.417%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.99^{87} = 0.417\dots}"/>, one cannot evade our model conflict by saying only a small fraction of conjectures last that long. Despite H-S noting that the honeycomb conjecture and Fermat and some others break their curve, their curve at left below shows excellent agreement up to and beyond the 100-year mark. </p>
<p/><p/>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/hsfigs5-6.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16487" height="298" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/hsfigs5-6.png?w=600&amp;h=298" width="600"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
The curve at right shows that a <img alt="{0.02}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.02%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.02}"/> rate fits even better when short-lived conjectures are deleted. Since <img alt="{0.98^{14.33} &lt; 0.75}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.98%5E%7B14.33%7D+%3C+0.75%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.98^{14.33} &lt; 0.75}"/>, that makes the conflict set in at <img alt="{t = 43}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t = 43}"/> years old. Then it applies even for P vs. NP dated to Cook. At <img alt="{t = 100}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{t = 100}"/> the conflict is considerable: Doomsday 66.7% of its lasting at least 50 more years, versus <img alt="{0.98^{50} \approx \frac{1}{e} \approx 36.4\%}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.98%5E%7B50%7D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Be%7D+%5Capprox+36.4%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0.98^{50} \approx \frac{1}{e} \approx 36.4\%}"/> chance of its lasting that long by H-S.</p>
<p>
This conflict says there must be a factor that invalidates either or both lines of reasoning. But the Hisano-Sornette estimates are supported by data, while our Doomsday representation is quite generic. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Do Odds Matter? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A further wrinkle is whether the collective balance of opinion on whether a conjecture is true or false has any bearing. If the field is evenly divided, does that argue that the conjecture will take longer to resolve?</p>
<p>
The idea of “odds” is hard to quantify and has come into play only recently. Despite <a href="http://blog.oddhead.com/2010/08/11/betting-on-p-equals-np/">lots</a> of <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/12/probability-of-pnp.html">chat</a> about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/theory-has-bet-on-pnp/">betting</a> on P vs. NP, and Bill Gasarch’s wonderful <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper3.pdf">polls</a> on which side is true, data for other problems is scant. </p>
<p>
This prompts us to mention that the Springer LNCS 10,000 anniversary <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9">volume</a> came out in October. It includes a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_12">contribution</a> by Ken titled, “Rating Computer Science Via Chess”—the title refers both to how the chess ratings of the best chess computers mirrored Moore’s Law and how they draw on many general CS achievements in both hardware and software. For now we note also the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_2">contribution</a> by Ryan Williams titled, “Some Estimated Likelihoods for Computational Complexity.” Ryan places only 80% on <img alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}"/> and puts <img alt="{\mathsf{NC}^1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNC%7D%5E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{NC}^1}"/> versus <img alt="{\mathsf{TC^0}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BTC%5E0%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{TC^0}}"/> at 50-50. </p>
<p>
There are also non-betting and non-opinion senses in which conjectures are regarded as “almost certainly true.” We recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/">posted</a> about this. Perhaps something more can be gleaned from highlighting those conjectures in the H-S data set to which such criteria apply.</p>
<p>
All of this speculation may be less idle and less isolated if it can be carried over to unsolved problems in other walks of life. Corporations and consortia doing open-ended research may already need to quantify the average time to achieve potential breakthroughs—or dismiss them—because they deal with many “feelers” at a time. The Doomsday assumption of random encounters probably doesn’t apply there. But there could be large-scale tests of it by “punters” seeking out random lifespans they can bet on, such as runs of shows or the time to make a movie of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/12/20/biggest-disaster-decade-roundup-most-memorable-cats-reviews/"><i>Cats</i></a>, and profit by applying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What do you think about attempts to forecast the time to solve P vs. NP, or to forecast breakthroughs on larger scales? </p>
<p>
There are many rebuttals to the Doomsday Argument, some general and some context-specific. Is our argument that it conflicts generally with memoryless exponential models subsumed by any of them?</p>

    <title>TR19-184 |  Extractors for Adversarial Sources via Extremal Hypergraphs | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jesse Goodman, 

	Vipul Goyal, 

	Xin Li</title>
    <summary>Randomness extraction is a fundamental problem that has been studied for over three decades. A well-studied setting assumes that one has access to multiple independent weak random sources, each with some entropy. However, this assumption is often unrealistic in practice. In real life, natural sources of randomness can produce samples with no entropy at all or with unwanted dependence. Motivated by this and applications from cryptography, we initiate a systematic study of randomness extraction for the class of adversarial sources defined as follows.

A weak source $\mathbf{X}$ of the form $\mathbf{X}_1,...,\mathbf{X}_N$, where each $\mathbf{X}_i$ is on $n$ bits, is an $(N,K,n,k)$-source of locality $d$ if the following hold:

(1) Somewhere good sources: at least $K$ of the $\mathbf{X}_i$'s are independent, and each contains min-entropy at least $k$. We call these $\mathbf{X}_i$'s good sources, and their locations are unknown. (2) Bounded dependence: each remaining (bad) source can depend arbitrarily on at most $d$ good sources.

We focus on constructing extractors with negligible error, in the regime where most of the entropy is contained within a few sources instead of across many (i.e., $k$ is at least polynomial in $K$). In this setting, even for the case of $0$-locality, very little is known prior to our work. For $d \geq 1$, essentially no previous results are known. We present various new extractors for adversarial sources in a wide range of parameters, and some of our constructions work for locality $d = K^{\Omega(1)}$. As an application, we also give improved extractors for small-space sources.

The class of adversarial sources generalizes several previously studied classes of sources, and our explicit extractor constructions exploit tools from recent advances in extractor machinery, such as two-source non-malleable extractors and low-error condensers. Thus, our constructions can be viewed as a new application of non-malleable extractors. In addition, our constructions combine the tools from extractor theory in a novel way through various sorts of explicit extremal hypergraphs. These connections leverage recent progress in combinatorics, such as improved bounds on cap sets and explicit constructions of Ramsey graphs, and may be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>TR19-183 |  Randomness Extraction from Somewhat Dependent Sources | 

	Marshall Ball, 

	Oded Goldreich, 

	Tal Malkin</title>
    <summary>We initiate a comprehensive study of the question of randomness extractions from two somewhat dependent sources of defective randomness. 
Specifically, we present three natural models, which are based on different natural perspectives on the notion of bounded dependency between a pair of distributions.
Going from the more restricted model to the less restricted one, our models and main results are as follows. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\em Bounded dependence as bounded coordination}:
Here we consider pairs of distributions that arise from independent random processes that are applied to the outcome of a single global random source, which may be viewed as a mechanism of coordination (which is adversarial from our perspective). 

We show that if the min-entropy of each of the two outcomes is larger than the length of the global source, then extraction is possible (and is, in fact, feasible). We stress that the extractor has no access to the global random source nor to the internal randomness that the two processes use, but rather gets only the two dependent outcomes.

This model is equivalent to a setting in which the two outcomes are generated by two independent sources, but then each outcome is modified based on limited leakage (equiv., communication) between the two sources.  (Here this leakage is measured in terms of the number of bits that were communicated, but in the next model we consider the actual influence of this leakage.)

\item{\em Bounded dependence as bounded cross influence}:
Here we consider pairs of outcomes that are produced by a pair of sources such that each source has bounded (worst-case) influence on the outcome of the other source.  We stress that the extractor has no access to the randomness that the two processes use, but rather gets only the two dependent outcomes.

We show that, while (proper) randomness extraction is impossible in this case, randomness condensing is possible and feasible; specifically, the randomness deficiency of condensing is linear in our measure of cross influence, and this upper-bound is tight.  We also discuss various applications of such condensers, including for cryptography, standard randomized algorithms, and sublinear-time algorithms, while pointing out their benefit over using a seeded (single-source) extractor. 

\item{\em Bounded dependence as bounded mutual information}:
Due to the average-case nature of this mutual information, here there is a trade-off between the error (or deviation) probability and the randomness deficiency.  Loosely speaking, for joint distributions of mutual information $t$, we can condense with randomness deficiency $O(t/\epsilon)$ and error $\epsilon$, and this trade-off is optimal.  
\end{enumerate}
