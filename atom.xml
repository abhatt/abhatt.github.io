Lesley Smith is a climate researcher at the University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. She is also <a href="https://psl.noaa.gov/people/lesley.l.smith/">associated</a> to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Physical Science Laboratory and has worked on behalf of several other national organizations. Her PhD was in particle physics at the University of Kansas, and she incorporates quantum physics into some of her non-nonfiction writings.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss a quantum walk on a simple graph with behavior wild enough to inspire at least the latter kind of writing.</p>
<p>
Smith was most recently second author on a <a href="https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/31032">paper</a> in the April, 2021 <em>Journal of Climate</em> whose title immediately speaks a vital subject: “Explaining the Spatial Pattern of U.S. Extreme Daily Precipitation Change.” The years-long <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/drought-grips-american-west-with-no-relief-in-sight/">drought</a> in the US West has critically depleted lakes and reservoirs and rivers. But just one week ago, much of California had its <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/25/atmospheric-river-record-rain-california/">wettest</a> day ever. Both the drought and the pattern of extremes have spread across the country, as many easily-found stories this year attest. The question is how to distinguish standard fluctuations from deep-seated causal factors.</p>
<p>
As for her <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/index.html">other</a> <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/blog.html">writings</a>, this is representative:</p>

The first lines are likewise topical: “Despite it being October, the sun felt warm on my skin. Forest-fire smoke from states west of Colorado gave the air a three-dimensional quality…” She has also written novels titled <em>Quantum Murder</em>, <em>The Quantum Cop</em>, and <em>Quantum Juneteenth</em>, plus just now a <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/shortfiction.html">short story</a>, “Lucky Halloween,” about a quantum computer scientist. She is writing a series called <em>Kat Cubed</em>—well we will raise Schrödinger cat-walks to powers well beyond cubed below.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Climate and Dynamism </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The climate paper’s opening paragraphs review the the general prediction of greater precipitation from the thermal component of climate change and the effects of changes in atmospheric currents. Then it observes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Yet, the regional pattern of observed heavy precipitation trends across the United States departs from this theoretical expectation, being remarkable for its heterogeneity rather than the more uniform structure that thermodynamic effects alone would predict. … The regionally diverse trends in extreme precipitation are likely related to dynamical factors. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The paper speaks to care needed to distinguish causes and draws two conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> First, the absence of appreciable increases [in annual maximum single day of rain] over the West is attributed to a dynamical effect of the observed centennial-scale trends in [sea-surface temperature], sea ice, and atmospheric composition. … A second factor is sampling variability […from…] a combination of moderate forced increases comingled with a strong articulation of internal atmospheric variability. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The nub of the latter from my perspective is distinguishing what we can infer on the basis of increased dynamism alone. In our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/01/30/global-warming/">post</a> seven years ago on global warming, I opined that greater energy and dynamism should be treated as more-primary effects than temperature. The challenge of inferring further effects from dynamism is recognized by another excerpt from the conclusions:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Recognizing the potency of unforced atmospheric dynamics, [one cannot discount] a scenario in which internal variability could mute if not reverse the observed upward trend in eastern U.S. [extreme rains]. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
In the rest of this post, we’ll offer an example of wild dynamics from a small quantum system that may speak to both her <em>métiers</em>.</p>

</p><p/><h2> Classical Random and Quantum Walks </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Consider the following graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It looks like a Q-tip. The two self-loops depart from usual examples of undirected graphs. </p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/11/01/quantum-trick-or-treat/propellergraph/" rel="attachment wp-att-19275"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-19275" height="72" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PropellerGraph.png?resize=550%2C72&amp;ssl=1" width="550"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
A classical random walk on <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> starts at some node—say node <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—and at each step flips a coin to determine the next node. The “walker” stays on node <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if the result is heads (<img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>) but goes to node <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> if tails (<img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>). The walker cannot go from <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="{3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in one step because there is no edge. The <b>probabilistic transition matrix</b> <img alt="{A_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is given at right. The vector </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 0.25 \\ 0.25 \end{bmatrix} = A_G\cdot \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 0.5 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = A_G^2 \cdot x^{(0)} \qquad\text{where}\qquad x^{(0)} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+0.5+%5C%5C+0.25+%5C%5C+0.25+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+%3D+A_G%5Ccdot+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+0.5+%5C%5C+0.5+%5C%5C+0+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+%3D+A_G%5E2+%5Ccdot+x%5E%7B%280%29%7D+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Bwhere%7D%5Cqquad+x%5E%7B%280%29%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%5C%5C+0+%5C%5C+0+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>gives the probabilities for each node after two steps. (Although multiplying row vectors on the left is commonly used for classical walks, we will use column vectors for consistency with quantum usage; that <img alt="{A_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is symmetric moots the difference anyway.) For any <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, <img alt="{x^{(t)} = A_G^t x_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B%28t%29%7D+%3D+A_G%5Et+x_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be called the “classical state” of the walk after <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> steps. </p>
<p>
The state <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> whose entries <img alt="{x[i]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Bi%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are given by the degree of node <img alt="{i}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> divided by the sum of the degrees makes <img alt="{A_G x = x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G+x+%3D+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and thus gives a <b>stable distribution</b> for the walk. A central theorem states that for every <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> that is not bipartite, the powers of <img alt="{A_G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_G%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> converge entrywise in every column to a unique stable distribution. When <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is regular, as here, this is simply the uniform distribution. The convergence in our case is quite quick, as signified by the exact values </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  A_G^{10} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.333984375 &amp; 0.3330078125 &amp; 0.3330078125 \\ 0.3330078125 &amp; 0.333984375 &amp; 0.3330078125 \\ 0.3330078125 &amp; 0.3330078125 &amp; 0.333984375 \end{bmatrix}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A_G%5E%7B10%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+0.333984375+%26+0.3330078125+%26+0.3330078125+%5C%5C+0.3330078125+%26+0.333984375+%26+0.3330078125+%5C%5C+0.3330078125+%26+0.3330078125+%26+0.333984375+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>
The quantum case needs to bind the graph and the “coin” into one system, so its domain has six members, which we list in order </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathcal{S} = \{(1,H),(1,T),(2,H),(2,T),(3,H),(3,T)\}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D+%3D+%5C%7B%281%2CH%29%2C%281%2CT%29%2C%282%2CH%29%2C%282%2CT%29%2C%283%2CH%29%2C%283%2CT%29%5C%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>In quantum notation, this is the tensor product of the “node space” <img alt="{V = \{1,2,3\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV+%3D+%5C%7B1%2C2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the “coin space” <img alt="{\mathcal{C} = \{H,T\}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D+%3D+%5C%7BH%2CT%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The meaning of <img alt="{(v,\mathfrak{c})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28v%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is that the walker just arrived at node <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> via the coin outcome <img alt="{\mathfrak{c}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. It is incumbent that every node <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> can be reached on either outcome. Our <img alt="{H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>–<img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> labeling above complies. Then we get a permutation <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> on <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from the action </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  P(v,\mathfrak{c}) = (v',\mathfrak{c}), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P%28v%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29+%3D+%28v%27%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{v'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is the vertex reached from <img alt="{v}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by the outcome <img alt="{\mathfrak{c}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> from the classical walk, and <img alt="{\mathfrak{c}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is kept the same. The penultimate trick is to expand this to a mapping <img alt="{P': \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%27%3A+%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathcal%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> by </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  P'((v,\mathfrak{b}),\mathfrak{c}) = (v',\mathfrak{c}), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++P%27%28%28v%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bb%7D%29%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29+%3D+%28v%27%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>
<p>whereby the previous coin outcome <img alt="{\mathfrak{b}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bb%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is “forgotten” while the current flip is preserved in the state. We can represent this by the <em>directed</em> graph <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> shown next. </p>

<p/><p><br/>
Incidentally, <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is planar (switch nodes <img alt="{2H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{2T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to see). The last trick is to label its edges by quantum amplitudes for the coin outcomes.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Realm of the Coin </h2><p/>

Our quantum coin can be “flipped” by applying any chosen <img alt="{2 \times 2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%5Ctimes+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> matrix <img alt="{\mathbf{U}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BU%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to the current state of the coin, provided <img alt="{\mathbf{U}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BU%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a unitary matrix.

But here we just need one qubit. Before fixing the choice of coin matrix, we can represent it abstractly as </p>

To move the walker after the coin result, we apply the <img alt="{6 \times 6}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6+%5Ctimes+6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> matrix <img alt="{\mathbf{P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of the permutation <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.

<p>We have drawn lines to show how the coin acts between each pair of nodes. Notice that <img alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is no longer symmetric, so specifying column-vector inputs matters. For instance, the <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in the top row comes in from the column at <img alt="{1T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and exits at <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. This means the previous coin result was tails and took the walker (from node 2) to node <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>; now the coin gives heads so the walker stays at node <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We can diagram this action also on the expanded graph <img alt="{G'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, so that the <img alt="{b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> goes on the arrow from <img alt="{1T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and so on:</p>

<p>
The first step has no “previous coin result” but we still have to specify one to initialize the coin state as well as the walker’s state. For starting on node <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> there is still an infinitude of combinations of the basis states <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{1T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If we fix the start as <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, this is like saying the coin was heads-up before the initial act of flipping it.</p>

A natural and popular choice of coin is the Hadamard matrix </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; -1 \end{bmatrix}.

<p>We need only mark the edges with <img alt="{d = -1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, keeping the normalizing <img alt="{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> in mind.

To visualize the <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-step walk, say starting from <img alt="{\mathfrak{s}_0 = 1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_0+%3D+1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we take each possible path of length <img alt="{t}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and multiply the numbers on its edges. Over all paths that end at the same <img alt="{\mathfrak{s}=(v,\mathfrak{c})}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D%3D%28v%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bc%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> we add those products to give the <b>amplitude</b> <img alt="{a_{u,v}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_%7Bu%2Cv%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which in our column-first notation equals the entry <img alt="{\mathbf{W}^t[\mathfrak{s},\mathfrak{s}_0]}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%5Et%5B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D%2C%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_0%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. </p>
<p>
For example, there are two paths of <img alt="{t=3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> steps from <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> back to itself. One takes the loop at <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> three times and contributes the phase value <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, but the other does <img alt="{1H\rightarrow 2T \rightarrow 1T \rightarrow 1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%5Crightarrow+2T+%5Crightarrow+1T+%5Crightarrow+1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and picks up the value <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Adding those values cancels them, leaving the red <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> shown at upper left in <img alt="{\mathbf{W}^3}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. If our walker is a Schrödinger cat, that part of it is not just “dead” but completely annihilated.</p>

It is still possible for the cat to end on node <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> after being cubed, because the path <img alt="{1H \rightarrow 1H \rightarrow 2T \rightarrow 1T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H+%5Crightarrow+1H+%5Crightarrow+2T+%5Crightarrow+1T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is not canceled. That the cat ends with phase <img alt="{-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> does not matter, because to get the probabilities—given we started at <img alt="{1H}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>—we take the squared magnitude of each entry in column <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and add the adjacent pairs denoting the same vertex of the original graph <img alt="{G}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Thus the cat has probability only </p>

Most treatments of quantum walks, including a seminal <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012090">paper</a> by Dorit Aharonov, Andris Ambainis, Julia Kempe, and Umesh Vazirani, and an influential 2003 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0303081">survey</a> by Kempe, emphasize the dispersion time being linear rather than quadratic as in classical random walks on undirected graphs. Here, the quadratic nature effects quick divergence between close states like <img alt="{\mathfrak{s}_0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\mathfrak{s}_{38}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7Bs%7D_%7B38%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, which is the signature of dynamical chaos. </p>
<p>
The coin <img alt="{\mathsf{J} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; i \\ i &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BJ%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+1+%26+i+%5C%5C+i+%26+1%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is reputed to make quantum walks smoother. That works to some extent for our three-node graph, but there appears to be no periodic stability, let alone convergence as in the classical case. Simple Python code for trying other coins is available <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse610/qtipwalk.py">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Real or Fiction? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Our main question is simple: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Are these crazy walks real? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The answer is <em>yes</em> if we can engineer a qutrit+qubit system that evolves by repeating <img alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. <em>Simulating</em> such a system throws up a second issue: No one would say that the classical computer executing my Python code is behaving chaotically. We can program <img alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> via basic gates available to run on real hardware at <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/">IBM Quantum</a> or some other services. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Is quantum hardware that applies powers of <img alt="{\mathbf{W}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbf%7BW%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> behaving chaotically? Does that pose a concretely physical impediment to maintaining its coherence? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
On expecting a <em>yes</em> answer to the walks’ physical existence in the microworld, our questions next try to connect to Smith’s paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does the mathematical existence of chaotic quantum systems on such small scales have macroscopic effects in our world? Such as on the chaotic dynamics of our atmosphere? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Again, the answer should be <em>yes</em> at the level of <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-09718-X_73">connecting</a> Brownian motion to quantum processes, or of quantum-walk <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:08ad4a94-483d-46db-8840-6f73c3e48a70/datastream/OBJ/download">interpretations</a> of physical systems such as the quantum harmonic oscillator (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator">QHO</a>). So the most specific form of our question is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does our (not-so-)simple three-node quantum walk appear as a non-negligible term in a Feynman-style summation needed to understand a macroscopic physical system? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Can the quantum chaos of the Q-tip graph be tamed? See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00316.pdf">this</a> for success on other graphs including the 3-cycle. There are are affinities between the 3-cycle and Q-tip walks, especially at even timesteps, and the 3-cycle is an option in the Python code.</p>
<p>
Smith also has many activities promoting STEM, including her <a href="http://www.physicsisfun.net/&quot;">Phyiscs Is Fun</a> website and a <a href="https://books2read.com/u/bMavLX">book</a> on particle physics.  She maintains a <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/blog.html">blog</a> of her writing and reading, plus much else on her <a href="http://www.lesleylsmith.com/">author site</a>.  Dick and I were already wondering about women in the community of math/theory bloggers, such as <a href="https://blog.tanyakhovanova.com/">Tanya Khovanova</a>, <a href="https://fractalkitty.com/">Sophia Wood</a>, <a href="http://vihart.com/">Vi Hart</a>, and <a href="https://mathmunch.org/author/aweltman/">Anna Weltman</a>.  </p>

$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate shortest path problems including
shortest-path-tree and transshipment.
</p>
<p>The universal optimality of our algorithms guarantees that, on any $n$-node
network $G$, our algorithm completes in $T \cdot n^{o(1)}$ rounds whenever a
$T$-round algorithm exists for $G$. This includes $D \cdot n^{o(1)}$-round
algorithms for any planar or excluded-minor network. Our algorithms never
require more than $(\sqrt{n} + D) \cdot n^{o(1)}$ rounds, resulting in the
first sub-linear-round distributed algorithm for transshipment.
</p>
<p>The key technical contribution leading to these results is the first
efficient $n^{o(1)}$-competitive linear $\ell_1$-oblivious routing operator
that does not require the use of $\ell_1$-embeddings. Our construction is
simple, solely based on low-diameter decompositions, and -- in contrast to all
known constructions -- directly produces an oblivious flow instead of just an
approximation of the optimal flow cost. This also has the benefit of
simplifying the interaction with Sherman's multiplicative weight framework
[SODA'17] in the distributed setting and its subsequent rounding procedures.

of $G$ that preserves all friendly cuts of value up to $k$, where a cut in $G$
is called friendly if every node has more edges connecting it to its own side
of the cut than to the other side. We present an algorithm that, given a simple
graph $G$, computes in almost-linear time a friendly cut sparsifier with
$\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k})$ edges. Using similar techniques, we also show how,
given in addition a terminal set $T$, one can compute in almost-linear time a
terminal sparsifier, which preserves the minimum $st$-cut between every pair of
terminals, with $\tilde{O}(n \sqrt{k} + |T| k)$ edges.
</p>
<p>Plugging these sparsifiers into the recent $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithms for
constructing a Gomory-Hu tree of simple graphs, along with a relatively simple
procedure for handling the unfriendly minimum cuts, we improve the running time
for moderately dense graphs (e.g., with $m=n^{1.75}$ edges). In particular,
assuming a linear-time Max-Flow algorithm, the new state-of-the-art for
Gomory-Hu tree is the minimum between our $(m+n^{1.75})^{1+o(1)}$ and the known
$m n^{1/2+o(1)}$.
</p>
<p>We further investigate the limits of this approach and the possibility of
better sparsification. Under the hypothesis that an $\tilde{O}(n)$-edge
sparsifier that preserves all friendly minimum $st$-cuts can be computed
efficiently, our upper bound improves to $\tilde{O}(m+n^{1.5})$ which is the
best possible without breaking the cubic barrier for constructing Gomory-Hu
trees in non-simple graphs.

databases. Such a representation renders the geographic data impracticable for
3D road traffic simulation. In this work, we propose a method to transform raw
GIS data into a realistic, operational model for real-time road traffic
simulation. For instance, the proposed raw to simulation ready data
transformation is achieved through several curvature estimation,
interpolation/approximation, and clustering schemes. The obtained results show
the performance of our approach and prove its adequacy to real traffic

and diameter-reducing shortcut sets. Spanners and emulators are sparse graphs
that approximately preserve the distances of a given graph. A shortcut set is a
set of edges that when added to a directed graph, decreases its diameter. The
previous best known lower bounds for these three structures are given by Huang
and Pettie [SWAT 2018]. For $O(n)$-sized spanners, we improve the lower bound
on the additive stretch from $\Omega(n^{1/11})$ to $\Omega(n^{2/21})$. For
$O(n)$-sized emulators, we improve the lower bound on the additive stretch from
$\Omega(n^{1/18})$ to $\Omega(n^{2/29})$. For $O(m)$-sized shortcut sets, we
improve the lower bound on the graph diameter from $\Omega(n^{1/11})$ to
$\Omega(n^{1/8})$. Our key technical contribution, which is the basis of all of
our bounds, is an improvement of a graph product known as an alternation

food-ordering platforms: Customers order dishes online, and the restaurant
delivers the food after receiving the order. Specifically, we study a problem
where $k$ vehicles of capacity $c$ are serving a set of requests ordering food
from one restaurant. After a request arrives, it can be served by a vehicle
moving from the restaurant to its delivery location. We are interested in
serving all requests while minimizing the maximum flow-time, i.e., the maximum
time length a customer waits to receive his/her food after submitting the
order.
</p>
<p>We show that the problem is hard in both offline and online settings: There
is a hardness of approximation of $\Omega(n)$ for the offline problem, and a
lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm,
where $n$ is number of points in the metric. Our main result is an
$O(1)$-competitive online algorithm for the uncapaciated (i.e, $c = \infty$)
food delivery problem on tree metrics. Then we consider the speed-augmentation
model. We develop an exponential time $(1+\epsilon)$-speeding
$O(1/\epsilon)$-competitive algorithm for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. A polynomial time
algorithm can be obtained with a speeding factor of $\alpha_{TSP}+ \epsilon$ or
$\alpha_{CVRP}+ \epsilon$, depending on whether the problem is uncapacitated.
Here $\alpha_{TSP}$ and $\alpha_{CVRP}$ are the best approximation factors for
the traveling salesman (TSP) and capacitated vehicle routing (CVRP) problems
respectively. We complement the results with some negative ones.

twenty years. A set $S\subseteq V$ of vertices is an offensive alliance in an
undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ if each $v\in N(S)$ has at least as many neighbours
in $S$ as it has neighbours (including itself) not in $S$. We study the
parameterized complexity of the Offensive Alliance problem, where the aim is to
find a minimum size offensive alliance. Our focus here lies on parameters that
measure the structural properties of the input instance. We enhance our
understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity by
showing that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a wide range of fairly
restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback vertex set number,
treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth of the input graph.

such a cut is a classic problem that is dual to that of finding a maximum flow

innovative computer application to the humanities are addressed through two
factors, in addition to the effects of historiography and bibliographies on the

policies, evidenced by the transfer of research effort on graph applications
from temporary interdisciplinary spaces to disciplinary organizations related
to the then-emerging field of computer science; and 2) the erratic careers of
algorithms, in which efficiency, flaws, corrections, and authors' status, were

and a 3OV-hardness lower bound, and in the discrete case, an $O(n^2 \log n)$
time algorithm and a quadratic lower bound. Our bounds are almost tight unless
SETH fails.

    <title>Improved Sliding Window Algorithms for Clustering and Coverage via Bucketing-Based Sketches</title>

The sliding window model is a model of streaming computation which also
captures the recency of the data. In this model, data arrives one item at a
time, but only the latest $W$ data items are considered for a particular
problem. The goal is to output a good solution at the end of the stream by
maintaining a small summary during the stream.
</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a new algorithmic framework for designing efficient
sliding window algorithms via bucketing-based sketches. Based on this new
framework, we develop space-efficient sliding window algorithms for $k$-cover,
$k$-clustering and diversity maximization problems. For each of the above
problems, our algorithm achieves $(1\pm \varepsilon)$-approximation. Compared
with the previous work, it improves both the approximation ratio and the space.

    <title>A Pre-processing Method for Fairness in Ranking</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1635724800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Ryosuke Sonoda <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.15503">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Fair ranking problems arise in many decision-making processes that often
necessitate a trade-off between accuracy and fairness.
</p>
<p>Many existing studies have proposed correction methods such as adding
fairness constraints to a ranking model's loss.
</p>
<p>However, the challenge of correcting the data bias for fair ranking remains,
and the trade-off of the ranking models leaves room for improvement.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a fair ranking framework that evaluates the order
of training data in a pairwise manner as well as various fairness measurements
in ranking.
</p>
<p>This study is the first proposal of a pre-processing method that solves fair
ranking problems using the pairwise ordering method with our best knowledge.
</p>
<p>The fair pairwise ordering method is prominent in training the fair ranking
models because it ensures that the resulting ranking likely becomes parity
across groups.
</p>
<p>As far as the fairness measurements in ranking are represented as a linear
constraint of the ranking models, we proved that the minimization of loss
function subject to the constraints is reduced to the closed solution of the
minimization problem augmented by weights to training data.
</p>
<p>This closed solution inspires us to present a practical and stable algorithm
that iterates the optimization of weights and model parameters.
</p>
<p>The empirical results over real-world datasets demonstrated that our method
outperforms the existing methods in the trade-off between accuracy and fairness
over real-world datasets and various fairness measurements.

determine its physical properties in thermal equilibrium. Here we study the
computational complexity of approximating these quantities for $n$-qubit local
Hamiltonians. First, we report a classical algorithm with $\mathrm{poly}(n)$
runtime which approximates the free energy of a given $2$-local Hamiltonian
provided that it satisfies a certain denseness condition. Our algorithm
combines the variational characterization of the free energy and convex
relaxation methods. It contributes to a body of work on efficient approximation
algorithms for dense instances of optimization problems which are hard in the
general case, and can be viewed as simultaneously extending existing algorithms
for (a) the ground energy of dense $2$-local Hamiltonians, and (b) the free
energy of dense classical Ising models. Secondly, we establish polynomial-time
equivalence between the problem of approximating the free energy of local
Hamiltonians and three other natural quantum approximate counting problems,
including the problem of approximating the number of witness states accepted by
a QMA verifier. These results suggest that simulation of quantum many-body
systems in thermal equilibrium may precisely capture the complexity of a broad
family of computational problems that has yet to be defined or characterized in
terms of known complexity classes. Finally, we summarize state-of-the-art
classical and quantum algorithms for approximating the free energy and show how
to improve their runtime and memory footprint.

    <title>Recognizing k-leaf powers in polynomial time, for constant k</title>

$V(G)$, and such that $uv \in E(G)$ if and only if the distance between $u$ and
$v$ in $T$ is at most $k$. The graph classes of $k$-leaf powers have several
applications in computational biology, but recognizing them has remained a
challenging algorithmic problem for the past two decades. The best known result
is that $6$-leaf powers can be recognized in polynomial time. In this paper, we
present an algorithm that decides whether a graph $G$ is a $k$-leaf power in
time $O(n^{f(k)})$ for some function $f$ that depends only on $k$ (but has the
growth rate of a power tower function).
</p>
<p>Our techniques are based on the fact that either a $k$-leaf power has a
corresponding tree of low maximum degree, in which case finding it is easy, or
every corresponding tree has large maximum degree. In the latter case, large
degree vertices in the tree imply that $G$ has redundant substructures which
can be pruned from the graph. In addition to solving a longstanding open
problem, we hope that the structural results presented in this work can lead to
further results on $k$-leaf powers.

plane. Almost three decades ago, an elegant polynomial-time algorithm was found
for \textsc{Maximum Clique} on unit disk graphs [Clark, Colbourn, Johnson;
Discrete Mathematics '90]. Since then, it has been an intriguing open question
whether or not tractability can be extended to general disk graphs. We show
that the disjoint union of two odd cycles is never the complement of a disk
graph nor of a unit (3-dimensional) ball graph. From that fact and existing
results, we derive a simple QPTAS and a subexponential algorithm running in
time $2^{\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})}$ for \textsc{Maximum Clique} on disk and unit ball
graphs. We then obtain a randomized EPTAS for computing the independence number
on graphs having no disjoint union of two odd cycles as an induced subgraph,
bounded VC-dimension, and linear independence number. This, in combination with
our structural results, yields a randomized EPTAS for \textsc{Max Clique} on
disk and unit ball graphs. \textsc{Max Clique} on unit ball graphs is
equivalent to finding, given a collection of points in $\mathbb R^3$, a maximum
subset of points with diameter at most some fixed value. In stark contrast,
\textsc{Maximum Clique} on ball graphs and unit $4$-dimensional ball graphs, as
well as intersection graphs of filled ellipses (even close to unit disks) or
filled triangles is unlikely to have such algorithms. Indeed, we show that, for
all those problems, there is a constant ratio of approximation which cannot be
attained even in time $2^{n^{1-\varepsilon}}$, unless the Exponential Time
Hypothesis fails.

their individual private inputs $x$ and $y$. They do this by engaging in a
non-adaptive (fixed order, fixed length) protocol to jointly compute $f(x,y)$.
The goal is to do this in an error-resilient way, such that even given some
fraction of adversarial corruptions, both parties still learn $f(x,y)$.
</p>
<p>In this work, we study the optimal error resilience of such a protocol in the
face of adversarial bit flip or erasures. While the optimal error resilience of
such a protocol over a large alphabet is well understood, the situation over
the binary alphabet has remained open. In this work, we resolve this problem of
determining the optimal error resilience over binary channels. In particular,
we construct protocols achieving $\frac16$ error resilience over the binary bit
flip channel and $\frac12$ error resilience over the binary erasure channel,
for both of which matching upper bounds are known. We remark that the
communication complexity of our binary bit flip protocol is polynomial in the
size of the inputs, and the communication complexity of our binary erasure
protocol is linear in the size of the minimal noiseless protocol computing $f$.

    <title>When did Math Get So Hard?</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><br/>
I have been on many Math PhD thesis defense's  as the Dean's Representative. This means I don't have to understand the work, just make sure the rules are followed. I've done this for a while and I used to understand some of it but now there are times I understand literally none of it. As a result, when the student leaves the room and we talk among ourselves I ask<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When did Math get so hard?<br/>
<br/>
I mean it as a statement and maybe a joke, but I decided to email various people and ask for a serious answer. Here are some thoughts of mine and others<div><br/></div><div>1) When you get older math got harder. Lance blogged on this <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/a-young-persons-game.html">here</a></div><div><br/></div><div>2) When math got more abstract it got harder. Blame Grothendieck.</div><div><br/></div><div>3) When math stopped being tied to the real work it got harder. Blame Hardy. </div><div><br/></div><div>4) Math has always been hard. We NOW understand some of the older math better so it seems easy to us, but it wasn't at the time. </div><div><br/></div><div>5) With the web and more people working in math, new results come out faster so its harder to keep up.</div><div><br/></div><div>6) All fields of math have a period of time when they are easy, at the beginning, and then as the low-hanging fruit gets picked it gets harder and harder.  So if a NEW branch was started it might initially be easy. Counterthought- even a new branch might be hard now since it can draw on so much prior math. Also, the low hanging fruit may be picked rather quickly. </div><div><br/>

    <summary>Square-difference-free set (\(\mathbb{M}\)), now a Good Article on Wikipedia. As the name suggests, these are sets of integers no two of which differ by a square. My favorite such set consists of the losing positions in subtract-a-square, where each move removes a square number of coins from a pile of coins, winning by taking the last coin. This general class of sets and the subtract-a-square set have \(o(n)\) elements up to \(n\), but their maximum density remains unknown.</summary>

    <p>The classical CS interview question of destructively reversing a singly-linked list goes back at least to <a href="http://i.stanford.edu/pub/cstr/reports/cs/tr/76/544/CS-TR-76-544.pdf">Ed McCreight in 1973</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/107147889403810499">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>).

    <title>Two counterexamples for covering points by two polygons</title>
    <summary>One of our students made a seminar presentation this week on the problem of covering a given set of \(n\) points by two scaled and translated copies of a given convex \(k\)-gon, minimizing the scale factor, based on a 2016 conference paper on the problem published by someone else. The presentation was good but the paper turns out to be wrong in several ways. I think it should not be difficult to find the paper if you look, but I’m avoiding naming it here: it’s uncited, so it hasn’t done much damage to the literature, its author’s other papers are not as far as I know problematic, the author appears to want to forget the paper (there was no journal version and it is not included in their online publication list), and I want to focus on the geometric nature of the mistakes rather than on pointing fingers.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>One of our students made a seminar presentation this week on the problem of covering
a given set of \(n\) points by two scaled and translated copies of a given convex <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-gon,</span> minimizing the scale factor, based on a 2016 conference paper on the problem published by someone else. The presentation was good but the paper turns out to be wrong in several ways. I think it should not be difficult to find the paper if you look, but I’m avoiding naming it here: it’s uncited, so it hasn’t done much damage to the literature, its author’s other papers are not as far as I know problematic, the author appears to want to forget the paper (there was no journal version and it is not included in their online publication list), and I want to focus on the geometric nature of the mistakes rather than on pointing fingers.</p>

<p>The algorithm of the paper starts by (correctly) computing the optimal cover of the given points by a single copy of the polygon. This is a low-dimensional linear program, but one with \(O(nk)\) constraints, one for each pair of a side of the polygon and an input point to be covered. The paper makes the observation that the only pairs that matter are the ones that match each side to the extreme point in a perpendicular direction, and it uses a nice divide-and-conquer method to find these extreme points in time \(O(n\log k)\), which turns out to be the bottleneck of the algorithm.</p>

<p>It then tries to use this one-copy cover to speed up the two-copy cover, and this is where things go wrong. It claims that if the one-copy cover has five or more of its sides touched by input points, then the optimal two-copy cover has the same scale factor: there are so many touching points that three or more of them would all have to be in the same copy of the two-copy cover, and would force it to have the same size as the one-copy cover. This is false.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Even when a regular hexagon is touched on six sides by the points that it covers, it may be possible to cover the same points by two smaller regular hexagons" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/6fixture-can-shrink.svg"/></p>

<p>It claims that, when four or fewer sides of the one-copy cover are touched by input points, then for the optimal two-copy cover, one of the two copies will be touched on two sides with the same slopes. If true this would greatly simplify the search for the optimal partition into two subsets and the optimal scale factor for that partition. But it is false: there exist instances where the slopes of sides touched on the two-copy cover are completely disjoint from the slopes touched on the one-copy cover.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Even when an octagon is touched on four sides by the points that it covers, the smallest two scaled and translated octagons that cover the same points may not be touched on any of the same sides" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/4fixture-can-shrink.svg"/></p>

<p>I think what is going on here is a more general phenomenon relating to linear programming, rather than to this specific geometric optimization problem. Suppose you have a linear program with \(k\) variables (here, three variables for the scale factor and translation vector of the single-copy cover), and to keep things simple let’s say that it has a unique optimal solution. That solution will be determined by a basis, a minimal subset of inequalities with the same solution. The basis inequalities become tight equalities rather than inequalities, and if you know which ones they are then you can just solve these \(k\) linear equations in the \(k\) unknowns. However, more than \(k\) inequalities may be  tight, and there may be more than one basis. With some additional assumptions that are automatically satisfied here you can choose any <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-tuple</span> of tight inequalities, solve linear equations, and get the same solution. But that does <em>not</em> mean that every <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-tuple</span> of tight inequalities is a basis, and it does not mean that these tight inequalities stay tight for all subsets of the constraints.</p>

<p>Turning this idea back into geometry, in each of these figures, the inequalities come from pairs of a point and a polygon side. Each inequality states that its point must be contained in the halfspace bounded by its side, and it is tight when the point lies on the side. Any translated and scaled copy of a polygon is determined by points that touch any three of its sides. But forming a basis, for the problem of covering points with the smallest possible copy, is a stronger property. A set of three sides and (maybe fewer than three) touching points forms a basis only when the normal vectors to those sides do not span an angle less <span style="white-space: nowrap;">than \(\pi\).</span></p>

<p>For instance, for the hexagons of the first illustration, triples of consecutive sides have normal vectors that span only an angle <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of \(2\pi/3\),</span> too small to form a basis. Other triples of sides have normal vectors that are more spread out and do form a basis. The blue one-copy hexagon containing all of the points is optimal, because all six of its sides are touched, and many triples of those touched sides are non-consecutive. But when we split the points into the two yellow hexagons, each yellow hexagon contains the points that touch only a consecutive triple of blue sides, not a basis. Because they are not a basis, those three points (and the other points that are grouped along with them) can be contained in a smaller hexagon than the blue one. (Exercise: find a basis for one of the yellow hexagons, showing that at least for this partition into two subsets the scale factor is optimal.)</p>

    <title>Fall 2021 Jobs Post</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We're in the midst of a great transformation in computing, one where data takes center stage and I predict this will start to have a larger effect on hiring in computer science departments. We'll see a bigger need to grow in data science, particularly machine learning and autonomous systems. Cybersecurity and quantum computing will also grow with a push due to competition with China. Quantum winter might be coming but we're not there yet.</p><p>Harder to predict is the rest of computer science, such as traditional areas like networks, operating systems, programming languages and, yes, theory, particularly theory unrelated to quantum, learning or security. There is still a need for CS departments to grow in these areas, but we may be moving away from a rising tide raising all boats. On the other hand due to the digital transformation of just about everything, non-CS departments are hiring people who look a lot like computer scientists.</p><p>Other factors may cause US universities to be more conservative in hiring such as a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-university-fall-higher-education-men-women-enrollment-admissions-back-to-school-11630948233?st=1oz46jkmsdq8jcq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">drop in male students</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.cupahr.org/issue/feature/higher-ed-enrollment-cliff/">demographic cliff</a>, an unclear future for international students coming to the states, and a lingering COVID budget hangover.</p><p>So go get a job while the going is still good though I would not suggest forgoing a faculty position for a postdoc, particularly if you aren't working in data science.</p><p>I also wonder how the post-COVID world will affect the job search. We'll probably see more virtual interviews than the pre-COVID days at least in the early rounds. It's also harder for students to network and make themselves known at virtual and hybrid conferences which will likely persist for some time.</p><p>Give yourself a good virtual face. Have a well-designed web page with access to all your job materials and papers. Maintain your Google Scholar page. Add yourself to the CRA's <a href="https://cra.org/cv-database/">CV database</a>. Find a way to stand out, perhaps a short video describing your research. </p><p>Best source for finding jobs are the ads from the <a href="https://cra.org/ads/">CRA</a> and the <a href="https://jobs.acm.org/">ACM</a>. For theoretical computer science specific postdoc and faculty positions check out <a href="https://cstheory-jobs.org/">TCS Jobs</a> and <a href="http://dmatheorynet.blogspot.com/">Theory Announcements</a>. If you have jobs to announce, please post to the above and/or feel free to leave a comment on this post. Even if you don't see an ad for a specific school they may still be hiring, check out their website or email someone at the department. You'll never know if you don't ask.</p></div>

    <title>How to deploy machine learning with differential privacy?</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In many applications of machine learning, such as machine learning for medical diagnosis, we would like to have machine learning algorithms that do not memorize sensitive information about the training set, such as the specific medical histories of individual patients. Differential privacy is a notion that allows quantifying the degree of privacy protection provided by an algorithm on the underlying (sensitive) data set it operates on. Through the lens of differential privacy, we can design machine learning algorithms that responsibly train models on private data.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-private-machine-learning-algorithms">Why do we need private machine learning algorithms?</h2>

<p>Machine learning algorithms work by studying a lot of data and updating their parameters to encode the relationships in that data. Ideally, we would like the parameters of these machine learning models to encode general patterns (e.g., ‘‘patients who smoke are more likely to have heart disease’’) rather than facts about specific training examples (e.g., “Jane Smith has heart disease”). Unfortunately, machine learning algorithms do not learn to ignore these specifics by default. If we want to use machine learning to solve an important task, like making a cancer diagnosis model, then when we publish that machine learning model (for example, by making an open source cancer diagnosis model for doctors all over the world to use) we might also inadvertently reveal information about the training set. A malicious attacker might be able to inspect the published model’s predictions and learn private information about Jane Smith. For instance, the adversary could mount a membership inference attack to know whether or not Jane Smith contributed her data to the model’s training set [SSS17]. The adversary could also build on membership inference attacks to extract training data by repeatedly guessing possible training points until they result in a sufficiently strong membership signal from the model’s prediction [CTW20]. In many instances, the model itself may be represented by a few of the data samples (e.g., Support Vector Machine in its dual form).</p>

<p>A common misconception is that if a model generalizes (i.e., performs well on the test examples), then it preserves privacy. As mentioned earlier, this is far from being true. One of the main reasons being that generalization is an average case behavior of a model (over the distribution of data samples), whereas privacy must be provided for everyone, including outliers (which may deviate from our distributional assumptions).</p>

<p>Over the years, researchers have proposed various approaches towards protecting privacy in learning algorithms (k-anonymity [SS98], l-diversity [MKG07], m-invariance [XT07], t-closeness [LLV07] etc.). Unfortunately, [GKS08] all these approaches are vulnerable to what are called composition attacks, that use auxiliary information to violate the privacy protection. Famously, this strategy allowed researchers to de-anonymize part of a movie ratings dataset released to participants of the Netflix Prize when the individuals had also shared their movie ratings publicly on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) [NS08]. If Jane Smith had assigned the same ratings to movies A, B and C in the Netflix Prize dataset and publicly on IMDb at similar times, then researchers could link data corresponding to Jane across both datasets. This would in turn give them the means to recover ratings that were included in the Netflix Prize but not on IMDb. This example shows how difficult it is to define and guarantee privacy because it is hard to estimate the scope of knowledge—about individuals—available to adversaries. While the dataset released by Netflix has since been taken down, it is difficult to ensure that all of its copies have been deleted. In recent years, data sample instance encoding based methods like InstaHide [HSL20], and NeuraCrypt [YEO21] have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to such composition attacks as well.</p>

<p>As a result, the research community has converged on differential privacy [DMNS06], which provides the following semantic guarantee, as opposed to ad-hoc approaches: An adversary learns almost the same information about an individual whether or not they are present in or absent from the training data set. In particular, it provides a condition on the algorithm, independent from who might be attacking it, or the specifics of the data set instantiation.  Put another way, differential privacy is a framework for evaluating the guarantees provided by a system that was designed to protect privacy. Such systems can be applied directly to “raw” data which potentially still contains sensitive information, altogether removing the need for procedures that sanitize or anonymize data and are prone to the failures described previously. That said, minimizing data collection in the first place remains a good practice to limit other forms of privacy risk.</p>

<h2 id="designing-private-machine-learning-algorithms-via-differential-privacy">Designing Private Machine Learning Algorithms via Differential Privacy</h2>

<p>Differential privacy [DMNS06] is a semantic notion of privacy that addresses a lot of the limitations of previous approaches like k-anonymity. The basic idea is to randomize part of the mechanism’s behavior to provide privacy. In our case, the mechanism considered is a learning algorithm, but the differential privacy framework can be applied to study any algorithm.</p>

<p>The intuition for why we introduce randomness into the learning algorithm is that it obscures the contribution of an individual, but does not obscure important statistical patterns. Without randomness, we would be able to ask questions like: “What parameters does the learning algorithm choose when we train it on this specific dataset?” With randomness in the learning algorithm, we instead ask questions like: “What is the probability that the learning algorithm will choose parameters in this set of possible parameters, when we train it on this specific dataset?”</p>

<p>We use a version of differential privacy which requires (in our use case of machine learning) that the probability of learning any particular set of parameters stays roughly the same if we change a single data record in the training set. A data record can be a single training example from an individual, or the collection of all the training examples provided by an individual. The former is often referred to as example level/item level privacy, and the latter is referred to as user level differential privacy. While user level privacy provides stronger semantics, it may be harder to achieve. For a more thorough discussion about the taxonomy of these notions, see [DNPR10, JTT18, HR12, HR13]. In this document, for the ease of exposition of the technical results, we focus on the example level notion. This could mean to add a training example, remove a training example, or change the values within one training example. The intuition is that if a single patient (Jane Smith) does not affect the outcome of learning much, then that patient’s records cannot be memorized and her privacy is respected. In the rest of this post, how much a single record can affect the outcome of learning is called the sensitivity of an algorithm.</p>

<p>The guarantee of differential privacy is that the adversary is not able to distinguish the answers produced by the randomized algorithm based on the data of two of the three users from the answers returned by the same algorithm based on the data of all three users. We also refer to the degree of indistinguishability as the privacy loss. Smaller privacy loss corresponds to a stronger privacy guarantee.</p>

<p>It is often thought that privacy is a fundamental bottleneck in obtaining good prediction accuracy/generalization for machine learning algorithms. In fact, recent research has shown that in many instances it actually helps in designing algorithms with strong generalization ability. Some of the examples where DP has resulted in designing better learning algorithms are Online linear predictions [KV05] and online PCA [DTTZ13]. Notably, [DFH15] formally showed that generalization for any DP learning algorithm comes for free. More concretely, if a DP learning algorithm has good training accuracy, it is guaranteed to have good test accuracy.
This is true because differential privacy itself acts as a very strong form of regularization.</p>

<p>One might argue that the generalization guarantee which a DP algorithm can achieve may be sub-par to that of its non-private baselines. For a large class of learning tasks, one can show that asymptotically DP does not introduce any further error beyond the inherent statistical error [SSTT21]. [ACG16,BFTT19] highlights that in the presence of enough data, a DP algorithm can get arbitrarily close to the inherent statistical error, even under strong privacy parameters.</p>

<h2 id="private-empirical-risk-minimization">Private Empirical Risk Minimization</h2>

<p>Before we go into the design of specific differentially private learning algorithms, we first formalize the problem setup, and standardize some notation. Consider a training data set \(D={(x_1,y_1),…,(x_n,y_n)}\) drawn i.i.d. from some fixed (unknown) distribution \(\Pi\), with the feature vector being \(x_i\) and label/response being \(y_i\). We define the training loss at any model \(\theta\) as \(L_{train} (\theta, D) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(\theta; (x_i, y_i))\), and the corresponding test loss as \(L_{test} (\theta) = E_{(x,y) \sim \Pi} l(\theta;(x,y)) \).
We will design DP algorithms to output models that approximately minimize the test loss while having access only to the training loss.</p>

<p>In the literature, there are a variety of approaches towards designing these DP learning algorithms [CMS11, KST12, BST14, PAE16, BTT18]. One can categorize them broadly as: i) algorithms that assume that the individual loss function \(l(\theta;\cdot) \) is convex in the model parameter  to ensure differential privacy, ii) algorithms that are differentially private even when the loss function is non-convex in nature (e.g., deep learning models), and iii) model agnostic algorithms, that do not require any information about the representation of the model \(\theta\), or the loss function \(l(\theta;\cdot) \). In our current discussion, we will only focus on designing algorithms for (ii), and (iii). This is because it turns out that the best known algorithms for (ii) are already competitive to algorithms that are specific for (i) [INS19].</p>

<h2 id="private-algorithms-for-training-deep-learning-models">Private Algorithms for Training Deep Learning Models</h2>

<p>The first approach, due to SCS13, BST14, and ACG16, is named differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). It proposes to modify the model updates computed by the most common optimizer used in deep learning: stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Typically, stochastic gradient descent trains iteratively. At each iteration, a small number of training examples (a “minibatch”) are sampled from the training set. The optimizer computes the average model error on these examples, and then differentiates this average error with respect to each of the model parameters to obtain a gradient vector. Finally, the model parameters (\(\theta_t\)) are updated by subtracting this gradient (\(\nabla_t\)) multiplied by a small constant \(\eta\) (the learning rate controls how quickly the optimizer updates the model’s parameters). At a high level, two modifications are made by DP-SGD to obtain differential privacy: gradients, which are computed on a per-example basis (rather than averaged over multiple examples), are first clipped to control their sensitivity, and, second, spherical Gaussian noise \(b_t\) is added to their sum to obtain the indistinguishability needed for DP. Succinctly, the update step can be written as follows: \(\theta_{t+1} \leftarrow \theta_t - \eta \cdot (\nabla_t + b_t)\).</p>

<p>Let us take the example of a hospital training a model to predict whether patients will be readmitted after being released. To train the model, the hospital uses information from patient records, such as demographic variables and admission variables (e.g., age, ethnicity, insurance type, type of Intensive Care Unit admitted to) but also time-varying vitals and labs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, white blood cell counts) [JPS16]. The modifications made by DP-SGD ensure that if (1) Jane Smith’s individual patient record contained unusual features, e.g., her insurance provider was uncommon for people of her age or her heart rate followed an unusual pattern, the resulting signal will have a bounded impact on our model updates, and (2) the model’s final parameters would be essentially identical should Jane Smith have chosen to not contribute (i.e., opt-out) her patient record to the training set. Stronger differential privacy is achieved when one is able to introduce more noise (i.e., sample noise with larger standard deviation) and train for as few iterations as possible.</p>

<p>Two main components in the above DP-SGD algorithm that distinguishes itself from traditional SGD are: i) per-example clipping and ii) Gaussian noise addition. In addition, for the analysis to hold, DP-SGD requires that sub-sampling of mini batches is uniform at random from the training data set. While this is not a requirement of DP-SGD per se, in practice many implementations of SGD do not satisfy this requirement and instead analyze different permutations of the data at each epoch of training.</p>

<p>While gradient clipping is common in deep learning, often used as a form of regularization, it differs from that in DP-SGD as follows: The average gradient over the minibatch is clipped, as opposed to clipping the gradient of individual examples (i.e., \(l(\theta_t;(x,y)) \) before averaging. It is an ongoing research direction to both understand the effect of per-example clipping in DP-SGD in model training [SSTT21], and also effective ways to mitigate its impact both in terms of accuracy [PTS21], and training time [ZHS19].</p>

<p>In standard stochastic gradient descent, subsampling is usually used either as a way to speed up the training process [CAR16], or as a a form of regularization [RCR15]. In DP-SGD, the randomness in the subsampling of the minibatch is used to guarantee DP. The technical component for this sort of privacy analysis is called privacy amplification by subsampling [KLNRS08,BBG18]. Since the sampling randomness is used to guarantee DP, it is crucial that the uniformity in the sampling step is of cryptographic strength. Another, (possibly) counterintuitive feature of DP-SGD is that for best privacy/utility trade-off it is in general better to have larger batch sizes. In fact, full-batch DP-gradient descent may provide the best privacy/utility trade-offs, albeit at the expense of computational feasibility.</p>

<p>For a fixed DP guarantee, the magnitude of the Gaussian noise that gets added to the gradient updates in each step in DP-SGD is proportional to \(\sqrt{the\ number\ of\ steps}\) the model is trained for. As a result, it is important to tune the number of training steps for best privacy/utility trade-offs.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy/blob/master/tutorials/mnist_dpsgd_tutorial.py">following tutorial</a>, we provide a small code snippet to train a model with DP-SGD.</p>

<h2 id="model-agnostic-private-learning">Model Agnostic Private Learning</h2>

<p>The Sample and Aggregate framework [NRS07] is a generic method to add differential privacy to a non-private algorithm without caring about the internal workings of it, a.k.a. model agnostic. In the context of machine learning, one can state the main idea as follows: Consider a multi-class classification problem. Take the training data, and split into k disjoint subsets of equal size. Train independent models \(\theta_1, \theta_2, …, \theta_k \) on the disjoint subsets. In order to predict on an test example x, first, compute a private histogram over the set of k predictions \(\theta_1(x), \theta_2(x), …, \theta_k(x) \). Then, select and output the bin in the histogram based on the highest count, after adding a small amount of Laplace/Gaussian noise to the counts. In the context of DP learning, this particular approach was used in two different lines of work: i) PATE [PAE16], and ii) Model agnostic private learning [BTT18]. While the latter focussed on obtaining theoretical privacy/utility trade-offs for a class of learning tasks (e.g., agnostic PAC learning), the PATE approach focuses on practical deployment. Both these lines of work make one common observation. If the predictions from \(\theta_1(x), \theta_2(x), …, \theta_k(x) \) are fairly consistent, then the privacy cost in terms of DP is very small. Hence, one can run a large number of prediction queries, without violating DP constraints. In the following, we describe the PATE approach in detail.</p>

<p>The private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) demonstrated in particular that this approach allows one to learn deep neural networks with differential privacy. It proposes to have an ensemble of models trained without privacy predict with differential privacy by having these models predict in aggregate rather than revealing their individual predictions. In PATE, we start by partitioning the private dataset into smaller subsets of data. These subsets are partitions, so there is no overlap between the data included in any pair of partitions. If Jane Smith’s record was in our private dataset, then it is included in one of the partitions only. That is, only one of the teachers has analyzed Jane Smith’s record during training. We train a ML model, called a teacher, on each of these partitions. We now have an ensemble of teacher models that were trained independently, but without any guarantees of privacy. How do we use this ensemble to make predictions that respect privacy? In PATE, we add noise while aggregating the predictions made individually by each teacher to form a single common prediction. We count the number of teachers who voted for each class, and then perturb that count by adding random noise sampled from the Laplace or Gaussian distribution. Each label predicted by the noisy aggregation mechanism comes with rigorous differential privacy guarantees that bound the privacy budget spent to label that input. Again, stronger differential privacy is achieved when we are able to introduce more noise in the aggregation and are able to answer as few queries as possible. Let us now come back to our running example. Imagine that we’d like to use the output of PATE to know if Jane likes a particular movie. The only teacher trained on the partition containing Jane Smith’s data—has now learned that a record similar to Jane’s is characteristic of an individual who likes similar movies, and as a consequence changes its prediction on a test input which is similar to Jane’s to predict the movie rating assigned by Jane. However, because the teacher only contributes a single vote to the aggregation, and that the aggregation injects noise, we won’t be able to know whether the teacher changed its prediction to the movie rating assigned by Jane because the teacher indeed trained on Jane’s data or because the noise injected during the aggregation “flipped” that teacher’s vote. The random noise added to vote counts prevents the outcome of aggregation from reflecting the votes of any individual teachers to protect privacy.</p>

<h2 id="practically-deploying-differential-privacy-in-machine-learning">Practically deploying differential privacy in machine learning</h2>

<p>The two approaches we introduced have the advantage of being conceptually simple to understand. Fortunately, there also exist several open-source implementations of these approaches. For instance, DP-SGD is implemented in TensorFlow Privacy, Objax, and Opacus. This means that one is able to take an existing TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch pipeline for training a machine learning model and replace a non-private optimizer with DP-SGD. An example implementation of PATE is also available in TensorFlow Privacy. So what are the concrete potential obstacles to deploying machine learning with differential privacy?</p>

<p>The first obstacle is the accuracy of privacy-preserving models. Datasets are often sampled from distribution with heavy tails. For instance, in a medical application, there are typically (and fortunately) fewer patients with a given medical condition than patients without that condition. This means that there are fewer training examples for patients with each medical condition to learn from. Because differential privacy prevents us from learning patterns which are not found generally across the training data, it limits our ability to learn from these patients for which we have very few examples of [SPG]. More generally, there is often a trade-off between the accuracy of a model and the strength of the differential privacy guarantee it was trained with: the smaller the privacy budget is, the larger the impact on accuracy typically is. That said, this tension is not always inevitable and there are instances where privacy and accuracy are synergical because differential privacy implies generalization [DFH15] (but not vice versa).</p>

<p>The second obstacle to deploying differentially private machine learning can be the computational overhead. For instance, in DP-SGD one must compute per-example gradients rather than average gradients. This often means that optimizations implemented in machine learning frameworks to exploit matrix algebra supported by underlying hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs) are harder to take advantage of. In another example, PATE requires that one train multiple models (the teachers) rather than a single model so this can also introduce overhead in the training procedure. Fortunately, this cost is mostly mitigated in recent implementations of private learning algorithms, in particular in Objax and Opacus.</p>

<p>The third obstacle to deploying differential privacy, in machine learning but more generally in any form of data analysis, is the choice of privacy budget. The smaller the budget, the stronger the guarantee is. This means one can compare two analyses and say which one is “more private”. However, this also means that it is unclear what is “small enough” of a privacy budget. This is particularly problematic given that applications of differential privacy to machine learning often require a privacy budget that provides little theoretical guarantees in order to train a model whose accuracy is large enough to warrant a useful deployment. Thus, it may be interesting for practitioners to evaluate the privacy of their machine learning algorithm by attacking it themselves. Whereas the theoretical analysis of an algorithm’s differential privacy guarantees provides a worst-case guarantee limiting how much private information the algorithm can leak against any adversary, implementing a specific attack can be useful to know how successful a particular adversary or class of adversaries would be. This helps interpret the theoretical guarantee but may not be treated as a direct substitute for it. Open-source implementations of such attacks are increasingly available: e.g., for membership inference <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy/tree/master/tensorflow_privacy/privacy/privacy_tests/membership_inference_attack">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cchoquette/membership-inference">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the above, we discussed some of the algorithmic approaches towards differentially private model training which have been effective both in theoretical and practical settings. Since it is a rapidly growing field, we could not cover all the important aspects of the research space. Some prominent ones include: i) Choice of the best hyperparameters in the training of DP models.In order to ensure that the overall algorithm preserves differential privacy, one needs to ensure that the choice of hyperparameters itself preserves DP. Recent research has provided algorithms for selecting the best hyperparameters in a differentially private fashion [LT19]. ii) Choice of network architecture: it is not always true that the best known model architectures for non-private model training are indeed the best for training with differential privacy. In particular, we know that the number of model parameters may have adverse effects on the privacy/utility trade-offs [BST14]. Hence, choosing the right model architecture is important for providing a good privacy/utility trade-off [PTS21]. (iii) Training in the federated/distributed setting: in the above exposition, we assumed that the training data lies in a single centralized location. However, in settings like Federated Learning (FL) [MMRHA17], the data records can be highly distributed, e.g., across various mobile devices. Running DP-SGD in the FL setting, which is required for FL to provide privacy guarantees for the training data, raises a series of challenges [KMA19] which are often facilitated by distributed private learning algorithms designed specifically for FL settings [BKMTT20, KMSTTZ21]. Some of the specific challenges in the context of FL include, limited and non-uniform availability of clients (holding individual data records) and unknown (and variable) size of the training data [BKMTT18]. On the other hand, PATE style algorithms lend themselves naturally to the distributed setting once combined with existing cryptographic primitives, as demonstrated by the CaPC protocol [CDD21]. It is an active area of research to address these above challenges.</p>

    <title>How to send a real number using a single bit (and some shared randomness)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In this post, we'll look at the natural problem of how to communicate an estimate of a real value in [0,1], using just 1 bit.  The post is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02331" target="_blank">this paper</a> (by Ran Ben-Basat of UCL and Shay Vargaftik of VMware Research and myself -- they helped also with the post) that appeared in ICALP last year. </p><p>This question is motivated by various aggregation problems;  multiple sending devices may measure a value, and wish to send the value to an aggregator who will compute something from the received values, such as the average.  In our problem, the senders have a real value x in [0,1] to send, but are constrained to send just a single bit.  Variations of this problem have come up in recent work on distributed/federated learning, where clients compute a gradient vector and send it to a centralized parameter server to update a learning model;  we may want to compress the vector to a small number of bits, or even 1 bit, per coordinate.  (We'll have more to say on the federated learning problem in a future post.)  Of course, it's also just an interesting randomized algorithm problem that seems interesting in its own right.  </p><p>A natural way to look at the problem is as a variation on rounding.  Given a value x in [0,1], one natural approach if limited to one bit is to deterministically round it to X.  But what should the receiver do when they receive the (rounded) bit value X?  It depends on what one's optimization goal is, but to minimize the maximum possible error, the receiver should have their estimate x' take on the value 3/4 when X is 1, 1/4 otherwise.  Note though that deterministic rounding this way is biased -- the expectation E[x'] does not equal x.  Randomized rounding, where the sender sends 1 with probability x and 0 otherwise, and the receiver uses the received bit X as the estimate x', has the property that E[x'] = x.  Unbiased estimators are arguably more natural for many estimation problems.  Here the measure of performance would be the maximum variance for the estimate over all inputs x, so for randomized rounding the cost is 1/4 (when x = 1/2).  </p><p>Can one do better than these schemes?  It turns out that you can, if you have available shared randomness.  An approach that has been known in the engineering world (where it has been used in signal processing) is subtractive dithering:  </p><p>We assume that the sender and receiver have access to shared randomness ℎ∼𝑈[−1/2,1/2].  Given a value x, the sender sends 1 if x+h≥1/2, 0 otherwise.  The receiver estimates x' = X - h.  We leave as an exercise that this is unbiased, which can be shown by deriving the stronger fact that x' is distributed as 𝑈[𝑥−1/2,𝑥+1/2] , and thus Var[𝑥']=1/12.</p><p>Subtractive dithering ignores that generating a shared real number may be more costly or problematic than generating a finite number of shared bits.  So one of the results of our paper is developing a "finite shared random bits" unbiased estimator, that corresponds to randomized rounding with no shared bits and converges to subtractive dithering as the number of shared random bits goes to infinity.  (The approach does allow for generating a private random real value.)  </p><p>Also in our paper, we study biased schemes, aiming to minimize the worst-case expected mean-squared error (where the expectation is over randomness used in the algorithm).  For example, it's very odd in the setting of subtractive dithering that one can obtain estimates smaller than 0 or greater than 1, when the input is restricted to [0,1], but that's a price we pay for having an unbiased estimator.  For  a biased estimator, you might naturally truncate the result from subtractive dithering;  by truncating to [z,1-z] for an appropriate z &gt; 0, you can indeed slightly improve over the worst-case mean-squared error of 1/16 for deterministic rounding.</p><p>We then studied various algorithmic improvements to obtain better biased schemes.  We were able to progress by looking at limited shared randomness, namely finding the best algorithm with s shared bits.  For example, consider the case of just 1 shared random bit h in {0,1}.  The receiver receives 1 bit X from the sender, and thus can have four possible estimates x' depending on X and h.  If the 4 possible estimate values are v0, v1, v2, v3 (all between 0 and 1), then it is possible to show the largest possible expected squared error occurs at one of the five inputs 0, 1, (v0+v1)/2, (v1+v2)/2, (v2+v3)/2.   We can then write a quadratic program to find the values that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error.  The end result is the following rounding algorithm:  given 1 shared random bit h in {0,1} and the value x, let X = 1 if x ≥ 0.4 + 0.2h, and 0 otherwise;  then let the estimate x' = 0.1 + 0.2h + 0.6X.  This has a worst-case expected mean-squared error of 1/20, beating deterministic rounding and truncated subtractive dithering.  Using some additional arguments we can handle more shared random bits;  at 8 bits we improve the worst-case expected squared error to about 0.04599, which is quite close to our lower bound of about 0.0459, and this is better than anything we could come up with analytically.  The optimal solution is still not known (an open question for future work!).  </p><p>Overall there are many variants of the rounding problem, and few tight bounds currently.  So even for simple-seeming problems like rounding, there are still interesting things to do.  </p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01614.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-945" src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01614.jpg?w=768"/></a></figure>



<p>The other day I couldn’t remember Fibonacci’s original motivation/presentation of the sequence now famously named after him.  This had to be corrected immediately, because of the picture above and my <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/papers/amigaMagazine.pdf">first publication</a> (1994) which includes a simple algorithm to decompress sounds.  The compression algorithm works by storing rather than the sound data — think of it as the key — the difference between consecutive keys.  The saving comes from not allowing every possible difference, but only those in… the Fibonacci sequence.  Why those differences are the right ones is part of the mystique which makes studying the sequence fun.  For further technical but not mystical details see the paper; an implementation of the decompressor is given in the Motorola 68000 assembly code.</p>



<p>This is me on my way to Fibonacci from Rome, some years ago:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01563-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="wp-image-947" src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01563-1.jpg?w=1024"/></a></figure>



<p>I actually find some presentations of the sequence a little hard to grasp, so I came up with a trivially different rendering which now will make it impossible for me to forget:</p>



<p>There are two types of trees: Young and old.  You start with one young tree. In one period, a young tree produces another young tree and becomes old, and an old tree produces a young tree and dies. How many young trees are there after t periods?</p>



<p/>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Period</td><td>Young trees</td><td>Old trees</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I also couldn’t exactly remember the spiral you can make with these numbers.  But you can tile the plane with squares whose sides come from the sequence, if you arrange them in a spiral.</p></div>

    <title>Squaring the circle is mentioned in a Gilbert and Sullivan comic Opera.</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The problem of <i>squaring the circle</i>: Given a circle, construct (with straightedge and compass) a square with the same area. While browsing the web for more information on this problem (for the blog entry on problems that might be similar to P vs NP: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/is-math-ready-for-pnp-is-alexandra.html">here</a>)  I came across the following:</p><p>In the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera <i>Princess Ida</i>, in the song <i>Gently, Gently</i>  is the line:</p><p>                                <i>    ... and the circle they will square it one fine day.</i></p><p>(To hear the song see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2hEcDmeIY">here</a>. The line is towards the end.) </p><p>They lyrics are <a href="https://www.gsarchive.net/princess_ida/webop/pi_12.html">here</a>. That website begins  <i>gsarchive.ne</i>t which made me wonder<i> Did I at one time set</i> u<i>p a website of math refs in Gilbert and Sullivan plays (gsarch is very close to gasarch) ? </i>which IS the kind of thing I would do. The answer is no: <i> gsarch</i> stands for <i>Gilbert and Sullivan archive.</i> They could have called it <i>gasarch </i>if they used the <i>and </i>in <i>Gilbert and Sullivan</i> but abbreviated <i>archive </i>as arch. Then I would have been far more confused. </p><p>Moving on...</p><p>In 1884<i> Princess Ida</i> opened in 1884. For more on this comic opera see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Ida">here</a>.</p><p>In 1882 pi was proven  transcendental and hence one cannot square the circle. For more on pi being transcendental see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">here</a>.</p><p>Kolmogorov Random Thoughts on all of this</p><p>0) The song is sung my three men who are making fun of the notion of a women's college. The song is about all the things the women are trying to do that are absurd such as squaring the circle. They also mention perpetual motion machines. </p><p>1) Did G and S know that the squaring the circle had been proven impossible, or just that it was thought to be impossible, or just that it was thought to be hard?</p><p>2) Was it known that perpetual motion machines were impossible? Or just very hard? </p><p>3) G and S used Mathematics in at least one other song: <i> I am the very model of a modern major general, </i>from<i> The Pirates of Penzance  </i>has the lines:</p><p><br/></p><p>                                       <i>I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical</i></p><p><i>                                       I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,</i></p><p><i>                                       About binomial theorems I'm teeming with the a lot o' news---</i></p><p><i>                                       With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse</i></p><p><br/></p><p>and later </p><p><i>                                        I'm very good at integral and differential calculus</i></p><p>See <a href="https://naic.edu/~gibson/poems/gilbert1.html">here</a> for all the lyrics. The website mentioned in the next point has a pointer to a YouTube video of people singing it. </p><p>4) There are many parodies of <i>Modern Major General. </i>The earliest ones I know of is Tom Lehrer's  <i>The Elements. </i>Since making a website of them IS the kind of thing I would do,  while writing this post I did it (Are we compelled to do things that fit our image of ourselves? Yup.) The website is <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/FUN//modmajgen.html">here</a>. It has 36 parodies (as of Oct 17, 2021 when I wrote this blog--- it may have more if you read this later.) That may seem like a lot, but it pales in comparison  to the most satirized song of all time: <i>The 12 days of Christmas </i>which I did an ugly lyrics-only website for back before html had nice tools, see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/12days.html">here</a>. It has 143 songs on it but I am sure there are many more. (Note to self: redo that website when you have time. Maybe when I retire.) </p><p>4) I suspect that G and S knew more math, or perhaps knew of more math,  than Broadway composers know now. I suspect this is a more general trend: people are more specialized now. Having said that, I need to mention the off-Broadway musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Tango">Fermat's last Tango</a> which I liked more than Lance (see his post on it <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/02/fermats-last-tango.html">here</a>). </p><p>5) How much math would you need to know in order to insert some into your play or movie? With Wikipedia and other web sources you could find out some things, but you would have to have some idea what you are looking for. And perhaps you would need some math background in order to even want to insert some math into your work in the first place. </p><p>6)  Here's hoping someone will make a musical about William Rowan Hamilton using this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZXHoWwBcDc">here</a> as a starting point. I blogged rather optimistically about that possibility <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/04/william-rowan-hamilton-musical.html#comment-form">here</a>.</p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>New computational geometry journal</title>
    <summary>Over the past year or so I’ve been working with Marc van Kreveld and Wolfgang Mulzer to set up a new diamond open access computational geometry journal, Computing in Geometry and Topology, sponsored by the Society for Computational Geometry, the organization set up to run the annual Symposium on Computational Geometry. It is the second such journal to be established, after the Journal of Computational Geometry. This week the new journal went live and it is now available for submissions. Below is the official announcement we sent out to several mailing lists:</summary>

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>As of this week, the new diamond open access journal</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em></p>

<p>is welcoming submissions. The website of the journal is <a href="https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt">https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt</a></p>

<p>Here you can also find the editorial board, the submission guidelines, the scope, and a style file.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the journal, please send them to info@cgt-journal.org</p>

<p>Best regards,
David Eppstein, Marc van Kreveld, and Wolfgang Mulzer</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Purpose and scope</strong></p>

<p><em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em> aims to support the broader computational geometry and topology community by being a peer-reviewed scientific journal that provides diamond open access. <em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em> is sponsored by the Society for Computational Geometry.</p>

<p>With the broader computational geometry and topology community, we include researchers in discrete and combinatorial geometry, and any application area of computational geometry and topology. We also include algorithm engineering for geometric computations.</p>

<p>The journal publishes two types of papers. Firstly, the journal publishes original research of sufficient depth and interest. Secondly, the journal publishes high-quality survey papers. Every paper has been thoroughly reviewed by experts in the area.</p>

<p>To emphasize the breadth of the interpretation of computational geometry and topology, the editorial board has different sections that represent the algorithmic and mathematical aspects, the applied aspects, and the engineering aspects.</p>
