<p><strong>Private High-Dimensional Hypothesis Testing</strong> by  Shyam Narayanan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01537">arXiv</a>) This paper continues the novel study of distribution testing under the constraints brought forth by differential privacy extending the work of Canonne-Kamath-McMillan-Ullman-Zakynthinou (henceforth CKMUZ, covered in our <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2019/06/news-for-may-2019/">May 2019 post</a>). In particular, the paper presents algorithms with optimal sample complexity for private identity testing of \(d\)-dimensional Gaussians. In more detail, the paper shows that can be done with a mere \(\widetilde{O}\left(  \frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} + \frac{  d^{1/3} }{ \alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon} \right)\). Here \(\alpha\) is the proximity parameter and \(\varepsilon\) is the privacy parameter. Combined with a previous result of Acharya-Sun-Zhang, the paper proves that private identity testing of \(d\)-dimensional Gaussians is doable with a sample complexity smaller than that of private identity testing of discrete distributions over a domain of size \(d\) thereby refuting a conjecture of CKMUZ.</p>

<p><strong>Differentially Private All-Pairs Shortest Path Distances: Improved Algorithms and Lower Bounds</strong> by Badih Ghazi, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi and Jelani Nelson (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16476">arXiv</a>) Adam Sealfon considered the classic All Pairs Shortest Path Problem (the APSP problem) with privacy considerations in 2016. In the \((\varepsilon, \delta)\)-DP framework, Sealfon presented an algorithm which on input an edge-weighted graph \(G=(V,E,w)\) adds Laplace noise to all edge weights and computes the shortest paths on this noisy graph. The output of the algorithm satisfies that the estimated distance between every pair is within an additive \(\pm O(n \log n/\varepsilon)\) of the actual distance (the absolute value of this parameter is called the <em>accuracy of the algorithm</em>). Moreover, this error is tight up to a logarithmic factor if the algorithm is required to <em>release</em> the shortest paths. The current paper shows you can privately release all the pairwise distances while suffering only a sublinear accuracy if you additionally release the edge weights (in place of releasing the shortest paths). In particular, this paper presents an \(\varepsilon\)-DP algorithm with sublinear \(\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})\) accuracy.</p></div>

    <title>Masks</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Illinois Tech removed the last of their mandatory masking restrictions yesterday. Chicago had zero Covid deaths. Yet I still get messages like this in my twitter feed.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I don't care who you are. If I see you without a mask indoors when infections are rampant and there are many still at risk, I will see you as ignorant of science, narcissistic, and uncaring of the vulnerable around you. I will truly see you unmasked for what you are.</p>— Bill Comeau 🇨🇦🇺🇦 (@Billius27) <a href="https://twitter.com/Billius27/status/1510714029072912390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p/><p>The science is unequivocal for vaccines, which do a good job preventing infection and a strong job saving lives. I just got my second booster on Sunday.</p><p>Masks give you some protection but nothing like the vaccines. It's impossible to completely remove the risk of Covid so people need to make their own choices and tradeoffs. If you are vaccinated your chance of serious illness is tiny, whether or not your wear a mask. And mask wearing is not cost-free.</p><p>I just don't like wearing masks. Wearing a mask bends my ears and is mildly painful. People can't always understand me when I talk through a mask, and they can't read my facial expressions. People and computers don't recognize me in a mask. Masks fog up my glasses. I can't exercise with a mask, it gets wet with sweat and hard to breath. You can't eat or drink wearing a mask.</p><p>Now everyone has their own tolerance and I respect that. I'll wear a mask if someone asks nicely or if it is required, like on public transit and many theaters. If I have a meeting with someone wearing a mask, I'll ask if they would like me to put mine on. In most cases they remove theirs.</p><p>On the other hand, the Chicago Symphony concert I planned to attend tonight was cancelled because the conductor, Riccardo Muti, <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/4/4/23010828/riccardo-muti-tests-positive-for-covid-chicago-symphony-orchestra-concert-canceled">tested positive for Covid</a> (with minor symptoms). For my own selfish reasons, I wish he had worn a mask.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d637be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+1/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fe9_J_DxUKtnWan4c8MigVZf8vBM%3D%2F0x0%3A4000x2668%2F4000x2668%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282000x1334%3A2001x1335%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F19129683%2FCSO190509_160f_Riccardo_Muti_and_Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra_May_2019.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d637be8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2667+0+1/resize/840x560!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fe9_J_DxUKtnWan4c8MigVZf8vBM%3D%2F0x0%3A4000x2668%2F4000x2668%2Ffilters%3Afocal%282000x1334%3A2001x1335%29%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F19129683%2FCSO190509_160f_Riccardo_Muti_and_Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra_May_2019.jpg" width="320"/></a></div><br/><p><br/></p></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After my <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2021/07/28/chess-com-55-1000/">previous post, </a>a reader (who amazingly has a nearly identical playing routine) pointed me to it.  It’s great!  Much better than chess.com.</p>



<p>“<em>No ads, no subscriptions; but open-source and passion.</em>“</p>



<p>“<em>Are some features reserved to Patrons? No, because Lichess is entirely free, forever, and for everyone. That’s a promise.</em>“</p>



<p>It doesn’t get better than that, in this world; and that’s why I love computers and the community surrounding them.</p>



<p>Another good news is that I got tired of 5 | 5!  The games are just too slow, and my chess isn’t even worth this much of my time.  I am now playing 3 | 2.  It’s fun the adrenaline kick I get with every match.  Also I got much stricter with my routine, and I don’t lose more than once a day.</p>



<p>Here’s my <a href="https://lichess.org/@/EAmaiLeNuvole">profile</a>.  It’s an anagram of my unpronounceable name which can be loosely translated as <em>…and I loved the clouds.</em></p>



<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Excessive activity and blunders merely reflect my generous sharing of credentials.</p>



<p>And then I thought, why don’t we automatically analyze existing games to find interesting situations, and present them to the user as a puzzle?  Naturally, the beauty — and dismay — of living in the AI (after-internet) era is that… <a href="https://chesstempo.com/chess-tactics/">it’s already done</a>.</p>



<p>OK, time for my daily fix.</p></div>

    <title>An Optimal Algorithm for Certifying Monotone Functions</title>

certificate complexity $C(f)$ and an input $x^{\star}$, we design an algorithm
that outputs a size-$C(f)$ subset of $x^{\star}$ certifying the value of
$f(x^{\star})$. Our algorithm makes $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries to $f$,
which matches the information-theoretic lower bound for this problem and
resolves the concrete open question posed in the STOC '22 paper of Blanc, Koch,
Lange, and Tan [BKLT22].
</p>
<p>We extend this result to an algorithm that finds a size-$2C(f)$ certificate
for a real-valued monotone function with $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries. We
also complement our algorithms with a hardness result, in which we show that
finding the shortest possible certificate in $x^{\star}$ may require
$\Omega\left(\binom{n}{C(f)}\right)$ queries in the worst case.

techniques from geometric and algebraic topology, category theory, and
combinatorics in order to study the "shape" of such complex high-dimensional
data. Research in this area has grown significantly over the last several years
bringing a deeply rooted theory to bear on practical applications in areas such
as genomics, natural language processing, medicine, cybersecurity, energy, and
climate change. Within some of these areas, TDA has also been used to augment
AI and ML techniques.
</p>
<p>We believe there is further utility to be gained in this space that can be
facilitated by a workshop bringing together experts (both theorists and
practitioners) and non-experts. Currently there is an active community of pure
mathematicians with research interests in developing and exploring the
theoretical and computational aspects of TDA. Applied mathematicians and other
practitioners are also present in community but do not represent a majority.
This speaks to the primary aim of this workshop which is to grow a wider
community of interest in TDA. By fostering meaningful exchanges between these
groups, from across the government, academia, and industry, we hope to create
new synergies that can only come through building a mutual comprehensive
awareness of the problem and solution spaces.

tessellations form an infinite sequence of convex face-to-face tilings of the

infinite sequences of minimum and maximum angles are both monotonic in $k$. As
an example, a stationary Poisson point process in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is locally
finite, coarsely dense, and generic with probability one. For such a set, the
distribution of angles in the Voronoi tessellations, Delaunay mosaics, and
Brillouin tessellations are independent of the order and can be derived from
the formula for angles in order-$1$ Delaunay mosaics given by Miles in 1970.

    <title>Combinatorial refinement on circulant graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1649116800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Laurence Kluge <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01054">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The combinatorial refinement techniques have proven to be an efficient
approach to isomorphism testing for particular classes of graphs. If the number
of refinement rounds is small, this puts the corresponding isomorphism problem
in a low-complexity class. We investigate the round complexity of the
2-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on circulant graphs, i.e. on Cayley
graphs of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$, and prove that the number of rounds
until stabilization is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(d(n)\log n)$, where $d(n)$ is
the number of divisors of $n$. As a particular consequence, isomorphism can be
tested in NC for connected circulant graphs of order $p^\ell$ with $p$ an odd
prime, $\ell&gt;3$ and vertex degree $\Delta$ smaller than $p$.
</p>
<p>We also show that the color refinement method (also known as the
1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm) computes a canonical labeling for
every non-trivial circulant graph with a prime number of vertices after
individualization of two appropriately chosen vertices. Thus, the canonical
labeling problem for this class of graphs has at most the same complexity as
color refinement, which results in a time bound of $\mathcal{O}(\Delta n\log
n)$. Moreover, this provides a first example where a sophisticated approach to
isomorphism testing put forward by Tinhofer has a real practical meaning.

in many application fields, including information visualisation, biological
network visualisation, sensor networks, routing algorithms, scheduling, and
graph drawing. Our survey provides a comprehensive summary of developments and
a full roadmap for state-of-the-art force-directed algorithms in schematic
drawings and placement. We classified the model of force-directed algorithms
into classical and hybrid. The classical force-directed algorithms are further
classified as follows: (a) accumulated force models, (b) energy function
minimisation models and (c) combinatorial optimisation models. The hybrid
force-directed algorithms are classified as follows: (a) parallel and hardware
accelerated models, (b) multilevel force-directed models and (c)
multidimensional scaling force-directed algorithms. Five categories of
application domains in which force-directed algorithms have been adopted for
schematic drawings and placement are also summarised: (a) aesthetic drawings
for general networks, (b) component placement and scheduling in high-level
synthesis of very-large-scale integration circuits design, (c) information
visualisation, (d) biological network visualisation and (e) node placement and
localisation for sensor networks.

than one, whose query distribution has the support $\mathcal S = \{(1,0,0),
(0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$ of hamming weight one vectors, the value of the $n$-fold
parallel repetition $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ decays polynomially fast to zero;
that is, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the

</p>
<p>Following the recent work of Girish, Holmgren, Mittal, Raz and Zhan (STOC
2022), our result is the missing piece that implies a similar bound for a much
more general class of multiplayer games: For $\textbf{every}$ 3-player game
$\mathcal G$ over $\textit{binary questions}$ and $\textit{arbitrary answer

such that the value of the game $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
</p>

use of the Level-$k$ inequalities from Boolean Fourier Analysis, which, to the
best of our knowledge, have not been explored in this context prior to our
work.

    <title>Various proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Markov Chains</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1649116800</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Biswas:Somenath.html">Somenath Biswas</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00784">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>This paper is a survey of various proofs of the so called {\em fundamental
theorem of Markov chains}: every ergodic Markov chain has a unique positive
stationary distribution and the chain attains this distribution in the limit
independent of the initial distribution the chain started with. As Markov
chains are stochastic processes, it is natural to use probability based
arguments for proofs. At the same time, the dynamics of a Markov chain is
completely captured by its initial distribution, which is a vector, and its
transition probability matrix. Therefore, arguments based on matrix analysis
and linear algebra can also be used. The proofs discussed below use one or the
other of these two types of arguments, except in one case where the argument is
graph theoretic. Appropriate credits to the various proofs are given in the
main text.
</p>
<p>Our first proof is entirely elementary, and yet the proof is also quite
simple. The proof also suggests a mixing time bound, which we prove, but this
bound in many cases will not be the best bound. One approach in proving the
fundamental theorem breaks the proof in two parts: (i) show the existence of a
unique positive stationary distribution for irreducible Markov chains, and (ii)
assuming that an ergodic chain does have a stationary distribution, show that
the chain will converge in the limit to that distribution irrespective of the
initial distribution. For (i), we survey two proofs, one uses probability
arguments, and the other uses graph theoretic arguments. For (ii), first we
give a coupling based proof (coupling is a probability based technique), the
other uses matrix analysis. Finally, we give a proof of the fundamental theorem
using only linear algebra concepts.

from $V$, called burning sequence, in order to burn the whole graph. This is a
discrete-step process, in each step an unburned vertex is selected as an agent
to spread fire to its neighbors by marking it as a burnt node. A node that is
burnt spreads the fire to its neighbors at the next consecutive step. The goal
is to find the burning sequence of minimum length. The \gb{} problem is NP-Hard
for general graphs and even for binary trees. A few approximation results are
known, including a $3$-approximation algorithm for general graphs and a $2$-
approximation algorithm for trees. In this paper, we propose an approximation
algorithm for trees that produces a burning sequence of length at most $\lfloor
1.75b(T) \rfloor + 1$, where $b(T)$ is length of the optimal burning sequence,
also called the burning number of the tree $T$. In other words, we achieve an
approximation factor of $(\lfloor 1.75b(T) \rfloor + 1)/b(T)$.

A graph class $\mathcal C$ is said
delineated if for every hereditary closure $\mathcal D$ of a subclass of
$\mathcal C$, it holds that $\mathcal D$ has bounded twin-width if and only if
$\mathcal D$ is monadically dependent. An effective strengthening of
delineation for a class $\mathcal C$ implies that tractable FO model checking
on $\mathcal C$ is perfectly understood: On hereditary closures $\mathcal D$ of
subclasses of $\mathcal C$, FO model checking is fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT) exactly when $\mathcal D$ has bounded twin-width. Ordered graphs
[BGOdMSTT, STOC '22] and permutation graphs [BKTW, JACM '22] are effectively
delineated, while subcubic graphs are not. On the one hand, we prove that
interval graphs, and even, rooted directed path graphs are delineated. On the
other hand, we show that segment graphs, directed path graphs, and visibility
graphs of simple polygons are not delineated. In an effort to draw the
delineation frontier between interval graphs (that are delineated) and
axis-parallel two-lengthed segment graphs (that are not), we investigate the
twin-width of restricted segment intersection classes. It was known that
(triangle-free) pure axis-parallel unit segment graphs have unbounded
twin-width [BGKTW, SODA '21]. We show that $K_{t,t}$-free segment graphs, and
axis-parallel $H_t$-free unit segment graphs have bounded twin-width, where
$H_t$ is the half-graph or ladder of height $t$. In contrast, axis-parallel
$H_4$-free two-lengthed segment graphs have unbounded twin-width. Our new
results, combined with the known FPT algorithm for FO model checking on graphs
given with $O(1)$-sequences, lead to win-win arguments. For instance, we derive
FPT algorithms for $k$-Ladder on visibility graphs of 1.5D terrains, and
$k$-Independent Set on visibility graphs of simple polygons.

    <title>Double-Hashing Algorithm for Frequency Estimation in Data Streams</title>

Bayan Bruss</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.00650">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Frequency estimation of elements is an important task for summarizing data
streams and machine learning applications. The problem is often addressed by
using streaming algorithms with sublinear space data structures. These
algorithms allow processing of large data while using limited data storage.
Commonly used streaming algorithms, such as count-min sketch, have many
advantages, but do not take into account properties of a data stream for
performance optimization. In the present paper we introduce a novel
double-hashing algorithm that provides flexibility to optimize streaming
algorithms depending on the properties of a given stream. In the double-hashing
approach, first a standard streaming algorithm is employed to obtain an
estimate of the element frequencies. This estimate is derived using a fraction
of the stream and allows identification of the heavy hitters. Next, it uses a
modified hash table where the heavy hitters are mapped into individual buckets
and other stream elements are mapped into the remaining buckets. Finally, the
element frequencies are estimated based on the constructed hash table over the
entire data stream with any streaming algorithm. We demonstrate on both
synthetic data and an internet query log dataset that our approach is capable
of improving frequency estimation due to removing heavy hitters from the
hashing process and, thus, reducing collisions in the hash table. Our approach
avoids employing additional machine learning models to identify heavy hitters
and, thus, reduces algorithm complexity and streamlines implementation.
Moreover, because it is not dependent on specific features of the stream
elements for identifying heavy hitters, it is applicable to a large variety of
streams. In addition, we propose a procedure on how to dynamically adjust the
proposed double-hashing algorithm when frequencies of the elements in a stream
are changing over time.

    <title>TR22-048 |  On the Range Avoidance Problem for Circuits | 

	Hanlin Ren, 

	Rahul Santhanam, 

	Zhikun Wang</title>
    <summary>We consider the range avoidance problem (called Avoid): given the description of a circuit $C:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^\ell$ (where $\ell &gt; n$), find a string $y\in\{0, 1\}^\ell$ that is not in the range of $C$. This problem is complete for the class APEPP that corresponds to explicit constructions of objects whose existence follows from the probabilistic method (Korten, FOCS 2021). 
    
Motivated by applications in explicit constructions and complexity theory, we initiate the study of the range avoidance problem for weak circuit classes, and obtain the following results:
    
    
1. Generalising Williams's connections between circuit-analysis algorithms and circuit lower bounds (J. ACM 2014), we present a framework for solving C-Avoid in $FP^{NP}$ using circuit-analysis data structures for C, for "typical" multi-output circuit classes C. As an application, we present a non-trivial $FP^{NP}$ range avoidance algorithm for De Morgan formulas.
An important technical ingredient is a construction of rectangular PCPs of proximity, building on the rectangular PCPs by Bhangale, Harsha, Paradise, and Tal (FOCS 2020).
        
2. Using the above framework, we show that circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$ are equivalent to circuit-analysis algorithms with $E^{NP}$ preprocessing. This is the first equivalence result regarding circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$. Our equivalences have the additional advantages that they work in both infinitely-often and almost-everywhere settings, and that they also hold for larger (e.g., subexponential) size bounds.

3. Complementing the above results, we show that in some settings, solving C-Avoid would imply breakthrough lower bounds, even for very weak circuit classes C. In particular, an algorithm for $AC^0$-Avoid with polynomial stretch (i.e., $\ell = poly(n)$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$, and an algorithm for $NC^0_4$-Avoid with very small stretch (i.e., $\ell = n + n^{o(1)}$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$ and branching programs.

4. We show that Avoid is in FNP if and only if there is a propositional proof system that breaks every non-uniform proof complexity generator. This result connects the study of range avoidance with fundamental questions in proof complexity.</summary>

    <title>TR22-047 |  Linear Hashing with $\ell_\infty$ guarantees and two-sided Kakeya bounds | 

	Manik Dhar, 

	Zeev Dvir</title>
    <summary>We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the $\ell_\infty$ sense.  More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^n$ and a randomly chosen linear map $L :  \mathbb{F}_q^n \to  \mathbb{F}_q^t$ with $q^t$ taken to be sufficiently smaller than $|S|$. Let $U_S$ denote a random variable distributed uniformly on $S$. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of $L$, the random variable  $L(U_S)$ is close to uniform in the $\ell_\infty$ norm.  In other words, every element in the range $\mathbb{F}_q^t$ has about the same number of elements in $S$ mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or $\ell_1$, distance  (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions  [ADMPT99].  Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.</summary>

    <title>TR22-046 |  Automating OBDD proofs is NP-hard | 

	Artur Riazanov, 

	Dmitry Itsykson</title>
    <summary>We prove that the proof system OBDD(and, weakening) is not automatable unless P = NP. The proof is based upon the celebrated result of Atserias and Muller [FOCS 2019] about the hardness of automatability for resolution. The heart of the proof is lifting with a multi-output indexing gadget from resolution block-width to dag-like multiparty number-in-hand communication protocol size with $o(n)$ parties, where $n$ is the number of variables in the non-lifted formula. A similar lifting theorem for protocols with $n + 1$ participants was proved by Göös et. el. [STOC 2020] to establish the hardness of automatability result for Cutting Planes.</summary>

    <title>TR22-045 |  Relaxed Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes: Beyond Tensoring | 

	Gil Cohen, 

	Tal Yankovitz</title>
    <summary>In their highly influential paper, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004) introduced the notion of a relaxed locally decodable code (RLDC). Similarly to a locally decodable code (Katz-Trevisan; STOC 2000), the former admits access to any desired message symbol with only a few queries to a possibly corrupted codeword. An RLDC, however, is allowed to abort when identifying corruption. The natural analog to locally correctable codes, dubbed relaxed locally correctable codes (RLCC), was introduced by Gur, Ramnarayan and Rothblum (ITCS 2018) who constructed asymptotically-good length-$n$ RLCC and RLDC with $(\log{n})^{O(\log\log{n})}$ queries.

In this work we construct asymptotically-good RLDC and RLCC with an improved query complexity of $(\log{n})^{O(\log\log\log{n})}$. To achieve this, we devise a mechanism--an alternative to the tensor product--that squares the length of a given code. Compared to the tensor product that was used by Gur et al. and by many other constructions, our mechanism is significantly more efficient in terms of rate deterioration, allowing us to obtain our improved construction.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p class="justify-text">In <a href="https://francisbach.com/von-neumann-entropy/">last month blog post</a>, I presented the von Neumann entropy. It is defined as a spectral function on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices, and leads to a Bregman divergence called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_relative_entropy">von Neumann relative entropy</a> (or matrix Kullback Leibler divergence), with interesting convexity properties and applications in optimization (mirror descent, or smoothing) and probability (concentration inequalities for matrices). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This month, I will show how the relative entropy relates to usual notions of information theory when applied to specific covariance matrices or covariance operators, with potential applications to all areas where entropy plays a role, and with a simple use of quantum information theory. This post is based on a recent preprint: see all details in [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>], as well as the conclusion section below for several avenues for future work.</p>



<h2>Von Neumann relative entropy between covariance matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider some set \(\mathcal{X}\), with a probability distribution \(p\). We assume given a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\), from \(\mathcal{X}\) to a \(d\)-dimensional vector space. This naturally defines a (non-centered) <em>covariance matri</em>x $$ \Sigma_{p} = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \varphi(x) \varphi(x)^\top dp(x), $$ which is a \(d \times d\) symmetric PSD matrix. We will assume throughout this post that the set \(\mathcal{X}\) is compact and that the Euclidean norm of \(\varphi\) is bounded on \(\mathcal{X}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given two distributions \(p\) and \(q\), and their associated covariance matrices \(\Sigma_p\) and \(\Sigma_q\), we can compute their von Neumann relative entropy as: $$ D( \Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) = {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma_p ( \log \Sigma_p \, – \log \Sigma_q) \big] – {\rm tr}\big[  \Sigma_p \big] +  {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma_q \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We immediately get that \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) is always non-negative, and zero if and only if \(\Sigma_p = \Sigma_q\). This property, that makes it a potentially interesting measure of dissimilarity, is shared among all Bregman divergences on covariance matrices, and has been extensively used in data science (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/kulis09a/kulis09a.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/060649021">3</a>]). What makes the von Neumann entropy special?</p>



<p class="justify-text">One important property is that it is jointly convex in \(p\) and \(q\), but this is also shared by other divergences [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>, Appendix A.4]. What really makes the von Neumann entropy special is its explicit link with with information theory.</p>



<h2>Finite sets with orthonormal embeddings</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let’s start with the simplest situation. If \(\mathcal{X}\) is finite with \(d\) elements, and we have an orthonormal embedding, that is, for all \(x,y \in \mathcal{X}\), \(\varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y) = 1_{x = y}\), then, after a transformation by a rotation matrix, we can assume that each \(\varphi(x)\) is one element of the canonical basis, and all covariance matrices are diagonal (without the rotation, we would have that all covariance matrices are jointly diagonalizable), and for probability distributions \(p\) and \(q\), using the same notation for their probability mass functions, we have: $$D( \Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)  = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = D(p \|q ), $$ which is exactly the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leilbler</a> (KL) divergence between the two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Can we push this further beyond finite sets and finite-dimensional feature maps, and obtain a link with classical notions from information theory?</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first remark is the invariance by rotation within the feature space (that is, if we replace \(\varphi(x)\) by \(R \varphi(x)\), where \(R\) is an \(d \times d\) orthogonal matrix, the von Neumann entropy does not change), so that it depends only on the dot-product \(k(x,y) = \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\), which is the traditional kernel function. As will see, this opens us the entire area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel machines</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A second remark is that we can go infinite-dimensional, and replace \(\mathbb{R}^d\) by any Hilbert space. This complicates a bit the exposition, and I refer to [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for more formal definitions. In this post, I will shamelessly go infinite-dimensional by using matrices with infinite dimensions when needed.</p>



<h2>Lower-bound on Shannon relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We first upper-bound \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) by joint convexity of the von Neumann relative entropy (see <a href="https://francisbach.com/von-neumann-entropy/">last post</a>) and Jensen’s inequality: $$ D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) =  D \Big( \int_{\mathcal{X}}\varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top dp(x) \Big\| \int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top dp(x) \Big)$$ $$\ \ \,  \leqslant  \int_{\mathcal{X}} D \Big( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top \Big\| \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \Big) dp(x).$$ The two matrices  \( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top\) and \(\frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \) are proportional to each other, and have \(\varphi(x)\) as the only eigenvector with a potentially non zero eigenvalue, so that we have $$ D \Big( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top \Big\| \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \Big) =  \| \varphi(x) \|^2  \bigg[ \log \Big( \frac{dp}{dq}(x) \Big)  \ – 1 +  \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \bigg].$$ Integrating with respect to \(p\) leads to cancellations: $$  D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \leqslant \int_{\mathcal{X}}\| \varphi(x) \|^2  \log \Big( \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \Big) dp(x) \tag{1}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume a unit norm bound on all features, that is, \(\| \varphi(x)\| \leqslant 1\) for all \(x \in \mathcal{X}\), we get  $$  D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \leqslant  \int_{\mathcal{X}} \log \Big( \frac{ dp}{dq}(x) \Big) dp(x) = D(p\|q), $$ and thus we have found a lower bound on the regular Shannon relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From relative entropy to entropy. </strong>We can also define a new notion of entropy by considering the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution on \(\mathcal{X}\), which we denote \(\tau\). That is, defining \(\Sigma\) the covariance matrix for the uniform distribution, we consider $$ H(\Sigma_p) = \ – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma),$$ which is thus greater than (with a unit norm bound on all features) $$- \int_{\mathcal{X}}   \log \big( \frac{d p}{d \tau}(x)\big) dp(x),$$ which is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_entropy">differential entropy</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now look at a few simple examples, and present further properties later (such as a well-defined bound in the other direction). We consider only one-dimensional examples, but the theory extends to all dimensions and all kernels. In particular, finite large sets such as \(\{-1,1\}^d\) can be considered (see [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>]).</p>



<h2>Polynomials and moments</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(\mathcal{X} = [-1,1]\) and \(\varphi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{r+1}\) spanning all degree \(r\) polynomials, with \(k(x,y) = \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\). For these examples, \(\Sigma_p\) is composed of all classical moments of order up to \(2r\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Regular polynomial kernel. </strong>Following traditional kernel methods, we can first consider \(\displaystyle k(x,y) = \frac{1}{2^r} ( 1 + xy)^r\), which corresponds to $$\varphi(x)_j =  \frac{1}{2^{r/2}} {{ r \choose j}\!\!}^{1/2} x^j,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,r\}\). We also have \(\sup_{ x\in \mathcal{X} } k(x,x) = 1\), which allows for the Shannon relative entropy upper-bound. Let us consider two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) on \([-1,1]\), and understand if letting \(r\) go to infinity leads to a good estimation of the Shannon relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, we consider the distribution \(p\) with density \(\frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2}\) (this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a>  affinely rescaled to \([-1,1]\) instead of \([0,1]\)), plotted below, and \(q\) the uniform distribution, with density \(1/2\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6964" height="181" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/density.png" width="290"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">All moments are available in closed form (see end of post), and the Shannon relative entropy is equal to \(D(p\|q) = \int_{-1}^1 \! \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2} \log \frac{4}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2} dx \approx 0.0484\). We can then compute for various values of \(r\), \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), which is plotted below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6937" height="269" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/reg_pol_kernel-2.png" width="289"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We should hope that the approximation improves as we use more monomials, but this is not the case. As common in kernel methods, the standard polynomial kernel does not have a good behavior. This is partly due to the fact that \(k(x,x) = \big( \frac{1+x^2}{2} \big)^r\) is far from uniform on \([-1,1]\).</p>



<p>Let’s now consider a better polynomial kernel.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Christofell-Darboux kernels. </strong>Other polynomial bases could be used as well beyond \(1, X, \dots, X^r\), in particular any basis of polynomials with increasing degrees \(P_0, \dots, P_r\) can be used, in particular polynomials that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal</a> with respect to a probability distribution on \([-1,1]\), with $$ \varphi(x)_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_r}} P_j(x) \mbox{ and } k(x,y) = \frac{1}{\alpha_r} \sum_{j=0}^r P_j(x) P_j(y),$$ where \(\alpha_r\) is here to ensure that \(k(x,x) \leqslant 1\) on \([-1,1]\). The kernel function \(k(x,y)\) has then itself a simple expression through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel%E2%80%93Darboux_formula">Christoffel–Darboux formula</a>, as $$ k(x,y) \propto   \frac{P_r(x)P_{r+1}(y)-P_r(y)P_{r+1}(x)}{x-y},$$ with an explicit proportionality constant. For more details on these kernels and their application to data analysis, see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01845137v3/document">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, for <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev polynomials</a>, which are orthonormal with respect to the probability measure with density \(\big(\pi \sqrt{1-x^2}\big)^{-1}\) on \([-1,1]\), we have \(P_0 = 1\), \(P_1 =  \sqrt{2} X\), and \(P_2 = \sqrt{2}( 2X^2 – 1) \), and more generally, for \(k&gt;0\), \(P_k(\cos \theta) = \sqrt{2}\cos k\theta\). One can then check that for \(x = \cos \theta\) and \(y = \cos \eta\), we have $$k(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} \Big( \frac{ \sin ( 2r+1)( \theta-\eta)/2}{\sin ( \theta-\eta)/2} + \frac{ \sin ( 2r+1)( \theta+\eta)/2}{\sin ( \theta+\eta)/2}  \Big).$$ Moreover, we can check that $$ \sup_{x \in \, [-1,1]} k(x,x) = 2r+1, $$ leading to \(\alpha_r = 2r+1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"> </p>



<p class="justify-text">As shown below, after computing (still in closed form, see end of the post) \(\Sigma_p\) and \(\Sigma_q\), we can plot the relative entropy, and compare it to the true one. This leads to an improved estimation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6936" height="273" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cheb_pol_kernel-2.png" width="293"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This is better, but still not quite there, and we get in fact convergence to exactly one half of the true relative entropy. The motivated reader will check that the limit of \(k(x,x)\) when \(r \) tends to infinity is \(1/2\) for all \(x \in (-1,1)\), and \(1\), for \(x \in \{-1,1\}\) (that is, the upper-bound of \(1\) is valid, but it is almost surely equal to \(1/2\)). This is where we lose the factor of \(1/2\) in Eq. (1) above.</p>



<p class="justify-text">One key overall insight is that the span of the feature space is not the only important aspect in the approximation, and that some rescalings are better than others (more on this below when optimize with respect to the chosen basis). Given that we end up estimating entropies from moments, it would be clearly interesting to compare with other ways of estimating entropies from moments, such as using asymptotic expansions based on Edgeworth expansions [8].</p>



<h2>Fourier series and translation-invariant kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We still consider \(\mathcal{X} = [-1,1]\). For a \(2\)-periodic function \(q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), such that \(q(0) = 1\), with Fourier series \(\hat{q}: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{C}\), we can consider $$k(x,y) = q(x-y) = \sum_{\omega \in \mathcal{Z}} \hat{q}(\omega) e^{i\pi \omega(x-y)}.$$ We can for example take $$q(x) = \frac{\sin ( 2r+1) \pi x/2}{(2r+1)\sin \pi x/2} $$ which corresponds to \(\hat{q}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2r+1} 1_{|\omega| \leqslant r}\), and having $$ \varphi(x)_\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2r+1}} e^{ i\pi \omega x } $$ for \(\omega \in \{-r-1,\dots,r+1\}\) (we consider complex-valued features for simplicity). We refer to this kernel as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_kernel">Dirichlet kernel</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Link with eigenvalues of Toeplitz matrices.</strong> For the specific choice of the Dirichlet kernel, the element of the covariance matrix indexed by \(\omega\) and \(\omega’\) has value \(\int_{-1}^1 e^{i\pi (\omega-\omega’)} dp(x)\), which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_function_(probability_theory)">characteristic function</a> of \(p\) evaluated at \(\pi(\omega-\omega’)\). One consequence is that \(\Sigma_p\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a> with constant values across all diagonals. It is then well-known that as \(m\) goes to infinity, the eigenvalues of \(\Sigma_p\) are tending in distribution to \(p\) (see [<a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~gray/CIT006-journal.pdf">10</a>]), which provides another proof of good estimation of the entropy in this very particular case.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that we could also consider an infinite-dimensional kernel \(q(x) =\Big( 1+ \frac{\sin^2 \pi x/2}{\sinh^2 \sigma}\Big)^{-1}\) which corresponds to \( \hat{q}(\omega) \propto e^{-2\sigma |\omega|}\), where the link with Toeplitz matrices does not apply. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Increasing number of frequencies. </strong>We can then plot the estimation of the same relative entropy as for polynomial kernels, as the number of frequency grows (we can still get the Fourier moments in closed form, see end of post).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6944" height="283" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dirichlet_kernel-1.png" width="305"/></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We now see that as the dimension of the feature space grows, we get a perfect estimation of the relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">This estimation is provably from below, but how far is it? How big \(r\) needs to be? </p>



<h2>Upper-bound trough quantum information theory</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to find a lower-bound \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), we cannot rely on Jensen’s inequality, as it is in the wrong direction (this happens a lot!). But here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information">quantum information theory</a> can come to the rescue. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Using the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) associated to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), we consider the PSD matrices \(D(y)\), indexed by \(y \in \mathcal{X}\), equal to $$D(y) = \Sigma^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \varphi(y)^\top \Sigma^{-1/2},$$ for which we have $$\int_{\mathcal{X}} D(y) d\tau(y) =\Sigma^{-1/2} \Big( \int_{\mathcal{X}}  \varphi(y) \varphi(y)^\top d\tau(y)\Big)\Sigma^{-1/2} =   I. $$ We can now consider, in quantum information theory terms, that each \(D(y)\) corresponds to a measurement that can be applied to a density operator, and that we look at measures obtained from \(p\), as \(\tilde{p}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_p)\), and from \(q\) as \(\tilde{q}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_q)\). This is a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_operation">quantum operation</a> because the matrices \(D(y)\) are PSD and sum to identity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The monotonicity of the von Neumann entropy with respect to quantum operations [9] applies, and we immediately get $$D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \geqslant \int_{\mathcal{X}} \tilde{p}(y) \log \frac{ \tilde{p}(y)}{\tilde{q}(y)} d\tau(y).$$ The lower-bound can be seen as the Shannon relative entropy \(D( \tilde{p} \| \tilde{q} )\) between the distributions with density \(\tilde{p}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) with respect to \(\tau\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">These densities have direct relationships with \(p\) and \(q\). Indeed,  we have $$\tilde{p}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_p) = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \big( \varphi(x)^\top \Sigma^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \big)^2 dp(x).$$ Denoting $$h(x,y) = \big( \varphi(x)^\top \Sigma_\tau^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \big)^2,$$ we have \(\int_{\mathcal{X}} h(x,y) d\tau(x) = \| \varphi(y)\|^2\) for all \(y \in \mathcal{X}\), and thus, when the features have unit norms, we can consider \(h\) as a smoothing kernel, and thus \(\tilde{p}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) as smoothed versions of \(p\) and \(q\). Thus, overall we have: $$D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q}) \leqslant D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)  \leqslant D(p\|q),$$ and we have sandwitched the kernel relative entropy by Shannon relative entropies.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then characterize the error made in estimating the relative entropy by measuring how the smoothing kernel \(h(x,y)\) differs from a Dirac. In  [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>, Section 4.2], I show how, for metric spaces, the difference between \(D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q})\) and \(D({p} \|{q}) \), and thus between \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) and \(D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q})\), is upperbounded by an explicit function of \(p\) and \(q\), times $$ \sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} h(x,y) d(x,y)^2 d\tau(y),$$ which is indeed small when \(h(x,y)\) is closed to a Dirac.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the Dirichlet kernel presented above, we can show that $$h(x,y) = \frac{1}{4r+2} \bigg( \frac{\sin ( 2r+1) \pi (x-y)/2}{\sin \pi (x-y)/2}\bigg)^2,$$ and that the quantity above characterizing convergence scales as \(1 / (2r+1)\), thus providing an explicit convergence rate. As an illustration, we plot the smoothing kernel at \(y=0\), that is, \(h(x,0)\) in regular scale (left) and log-scale (right), for the Dirichlet kernel above (for which we have unit norm features) for various values of \(r\). We see how it converges to a Dirac as \(r\) grows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-6999" height="223" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/smoothh_both-2.gif" width="503"/></figure></div>



<h2>Estimation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Above, we have relied on finite-dimensional feature maps and explicit expectations under \(p\) and \(q\). This is clearly not scalable to generic situations and potentially infinite-dimensional feature spaces. But we can rely here on 30 years of progress in kernel methods.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For simplicity here, we will only estimate the von Neumann entropy \({\rm tr}\big[ \Sigma_p \log \Sigma_p \big]\) from \(n\) independent and identically distributed samples. The natural estimator is \({\rm tr}\big[ \hat{\Sigma}_p \log \hat{\Sigma} _p \big]\), where \(\hat{\Sigma}_p\) and \(\hat{\Sigma}_q\) are empirical covariance matrices (the averages of \(\varphi(x_i) \varphi(x_i)^\top\) over all data points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute it efficiently, we can use the usual kernel trick, exactly as used within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_principal_component_analysis">kernel principal component analysis</a>, and if \(K\) is the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix associated with the \(n\) data points, then the eigenvalues of \(\frac{1}{n} K\) and \(\hat{\Sigma}_p\) are the same, and thus $$  {\rm tr}\big[ \hat{\Sigma}_p \log \hat{\Sigma} _p \big] =  {\rm tr}\big[ \big(\frac{1}{n}K  \big)\log \big( \frac{1}{n} K \big)  \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In terms of statistical analysis, we refer to [1] where it is shown that the difference between the estimate and the true value is of order \(C / \sqrt{n}\), with an explicit constant \(C\), for a wide range of kernels. Surprisingly, there is no need to add any form of regularization.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Entropy estimation. </strong>Together with the approximation result presented above, by letting \(r\) go to infinity for the Dirichlet kernel, we get an estimator of the regular Shannon entropy which is not that bad (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02141">7</a>] for an optimal one).</p>



<h2>Learning representations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above for polynomials, a key question is how to choose a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\). Given that we have a lower-bound on the relative entropy, it is tempting to try to <em>maximize</em> this lower bound, subject to \(\forall x \in \mathcal{X}\), \(\| \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\|^2 \leqslant 1\). The magic is that this is a tractable optimization problem (concave maximization with convex constraints) in the kernel function \((x,y) \mapsto \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\). This is not an obvious result (in fact, I first tried to prove that the von Neumann relative entropy was convex in the kernel, while it is in fact concave). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for the concavity proofs and simple optimization algorithms.</p>



<h2>Duality and log-partition functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given that our kernel notions of relative entropies are lower bounds on the regular notions, by the traditional convex duality results between maximum entropy and log-partition functions (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/DownloadSummary/MAL-001">11</a>]), we should obtain upper-bounds on log-partition functions. This is exactly what we can get, we simply provide the gist here and refer to [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for further details. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Given a probability distribution \(q\) on \(\mathcal{X}\) and a function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\), the log-partition function is defined as $$a(f) = \log \bigg( \int_{\mathcal{X}} e^{f(x)} dq(x)\bigg) \tag{2}.$$ It plays a crucial role in probabilistic and statistical inference, and obtaining upper-bounds is instrumental in deriving approximate inference algorithms [11]. A classical convex duality result shows a link with the Shannon relative entropy, as we can express \(a(f)\) as $$a(f) = \sup_{ p\  {\rm probability} \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x) \ – D( p \| q).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming that all features have unit norm, we have \(D(p \|q) \geqslant D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), and thus $$ a(f) \leqslant \sup_{ p \ {\rm probability} \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x)\  – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q),$$ which is itself smaller than the supremum over all signed measures with unit mass (thus removing the non-negativity constraint). Therefore, $$ a(f) \leqslant \sup_{ p \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x)\  – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \tag{3},$$ which can be made computationally tractable in a number of cases.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I tried to exhibit a new link between kernels and information theory, which mostly relies on the convexity properties of von Neumann entropy and a bit of quantum analysis. Clearly, the practical relevance of this link remains to be established, but it opens tractable information theory tools to all types of data on which positive kernels can be defined (essentially all of them), with many potential avenues for future work.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Multivariate modelling.</strong> Regular entropies and relative entropies are used extensively in data science, such as for variational inference, but also to characterize various forms of statistical dependences between random variable. It turns out that the new kernel notions allow for this as well, connecting with a classical line of work within kernel methods [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bach02a/bach02a.pdf">12</a>, <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/sriperumbudur10a/sriperumbudur10a.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other divergences.</strong> I have focused primarily on the link with Shannon relative entropies, but most of the results extend to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a>. For example, we can get kernel-based lower bounds on the square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellinger_distance">Hellinger distance</a>, or the \(\chi^2\)-divergences.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel sum-of-squares with a probabilistic twist.</strong> As a final note, there is a link between the new notions of kernel entropies with global optimization with <a href="https://francisbach.com/finding-global-minima-with-kernel-approximations/">kernel sum-of-squares</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11978">14</a>]. Indeed, in Eq. (2), if we add a temperature parameter \(\varepsilon\) and define $$a_\varepsilon(f) =\varepsilon  \log \bigg( \int_{\mathcal{X}} e^{f(x) / \varepsilon} dq(x) \bigg), $$ then when \(\varepsilon\) tends to zero, \(a_\varepsilon(f) \) tends to \(\sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\). The lower bound from Eq. (3) then becomes $$\sup_{ p \ {\rm measure}}  \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x) \ – \varepsilon D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q),$$ which exactly tends to the sum-of-squares relaxation for the optimization problem. Given that for global optimization, smoothness can be leveraged to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we can imagine something similar for log-partition functions and entropies.</p>

    <title>TR22-044 |  An Optimal Algorithm for Certifying Monotone Functions | 

	Meghal Gupta, 

	Naren Manoj</title>
    <summary>Given query access to a monotone function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ with certificate complexity $C(f)$ and an input $x^{\star}$, we design an algorithm that outputs a size-$C(f)$ subset of $x^{\star}$ certifying the value of $f(x^{\star})$. Our algorithm makes $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries to $f$, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound for this problem and resolves the concrete open question posed in the STOC '22 paper of Blanc, Koch, Lange, and Tan [BKLT22].

We extend this result to an algorithm that finds a size-$2C(f)$ certificate for a real-valued monotone function with $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries. We also complement our algorithms with a hardness result, in which we show that finding the shortest possible certificate in $x^{\star}$ may require $\Omega\left(\binom{n}{C(f)}\right)$ queries in the worst case.</summary>

    <title>Dissection into rectangles and tensor rank</title>
    <summary>It’s easy to cut a Greek cross into pieces that can be reassembled into a rectangle:</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>It’s easy to cut a Greek cross into pieces that can be reassembled into a rectangle:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Dissection of a Grek cross to a 4x5 rectangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/cross2rect.svg" width="60%"/></p>

<p>Here’s another example. The three yellow rectangles below have dimensions <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(2^{2/3}\times 1\),</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(2^{1/3}\times 2^{1/3}\),</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">and \(1\times 2^{2/3}\).</span> (The order of multiplication matters here!) Put them together, and you get the blue stealth aircraft shape. Can you cut this shape into pieces and reassemble them into a single rectangle?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Union of three irrational rectangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trirect.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>The answer is yes; any polygon can be cut and reassembled into a rectangle, or into any other polygon of the same area. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%E2%80%93Bolyai%E2%80%93Gerwien_theorem">Wallace–Bolyai–Gerwien theorem</a>. But the Greek cross dissection above uses only axis-parallel cuts and translation of the pieces. To get a single rectangle from the stealth shape, you’re going to need a more general class of operations that cut it at odd angles and rotate the pieces. It’s impossible to make a rectangle from this shape using only axis-parallel cuts and translation. And even for the Greek cross, although you can make a rectangle as shown, it’s impossible to make a square using only axis-parallel cuts and translation.</p>

<p>To see why, we need to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_invariant">Dehn invariant</a>. As usually defined, this is a value that can be determined for any three-dimensional polyhedron. It’s called an invariant because it stays unchanged when you cut up the polyhedron into polyhedral parts and reassemble the pieces into something else, allowing odd-angled cuts and rotations. In order for one polyhedron to have a dissection into another, they must both have the same volume and the same Dehn invariant. This can be used to show, for instance, that you cannot dissect a regular tetrahedron into a cube. But as several authors have described, a version of the same method also applies to axis-parallel dissections of orthogonal <span style="white-space: nowrap;">polygons.<sup id="fnref:s"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/04/03/dissection-into-rectangles.html#fn:s" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:b"><a class="footnote" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/04/03/dissection-into-rectangles.html#fn:b" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></span></p>

<p>To evaluate the Dehn invariant of an orthogonal polygon, the first step is to represent the polygon in Cartesian coordinates, and to find a <em>rational basis</em> for its coordinates, a system of numbers such that every coordinate has a unique representation as a linear combination of basis elements with rational-number coefficients. This is just a basis, in the usual meaning of the word from linear algebra, when we interpret the real numbers as being a vector space over the rational numbers. In the example of the stealth shape, we can use the same basis for both the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\)- and</span> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(y\)-coordinates,</span> the set of numbers <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\{1,2^{1/3},2^{2/3}\}\).</span> The choice of basis is arbitrary (as long as it can represent all coordinates, without any redundancy) and will affect the rest of the calculation but not the conclusions we draw from it. If we’re comparing two shapes, we can use a common basis that can represent the coordinates from both; it won’t hurt if some of the basis elements are only used for one of the two shapes. So for instance, if the Greek cross is made out of unit squares, the square we’d like to dissect it into has side length \(\sqrt5\) and we can use the basis \(\{1,\sqrt 5\}\) to compare the cross to the square.</p>

<p>Next, we decompose the given shape into rectangles through its vertices (like the yellow rectangles that we’ve already used to decompose the stealth shape). Express the width and height of each rectangle as a rational combination of basis elements; in our example, each rectangle is just a product of two basis elements, but sometimes more complex combinations might be required. If we multiply the expression for the width of a rectangle by the expression for the height of a rectangle, we get an expression for the area of the whole rectangle as a sum of terms \(a\cdot b_x\cdot b_y\) where \(a\) is a rational number and \(b_x\) and \(b_y\) are <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\)-basis</span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(y\)-basis</span> elements, respectively. Adding these expressions for every rectangle in the decomposition gives a similar expression for the area of the whole shape. Since we’re separating out the terms for each product of basis elements, it’s convenient to write it out as a matrix. For the Greek cross and same-area square, with the basis \(\{1,\sqrt 5\}\) for both <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\) and \(y\),</span> we get the matrices</p>

\[\begin{pmatrix} 5 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \qquad\text{and}\qquad
\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix},\]

<p>respectively. For the stealth shape, with the basis \(\{1,2^{1/3},2^{2/3}\}\) for both <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(x\) and \(y\),</span> we get the matrix</p>

\[\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix}.\]

<p>That’s the Dehn invariant! Because the Greek cross and square have different invariants, they cannot be dissected into each other (for this restricted axis-parallel translation-only form of dissection). But what about the dissection of the stealth shape into a single rectangle? How can we apply this analysis when there are infinitely many possible rectangles to try?</p>

<p>Here it’s convenient to move from the notion of bases and matrices to a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate-free">coordinate-free</a> formulation of the same thing using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_(intrinsic_definition)">abstract tensors</a>. When we’re expressing the area of an \(x\times y\) rectangle as a product of rational linear combinations of basis elements, what we’re really doing is constructing the element \(x\otimes y\) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product">tensor product</a> <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{R}\).</span> Then when we add the expressions arising from the decomposition into rectangles, to form a matrix describing the whole shape, this is just addition of these elements within the tensor product. The subscript \(\mathbb{Q}\) in the tensor notation corresponds to the fact that we’re interpreting real numbers as forming a vector space over the field \(\mathbb{Q}\) of rational numbers. (Some sources use a subscript \(\mathbb{Z}\) but this is not an important difference here.)</p>

<p>One thing we know about matrices is that they have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)">rank</a>, the dimension of the vector space generated by their rows or columns. But tensors also have a notion of rank. The rank of a tensor is the minimum number of terms needed to express it as a sum of products</p>

\[x_1\otimes y_1+x_2\otimes y_2+\cdots,\]

<p>where the \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) can be any elements of the spaces that are being tensored together (they are not required to be basis elements). For tensor products of three or more spaces, the rank is still defined in the same way, but it can get very tricky to calculate. This is a big part about why the time bounds for fast matrix multiplication are still so mysterious: they involve tensors of order three. But for the order-two tensor space \(\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{R}\), we’re saved by linear algebra: the rank of a tensor of order two is just the rank of a matrix representing it, for any basis over the appropriate field <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(here \(\mathbb{Q}\)).</span></p>

<p>Suppose that we could dissect a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">polygon \(P\),</span> using axis-parallel cuts and translations, into a collection of \(k\) rectangles. Then the sum of the tensor expressions for those rectangles would be an expression of the Dehn invariant <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of \(P\),</span> as a sum of \(k\) products. Therefore, the rank of the Dehn invariant of \(P\) would have to be at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">most \(k\).</span> But for our stealth shape, we know the rank: we have expressed its Dehn invariant as a matrix of rank three. Therefore, to dissect it into rectangles, we need at least three rectangles.</p>

<p>Another use of the polyhedral Dehn invariant, besides dissection of one shape into another, involves tiling. Any polyhedron that tiles space must have Dehn invariant zero, and any polyhedron with Dehn invariant zero can be dissected into a different polyhedron that tiles space. For the axis-parallel polygonal Dehn invariant we’re looking at here, things don’t work out quite so neatly. The Greek cross can tile, but has nonzero Dehn invariant. More, any axis-parallel polygon can be cut into multiple rectangles, and these can tile space aperiodically by grouping them into rows of the same type of rectangle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Aperiodic tiling by three irrational rectangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trirect-row-tiling.svg" width="65%"/></p>

<p>So the Dehn invariant cannot be used to prove that such a thing is impossible, because it is always possible. If we could rotate pieces, we could also form these three rectangles into a single-piece axis-parallel hexagon that can tile the plane:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Periodic tiling by a hexagon formed from three irrational rectangles" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trirect-flip-tiling.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>But this is not possible without rotation. Every periodic tiling of the plane has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_domain">fundamental region</a> in the shape of an axis-parallel hexagon, like the hexagons in this periodic tiling.  If one or more copies of a polygon could be cut up by axis-parallel cuts and reassembled by translations to form a single polygon that can tile the plane periodically, it would also be possible to dissect copies of the polygon (possibly a larger number of copies of it) into an axis-parallel hexagon. But these hexagons have a Dehn invariant with rank at most two (they can be cut into two rectangles), while any number of copies of our stealth shape combine to have rank three (making more copies just multiplies the matrix by a scalar). Because the Dehn invariants have different ranks, no dissection is possible.</p>

<p>This same rank analysis can also be applied to the more familiar polyhedral form of the Dehn invariant. For that form, a polyhedron whose Dehn invariant has high rank cannot be dissected into another polyhedron with fewer edges than the rank.</p>

<p>A brief summary: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17207">In the paper, A proof of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture,</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jinyoungpark">Jinyoung Park</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~huypham/">Huy Tuan Pham</a> proved the 2006 expectation threshold conjecture posed by Jeff Kahn and me. The proof is wonderful. Congratulations Jinyoung and Huy Tuan!</p>
<p>The 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603218">expectation threshold conjecture</a> gives a justification for a naive way to estimate the threshold probability of a random graph property. Suppose that you are asked about the critical probability for a random graph in G(n,p) for having a perfect matching (or a Hamiltonian cycle). You compute the expected number of perfect matchings and realize that when p is C/n this expected number equals 1/2. (For Hamiltonian cycles it will be C’/n.) Of course, if the expectation is one half, the probability for a perfect matching can still be very low; indeed, in this case, an isolated vertex is quite likely but when there is no isolated vertices the expected number of perfect matchings is rather large. Our 2006 conjecture boldly asserts that the gap between the value given by such a naive computation and the true threshold value is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. Jeff and I tried hard to find a counterexample but instead we managed to find more general and stronger forms of the conjecture that we could not disprove.</p>
<p>Two years ago Keith Frankston, Jeff Kahn, Bhargav Narayanan, and Jinyoung Park proved a weak form of the conjecture which was proposed in a 2010 paper by Michel Talagrand. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/">this post</a>.) Indeed, the expectation threshold conjecture had some connections with a 1995 paper of Michel Talagrand entitled <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-9090-8_25">Are all sets of positive measure essentially convex?</a> In a 2010 STOC paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Are Many Small Sets Explicitly Small?</a> Michel formulated a whole array of interesting conjectures and commented that he feels that these conjectures are related to the expectation threshold conjecture to which he offered a weaker fractional version. This weak version suffices for various applications of the original conjecture. Keith, Jeff, Bhargav, and Jinyoung’s work built on the breakthrough work of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the Erdős-Rado ‘sunflower’ conjecture. </p>
<p>Proving the full expectation threshold conjecture looked like a  difficult task. The only path that people saw was to try to relate Talagrand’s fractional expectation threshold with our expectation threshold. (Indeed Talagrand also conjectured that they only differ by a multiplicative constant factor. This looked if true very difficult to prove.)  However this is not the path taken by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham and they found a direct simple argument! Jinyoung and Huy Tuan also used their method to settle one of the central conjectures (Conj 5.7) from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Talagrand’s paper</a> and this will be presented in a forthcoming paper.</p>
<p>The <em>logn</em> gap in our conjecture looked rather narrow but now that it was proved we can ask for conditions that will guarantee a smaller gap. For example, when is the gap only a constant?</p>
<p>Here is a nice IAS video on Jinyoung Park’s path to math.</p>

    <title>TR22-043 |  Polynomial Bounds On Parallel Repetition For All 3-Player Games With Binary Inputs | 

	Kunal Mittal, 

	Wei Zhan, 

	Uma Girish, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game $\mathcal G$ with value less than one, whose query distribution has the support $\mathcal S = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$ of hamming weight one vectors, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ decays polynomially fast to zero; that is, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal  G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal  G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Following the recent work of Girish, Holmgren, Mittal, Raz and Zhan (STOC 2022), our result is the missing piece that implies a similar bound for a much more general class of multiplayer games: For $\textbf{every}$ 3-player game $\mathcal G$ over $\textit{binary questions}$ and $\textit{arbitrary answer lengths}$, with value less than 1, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Our proof technique is new and requires many new ideas. For example, we make use of the Level-$k$ inequalities from Boolean Fourier Analysis, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been explored in this context prior to our work.</summary>

<p>
Mr. Apollinax might have made a good escort for Lofa Polir, had she lived a hundred years ago. The titular character of a <a href="https://interestingliterature.com/2017/09/a-short-analysis-of-t-s-eliots-mr-apollinax/">poem</a> written circa 1915 by Thomas Eliot was based on Bertrand Russell, whose 1901 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">paradox</a> revealed a gaping inconsistency in set theory as it was then known. Russell spent much of the intervening years trying to repair the gap via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#History">type theory</a>.</p>
<p>
Today we present a recently-discovered inconsistency in the type theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> programming language, which forced a feature-chopping <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/type-projection.html">revision</a> in its new version <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html">3.0</a>. Then, in a worldwide exclusive, we reveal a new theorem by Polir that explains why such inconsistencies are <em>inevitable</em>.</p>
<p>
Ernst Zermelo had already noticed the paradox in 1899 but brushed it off because his axiom system already evaded it. It is possible that Georg Cantor knew it in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BtZM33PzV9UC&amp;pg=PA923&amp;lpg=PA923&amp;dq=Cantor+letter+to+Dedekind+and+Hilbert+about+inconsistency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hE28iI4IT4&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CMPDUFBheRaXGQcIMFngE-Iytdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1j-7ej_T2AhXJY98KHd7WDuUQ6AF6BAgOEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Cantor letter to Dedekind and Hilbert about inconsistency&amp;f=false">letters</a> in 1897 to Richard Dedekind and David Hilbert. I could call this a continuation of a theme we’ve often addressed about discoveries not being named for their first discoverers, but I will not, for this reason: The discover<b>ee</b> was Gottlob Frege, who immediately recognized that the treatise on set theory he was about to publish had been devastated by the paradox. And the person he heard that from, in June 1902, was Russell—not any of his own compatriots.</p>
<p>
The poem comes with an epigram from a Greek text by Lucian satirically praising the painter Zeuxis of Herakleia: “Ω τῆς καινότητος. Ἡράκλεις, τῆς παραδοξολογίας. εὐμήχανος ἄνθρωπος.”  The reference <a href="https://genius.com/annotations/3603099/standalone_embed">translation</a> Eliot had to hand goes: “Such novelty! Heavens, what paradoxes! How inventive he is!”  I believe, however, that Eliot intended a more-particulate reading: “Oh for his innovation! Hercules, his paradoxology! Sweet machine man!”  That goes better with the poem <a href="https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/content/mr-apollinax">text</a> and with aspects of Russell that were visible to Eliot at the time.  We’ll only talk about the <i>paradoxology</i>.  Russell was well aware that other monsters besides his own were lurking, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene-Rosser_paradox">ones</a> that emerged in the US.  What if patching paradoxes is just the way of progress?  Let’s see this play out in the Scala programming language.</p>
<p/><h2> The Inconsistency </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The root of the inconsistency is allowing <em>projection</em> of an <em>abstract</em> type. Let’s explain the former concept with concrete types first. A standard way to represent trees and other graphs is by having a nested node class, for instance:</p>
<p><code><br/>
class BinaryTree[A &lt;: Comparable[A]] {</code></p>
<p>   class Node(var left: Node, var item: A, var right: Node)</p>
<p>   private var root: Node = null<br/>
   //etc.<br/>
}<br/>
</p>
<p>
A key wrinkle of Scala is that if you have two different trees <font size="+1"><tt>T1</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2</tt></font>, then <font size="+1"><tt>T1.Node</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2.Node</tt></font> are separate types. This notion of <em>path-dependent types</em> enables the compiler to catch bugs where you might try to connect a node on one tree as a child of a node in the other tree. If there were just one <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree.Node</tt></font> type, as is standard in Java for instance, then you could easily make this kind of bug and the compiler would not bat an eye.</p>
<p>
If you really do want to combine nodes from two different trees, however, you can do so via code using the projection type <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree#Node</tt></font>. The hash sign # makes this defined to be the <i>supertype</i> of nodes of all possible binary trees. </p>
<p>
The <font size="+1"><tt>[A &lt;: Comparable[A]]</tt></font> part means that the tree can hold any type <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> of data that extends a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> called <font size="+1"><tt>Comparable</tt></font>, whose function is to mandate having a comparison function for <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> so that the tree can be kept sorted. The symbol <font size="+1"><tt>&gt;:</tt></font> written the other way means supertype rather than subtype.</p>
<p>
We could try to make our binary tree class more versatile by making it more abstract. By itself it could be a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> so as to allow deferred implementations. It could try to define a more general notion of <font size="+1"><tt>Node</tt></font> that might relate more directly to stored data, for instance strings or numbers. This is not to say such abstractions are necessarily well-motivated, but the point is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Scala compiler defines what is workable. <p/>
</li><li>
Its notion of workability is based on mathematical type theory. <p/>
</li><li>
Lots of abstract constructions are made workable to encourage creativity.
</li></ul>
<p>
Workability is not supposed to lead to type errors, however. That is the unsoundness allowed in versions 2.x of Scala.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Code </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
If you have a lot of time—time to read the longest <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">post</a> ever on this blog—then you can draw some motivation for the unsound code. That post shows how to represent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Bernays-Godel_set_theory">NBG</a> version of set theory, due to John von Neuman, Paul Bernays, and Kurt Gödel, as an infinite graph. At the top of the graph are nodes representing the class of all sets and various other expansive types, which are symbolized by <font size="+1"><tt>V</tt></font> in the post. At the bottom is a node for the null set identified with <font size="+1"><tt>O</tt></font>. We can think of them as representing “zones” for possible supertypes and subtypes of some types of interest, such as string and number. </p>
<p>
Aside from some abstract manipulation of types, the following code does nothing except compose two versions of the identity function, applied to a <font size="+1"><tt>String</tt></font>. As you are welcome to try yourself, it compiles in Scala 2.x. But before you try to run it, you can ask yourself: exactly what number would the string “Hello World!” become?</p>
<p>
<code><br/>
/** File "Unsound.scala", mod by KWR from the last example in<br/>
    <a href="https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html" rel="nofollow">https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html</a><br/>
 */<br/>
object Unsound extends App {</code></p>
<p>   trait VZone { type Node &gt;: String }<br/>
   trait OZone { type Node &lt;: Double }</p>
<p>   def liftup[A &lt;: VZone]: String =&gt; A#Node<br/>
      = (x =&gt; x)<br/>
   def godown[A &lt;: OZone]: A#Node =&gt; Double<br/>
      = (x =&gt; x)</p>
<p>   def hole[A &lt;: VZone with OZone]: String =&gt; Double<br/>
      = (x =&gt; godown[A](liftup[A](x)))</p>
<p>   println(hole("Hello World!"))<br/>
}<br/>
</p>
<p>
The point remains, however, that this program is accepted as a “theorem” in the logical theory underlying the Scala 2.x type system. That theory is thereby unsound.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Lofa Polir’s Theorem </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A point we have been at pains to make is that this kind of happening is far from rare. Systems are proven secure and then break all the time. Creating more ways to write correct programs has created new ways to have bugs, even as the frequency of old kinds of bugs is reduced. As with the Earth’s ozone hole, the situation is not worsening but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
Dr. Polir’s new theorem not only explains why but also argues that we should be neither surprised nor dismayed by this state of affairs. It can be given the following intuitive statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> There is a sound theory <b>A.F.</b> that can be represented as a complexity-bounded limit of inconsistent theories, but not as an effective limit of consistent theories. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
The soundness is with respect to the standard model of arithmetic and includes every statement of arithmetic proved in set theory. The clever new idea in her proof is the manner of the proof itself: it formalizes and self-applies a criterion of <em>feasible correctness in the limit</em> for a sequence of incorrect proofs. </p>
<p>
The upshot is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The most productive and feasible way to do mathematics is to design inconsistent theories and fix them incrementally, rather than to demand global correctness from the get-go. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Before Dr. Polir types up her paper, she has a request for readers of this blog: What should the initials <b>A.F.</b> of her theory stand for? The name “Arithmetical Foundations” is both hackneyed and taken. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What do you think Lofa’s <b>A.F.</b> stands for? </p>

<i>If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.—Alan Turing</i></p>
<p>
Jack Dongarra has just won the 2021 <a href="https://amturing.acm.org">Turing Award</a>. Congrats to him. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/31/the-2021-turing-award/jd/" rel="attachment wp-att-19835"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19835" height="168" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jd.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Dongarra is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee. He has connections to the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to Rice University, and in England to the University of Manchester—Turing’s academic home.  The nub of ACM’s <a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2021-turing">article</a> says the following, with <i>linear algebra</i> emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dongarra’s major contribution was in creating open-source software libraries and standards which employ linear algebra as an intermediate language that can be used by a wide variety of applications. These libraries have been written for single processors, parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. Dongarra’s libraries also introduced many important innovations including autotuning, mixed precision arithmetic, and batch computations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dongarra’s doctoral advisor was Cleve Moler decades ago in 1980.  I always think we should thank our advisors—having been one myself.  But they continued on parallel tracks in the 1980s.  Moler had invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB">MATLAB</a> in the 1970s, but with the advent of IBM PCs in the 1980s, realized their promise for bringing advanced numerical computations into wide use.  Moler and John Little and Steve Bangert co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks">MathWorks</a> in 1984 to market their rewrite of MATLAB in C.  Dongarra went on to co-write a host of mathematical tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms">BLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPACK</a> (which succeeded his work with Moler and others on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISPACK">EISPACK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK">LINPACK</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software">ATLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCG_benchmark">HPCG</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why The Turing Award? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Dongarra received the Turing for his software—code that has had significant impact in many areas of computational science from data analytics, healthcare, renewable energy, weather prediction, genomics, and economics, to name a few. His work was over four decades of writing code that can solve linear systems. Such systems occur in just about all of engineering and science. They challenge us because we constantly wish to solve bigger and more difficult systems. And we are able to solve bigger systems because computers continue to get faster—able to do more operations per second. </p>
<p>
However, the challenge was and is that while computers get faster every year, <em>how</em> they get faster remains involved. They cannot just compute faster but how they get faster continues to be complex. If a computer just got faster every year, then Dongarra would <b>not</b> have been able to win a Turing award. That how they get faster is more complex, more involved, that made his Turing award possible. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Why So Hard? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are some of the challenges that Dongarra had to fight, and continues to fight?  We can build off the following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021183914/http://www.csbruce.com/~csbruce/quotes/craig-cut.html">quip</a> by the Canadian software developer Craig Bruce:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s hardware that makes a machine fast. It’s software that makes a fast machine slow.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
And in 1980 we could add: what could make an IBM PC fast?</p>
<p>
The goal of Dongarra’s software was to run fast on the current hardware systems. The challenge over the decades is simple:  As hardware systems were improved in performance they did not simply get faster. They needed to change how they worked in order to get faster.  The systems changed from single processors, to parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. These changes made the ability to exploit the potential performance harder and harder. </p>
<p>
Let’s assume, for example, that the hardware could not go 100X faster but could execute 100 operations at the same time. Then provided we can exploit this parallelism we can make the hardware seem to be 100 times faster. But if we cannot exploit this, we are in trouble. This is the key issue that Dongarra faced. This challenge is exactly what made his work so difficult and important.</p>
<p/><h2>The Test of Time</h2><p/>
<p>
The solutions found by Dongarra and his co-workers were definitive enough, and the core of linear algebra in LINPACK pure enough, that it could yield a salient benchmark of hardware power.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK benchmark suite</a> won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/business/technology-measuring-how-fast-computers-really-are.html">agreement</a> by the early 1990s as giving the definitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500">measure</a> of hardware power.  A decade ago, they began <a href="https://news.utk.edu/2013/07/10/professor-jack-dongarra-announces-supercomputer-benchmark/">updating</a> it to involve HPCG.</p>
<p>
Thus it is not enough to say that this work has stood the test of time: it <b>is</b> the test of time.  And this is carrying into the future.  A high LINPACK score in 2013 was an early <a href="https://newatlas.com/d-wave-quantum-computer-supercomputer-ranking/27476/">indicator</a> of the power achievable by D-Wave’s quantum adiabatic hardware.  An <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/value-of-quantum-computing-benchmarks">article</a> last month titled “The Race to Quantum Advantage Depends on Benchmarking” includes LINPACK as a contender.  There is recent work toward a more-tailored <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/presentations/202007_GoogleQuantum_LinLin_handout.pdf">quantum LINPACK</a> benchmark.</p>

Some interesting milestones about the Turing awards are:  The first recipient of the award, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, an American computer scientist who wrote the compiler for the ALGOL computer programming language. The first woman to win the prize was Frances Allen, in 2006, for her work in compiler optimization, which contributed to the development of parallel execution in multiprocessing. The youngest recipient was Donald Knuth, who was 36 when he received the award in 1974 for his work on algorithms and computer programming. The oldest recipient was Alfred Aho, who was 79 when he received the award in 2020 for his work on algorithms and the theory of programming language implementation.  I knew all the above winners pretty well. Rich DeMillo and I wrote a paper with Perlis in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">1979</a>.  </p>
<p>
Turing himself was also a pioneer in AI, of course.  He thought about how computers could reason, how they could think.  What directions will the Turing Awards take in the future—and will they reflect this side of Turing’s vision more?</p></div>

    <title>TR22-042 |  Matrix Polynomial Factorization via Higman Linearization | 

	Vikraman Arvind, 

	Pushkar Joglekar</title>
    <summary>In continuation to our recent work on noncommutative
 polynomial factorization, we consider the factorization problem for
 matrices of polynomials and show the following results.
\begin{itemize}  
\item Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries
  $M_{ij}$ are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring
  $\mathbb{F}_q\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a
  noncommutative arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a
  randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and
  $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization of $M$ as a matrix product
  $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix factor $M_i$ is
  irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each $M_i$
  are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that are output
  as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
  algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
\item A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose
  entries are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
  field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals
  we obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.
  \end{itemize}</summary>

    <title>There’s more to data than distributions.</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><em>This is first guest post by Deb. More to come!</em></p>

<p>In “<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104626">The clinician and dataset shift in artificial intelligence</a>,” published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a set of physician-scientists describe how a popular sepsis-prediction system developed by the company Epic needed to be deactivated. “Changes in patients’ demographic characteristics associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic” supposedly caused spurious alerting arising from the system, rendering it of little value to clinicians. For the authors, this is a clear illustration of distribution shift, a change in training and test data that, in this case, made it difficult to distinguish between fevers and bacterial sepsis. They go into detail about what this means: distribution shift is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, and whenever we attempt to deploy machine learning in the real world without considering the way in which that real world environment can change (whether its changes in technology (e.g., software vendors), changes in population and setting (e.g., new demographics), or changes in behavior (e.g., new reimbursement incentives), then we fail to properly consider the ways in which the data can change or shift between train and test environments. If not considered, the model will inevitably fail.</p>

<p>And why not? If the underlying test data diverges from the data used in the development of the model, we should expect disappointing results. But the distribution shift problem is so common that ML researchers and practitioners have started seeing it everywhere they look. In fact, in many cases, they will inappropriately characterize any failure of deployed ML models as a distribution shift. This both muddles our understanding of what exactly distribution shift means, and limits our vocabulary for the range of failures that can show up in deployment. In this blog post, I’ll use Epic’s sepsis-detector to illustrate some of the current confusion about distribution shift, and why the notion of “external validity”, a description of generalization problems used widely in other fields, is perhaps more relevant.</p>

<p>The terminology of distribution shift is both too specific and not specific enough. A “change in distribution” could be characterized as anything from a variation in source to a re-sampling. <a href="https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/cis700-2019/papers/dataset-shift/dataset-shift-terminology.pdf">These changes could involve changes to the input features (ie. covariate shift), changes to the labels (ie. prior probability shift) or both (ie. concept drift).</a></p>

<p>The notion of “data distributions” themselves assumes data comes from an imagined data generating function. In that world of infinitely abundant independent data points samples from a bespoke probability distribution (ie. the “independent and identically distributed” i.i.d. assumption), describing data in terms of how it’s distributed makes a lot of sense. But as Breiman describes in <a href="http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf">“Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures”</a>, that assumption doesn’t often hold for real world data. Very rarely does one actually know the data generating function, or even a reasonable proxy - real world data is disorganized, inconsistent, and unpredictable. As a result, the term “distribution” is vague enough to not address the additional specificity necessary to direct actions and interventions. When we talk about a hypothetical distribution shift, we talk about data changes but are not specific about which data changes happen and why they happen. We’re also constraining our discourse by just looking at changes in the data in the first place, when in fact, many other changes occur between development and deployment (such as changes in interactions with the model, changes in the interpretation of model results, etc.). Specifying the type of distribution shift is one solution, but more importantly, we need to understand specific distribution shifts as part of a broader phenomenon of external validity that we need to begin to articulate as a field.</p>

<p>The most significant consequence of the myopic obsession with distributions is how it constrains ML evaluations. The benchmarking paradigm that dominates ML at the moment is a by-product of its obsession with detecting shifts in data - the evaluation of models on static data test sets are tied to assumptions about failures being due to shifts in data distribution and not much else. A myopic view on distribution shift confuses the discourse on how to evaluate models for deployment. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01312-x">Several</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1872">studies</a> on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0">regulatory approvals</a> of ML-based tools in healthcare already demonstrate how over-emphasis on data distribution shift failures has led ML practitioners and even regulators within the healthcare space to inappropriately prioritize the use of <em>retrospective studies</em> (ie. evaluations on static collections of past data) rather than <em>prospective studies</em> (ie. examinations of the system within its context of use). Things like multi-site assessment, median evaluation sample size, demographic subgroup performance and
“side-by-side comparison of clinicians’ performances with and without AI” are also exceedingly rare in the evaluation of ML-based healthcare tools, as they don’t fit our current narrow perception of what can go wrong when you throw an ML model into the real world. Of course distribution shift matters but the nature in which we focus on it to the exclusion of everything else is regrettable. For better regulation and evaluation methodology for machine learning deployments, we need to expand our thinking and align ourselves with the other fields attempting to understand performance gaps between the theory and practice of interventions.</p>

<p>This broader notion of validity characterizes the accuracy of the claims being made in a specific context. The related notion of reliability has to do with reproducibility and the consistency of results (think of measurement precision), but validity is concerned with some notion of truthfulness and how close claims get to the target of describing the real relationship between inputs and outputs. There are various notions of validity discussed in measurement theory, evaluation science, program evaluation and experiment design literature, but there are common core concepts. For example, internal validity is about assessing a consistent causal relationship between the inputs and outputs within the experiment and construct validity is related to the evaluation of how well experimental variables represent the real world phenomena being observed. When discussing generalization issues, we are most interested in external validity, which analyzes if  the causal relationship between inputs and outputs observed in experiments holds for inputs and outputs outside the experimental setting.</p>

<p>To understand how external validity differs from the current discourse on distribution shift, let’s go back to the sepsis monitoring example. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2781307">“External Validation of a Widely Implemented Proprietary Sepsis Prediction Model in Hospitalized Patients,”</a>, published in JAMA, describes a retrospective study on the use of the sepsis tool between December 2018 and October 2019 (notably well before the pandemic began). They examined 27,697 patients undergoing 38,455 hospitalizations and found that the Epic Sepsis Model predicted the onset of sepsis with an area under the curve of 0.63, “which is substantially worse than the performance reported by its developer”. Furthermore, the tool “did not identify 1,709 patients with sepsis (67%) despite generating alerts… for 6,971 of all 38 455 hospitalized patients (18%), thus creating a large burden of alert fatigue.” These researchers rightfully describe these issues as “external validity” issues, and go into detail examining a range of problems far beyond the data-related “shifts” described in the “Clinician and Dataset Shift” oped. They don’t pretend that this doesn’t have to do with changes in the data - of course it does. Epic’s system evaluation was on data from 3 US health systems from 2013 to 2015, and that’s certainly a different dataset than University of Michigan’s 2018-2019 patient records. But they also comment on changes to the interactions doctors had with the model and how that modified outcomes, as well as other external validity factors that had very little to do with data at all, much less “data distribution shift.” Even when discussing substantive data changes, they are specific in characterizing what it is and breaking down the differences that occurred upon deployment at their hospital.</p>

<p>As this study shows, machine learning needs some clean guidelines for evaluating external validity.
To begin scaffolding such frameworks, we can learn from the social sciences. For example, Erin Hartman, a UC Berkeley colleague in political science, and her co-author Naoki Egami <a href="https://erinhartman.com/publication/elements/">propose a taxonomy that provides an interesting start to this discussion</a>. Their interest is in assessing external validity in scenarios where a population is given a policy treatment (eg. sending out voting reminders, updating the tax code, giving out free vaccines, etc.) and the impact of this treatment as measured within the experiment and also once implemented in the real world. If we consider the treatment to be an ML model’s integration into a broader system, we can begin to articulate what external validity could mean in the algorithmic context.  In my next blog post, I’ll try to work through Hartman and Egami’s framework and other specific proposals from other fields on how we could begin to taxonomize external validity issues, and see which of the external validity problems they describe are actually quite relevant to machine learning.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Reproducibility is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of reproducibility have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the reproducibility crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that don’t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new notion of reproducibility for randomized algorithms. This notion ensures that with high probability, an algorithm returns exactly the same output when run with two samples from the same distribution. Despite the exceedingly strong demand of reproducibility, there are efficient reproducible algorithms for several fundamental problems in statistics and learning. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a modest increase in sample complexity, and we use this to construct reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters and medians. Using these ideas, we give the first reproducible algorithm for learning halfspaces via a reproducible weak learner and a reproducible boosting algorithm. We initiate the study of lower bounds and inherent tradeoffs for reproducible algorithms, giving nearly tight sample complexity upper and lower bounds for reproducible versus non-reproducible SQ algorithms. Finally, we discuss connections to other well-studied notions of algorithmic stability, such as differential privacy.</p>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>by <a href="https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Sean Meyn</a> (University of Florida) and <a href="http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Gergely Neu</a> (Pompeu Fabra University)</p>



<p>One theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning is optimal control, usually rooted in the Markovian variety known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDP model consists of a state process, an action (or input) process, and a one-step reward that is a function of state and action. The goal is to obtain a policy (function from states to actions) that is optimal in some predefined sense. Chris Watkins introduced the Q-function in the 1980s as part of a methodology for reinforcement learning. Given its importance for over three decades, it is not surprising that the question of the true meaning of <em>Q</em> was a hot topic for discussion during the Simons Institute’s Fall 2020 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Theory of Reinforcement Learning</a>.</p>



<p>This short note focuses on interactions at the start of the program, and research directions inspired in part by these interactions. To start with, <em>who is Q</em>? Was this code for one of Watkins’ friends at Cambridge? The question was posed early on, which led to an online investigation. The mystery was shattered through a response from Chris: we now know that the letter <em>Q</em> stands for <em>quality</em>, not Quinlyn or Quincy. To discuss further questions and potential answers requires some technicalities.</p>



<p>The discounted-cost optimality criterion is a favorite metric for performance in computer science and operations research, and is the setting of the original Q-function formulation. The definition requires a state process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span> and an action (or input) process <span class="math inline">\(\{A_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span>, evolving on respective spaces (which are assumed discrete in this note). There is a controlled transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that describes dynamics: <span class="math inline">\(X_{k+1}\)</span> is distributed according to <span class="math inline">\(P(\cdot|x,a)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_k=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>, for any action sequence that is adapted to the state sequence.</p>



<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> denoting the discount factor, the Q-function is the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation <span class="math inline">\(T^*Q = Q\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is the Bellman operator: <span class="math display">\[\left(T^*Q\right)(x,a) = r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\]</span> This must hold for each state-action pair <span class="math inline">\((x,a)\)</span>, with the maximum over all possible actions. This is a version of the dynamic programming (DP) equation that has been with us for about seven decades.</p>



<p>The magic of Q-learning, which is based on this DP equation, is that the maximum appears within an expectation. This makes possible the application of Monte Carlo methods to obtain an approximate solution based solely on observations of the actual system to be controlled, or through simulations.</p>



<p>One core idea of modern reinforcement learning (RL) is to find approximate solutions of the DP equation within a function class (e.g., neural networks, as popularized by the deep Q-learning approach of Mnih et al., 2015). While success stories are well-known, useful theory is scarce: we don’t know if a solution exists to an approximate DP equation except in very special settings, and we don’t know if a good approximation will lead to good performance for the resulting policy. We don’t even know if the recursive algorithms that define Q-learning will be stable — estimates may diverge to infinity.</p>



<p>There are many ways to read these negative results, and indeed many articles have been written around this subject. Our own reading is probably among the most radical: without understanding the issues around the existence of solutions to these DP equation approximations or their interpretation, we should search for alternative approximations of dynamic programming suitable for application in RL.</p>



<p>These concerns were raised at Sean Meyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUaFu3WzW7o" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">boot camp lecture</a>, where he called on listeners to revisit an alternate foundation of optimal control: the linear programming (LP) approach introduced by Manne (1960) and further developed by Denardo (1970) and d’Epenoux (1963). The message was greeted with enthusiasm from some attendees, including Gergely Neu, who responded, “You have blown my mind!” He had been working on his own formulation of this idea, which became logistic Q-learning (more on this below).</p>



<span id="more-636"/>



<p>The least-squares approach that is central to most traditional RL algorithms (such as DQN) is replaced by an LP, so that we move from <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> approximation. There is ample motivation for this point of view:</p>



<ul><li>
		<p>Lyapunov theory and the theory of inverse dynamic programming provide firm motivation: a good approximation of the DP equation in an <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> sense implies strict bounds on closed-loop performance of the resulting policy. You can learn more about this theory in standard RL texts, and Meyn’s new RL monograph to appear this year.</p>
	</li><li>
		<p>The LP approach reframes the DP approximation as a numerical optimization problem rather than a root-finding problem. Existence of a solution is guaranteed under minimal assumptions, even when working with a restricted set of candidate solutions.</p>
	</li></ul>



<p>Despite these advantages, LP-based approaches were left out of the mainstream RL tool kit until recently. One reason may be a glaring gap in the framework: the classical LPs are phrased in terms of state-value functions and not Q-functions! This means it was not obvious how to bring in Monte Carlo methods for algorithm design.</p>



<p>In 2020, we independently discovered the following LP that can be used to cast Q-learning as a constrained optimization problem — the so-called DPLP: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} \mbox{minimize } \qquad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_{a} Q(X,a)\right] \\ \mbox{subject to } \qquad &amp; Q(x,a) \ge r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Without any constraints on the function class, the optimizer is the solution to the DP equation. The constraints amount to the DP inequality <span class="math inline">\(Q \ge T^* Q\)</span>, which tells us only <em>negative</em> deviations should be penalized! This is to be contrasted with the commonly used squared Bellman error criterion that penalizes deviations of both signs. In seeking an approximation within a function class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it is not at all difficult to ensure a feasible solution exists, even when there is no theory to ensure that an approximate Bellman optimality operator has a fixed point.</p>



<p>There are a variety of possible ways of turning <span> this</span> insight into practical algorithms. One path (taken by Bas-Serrano et al., 2021) is to replace the hard constraint in the LP with a smooth upper bound on the expected constraint violations, resulting in the following unconstrained minimization problem: <span class="math display">\[%  \mbox{minimize } \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}[\max_a Q(X,a)] + \frac 1\eta \log 
% \mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}[e^{\eta(r(X,A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|X,A)}[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)] – Q(X,A))}].
\mbox{minimize} \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_a Q(X,a)\right] + \frac 1\eta \log 
\mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}\left[e^{\eta((T^*Q)(X,A) – Q(X,A))}\right].\]</span> Bas-Serrano et al. (2021) dubbed the above objective function the “logistic Bellman error” and have shown that it enjoys several favorable properties that make it an ideal objective for stochastic optimization. Interactions at the Simons Institute led to the development of another related algorithmic framework called “convex Q-learning,” in which the hard constraints in the LP are replaced with a different continuous approximation (Lu et al., 2021).</p>



<p>It is straightforward to derive practical algorithms from both approaches by replacing the expectations with sample averages. This approach led to good empirical performance, along with the beginnings of theory for convergence and performance bounds.</p>



<p>The LP approach had been simmering in the background over the prior decade: de Farias and Van Roy (2003) proposed an LP approach for approximate dynamic programming, and Mehta and Meyn (2009) contains foundations for convex Q-learning, including a variant of the DPLP for deterministic systems in continuous time.</p>



<p>The new techniques bring challenges that must be overcome before these LP-based approaches can take on the world. One is that these optimization problems can be very poorly conditioned. Another is that the approximation may greatly underestimate the true Q-function when using a poor choice of function class for approximation. We remain optimistic: just like the RL community has successfully developed numerical recipes for addressing the much more severe issue of nonexistence of fixed points to the approximate Bellman operators, we believe that similar know-how can be developed for LP-based methods if theorists and practitioners join forces. Now that we understand where Q comes from, let us decide together where it will go next!</p>



<p><em>Acknowledgment</em>. The authors owe a great debt to the Simons Institute for providing inspiration and interactions throughout the fall program. In particular, our joint work (Lu et al., 2021) was in large part an outcome of discussions at the meeting. The LP approach is one theme of the new textbook (Meyn, 2022), and the impact of the program is seen throughout the book.</p>

Keith Kirkpatrick is the author of an interesting CACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/4/259392-still-waiting-for-self-driving-cars/fulltext">article</a> on self-driving cars. It is titled “Still Waiting For Self-Driving Cars” and appears in the news section of this month’s issue. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss why it has been so difficult to get self-driving cars started.</p>
<p>
Kirkpatrick’s article starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Over the past decade, technology and automotive pundits have predicted the “imminent” arrival of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without any active monitoring or input from a human driver. Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017. Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> An Issue </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
As printed in the current CACM issue, his article says the following on page 13:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A potential intermediate solution currently being tested in Germany is to utilize remote drivers to control vehicles. Vay, a Berlin-based startup, has been testing a fleet of remote-controlled electric vehicles in that city and plans to roll out a mobility service in Europe and potentially the U.S. this year. The service will allow customers to order a remote-controlled car and have it drive them to their desired destination; on arrival, they get out if the vehicle and leave it to a human teledriver miles away to either park the vehicle or steer it to the next client. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
I claim this shows the issue that we have with automatic driving systems. There is a typo in the above paragraph. A typo that shows what we are up against in the attempt to make automatic driving systems. </p>
<p>
<b>DO YOU SEE IT?</b></p>
<p/><p><br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/cacmifoftypo/" rel="attachment wp-att-19792"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19792" height="36" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CACMifoftypo.jpg?resize=253%2C36&amp;ssl=1" width="253"/></a></p>
<p/><p><br/>
We claim that a typo like this in a CACM article is part of the reason it is so hard to make self-driving cars. Do you agree? Or is the typo not critical? While we’re at it, does the title of this post have a typo?  Read on…</p>
<p>
Ken contributes a more difficult example of this kind, one he used while addressing the same issue of AI advances in his department’s Freshman Seminar. It relates to a later section in Kirkpatrick’s article, where he discusses the issue of</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …testing to ensure vehicle navigation systems understand the complex social interactions that often occur between oncoming and adjacent drivers, or drivers and pedestrians. Generally, if a pedestrian is about to cross or is crossing a street, the driver and pedestrian will make eye contact, and will use nonverbal cues to indicate the direction and speed of their movement. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Over to Ken:</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Example </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is the relevant portion of the White House <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia">transcript</a> of Barack Obama’s July 2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia—the one with the notorious phrase “you didn’t build that”:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/youdidntbuildthat/" rel="attachment wp-att-19798"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19798" height="229" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/YouDidntBuildThat.jpg?resize=363%2C229&amp;ssl=1" width="363"/></a></p>
<p>
The question we could submit to Google—whose own automated-driving efforts have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html">difficulties</a> with interpreting rules—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What does the word “that” in “you didn’t build that” refer to? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
By rules of linguistic derivation, the answer seems clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The word “that” refers to the most recent noun, which is “business.” <p/>
</li><li>
The dashes ‘- -‘ connect two parts that refer to each other. <p/>
</li><li>
The word cannot anyway refer to “roads and bridges” because that is plural whereas “that” is singular, like “business.” <p/>
</li><li>
(The preceding point is not a self-contradiction because in quotes, “roads and bridges” is a phrase—singular.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Now please take a minute-plus to listen to the actual delivery of this part of the speech (you may need to click back from 0:00:08 to 0:00:00 to get the start):</p>
<p/><center><br/>
<br/>
</center><p/>
<p/><p><br/>
First, the transcript is missing a word: Obama actually said “<em>that</em>—you didn’t build <em>that</em>.” Perhaps having a rhetorically emphasized <em>that</em> right after “business” makes the semantic designation even clearer? But then notice that the part “if you’ve got a business” was delivered in a quick and parenthetical manner inside the full phrase “Somebody invested in roads and bridges … you didn’t build that.” </p>
<p>
The interpretation that the “that” refers to <em>infrastructure</em> is supported by the speech’s immediate segue to the Internet, sandwiched around “somebody else made that happen.” Going out to sources, Obama was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html">channeling</a> a point already notoriously made by Elizabeth Warren in a 2011 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-agenda/elizabeth-warrens-quote-reihan-salam/">speech</a>. But without going out to sources—something we cannot expect an AI to do in the moment—there is Obama’s next sentence (also included in the speech clip):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Whether Obama intended to say that people did not build their businesses can still be argued, but that’s not the real point. My first point is that AIs based on current art for ascribing meanings not only would make that ascription, but <em>should</em> do so for overall consistency. And the second, larger, point at the end of my <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse199/InternetAndData199np.pdf">slides</a>, where I get to hard AI problems, is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We base our confidence in developing AI systems on Alan Turing’s principle that whatever the human mind can resolve, a computer can be programmed to apprehend and execute. But what if important data, on fine scales, concern matters that our human minds cannot resolve? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
CACM puts in a bubble Kirkpatrick’s quoting another expert that “it will take years and massive compute power to train self-driving systems to understand the nonverbal cues that pass between drivers and pedestrians.”  We believe the task and need of getting cars to <em>self-derive</em> meanings is greater still.  </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Do these issues say anything about the difficulty of getting code right? We think so, but what do you think?</p>
<p/><p><br/>
[some word changes; I seem unable to fix the endpoints of my clip on the C-SPAN website.]</p></font></font></div>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><strong>The 2022 STOC Test of Time Award</strong> recognizes papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. This is the second year of this annual award. There are three awards, targeting the STOC conferences 10, 20, and 30 years prior to the year in which the award is given. While there is a preference for papers in the target years (and nominations from those years are encouraged), in each of these award categories it is also possible to nominate STOC conference papers published up to four conferences earlier than the targeted conference. Thus, the 2022 STOC Test of Time Awards will be for papers presented at the STOC conferences in 2008-2012, 1998-2002, and 1988-1992. The awards, which will be presented at STOC 2022, include a prize of US $500 per author as well as complimentary registration for all authors who attend the conference at which the award is given.</p>



<h2>Nomination Procedure</h2>



<p>Nominations should be sent to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>stoc22.tot.award@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>with a subject line of <strong>“STOC Test of Time Award” </strong>no later than <strong>April 30, 2022</strong>. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. A nomination may be accompanied by up to three additional endorsement letters, which may be sent by the endorsers directly to the same email address with the same subject line. Self-nominations are disallowed. </p>



<h2>Selection</h2>



<p>The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the SIGACT Executive Committee. For 2022 the selection committee consists of Toniann Pitassi (Columbia), Satish Rao (Berkeley), Salil Vadhan (Harvard, chair), Avi Wigderson (Institute for Advanced Study). </p>



<p>In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including but not limited to:</p>



<ol><li>Opening up a new area of research</li><li>Introducing new techniques</li><li>Solving a problem of lasting importance</li><li>Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines.</li></ol>



<p>The committee expects to select exactly one paper for each award. However, when circumstances justify it, up to three may be selected. The committee may consider papers that were not explicitly nominated and gather additional input from experts, but formal nominations are extremely helpful in the committee’s deliberations and strongly encouraged.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  In the Pandora’s Box problem, the algorithm is provided with a number of boxes with unknown (stochastic) rewards contained inside them. The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora’s Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that different random variables in the input are distributed independently. As such it does not capture many real-world settings. In this work, we provide the first algorithms for Pandora’s Box-type problems with correlations. In the independent setting, optimal algorithms are non-adaptive and based on the notion of the Gittins index. These techniques fail to extend to the correlated case. We assume that the algorithm has access to samples drawn from the joint distribution on input and provide solutions that require few samples; are computationally efficient; and guarantee approximate optimality. <br/>This is joint work with Evangelia Gergatsouli, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang and appeared in FOCS’20.</p>
