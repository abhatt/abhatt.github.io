    <title>Sparse Convex Optimization via Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593129600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Axiotis:Kyriakos.html">Kyriakos Axiotis</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sviridenko:Maxim.html">Maxim Sviridenko</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14571">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The goal of Sparse Convex Optimization is to optimize a convex function $f$
under a sparsity constraint $s\leq s^*\gamma$, where $s^*$ is the target number
of non-zero entries in a feasible solution (sparsity) and $\gamma\geq 1$ is an
approximation factor. There has been a lot of work to analyze the sparsity
guarantees of various algorithms (LASSO, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP),
Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)) in terms of the Restricted Condition Number
$\kappa$. The best known algorithms guarantee to find an approximate solution
of value $f(x^*)+\epsilon$ with the sparsity bound of $\gamma =
O\left(\kappa\min\left\{\log \frac{f(x^0)-f(x^*)}{\epsilon},
\kappa\right\}\right)$, where $x^*$ is the target solution. We present a new
Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding (ARHT) algorithm that makes
significant progress on this problem by bringing the bound down to
$\gamma=O(\kappa)$, which has been shown to be tight for a general class of
algorithms including LASSO, OMP, and IHT. This is achieved without significant
sacrifice in the runtime efficiency compared to the fastest known algorithms.
We also provide a new analysis of OMP with Replacement (OMPR) for general $f$,
under the condition $s &gt; s^* \frac{\kappa^2}{4}$, which yields Compressed
Sensing bounds under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). When compared to
other Compressed Sensing approaches, it has the advantage of providing a strong
tradeoff between the RIP condition and the solution sparsity, while working for
any general function $f$ that meets the RIP condition.

    <title>Augmenting the Algebraic Connectivity of Graphs</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593129600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Bogdan-Adrian Manghiuc, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/p/Peng:Pan.html">Pan Peng</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sun:He.html">He Sun</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14449">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>For any undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set $E_W$ of candidate edges with
$E\cap E_W=\emptyset$, the $(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem is to
find a set $F$ of $k$ edges from $E_W$ with appropriate weighting, such that
the algebraic connectivity of the resulting graph $H=(V,E\cup F)$ is least
$\gamma$. Because of a tight connection between the algebraic connectivity and
many other graph parameters, including the graph's conductance and the mixing
time of random walks in a graph, maximising the resulting graph's algebraic
connectivity by adding a small number of edges has been studied over the past
15 years.
</p>
<p>In this work we present an approximate and efficient algorithm for the
$(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem, and our algorithm runs in
almost-linear time under a wide regime of parameters. Our main algorithm is
based on the following two novel techniques developed in the paper, which might
have applications beyond the $(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem.
</p>
<p>(1) We present a fast algorithm for solving a feasibility version of an SDP
for the algebraic connectivity maximisation problem from [GB06]. Our algorithm
is based on the classic primal-dual framework for solving SDP, which in turn
uses the multiplicative weight update algorithm. We present a novel approach of
unifying SDP constraints of different matrix and vector variables and give a
good separation oracle accordingly.
</p>
<p>(2) We present an efficient algorithm for the subgraph sparsification
problem, and for a wide range of parameters our algorithm runs in almost-linear
time, in contrast to the previously best known algorithm running in at least
$\Omega(n^2mk)$ time [KMST10]. Our analysis shows how the randomised BSS
framework can be generalised in the setting of subgraph sparsification, and how
the potential functions can be applied to approximately keep track of different
subspaces.

    <title>Approximation Algorithms for Clustering with Dynamic Points</title>

$n$ points in a metric space, by segmenting them into $k$ categories or
clusters, each cluster represented concisely by a single point in the metric
space. Two notable examples are the $k$-center/$k$-supplier problem and the
$k$-median problem. In practical applications of clustering, the data set may
evolve over time, reflecting an evolution of the underlying clustering model.
In this paper, we initiate the study of a dynamic version of clustering
problems that aims to capture these considerations. In this version there are
$T$ time steps, and in each time step $t\in\{1,2,\dots,T\}$, the set of clients
needed to be clustered may change, and we can move the $k$ facilities between
time steps. More specifically, we study two concrete problems in this
framework: the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median and the Dynamic $k$-Supplier problem.
We first consider the Dynamic Ordered $k$-Median problem, where the objective
is to minimize the weighted sum of ordered distances over all time steps, plus
the total cost of moving the facilities between time steps. We present one
constant-factor approximation algorithm for $T=2$ and another approximation
algorithm for fixed $T \geq 3$. Then we consider the Dynamic $k$-Supplier
problem, where the objective is to minimize the maximum distance from any
client to its facility, subject to the constraint that between time steps the
maximum distance moved by any facility is no more than a given threshold. When
the number of time steps $T$ is 2, we present a simple constant factor
approximation algorithm and a bi-criteria constant factor approximation
algorithm for the outlier version, where some of the clients can be discarded.
We also show that it is NP-hard to approximate the problem with any factor for
$T \geq 3$.

    <title>New Approximations and Hardness Results for Submodular Partitioning Problems</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1593129600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Santiago:Richard.html">Richard Santiago</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.14312">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We consider the following class of submodular k-multiway partitioning
problems: (Sub-$k$-MP) $\min \sum_{i=1}^k f(S_i): S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots
\uplus S_k = V \mbox{ and } S_i \neq \emptyset \mbox{ for all }i\in [k]$. Here
$f$ is a non-negative submodular function, and $\uplus$ denotes the union of
disjoint sets. Hence the goal is to partition $V$ into $k$ non-empty sets
$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k f(S_i)$ is minimized. These
problems were introduced by Zhao et al. partly motivated by applications to
network reliability analysis, VLSI design, hypergraph cut, and other
partitioning problems.
</p>
<p>In this work we revisit this class of problems and shed some light onto their
hardness of approximation in the value oracle model. We provide new
unconditional hardness results for Sub-$k$-MP in the special settings where the
function $f$ is either monotone or symmetric. For symmetric functions we show
that given any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, any algorithm achieving a $(2 -
\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many queries in the value
oracle model. For monotone objectives we show that given any $\epsilon &gt; 0$,
any algorithm achieving a $(4/3 - \epsilon)$-approximation requires
exponentially many queries in the value oracle model.
</p>
<p>We then extend Sub-$k$-MP to a larger class of partitioning problems, where
the functions $f_i(S_i)$ can now be all different, and there is a more general
partitioning constraint $ S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus S_k \in
\mathcal{F}$ for some family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^V$ of feasible sets. We
provide a black box reduction that allows us to leverage several existing
results from the literature; leading to new approximations for this class of
problems.

We say that
$T_1$ can be transformed into $T_2$ via an edge flip if there exist two edges
$e \in T_1$ and $f$ in $T_2$ such that $T_2= (T_1 \setminus e) \cup f$. Since
spanning trees form a matroid, one can indeed transform a spanning tree into
any other via a sequence of edge flips, as observed by Ito et al.
</p>
<p>We investigate the problem of determining, given two spanning trees $T_1,T_2$
with an additional property $\Pi$, if there exists an edge flip transformation
from $T_1$ to $T_2$ keeping property $\Pi$ all along.
</p>
<p>First we show that determining if there exists a transformation from $T_1$ to
$T_2$ such that all the trees of the sequence have at most $k$ (for any fixed
$k \ge 3$) leaves is PSPACE-complete.
</p>
<p>We then prove that determining if there exists a transformation from $T_1$ to
$T_2$ such that all the trees of the sequence have at least $k$ leaves (where
$k$ is part of the input) is PSPACE-complete even restricted to split,
bipartite or planar graphs. We complete this result by showing that the problem
becomes polynomial for cographs, interval graphs and when $k=n-2$.

    <title>An Efficient, Practical Algorithm and Implementation for Computing Multiplicatively Weighted Voronoi Diagrams</title>

weighted Voronoi diagrams of points and straight-line segments in the Euclidean
plane. If the input sites may be assumed to be randomly weighted points then
the use of a so-called overlay arrangement [Har-Peled&amp;Raichel, Discrete Comput.
Geom. 53:547-568, 2015] allows to achieve an expected runtime complexity of
$O(n\log^4 n)$, while still maintaining the simplicity of our approach. We
implemented the full algorithm for weighted points as input sites, based on
CGAL. The results of an experimental evaluation of our implementation suggest
$O(n\log^2 n)$ as a practical bound on the runtime. Our algorithm can be
extended to handle also additive weights in addition to multiplicative weights,
and it yields a truly simple $O(n\log n)$ solution for solving the
one-dimensional version of this problem.

Specifically, we
look for a constructive method to connect any two points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The
construction must be {\em consistent} (that is, satisfy the natural extension
of the Euclidean axioms) while resembling them as much as possible. Previous
work has shown asymptotically tight results in two dimensions with $\Theta(\log
N)$ error, where resemblance between segments is measured with the Hausdorff
distance, and $N$ is the $L_1$ distance between the two points. This
construction was considered tight because of a $\Omega(\log N)$ lower bound
that applies to any consistent construction in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
</p>
<p>In this paper we observe that the lower bound does not directly extend to
higher dimensions. We give an alternative argument showing that any consistent
construction in $d$ dimensions must have $\Omega(\log^{1/(d-1)} N)$ error. We
tie the error of a consistent construction in high dimensions to the error of
similar {\em weak} constructions in two dimensions (constructions for which
some points need not satisfy all the axioms). This not only opens the
possibility for having constructions with $o(\log N)$ error in high dimensions,
but also opens up an interesting line of research in the tradeoff between the
number of axiom violations and the error of the construction. In order to show
our lower bound, we also consider a colored variation of the concept of
discrepancy of a set of points that we find of independent interest.

relies on new results for data structures that support dynamic longest

<h2>Rani Sharim’s two-player variants of John Conway’s game-of-life</h2>
<p><a href="https://ranisharim.github.io/game_of_life_2_players/">Here is a web-page</a> by a student in my “Game Theory” course where you can play several two-players variants of John Conway’s game-of-life.  (A couple of variants were considered before. See, e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0207679">this  paper</a>.)</p>
<p>I really enjoyed playing Rani’s games and it can certainly cheer you up in difficult times. Questions about the game, remarks, and suggestions for improvements and for new features, are most welcome.</p>
<h2>How to catch lies with statistics, a 2006  presentation by Maya Bar-Hillel</h2>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19929" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/mayesther.png?w=640"/></a></p>
<p>Maya Bar-Hillel (left) and Ester Samuel-Cahn</p>
<p>Here is an interesting 2006 <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/ester.ppt">power point presentation entitled <strong><em>How to detect lies with statistics</em></strong> by Maya Bar-Hillel.</a>  This was a talk given by Maya at the <a href="http://www.esterconference.huji.ac.il/">conference</a> honoring Prof. Ester Samuel- Cahn , Jerusalem, December 18-20, 2006, and it described a planned research project of Maya Bar-Hillel with Yossi Rinott, David Budescu and myself. At the end we did not pursue it, mainly because each of us was involved in various other projects (but also because we were skeptical about some aspects of it.)  Ester Samuel-Cahn (1933-2015) was a famous Israeli statistician. (Here is a <a href="http://www.sci-princess.info/archives/291">post by Yosi Levy in Hebrew</a> about the conference and about Ester.)</p>
<p>The lecture starts with “Last year, <em>Statistical Science</em> celebrated 50 years for `How to Lie with Statistics’ the book [by Durell Huff] whose title inspired this talk.”</p>
<p>And here are a few other quotes from Maya’s presentation</p>
<p>“We are not sure a general toolkit for detecting lies with statistics can be developed. Perhaps that explains why none yet exists.  We have shown just a collection of anecdotes. But they can be classified and categorized. Some do seem generalizeable, at least to some extent.”</p>
<p>and the conclusion</p>
<blockquote><p>A famous quip by Fred Mosteller: “It is easy to lie with statistics, but easier to lie without them.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we should say:  “It is possible to detect (some) lies with statistics, but easier to detect them with other means”.</p></blockquote>

<p>A year ago I came across <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114324995342352&amp;set=a.507523926022475&amp;type=3&amp;theater">this cool facebook post</a> by Rupei Xu</p>
<blockquote><p>OMG! Just learned that Jaeger’s conjecture is false for every t&gt;=3. An interesting consequence of it is that a specific version of Goddyn’s conjecture on thin spanning trees is false, which shows some negative evidence that the thin spanning tree approaches may fail to lead to a constant factor approximation algorithm for ATSP!</p></blockquote>

    <title>Writing Code for a Paper :  A Note to Students</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This post both relates to some of the stuff I'll be presenting at Friday's STOC workshop on Algorithms with Predictions, but is also for future students in my classes, who sometimes wonder why I have them write code on theory material.  (Somehow this might be a theme for a lecture in my grad class next semester, so maybe these are a first attempt at notes for the lecture.  Comments  and  suggestions welcome.)<br/><br/>Some of the work I'm doing is looking at how queueing systems perform with various sorts of predictions on the times the jobs take.  This particular work I'm doing on my own.  (While most of my research has been and is with collaborators, and it's one of the things I enjoy about computer science -- we're a very collaborative field!, which seems to surprise many people -- I still sometimes like to do research projects on my own.  I've looked at queueing systems since my PhD thesis, and it's a bit outside the research interest of most of my collaborator pool, and it's "fun" sometimes to do my own thing.  The reason why "fun" is in quotes is described below.)  <br/><br/>Often in my work in queueing I'm looking at mean-field limits (meant to model infinite systems of queues, which provides a good approximation for large finite systems under reasonable assumptions), where I can derive families of differential equations describing the system behavior.  I can also simulate the large finite system directly, and make sure the results match.  I generally do this for all of these types of papers.<br/><br/>Now the numbers I get from simulating the system directly and from simulating the differential equations should match (say within 1% or so).  If they don't, something is wrong.  In an effort to avoid wrongness, I won't consider the paper ready for outside consumption until I get a match.  Unfortunately, there are three ways things can go wrong.<br/><br/>1.  My simulation code for the queueing system might have bugs.<br/>2.  My code to evaluate the differential equations might have bugs.<br/>3.  My equations themselves might have bugs.<br/><br/>And I find there are two main categories of bugs.  Sometimes the bugs are simple/standard coding mistakes -- I'm off by 1 on an index, or I cut and paste and forget to change an i++ to a j++ in one my double loops, or I type x instead of a y.  Usually it's pretty easy to find these things, although I've had times where a hidden typo took hours to find.  But sometimes the bug is a thinking mistake -- I've forgotten a subcase and so my equations aren't complete (and so my code evaluating the equations won't give the right answer), or I've not handled a subcase correctly in my simulation.  That type usually takes longer. <br/><br/>Usually, the first time through, most all of these types of bugs happen -- my math is off, I've typed some stuff wrong, it can all happen.  And then, like coders everywhere, I go through and fix it.  And it's painful.  Sometimes everything goes right, a quick check or two and everything works.  For more complicated stuff, it's more time figuring out what went wrong than setting up the code to begin with.  And being the personality type to not let things sit, that can mean late nights figuring out what went wrong.<br/><br/>For my talk this week, there was one last problem I wanted to include, which meant finally taking the model and writing the equations and code.  I didn't even need it for the talk, but it's also the last bit before I put a paper draft on arxiv, so taking advantage of a deadline, I figured now was the time.  Which means the last 2 days, I've spent many hours (and a late night) trying to remove the disagreements.<br/><br/>On the plus side, when everything finally works, it's a wonderful feeling.  And it always makes me feel better when I have worked to verify my math this way;  this time, what kept me up well past midnight and took several hours to track down was actually a boundary case I had left out of the equations.  (I had looked at the equations over and over again without noticing I had left out the subcase;  I had to step through numbers from the differential equations one time step at a time to track down what was missing, and then the numbers told me what I had done wrong.)<br/><br/>On the down side, it's work, and debugging is never particularly fun.<br/><br/>For students out there, maybe I'm just explaining that I understand the pain that I am putting you through.  You may wonder why I have you do simulations that take a few hours if you do them well, but days if you don't think through the best approach.  But using programming and theory together can be powerful;  it's helped me countless times in my research.<br/><br/>(Related: on theory and experiments that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191184-theory-without-experiments/fulltext">I've written on before</a>, along with <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/9/191183-experiments-as-research-validation/fulltext">a viewpoint by Jeffrey Ullman</a>.)<br/><br/><br/></div>

    <title>TR20-096 |  On the asymptotic complexity of sorting | 

	Igor Sergeev</title>
    <summary>We investigate the number of pairwise comparisons sufficient to sort $n$ elements chosen from a linearly ordered set. This number is shown to be $\log_2(n!) + o(n)$ thus improving over the previously known upper bounds of the form $\log_2(n!) + \Theta(n)$. The new bound is achieved by the proposed group insertion sorting algorithm.</summary>

    <title>TR20-095 |  On Basing Auxiliary-Input Cryptography on NP-hardness via Nonadaptive Black-Box Reductions | 

	Mikito Nanashima</title>
    <summary>A black-box (BB) reduction is a central proof technique in theoretical computer science. However, the limitations on BB reductions have been revealed for several decades, and the series of previous work gives strong evidence that we should avoid a nonadaptive BB reduction to base cryptography on NP-hardness (e.g., Akavia et al., 2006). Then should we also give up such a familiar proof technique even for an intermediate step towards cryptography?

In this paper, we continue to explore the capability of nonadaptive BB reductions and extend our knowledge on such a central technique out of the current (worst-to-average) framework. In particular, we investigate the attempt to base weaker cryptographic notions allowed to take auxiliary-input via nonadaptive BB reductions. As a result, we prove the following theorems: (1) if we base an auxiliary-input pseudorandom generator (AIPRG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses; (2) if we base an auxiliary-input one-way function (AIOWF) or auxiliary-input hitting set generator (AIHSG) on NP-hardness via a nonadaptive BB reduction, then an (i.o.-)one-way function also exists based on NP-hardness (via an adaptive BB reduction).

The first result gives new evidence that nonadaptive BB reductions are insufficient to base AIPRG. The second result also yields a weaker but still surprising consequence of nonadaptive BB reductions, that is, a one-way function based on NP-hardness. In fact, the second result is interpreted as the following two opposite ways. Pessimistically, it shows that basing AIOWF or AIHSG via nonadaptive BB reductions is harder than constructing a one-way function based on NP-hardness, which can be regarded as a negative result. Note that AIHSG is a weak primitive implied even by the hardness of learning; thus, this pessimistic view gives conceptually stronger limitations than the currently known limitations on nonadaptive BB reductions. Optimistically, our result gives a new hope: a breakthrough construction of auxiliary-input primitives might also be useful to construct standard cryptographic primitives. This optimistic view enhances the significance of further investigation on constructing auxiliary-input or other intermediate cryptographic primitives instead of standard cryptographic primitives.</summary>

    <title>An equilibrium in nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>While there has been incredible progress in convex and nonconvex minimization, a multitude of problems in ML today are in need of efficient algorithms to solve min-max optimization problems. 
 Unlike minimization, where algorithms can always be shown to converge to some local minimum, there is no notion of a local equilibrium in min-max optimization that exists for general nonconvex-nonconcave functions.
    In two recent papers, we give  two notions of local equilibria that are guaranteed to exist and efficient algorithms to compute them.
In this post we present the key ideas behind a second-order notion of local min-max equilibrium from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> and in the next we will talk about a different notion along with the algorithm and show its implications to GANs from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12376">this paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="min-max-optimization">Min-max optimization</h2>

<p>Min-max optimization of an objective function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$</p>



<p>is a powerful framework in optimization, economics, and ML as it allows one to model learning in the presence of multiple agents with competing objectives.
In ML applications, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">GANs</a> and <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org">adversarial robustness</a>, the min-max objective function may be nonconvex-nonconcave.
We know that min-max optimization is at least as hard as minimization, hence, we cannot hope to find a globally optimal solution to min-max problems for general functions.</p>

<h2 id="approximate-local-minima-for-minimization">Approximate local minima for minimization</h2>

<p>Let us first revisit the special case of minimization, where there is a natural notion of an approximate second-order local minimum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$x$ is a second-order $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ if
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now suppose we just wanted to minimize a function $\mathcal{L}$, and we start from any point which is <em>not</em> at an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of $\mathcal{L}$.
Then we can always find a direction to travel in along which either $\mathcal{L}$ decreases rapidly, or the second derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ is large.
 By searching in such a direction we can easily find a new point which has a smaller value of $\mathcal{L}$ using only local information about the gradient and Hessian of $\mathcal{L}$.
 This means that we can keep decreasing $\mathcal{L}$ until we reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum (see <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Boris_Polyak2/publication/220589612_Cubic_regularization_of_Newton_method_and_its_global_performance/links/09e4150dd2f0320879000000/Cubic-regularization-of-Newton-method-and-its-global-performance.pdf">Nesterov and Polyak</a>,  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3055399.3055464">here</a>,  <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Ge15.pdf">here</a>,  and also an earlier <a href="https://www.offconvex.org/2016/03/22/saddlepoints">blog post</a> for how to do this with only access to gradients of $\mathcal{L}$).
 If $\mathcal{L}$ is Lipschitz smooth and bounded, we will reach an $\varepsilon$-local minimum in polynomial time from any starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there an analogous definition with similar properties for min-max optimization?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="problems-with-current-local-optimality-notions">Problems with current local optimality notions</h2>
<p>There has been much recent work on extending theoretical results in nonconvex minimization to min-max optimization (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00331">here</a>, <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9430-efficient-algorithms-for-smooth-minimax-optimization">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02629.pdf">here</a>,  <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9631-solving-a-class-of-non-convex-min-max-games-using-iterative-first-order-methods.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07512">here</a>.
One way to extend the notion of local minimum to the min-max setting is to seek a solution point called a “local saddle”–a point $(x,y)$ where 1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x, \cdot)$ and 2) $x$ is a local minimum for $f(\cdot, y).$</p>

<p>For instance,
 this is used  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08500">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.00838.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10461.pdf">here</a>, and <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/adolphs19a.html">here</a>.
But, there are very simple examples of two-dimensional bounded functions where a local saddle does not exist.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, consider $f(x,y) = sin(x+y)$ from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">here</a>. Check that none of the points on this function are simultaneously a local minimum for $x$ and local maximum for $y$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that no local saddle exists may be surprising, since an $\varepsilon$-global solution to a min-max optimization problem <em>is</em> guaranteed to exist as long as the objective function is uniformly bounded.
Roughly, this is because, in a global min-max setting, the max-player is empowered to globally maximize the function $f(x,\cdot)$, and the min-player is empowered to minimize the “global max” function $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$.</p>

<p>The ability to compute the global max  allows the min-player to  predict the max-player’s response.
If $x$ is a global minimum of $\max_y(f(x, \cdot))$, the min-player is aware of this fact and will have no incentive to update $x$.
On the other hand, if the min-player can only simulate the max-player’s updates locally (as in local saddle),
then the min-player may try to update her strategy even when it leads to a net increase in $f$.
This can happen because the min-player is not powerful enough to accurately simulate the max-player’s response. (See  a  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00618">related notion</a> of local optimality with similar issues due to vanishingly small updates.)</p>

<p>The fact that players who can only make local predictions are
unable to predict their opponents’ responses can lead to convergence problems in many popular algorithms such as<br/>
gradient descent ascent (GDA). This non-convergence behavior can occur if the function has no local saddle point (e.g. the function $sin(x+y)$  mentioned above), and can even happen on some functions, like $f(x,y) = xy$ which do have a local saddle point.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/GDA_spiral_fast.gif"/>
<br/>
<b>Figure 1.</b> GDA spirals off to infinity from almost every starting point on the objective function $f(x,y) = xy$. 
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<h2 id="greedy-max-a-computationally-tractable-alternative-to-global-max">Greedy max: a computationally tractable alternative to global max</h2>

<p>To allow for a more stable min-player, and a more stable notion of local optimality, we would like to empower the min-player to more effectively simulate the max-player’s response. 
While the notion of global min-max does exactly this by having the min-player compute the global max function $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, computing the global maximum may be intractable.</p>

<p>Instead, we replace the global max function $\max_y (f(\cdot ,y))$ with a computationally tractable alternative. 
Towards this end, we restrict the max-player’s response, and the min-player’s simulation of this response, to updates which can be computed using any algorithm from a class of second-order optimization algorithms.
More specifically, we restrict the max-player to updating $y$ by traveling along continuous paths which start at the current value of $y$ and along which either $f$ is increasing or the second derivative of $f$ is positive.  We refer to such paths as greedy paths since they model a class of second-order “greedy” optimization algorithms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy path:</strong> A unit-speed path $\varphi:[0,\tau] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ is greedy if $f$ is non-decreasing over this path, and for every $t\in[0,\tau]$
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roughly speaking, when restricted to updates obtained from greedy paths, the max-player will always be able to reach a point which is an approximate local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$, although there may not be a greedy path which leads the max-player to a global maximum.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_region_omega_t.png" style="width: 400px;"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/global_max_path_no_axes_t.png" style="width: 400px;"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 2.</b> <i>Left:</i> The light-colored region $\Omega$ is reachable from the initial point $A$ by a greedy path; the dark region is not reachable. <i>Right:</i> There is always a greedy path from any point $A$ to a local maximum ($B$), but a global maximum ($C$) may not be reachable by any greedy path.
</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To define an alternative to $\max_y(f(\cdot,y))$, we consider the local maximum point with the largest value of $f(x,\cdot)$ attainable from a given starting point $y$ by any greedy path.
We refer to the value of $f$ at this point as the <em>greedy max function</em>, and denote this value by $g(x,y)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Greedy max function:</strong> 
    $g(x,y) = \max_{z \in \Omega} f(x,z),$
where $\Omega$ is points reachable from $y$ by greedy path.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="our-greedy-min-max-equilibrium">Our greedy min-max equilibrium</h2>
<p>We use the greedy max function to define a new second-order notion of local optimality for min-max optimization, which we refer to as a greedy min-max equilibrium.
Roughly speaking, we say that $(x,y)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if 
1) $y$ is a local maximum for $f(x,\cdot)$ (and hence the endpoint of a greedy path), and 
2) if $x$ is a local minimum of the greedy max function $g(\cdot,y)$.</p>

<p>In other words, $x$ is a local minimum of $\max_y f(\cdot, y)$ under the constraint that the maximum is computed only over the set of greedy paths starting at $y$.
Unfortunately, even if $f$ is smooth, the greedy max function may not be differentiable with respect to $x$ and may even be discontinuous.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2_grid_t.png" width="400"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/discontinuity2g_grid_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 3.</b> <i>Left:</i> If we change $x$ from one value $x$ to a very close value $\hat{x}$, the largest value of $f$ reachable by greedy path undergoes a discontinuous change.  <i>Right:</i>  This means the greedy max function $g(x,y)$ is discontinuous in $x$.</div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>This creates a problem, since the definition of $\varepsilon$-local minimum only applies to smooth functions.</p>

<p>To solve this problem we would ideally like to smooth $g$ by convolution with a Gaussian.
Unfortunately, convolution can cause the local minima of a function to “shift”– a point which is a local minimum for $g$ may no longer be a local minimum for the convolved version of $g$ (to see why, try convolving the function $f(x) = x - 3x I(x\leq 0) + I(x \leq 0)$ with a Gaussian $N(0,\sigma^2)$ for any $\sigma&gt;0$).
To avoid this, we instead consider a “truncated” version of $g$, and then convolve this function in the $x$ variable with a Gaussian to obtain our smoothed version of $g$.</p>

<p>This allows us to define a notion of greedy min-max equilibrium.  We say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if $y^\star$ is an approximate local maximum of $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, and $x^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-local minimum of this smoothed version of $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Greedy min-max equilibrium:</b>
$(x^{\star}, y^{\star})$ is a greedy min-max equilibrium if

 
where $S(x,y):= \mathrm{smooth}_x(\mathrm{truncate}(g(x, y))$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any point which is a local saddle point (talked about earlier) also satisifeis our equilibrium conditions. The converse, however, cannot be true as a local saddle point may not always exist. Further, for compactly supported convex-concave functions a point is a greedy min-max equilibrium (in an appropriate sense) if and only if it is a global min-max point. (See Section 7 and Appendix A respectively in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">our paper</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="greedy-min-max-equilibria-always-exist-and-can-be-found-efficiently">Greedy min-max equilibria always exist! (And can be found efficiently)</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12363">this paper</a> we show: A greedy min-max equilibrium is always guaranteed to exist provided that $f$ is uniformly bounded with Lipschitz Hessian. We do so by providing an algorithm which converges to a greedy min-max equilibrium, and, moreover, we show that it is able to do this in polynomial time from any initial point:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Main theorem:</b> Suppose that we are given access to a smooth function $f:\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and to its gradient and Hessian.  And suppose that $f$ is unformly bounded by $b&gt;0$ and has $L$-Lipschitz Hessian.
Then given any initial point, our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-greedy min-max equilibrium $(x^\star,y^\star)$ of $f$ in $\mathrm{poly}(b, L, d, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a number of difficulties that our algorithm and proof must overcome:
One difficulty in designing an algorithm is that the greedy max function may be discontinuous. 
To find an approximate local minimum of a discontinuous function, our algorithm combines a Monte-Carlo hill climbing algorithm with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0408007">zeroth-order optimization version</a> of stochastic gradient descent.
Another difficulty is that, while one can easily compute a greedy path from any starting point, there may be many different greedy paths which end up at different local maxima.
Searching for the greedy path which leads to the local maximum point with the largest value of $f$ may be infeasible.
In other words the greedy max function $g$ may be intractable to compute.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt="" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/greedy_paths_no_axes_t.png" width="400"/> 
<br/>
 <b>Figure 4.</b>There are many different greedy paths that start at the same point $A$.  They can end up at different local maxima ($B$, $D$), with different values of $f$.  In many cases it may be intractable to search over all these paths to compute the greedy max function.
 </div>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To get around this problem, rather than computing the exact value of $g(x,y)$, we instead compute a lower bound $h(x,y)$ for the greedy max function. Since we are able to obtain this lower bound by computing only a <em>single</em> greedy path, it is much easier to compute than greedy max function.</p>

<p>In our paper, we prove that if 1) $x^\star$ is an approximate local minimum for the this lower bound $h(\cdot, y^\star)$, and  2) $y^\star$ is a an approximate local maximum for $f(x^\star, \cdot)$, then $x^\star$ is also an approximate local minimum for the greedy max $g(\cdot, y^\star)$.
This allows us to design an algorithm which obtains a greedy min-max point by minimizing the computationally tractable lower bound $h$, instead of the greedy max function which may be intractable to compute.</p>

<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>

<p>In this post we have shown how to extend a notion of second-order equilibrium for minimization to min-max optimization which is guaranteed to exist for any function which is bounded and Lipschitz, with Lipschitz gradient and Hessian.
We have also shown that our algorithm is able to find this equilibrium in  polynomial time from any initial point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our results do not require any additional assumptions such as convexity, monotonicity, or sufficient bilinearity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In an upcoming blog post we will show how one can use some of the ideas from here to obtain a new min-max optimization algorithm with applications to stably training GANs.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-094 |  Is it possible to improve Yao’s XOR lemma using reductions that exploit the efficiency of their oracle? | 

	Ronen Shaltiel</title>
    <summary>Yao's XOR lemma states that for every function $f:\set{0,1}^k \ar \set{0,1}$, if $f$ has hardness $2/3$ for $P/poly$ (meaning that for every circuit $C$ in $P/poly$, $\Pr[C(X)=f(X)] \le 2/3$ on a uniform input $X$), then the task of computing $f(X_1) \oplus \ldots \oplus f(X_t)$ for sufficiently large $t$ has hardness $\half +\epsilon$ for $P/poly$.

Known proofs of this lemma cannot achieve $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k^{\omega(1)}}$, and even for $\epsilon=\frac{1}{k}$, we do not know how to replace
$P/poly$ by AC$^0[\textsc{parity}]$ (the class of constant depth circuits with the gates $\set{\textsc{and,or,not,parity}}$ of unbounded fan-in).

Recently, Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola (FOCS 2018) (building on a sequence of earlier works) showed that these limitations cannot be circumvented by \emph{black-box reductions}. Namely, by reductions $\Red^{(\cdot)}$ that given oracle access to a function $D$ that violates the conclusion of Yao's XOR lemma, implement a circuit that violates the assumption of Yao's XOR lemma.

There are a few known reductions in the related literature on worst-case to average case reductions that are \emph{non-black box}. Specifically, the reductions of Gutfreund, Shaltiel and Ta Shma (Computational Complexity 2007) and  Hirahara (FOCS 2018)) are ``class reductions'' that are only guaranteed to succeed when given oracle access to an oracle $D$ from some efficient class of algorithms. These works seem to circumvent some black-box impossibility results.

In this paper we extend the previous limitations of Grinberg, Shaltiel and Viola to class reductions, giving evidence that class reductions cannot yield the desired improvements in Yao's XOR lemma.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first limitation on reductions for hardness amplification that applies to class reductions.

Our technique imitates the previous lower bounds for black-box reductions, replacing the inefficient oracle used in that proof, with an efficient one that is based on limited independence, and developing tools to deal with the technical difficulties that arise following this replacement.</summary>

<p/><hr/><p/>



<p>This morning, like many others, I woke up to the terrible news that Scott Alexander—the man I call “the greatest Scott A. of the Internet”—has <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">deleted SlateStarCodex in its entirety</a>.  The reason, Scott explains, is that the <em>New York Times</em> was planning to run an article about SSC.  Even though the article was going to be <em>positive</em>, NYT decided that by policy, it would need to include Scott’s real surname (Alexander is his middle name).  Scott felt that revealing his name to the world would endanger himself and his psychiatry patients.  Taking down his entire blog was the only recourse that he saw.</p>



<p>The NYT writer, Cade Metz, was someone who I’d previously known and trusted from his reporting on Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.  So in recent weeks, I’d spent a couple hours on the phone with Cade, answering his questions about the rationality community, the history of my interactions with it, and why I thought SlateStarCodex spoke to so many readers.  Alas, when word got around the rationality community that Cade was writing a story, a huge panic arose that he was planning on some sort of <em>Gawker</em>-style hit piece or takedown.  Trying to tamp down the fire, I told Scott Alexander and others that I knew Cade, his intentions were good, he was only trying to understand the community, and everyone should help him by talking to him openly.</p>



<p>In a year of historic ironies, here’s another one: that it was the decent, reasonable, and well-meaning Cade Metz, rather than any of the SneerClubbers or Twitter-gangsters who despised Scott Alexander for sharing his honest thoughts on hot-button issues, who finally achieved the latter’s dark dream of exiling Scott from the public sphere.</p>



<p>The recent news had already been bad enough: Trump’s “temporary suspension” of J1 and H1B visas (which will deal a body blow to American universities this year, and to all the foreign scientists who planned to work at them), on top of the civil unrest, on top of the economic collapse, on top of the now-resurgent coronavirus.  But with no more SlateStarCodex, now I <em>really</em> feel like my world is coming to an end.</p>



<p>I’ve considered SSC to be the best blog on the Internet since not long after discovering it five years ago.  Of course my judgment is colored by one of the most notorious posts in SSC’s history (“Untitled”) being a ferocious defense of me, when thousands were attacking me and it felt like my life was finished.  But that’s merely what brought me there in the first place.  I stayed because of Scott’s insights about everything else, and because of the humor and humanity and craftsmanship of his prose.  Since then I had the privilege to become friends with Scott, not only virtually but in real life, and to meet dozens of others in the SSC community, in its Bay Area epicenter and elsewhere.</p>



<p>In my view, for SSC to be <em>permanently</em> deleted would be an intellectual loss on the scale of, let’s say, John Stuart Mill or Mark Twain burning their collected works.  That might sound like hyperbole, but not (I don’t think) to the tens of thousands who read Scott’s essays and fiction, particularly during their 2013-2016 heyday, and who went from casual enjoyment to growing admiration to the gradual recognition that they were experiencing, “live,” the works that future generations of teachers will assign their students when they cover the early twenty-first century.  The one thing that mitigates this tragedy is the hope that it will yet be reversed (and, of course, the fact that backups still exist in the bowels of the Internet).</p>



<p>When I discovered Scott Alexander in early 2015, the one issue that gave me pause was his strange insistence on maintaining pseudonymity, even as he was already then becoming more and more of a public figure.  In effect, Scott was trying to erect a firewall between his Internet persona and his personal and professional identities, and was <em>relying on the entire world’s goodwill</em> not to breach that firewall.  I thought to myself, “this can’t <em>possibly</em> last!  Scott simply writes too well to evade mainstream notice forever—and once he’s on the world’s radar, he’ll need to make a choice, about who he is and whether he’s ready to own his gifts to posterity under his real name.”  In retrospect, what astonishes me is that Scott has been able to maintain the “double life” for as long as he has!</p>



<p>In his takedown notice, Scott writes that it’s considered vitally important in psychiatry for patients to know almost nothing about their doctors, beyond their names and their areas of expertise.  That caused me to wonder: OK, but doesn’t the world already have enough psychiatrists who are ciphers to their patients?  Would it be so terrible to have one psychiatrist with a clear public persona—possibly even one who patients sought out <em>because</em> of his public persona, because his writings gave evidence that he’d have sympathy or insight about their conditions?  To become a psychiatrist, does one really need to take a lifelong vow of boringness—a vow never to do or say anything notable enough that one would be “outed” to one’s patients?  What would Freud, or Jung, or any of the other famous therapist-intellectuals of times past have thought about such a vow?</p>



<p>Scott also mentions that he’s gotten death threats, and harassing calls to his workplace, from people who hate him because of his blog (and who found his real name by sleuthing).  I wish I knew a solution to that.  For what it’s worth, my blogging has <em>also</em> earned me a death threat, and threats to sue me, and accusatory letters to the president of my university—although in my case, the worst threats came neither from Jew-hating neo-Nazis nor from nerd-bashing SJWs, but from crackpots enraged that I wouldn’t use my blog to credit their proof of P≠NP or their refutation of quantum mechanics.</p>



<p>When I started <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> back in 2005, I remember thinking: this is it.  From now on, the only secrets I’ll have in life will be ephemeral and inconsequential ones.  From this day on, every student in my class, every prospective employer, every woman who I ask on a date (I wasn’t married yet), can know whatever they want to know about my political sympathies, my deepest fears and insecurities, any of it, with a five-second Google search.  Am I ready for that?  I decided that I was—partly just because I‘ve never had the mental space to maintain multiple partitioned identities <em>anyway</em>, to remember what each one is or isn’t allowed to know and say!  I won’t pretend that this is the right decision for everyone, but it was my decision, and I stuck with it, and it wasn’t always easy but I’m still here and so evidently are you.</p>



<p>I’d be <em>overjoyed</em> if Scott Alexander were someday to reach a place in his life where he felt comfortable deciding similarly.  That way, not only could he enjoy the full acclaim that he’s earned for what he’s given to the world, but (much more importantly) his tens of thousands of fans would be able to continue benefitting from his insights.</p>



<p>For now, though, the brute fact is that Scott is obviously <em>not</em> comfortable making that choice.  That being so, it seems to me that, if the NYT was able to respect the pseudonymity of Banksy and many others who it’s reported on in the past, when revealing their real names would serve no public interest, then it should also be able to respect Scott Alexander’s pseudonymity.  Especially now that Scott has sent the most credible signal imaginable of how much he values that pseudonymity, a signal that astonished even me.  The world does not exist only to serve its rare geniuses, but surely it can make such trivial concessions to them.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-093 |  Reduction From Non-Unique Games To Boolean Unique Games | 

	Dana Moshkovitz, 

	Ronen Eldan</title>
    <summary>We reduce the problem of proving a "Boolean Unique Games Conjecture" (with gap $1-\delta$ vs. $1-C\delta$, for any $C&gt; 1$, and sufficiently small $\delta&gt;0$) to the problem of proving a PCP Theorem for a certain non-unique game.
In a previous work, Khot and Moshkovitz suggested an inefficient candidate reduction (i.e., without a proof of soundness). 
The current work is the first to provide an efficient reduction along with a proof of soundness. 
The non-unique game we reduce from is similar to non-unique games for which PCP theorems are known.
Our proof relies on a new concentration theorem for functions in Gaussian space that are restricted to a random hyperplane. We bound the typical Euclidean distance between the low degree part of the restriction of the function to the hyperplane and the restriction to the hyperplane of the low degree part of the function.</summary>

    <title>The Uncanny Valley of Virtual Conferences</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We wrapped up two amazing days of <a href="http://www.l4dc.org/">L4DC 2020</a> last Friday. It’s pretty wild to watch this community grow so quickly: starting as a <a href="https://kgatsis.github.io/learning_for_control_workshop_CDC2018/">workshop</a> at <a href="https://kgatsis.github.io/learning_for_control_workshop_CDC2018/">CDC 2018</a>, the conference organizers put together an <a href="https://l4dc.mit.edu/">inaugural event at MIT</a> in only a few months and were overwhelmed by nearly 400 attendees. Based on a groundswell of support from the participants, we decided to add contributed talks and papers this year. We had passionate volunteers for our <a href="https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/l4dc/organizers-pc">70-person program committee</a>, and they did heroic work of reviewing 135 submissions for this year’s program.</p>

<p>Then, of course, the pandemic hit forcing us to cancel our in-person event. As most conferences in a similar situation as ours, we decided to move to a virtual setting. I think that had we not had contributed papers, we would have simply canceled this year (I’ll return to this later). But to respect the passion and hard-work of our contributors, we tried to come up with a reasonable plan for running this conference virtually.</p>

<p>When we started planning to go virtual, there were too many options to sort through: Zoom webinars and breakout rooms? Sli.do Q&amp;As? Google Hangouts? Slack channels? We had so many tools for virtual community building, each with their own pluses and minuses. Our main constraints were that we wanted to highlight the best contributed papers as talks in some way, to give visibility to the wonderful set of accepted papers without burdening the authors with more work, to be inclusive to the broader community of folks interested in learning and automation, and, importantly, to not charge registration fees.</p>

<p>We eventually settled on the following scheme:</p>
<ol>
  <li>We had a Zoom room for invited and contributed speakers and moderators.</li>
  <li>This Zoom was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sJb1k9dVY">live streamed to Youtube</a>.</li>
  <li>Questions were gathered by grad student moderators who scanned the YouTube live chat and then relayed inquiries back to the speakers.</li>
  <li>We tried to keep the live part under four hours per day and to provide ample breaks. We recognize how hard it is to sit in front of a live stream for much more than that.</li>
  <li>Further discussion was then done on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=L4DC.org/2020/Conference">OpenReview</a>, where we hosted all accepted papers of the conference.</li>
  <li>The proceedings of the conference were subsequently archived by <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/">Proceedings of Machine Learning Research</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Though it took a lot of work to tie all these pieces together, everything went super smoothly in the end. I was basically able to run the entire AV setup from my garage.</p>

<p class="center"><img alt="where the magic happens" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/command_station.jpg" width="250px"/></p>

<p>The only thing that cost money here was the Zoom account (20 dollars/month, though subsidized by Berkeley) and my home internet connection. I know that Zoom and YouTube have well documented issues, and I think it’s imperative that they continue to strive to fix these problems, but I also think it’s easy to forget how empowering this technology is. This format opens up conferences to those who can’t travel for financial or logistical reasons, and lowers the energy to engage with cutting edge research. Being able to sit in my garage and run a virtual conference with speakers spanning 10 time zones and nearly 2000 viewers is a wonder of modern times.</p>

<h2 id="second-life-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">Second Life still has a long way to go.</h2>

<p>There are still many parts of the online conference that felt cheated and incomplete. I still don’t know how to run a virtual poster session effectively. Most of our papers have not yet received any comments on <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=L4DC.org/2020/Conference">OpenReview</a>, though comments are still open and I’d encourage you to drop by and ask questions! Partially, I think this lack of engagement stems from the considerable amount of effort required to participate, especially when it is compared to somewhat aimlessly ambling through a poster session.</p>

<p>Indeed, many aspects of live conferences are simply not replicable with our current tools, whether they be chance encounters or meetings with friends from far away. On the other hand, maybe we shouldn’t try to replicate this experience! Maybe we need to think harder about what opportunities our technology has for building communities and how we can better support these facets of academic interaction. When I think back on the decades of conferences I’ve attended, I can think of only a few posters that really got me interested in reading a paper, and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3323-the-tradeoffs-of-large-scale-learning.pdf">one later won a test of time award at NeurIPS</a>. Poster sessions always felt like an anachronistic means to justify a work travel expense rather than an effective means of academic knowledge dissemination. Is there a better way forward that uses our current technological constraints to amplify the voices of young scholars with cutting edge ideas? I don’t have great ideas for how to do this yet, but new interaction structures may emerge as we deal with at least one more year without meetings with hundreds of people.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-should-conferences-cost">How much should conferences cost?</h2>

<p>We were able to do L4DC, with the proceedings and all, for free. Obviously, the program committee put in tons of work in reviewing and organizing the logistics. But reviewing labor isn’t compensated by any conference. All peer reviewed conferences rely on the volunteer service labor of a dedicated program committee. The main line items we expected for L4DC were for renting physical space, paying an AV crew, and food. But in the virtual world, these expenses drop to near zero.</p>

<p>I’m supposed to give a plenary talk at the <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/">Virtual IFAC Congress</a> in July. I have to say, I am troubled: IFAC is charging <a href="https://www.ifac2020.org/registration/">380 euros per person</a> for registration. What does one get for this sum? Access to video streams and the ability to publish papers. This seems exorbitantly expensive. Why would anyone watch a talk I give at IFAC when I promise to just release it on YouTube at the same time? What value is IFAC providing back to the academic community?</p>

<h2 id="decoupling-papers-from-talks">Decoupling papers from talks</h2>

<p>One of the main things the registration fee at many conferences provides is a stamp of academic approval. It is a de facto publication fee. Led by computer science, conferences in engineering are replacing journals as the archives where CV-building work is cataloged. Though this wasn’t the initial purpose of conferences in computer science, conferences do have many attractive features over journals for rapidly evolving fields: Conferences have speedy turn-around times and clearly delineated submission and decision dates. This archival aspect of conferences, however, has nothing to do with community building or scholarly dissemination. Why do we need to couple a talk to a publication? Can’t we separate these two as is done in every other academic field?</p>

<p>Our collective pandemic moment gives us an opportunity not only to rethink community-building but also our publication model. With 10000-person mega-conferences like <a href="http://icml.cc">AI Summer</a> and <a href="http://neurips.cc">AI Winter</a>, why can’t we keep all of the deadlines the same but remove all of the talks? We’d still have the same reviewing architecture, which has been wholly virtual for over a decade. And we could still publish all of the proceedings online for free, which has been done for multiple decades.</p>

<p>The decoupling proposal here would have effectively zero overhead on our communities: the deadlines, CMTs, program committees, and proceedings could all function exactly the same way (though, to be fair, these systems all have warts worth improving upon). New archival, fast-turnaround journals could easily start using the same tools. Indeed, I’ve always been enamored with the idea of an arxiv-overlay journal that simply is a table of contents that points towards particular versions of arxiv papers as “accepted.” And a really radical idea would be to solicit <em>talks</em>—not papers—for virtual conferences where potential speakers would submit slides or videos to demonstrate proficiency in the medium in which they’d present.</p>

<p>I tend to dismiss most of the bloviation about how coronavirus permanently changes everything about how we live our lives. But it does provide us an opportunity to pause and assess whether current systems are functioning well. I’d argue that the current conference system hasn’t been functioning well for a while, but this simple decoupling of papers and talks might clear up a lot of the issues currently facing the hard-charging computing world.</p>

<p><em>Many thanks to my dedicated, passionate L4DC Co-organizers: Alex Bayen, Ali Jadbababie, George Pappas, Pablo Parrilo, Claire Tomlin, and Melanie Zeilinger. I’d also like to thank Rediet Abebe, Jordan Ellenberg, Eric Jonas, Angjoo Kanazawa, Adam Klivans, Nik Matni, Chris Re, and Tom Ristenpart for their helpful feedback on this post.</em></p></div>

    <title>Subpract</title>
    <summary>I’ve written here before about subtraction games, two-player games in which the players remove tokens from a pile of tokens, the number of removed tokens is required to belong to a designated subtraction set, and the goal is to make the last move. For instance, subtract a square, a game I studied at FUN 2018, is of this type, with the subtraction set being the square numbers.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’ve <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/04/18/subtraction-games.html">written here before</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction_game">subtraction games</a>, two-player games in which the players remove tokens from a pile of tokens, the number of removed tokens is required to belong to a designated <em>subtraction set</em>, and the goal is to make the last move. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtract_a_square">subtract a square</a>, a game <a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.FUN.2018.20">I studied at FUN 2018</a>, is of this type, with the subtraction set being the square numbers.</p>

<p>At some point in studying these games I also briefly looked at the subtraction game whose subtraction set is the set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_number">practical numbers</a>, the numbers whose sums of divisors include all values up to the given numbers. The sequence of these numbers begins</p>



<p>and it turns out to be important here that, after the first one, they’re all even. Let’s call the subtraction game with this subtraction set <em>subpract</em>.</p>

<p>For a subtraction game, or more generally any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_game">impartial game</a>, the game states can be partitioned into -positions (where the player who played previously is winning with optimal play) and -positions (where the next player to move can force a win); the -positions tend to be rarer than the -positions, and it’s important to know where they are because the optimal strategy in the game is to move to a -position whenever possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://oeis.org/A275432">OEIS A275432</a> lists the -positions for subpract. They are:</p>



<p>For instance, it’s a winning move in subpract to move to a pile of ten tokens (if you can), because  whatever move your opponent makes from there lets you win. If your opponent takes an even number of tokens, you will be able to take all the remaining tokens and win immediately. And if your opponent takes one token, leaving a pile of nine tokens, you can win by taking six more and leaving a pile of three tokens. Then, regardless of how your opponent responds, you will be able to take all the tokens on your next move.</p>

<p>An obvious pattern jumps out from this list of -positions: they come in pairs, spaced three apart. More precisely, an even number  is a -position if and only if the odd number  is a -position. It’s not just a coincidence, true at the start of the sequence and then false later on: it carries on throughout the entire sequence of -positions. More strongly, this same three-apart pairing of  -positions holds for any subtraction game whose subtraction set contains <span style="white-space: nowrap;">, , and ,</span> and does not contain any other odd numbers.</p>

<h1 id="proof-of-the-pairing-property">Proof of the pairing property</h1>

<p>To prove this, I need to show that  is a -position if and only if  is a winning position. We can prove this by induction, where we assume that all the -positions below  and  are paired up in the same way, and use it to prove that the same pairing holds for  and . The basic idea of the proof is to assume that one of the two players has a winning strategy for the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">position ,</span> and to copy that strategy for , most of the time playing the same moves and responses that you would play for the smaller position. Whenever a sequence of moves is applicable to both  and  and preserves the parity of the starting position, the induction hypothesis shows that it has the same outcome for both starting positions. However, there are a few cases where you may be forced to deviate from this strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If  is an -position, but its winning move is to subtract one token leading to an odd -position , then copying that move from the starting position  would lead to the position  which may not be a -position. Instead you should subtract four tokens to get to the position  directly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If  is a -position, and you’re trying to copy its winning strategy in the position , your opponent may be able to subtract , a move that is not possible in , so you have no response to copy. But in this case the result is a pile of just one token, from which you can immediately win.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Again, if you’re trying to copy the winning strategy for -position  in the position , your opponent may subtract only one token. In this case, the winning response when starting from  might be to subtract an even number, leading to an odd -position . If you copy this response, you will end up at  which may not be a -position. But instead of copying the -strategy, you can simply subtract two tokens, leading to the position  itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly, it may be the case that the winning response to an opponent’s even move from  is to take a single token, leading to odd -position . Copying this strategy from the starting position  would again lead to . But in this case you can subtract four tokens leading to  again.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s tempting to guess that, more strongly than pairing -positions and -positions in this way, subpract and similar subtraction games have a pairing of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague%E2%80%93Grundy_theorem">nim-values</a>, where the nim-value of an odd position always equals the nim-value of the even position three units smaller. But it’s not true. For instance, in subpract, a pile of four tokens has nim-value 1 while a pile of seven tokens has nim-value 4.</p>

<h1 id="other-subtraction-sets">Other subtraction sets</h1>

<p>Probably the most obvious choice of another subtraction set that begins  and has no larger odd numbers would be the powers of two, but they don’t give rise to an interesting subtraction game: the -positions are just the multiples of three. The same thing happens whenever there are no multiples of three in the subtraction set, as happens for instance with the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/06/21/Telephone number (mathematics)">telephone numbers</a> and <a href="http://oeis.org/A003422">left factorials</a>.</p>

<p>Another natural subtraction set to which this theory applies is the sequence of <a href="http://oeis.org/A025487">Hardy–Ramanujan integers (A025487)</a>, the numbers whose prime factorization  has a non-increasing sequence of exponents . They are:</p>



<p>These are a subset of the practical numbers so one would expect their subtraction game to have more-dense -positions. My implementation found that these -positions are:</p>



<p>again obeying the offset-by-three pairing as it should, and otherwise having somewhat irregular intervals between its -positions.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://oeis.org/A000084">enumeration function of the series-parallel graphs and the cographs</a> is even after its first term because of series-parallel duality; it begins</p>



<p>These are not all practical; for instance, 10, 1532, and 43930 are not practical. The sequence of -positions for their subtraction game begins</p>



<p>mostly differing by three between consecutive values but with occasional glitches where the larger multiple-of-three subtraction set values kick in.</p>

<p>And finally, if we subtract numbers that are one less than a prime, we get the subtraction set</p>



<p>and the sequence of -positions</p>



<p>Its small values have many five-unit gaps but that pattern appears to die out after the quadruple of -positions .</p>

Not just for today, but for the summer at least, Ken and I want to share some gossip, share some problems, and ask our readers a question.</p>
<p>
The question first. Ken and I wonder if GLL should start a virtual theory “lunch” meeting, that would meet periodically via Zoom. It would be like meeting for a theory lunch in the old days—just not all in the same room. Some topic might be agreed on, perhaps a short presentation, and always a chance to swap some gossip. Plus maybe ask the group for advice on a problem.</p>
<p>
I do miss the old meetings: </p>

<p>
What do you think? Should we have such meetings?</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Gossip </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The study of gossip feeds into other issues of the spread of information and misinformation during an election year. Ken’s Buffalo colleague Kenny Joseph has <a href="https://kennyjoseph.github.io/">research</a> on the spread of fake news and Twitter sentiment using mathematical tools adjacent to those of the trio above. Ken and I still intend to say more about epidemiology models ourselves when we get time. But no, here by “gossip” we just mean actual pieces of gossip—just as at a conference or other kind of in-person meeting.</p>
<p>
Here are two examples of the kind of gossip we might exchange. </p>
<p>
Anna Gilbert is moving from Michigan math to Yale math and statistics. She will be the John C. Malone Professor of Mathematics, Professor of Statistics &amp; Data Science. Pretty impressive. She was at Michigan math for <img alt="{2^{4}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{4}}"/> years. She told me that she could not wait for the next power of <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/>, and thus had to try a new place, with new challenges. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/gilbert-1.png"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17233" height="163" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/gilbert-1.png?w=127&amp;h=163" width="127"/></a></p>
<p>
Rich DeMillo is a long time friend who is at Georgia Institute of Technology and is not moving. He continues working on making voting fair, secure, and efficient. He is referenced in a recent article on voting issues in Georgia. See <a href="https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-politics/activists-cite-tabulation-flaw-georgia-mail-ballots">here</a> for details. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/demillo-1.jpg"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-17234" height="138" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/demillo-1.jpg?w=149&amp;h=138" width="149"/></a></p>
<p>
Note: we have in mind pleasant and factual gossip. The most useful kind is about probable directions and emphases to make projects attractive to pursue. This leads into our other component.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Possible Problems To Present </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are a problem from each of us as examples of what could be discussed in these meetings and why that might give advantage over just hunting the literature. Both are about factoring—always factoring…</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Factoring: Ken </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
I, Ken, would like to know about field tests of approximative methods in quantum computing, specifically of shortcuts to Shor’s Algorithm. The approximations I have in mind are rougher than those I find in the literature and need not be physically natural.</p>
<p>
To explain, the way Shor’s algorithm is proven correct in Shor’s paper and all textbooks we know—including ours—uses an exact analysis involving the quantum Fourier transform, in which exponentially fine phase angles appear in terms. Approximation can be argued in several ways. Circuits of Hadamard, CNOT, and <img alt="{T}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{T}"/>-gates, in which no phase angle finer than <img alt="{\pi/4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%2F4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi/4}"/> appears, can approximate arbitrary quantum circuits to exponential precision with polynomial overhead. With just Hadamard and Toffoli gates, hence <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> and <img alt="{\pi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi}"/> as the only phases, one can approximate the data returned by measurements in the algorithm, though without approximating the algorithm’s result vectors in complex Hilbert space. There are other ways to approximate those vectors while eliding the finer phase components. We would like to see more attention to the concrete overheads of all these methods.</p>
<p>
What I would really like to discuss, however, is efforts toward more-brusque approximations that could yield new classical attempts on factoring. For a broad example, note that not only does <img alt="{\mathsf{BQP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BBQP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{BQP}}"/> reduce to <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/> but also individual steps in Shor’s algorithm can be broken down as reductions to counting. Now suppose we apply approximate counting heuristics to those steps. The stock answer for why this doesn’t work to approximate quantum measurement properties <em>globally</em> is that those probabilities have the form </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  p = \frac{f_1(x) - f_2(x)}{D} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++p+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bf_1%28x%29+-+f_2%28x%29%7D%7BD%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  p = \frac{f_1(x) - f_2(x)}{D} "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{f_1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_1}"/> and <img alt="{f_2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2}"/> are <img alt="{\mathsf{\#P}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5C%23P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{\#P}}"/> functions and <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> is something like <img alt="{2^{n/2}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2^{n/2}}"/>. Note the knowledge beforehand that <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> is between <img alt="{0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{0}"/> and <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. The point is that <img alt="{D}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{D}"/> is exponential yet smaller than the additive approximations possible in polynomial time for <img alt="{f_1(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_1(x)}"/> and <img alt="{f_2(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_2%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{f_2(x)}"/> individually, so the approximation gives no help to the difference. </p>
<p>
However, this does not prevent using approximations of magnitudes that are not differences at intermediate steps. For a vein of more particular examples, I raise the translation from quantum gates to Boolean formulas in my 2018 <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-56499-8_4">paper</a> with Amlan Chakrabarti and my recent PhD graduate Chaowen Guan. This translation can encode the state <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/> at any intermediate stage of an execution of Shor’s algorithm by a Boolean formula <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. The size of <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> stays linear in the size of the quantum circuit being simulated—the exponential explosion happens only when we try to count solutions to <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/>. The formula <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> encodes all the information in <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/>, including the implicit presence of fine phase angles. Now suppose we alter <img alt="{\phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi}"/> to a <img alt="{\phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi'}"/> whose corresponding <img alt="{\Phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi'}"/> is a simplified approximation of <img alt="{\Phi}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi}"/>. The kicker is that <img alt="{\Phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPhi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Phi'}"/> might not need to be a legal quantum state. The transformations in our paper for later stages of the circuit will still apply building on <img alt="{\phi'}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\phi'}"/>. </p>
<p>
Is there any chance of this working? Heuristic approaches applying SAT to factoring have been tried and found to be <a href="https://toughsat.appspot.com/">tough</a>. The nice site <a href="http://beyondnp.org/">BeyondNP</a> includes <a href="http://beyondnp.org/pages/solvers/model-counters-exact/">links</a> to #SAT counters such as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marcthurley/sharpsat">sharpSAT</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/kautz/Cachet/index.htm">Cachet</a>. Thus we are not asking anything outlandish. Leveraging Shor’s algorithm might be a new approach. Has anyone tried it? That’s the kind of question I would visit a conference to ask, where wider arity might work better than asking people individually. Thus also for raising it in a meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h3> Factoring: Dick </h3><p/>
<p/><p>
I have recently been thinking about the power of weak sub-theories of Peano Arithmetic. There are many proofs known that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. The usual proofs use this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> For all <img alt="{x&gt;1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3E1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x&gt;1}"/> there is some prime <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> that divides <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Given this it is not hard to prove, in many ways, that there are an infinite number of primes. Euclid’s original proof uses it in the step: Let <img alt="{p}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p}"/> divide <img alt="{p_{1}\cdots p_{n} + 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_%7B1%7D%5Ccdots+p_%7Bn%7D+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{p_{1}\cdots p_{n} + 1}"/>. The idea is suppose some weak theory can prove the above. This means that it can prove: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \forall x&gt;1 \ \exists y \ y|x \text{ and } \mathsf{prime}(y). " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cforall+x%3E1+%5C+%5Cexists+y+%5C+y%7Cx+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%5Cmathsf%7Bprime%7D%28y%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \forall x&gt;1 \ \exists y \ y|x \text{ and } \mathsf{prime}(y). "/></p>
<p>	 I believe that this shows that if the theory is weak enough that this implies that factoring is in polynomial time. Is this known? Is it true? </p>
<p>
Once again, we can hunt for literature on this. We can ask individual people, such as Avi Wigderson and various co-authors of his. But our hunch is that this topic was explored in the 1990s without a definitive resolution. It could be more effective to get up to speed on it and share ideas in a meeting.</p>
<p>

Should we start a virtual theory lunch? Would you attend?</p>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Time for a non-depressing post.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a>, which is already available in English and Russian, is about to be published in both Chinese and Japanese.  (So if you read this blog, but have avoided tackling QCSD because your Chinese or Japanese is better than your English, today’s your day!)  To go along with the new editions, Cambridge University Press asked me to write a new foreword, reflecting on what happened in the seven years since the book was published.  The editor, Paul Dobson, kindly gave me permission to share the new foreword on my blog.  So without further ado…</p>



<p/><hr/><p/>



<p><em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> began its life as a course that I taught at the University of Waterloo in 2006.  Seven years later, it became the book that you now hold.  Its preface ended with the following words:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Here’s hoping that, in 2020, this book will be as badly in need of revision as the 2006 lecture notes were in 2013.</p></blockquote>



<p>As I write this, in June 2020, a lot has happened that I would never have predicted in 2013.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States, and is up for reelection shortly.  This is not a political book, so let me resist the urge to comment further.  Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic is ravaging the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people, crashing economies, and shutting down schools and universities (including mine).  And in the past few weeks, protests against racism and police brutality started in America and then spread to the world, despite the danger of protesting during a pandemic.</p>



<p>Leaving aside the state of the world, my own life is also very different than it was seven years ago.  Along with my family, I’ve moved from MIT to the University of Texas in Austin.  My daughter, who was born at almost exactly the same time as <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, is now a first-grader, and is joined by a 3-year-old son.  When my daughter’s school shut down due to the coronavirus, I began home-schooling her in math, computer science, and physics—in some of the exact same topics covered in this book.  I’m now engaged in an experiment to see what portion of this material can be made accessible to a 7-year-old.</p>



<p>But what about the material itself?  How has it held up over seven years?  Both the bad news and the (for you) good news, I suppose, is that it’s <em>not</em> particularly out of date.  The intellectual underpinnings of quantum computing and its surrounding disciplines remain largely as they were.  Still, let me discuss what <em>has</em> changed.</p>



<p>Between 2013 and 2020, the field of quantum computing made a striking transition, from a mostly academic pursuit to a major technological arms race.  The Chinese government, the US government, and the European Union have all pledged billions of dollars for quantum computing research.  Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Alibaba, Intel, and Honeywell also now all have well-funded groups tasked with building quantum computers, or providing quantum-computing-related software and services, or even just doing classical computing that’s “quantum-inspired.”  These giants are joined by dozens of startups focused entirely on quantum computing.</p>



<p>The new efforts vary greatly in caliber; some efforts seem rooted in visions of what quantum computers will be able to help with, and how soon, that I find to be wildly overoptimistic or even irresponsible.  But perhaps it’s always this way when a new technology moves from an intellectual aspiration to a commercial prospect.  Having joined the field around 1999, before there were <em>any</em> commercial efforts in quantum computing, I’ve found the change disorienting.</p>



<p>But while some of the new excitement is based on pure hype—on marketers now mixing some “quantum” into their word-salad of “blockchain,” “deep learning,” etc., with no particular understanding of any of the ingredients—there really have been some scientific advances in quantum computing since 2013, a fire underneath the smoke.</p>



<p>Surely the crowning achievement of quantum computing during this period was the achievement of “quantum supremacy,” which a team at Google announced in the fall of 2019.  For the first time, a programmable quantum computer was used to outperform any classical computer on earth, running any currently known algorithm.  Google’s device, called “Sycamore,” with 53 superconducting qubits cooled to a hundredth of a degree above absolute zero, solved a well-defined albeit probably useless sampling problem in about 3 minutes.  To compare, current state-of-the-art simulations on classical computers need a few days, even with hundreds of thousands of parallel processors.  Ah, but will a better classical simulation be possible?  That’s an open question in quantum complexity!  The discussion of that question draws on theoretical work that various colleagues and I did over the past decade.  That work in turn draws on my so-called <strong>PostBQP</strong>=<strong>PP</strong> theorem from 2004, explained in this book.</p>



<p>In the past seven years, there were also several breakthroughs in quantum computing theory—some of which resolved open problems mentioned in this book. </p>



<p>In 2018, Ran Raz and Avishay Tal gave an oracle relative to which <strong>BQP</strong> (Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time) is not contained in <strong>PH</strong> (the Polynomial Hierarchy).  This solved one of the main open questions, since 1993, about where <strong>BQP</strong> fits in with classical complexity classes, at least in the black-box setting.  (What does that mean?  Read the book!)  Raz and Tal’s proof used a candidate problem that I had defined in 2009 and called “Forrelation.”</p>



<p>Also in 2018, Urmila Mahadev gave a protocol, based on cryptography, by which a polynomial-time quantum computer (i.e., a <strong>BQP</strong> machine) could always prove the results of its computation to a classical polynomial-time skeptic, purely by exchanging classical messages with the skeptic.  Following Urmila’s achievement, I was delighted to give her a $25 prize for solving the problem that I’d announced on my blog back in 2007.</p>



<p>Perhaps most spectacularly of all, in 2020, Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, and Henry Yuen proved that <strong>MIP*</strong>=<strong>RE</strong>.  Here <strong>MIP*</strong> means the class of problems solvable using multi-prover interactive proof systems with quantumly entangled provers (and classical polynomial-time verifiers), while <strong>RE</strong> means Recursively Enumerable: a class that includes not only all the computable problems, but even the infamous halting problem (!).  To say it more simply, <em>entangled provers can convince a polynomial-time verifier that an arbitrary Turing machine halts</em>.  Besides its intrinsic interest, a byproduct of this breakthrough was to answer a decades-old question in pure math, the so-called Connes Embedding Conjecture (by <em>refuting</em> the conjecture).  To my knowledge, the new result represents the first time that quantum computing has reached “all the way up the ladder of hardness” to touch uncomputable problems.  It’s also the first time that non-relativizing techniques, like the ones central to the study of interactive proofs, were ever used in computability theory.</p>



<p>In a different direction, the last seven years have witnessed an astonishing convergence between quantum information and quantum gravity—something that was just starting when <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> appeared in 2013, and that I mentioned as an exciting new direction.  Since then, the so-called “It from Qubit” collaboration has brought together quantum computing theorists with string theorists and former string theorists—experts in things like the black hole information problem—to develop a shared language.  One striking proposal that’s emerged from this is a fundamental role for <em>quantum circuit complexity</em>—that is, the smallest number of 1- and 2-qubit gates needed to prepare a given n-qubit state from the all-0 state—in the so-called AdS/CFT (Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory) correspondence.  AdS/CFT is a duality between physical theories involving different numbers of spatial dimensions; for more than twenty years, it’s been a central testbed for ideas about quantum gravity.  But the duality is extremely nonlocal: a “simple” quantity in the AdS theory, like the volume of a wormhole, can correspond to an incredibly “complicated” quantity in the dual CFT.  The new proposal is that the CFT quantity might be not just complicated, but literally circuit complexity itself.  Fanciful as that sounds, the truth is that no one has come up with any other proposal that passes the same sanity checks.  A related new insight is that the nonlocal mapping between the AdS and CFT theories is not merely analogous to, but literally an example of, a quantum error-correcting code: the same mathematical objects that will be needed to build scalable quantum computers.</p>



<p>When <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> was first published, some people thought it went too far in elevating computer science, and computational complexity in particular, to fundamental roles in understanding the physical world.  But even I wasn’t audacious enough to posit connections like the ones above, which are now more-or-less mainstream in quantum gravity research.</p>



<p>I’m proud that I wrote <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>, but as the years go by, I find that I have no particular desire to revise it, or even reread it.  It seems far better for the book to stand as a record of what I knew and believed and cared about at a certain moment in time.</p>



<p>The intellectual quest that’s defined my life—the quest to wrap together computation, physics, math, and philosophy into some sort of coherent picture of the world—might never end.  But it does need to start somewhere.  I’m honored that you chose <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em> as a place to start or continue your own quest.  I hope you enjoy it.</p>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">(1) To start with some rare good news: I was delighted that the US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 holding led by Chief Justice Roberts (!), struck down the Trump administration’s plan to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals).

<p>(1) To start with some rare good news: I was delighted that the US Supreme Court, in a 5-4 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-587_5ifl.pdf">holding</a> led by Chief Justice Roberts (!), struck down the Trump administration’s plan to end DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Dismantling DACA would’ve been a first step toward deporting 700,000 overwhelmingly blameless and peaceful people from, in many cases, the only homes they remember, for no particular reason other than to slake the resentment of Trump’s base. Better still was the majority’s argument: that when, by law, a federal agency has to supply a <em>reason</em> for a policy change (in this case, ending DACA), its reason can’t just be blatantly invented <em>post facto</em>.</p>



<p>To connect to my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4845">last post</a>: I hope this gives some evidence that, if Trump refuses to accept an electoral loss in November, and if it ends up in the Supreme Court as Bush v. Gore did, then Roberts might once again break from the Court’s other four rightists, in favor of the continued survival of the Republic.</p>



<p>(2) Along with Steven Pinker, Scott Alexander, Sam Altman, Jonathan Haidt, Robert Solovay, and others who might be known to this blog’s readership, I decided after reflection to sign a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/petition-letter-stephen-hsu/home?authuser=0">petition</a> in support of Steve Hsu, a theoretical physicist turned genomics researcher, and the Senior Vice President for Research and Innovation at Michigan State University.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img alt="Information Processing: Hail to the Chief" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dVAprDWO_YI/UzGkunExlkI/AAAAAAAAEq4/MuApiqQsX_I/s1600/photo+(4).JPG"/>Hsu is the one on the right.</figure>



<p>Hsu now faces possible firing, because of a social media campaign apparently started by an MSU grad student and SneerClub poster named Kevin Bird.  What are the <a href="https://twitter.com/GradEmpUnion/status/1270829003130261504">charges</a>?  Hsu appeared in 2017 on an alt-right podcast (albeit, one that Noam Chomsky has also appeared on).  On Hsu’s own podcast, he <a href="https://manifoldlearning.com/episode-010-transcript/">interviewed Ron Unz</a>, who despite Jewish birth has become a <a href="https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/">nutcase Holocaust denier</a>—yet somehow that topic never came up on the podcast.  Hsu said that, as a scientist, he doesn’t know whether group differences in average IQ have a genetic component, but our commitment to anti-racism should never hinge on questions of biology (a view also espoused by Peter Singer, perhaps the leading liberal moral philosopher of our time).  Hsu has championed genomics research that, in addition to medical uses, <em>might someday</em> help enable embryo screening for traits like IQ.  Finally, Hsu supports the continued use of standardized tests in university admissions (yes, that’s one of the listed charges).</p>



<p>Crucially, <strong>it doesn’t matter</strong> for present purposes if you disagree with many of Hsu’s views. The question is more like: <em>is agreement with Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, and other mild-mannered, Obama-supporting thinkers featured in your local airport bookstore now a firing offense in academia?  And will those who affirm that it is, claim in the next breath to be oppressed, marginalized, the Rebel Alliance?</em></p>



<p>To be fair to the cancelers, I think they have two reasonable arguments in their favor.</p>



<p>The first that they’re “merely” asking for Hsu to step down as vice president, not for him to lose his tenured professorship in physics.  Only <em>professors</em>, say the activists, enjoy academic freedom; <em>administrators</em> need to uphold the values and public image of their university, as Larry Summers learned fifteen years ago.  (And besides, we might add, what intellectual iconoclast in their right mind would ever <em>become</em> a university VP, or want to stay one??)  I’d actually be fine with this if I had any confidence that it was going to end here.  But I don’t.  Given the now-enshrined standards—e.g., that professors hold positions of power, and that the powerful can oppress the powerless, or even do violence to them, just by expressing or entertaining thoughts outside an ever-shrinking range—why should Hsu trust any assurances that he’ll be left alone, if he <em>does</em> go back to being a physics professor?  If the SneerClubbers can cancel him, then how long until they cancel Pinker, or Haidt, or me?  (I <em>hope</em> the SneerClubbers enthusiastically embrace those ideas!  If they do, then no one ever again gets to call me paranoid about Red Guards behind every bush.)</p>



<p>The second reasonable argument is that, as far as I can tell, Hsu really did grant undeserved legitimacy to a Holocaust denier, via a friendly interview about other topics on his podcast.  I think it would help if, without ceding a word that he doesn’t believe, Hsu were now to denounce racism, Holocaust denial, and specifically Ron Unz’s flirtation with Holocaust denial in the strongest possible terms, and explain why he didn’t bring the topic up with his guest (e.g., did he not know Unz’s views?).</p></div>

Baeten, Bergstra and Klop had proved that strong bisimilarity is in fact decidable for the BPA calculus even though the class of trace languages for BPA is exactly the class of context-free languages. The result only held for normed BPA processes, that is, processes that could always terminate. Colin was my supervisor in Edinburgh, and he suggested that I try to find a simpler proof of that result (much can be said about the original proof, but simple it was not!). This turned out to be really interesting; I met Didier Caucal from IRISA who had found a nice, much shorter proof that relied on finite characterizations and I was able to use his notion of self-bisimilarity to prove that a tableau system for bisimilarity was sound and complete wrt. bisimilary. Jan Friso Groote, who was a PhD student at the CWI at the time, and myself proved that all other known equivalences are undecidable for normed BPA (and therefore </span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK"><i>a fortiori</i></span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">also for full, unnormed BPA). But one problem that Colin and I were never able to solve was if the decidability result also held for the full BPA calculus.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Søren arrived in Edinburgh in 1990 and we shared a flat there, in St Leonards Bank just across from Holyrood Park. We hung out with the same people in the LFCS, many of whom were clever Italians such as Davide Sangiorgi and clever quasi-Italians such as Marcelo Fiore. It is no surprise that Søren and I often discussed our work or that he, given that Colin was also his supervisor, moved on to study decidability problems as well, the only difference being that Søren was mostly interested in the BPP calculus that has parallel composition instead of sequential composition.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">When I left Edinburgh at the end of August of 1991, Colin and I had managed to make some progress on the decidability problem for unnormed BPA. We realised that a finite characterization of the maximal bisimulation </span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK"><i>á la</i></span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Caucal was the way ahead but the actual characterization escaped us. When I returned for my viva in December, Søren had found an important lemma on finite characterizations and everything fell into place. The decidability result relied on proving that bisimilarity is semi-decidable using the finite characterization; non-bisimilarity was already known to be semi-decidable. </span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">Luca: Both S</span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">ø</span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">ren Christensen and you wrote the award-winning paper as PhD students in Edinburgh.

Robin Milner was still around and busy working on the pi-calculus together with Davide Sangiorgi, who was his student at the time. Watching them at the blackboard was interesting, even though the rest of us often could not follow their discussions! Gordon Plotkin was there (and still is, fortunately). Rod Burstall was still active, and so was Mike Fourman. Plus many, many others. There was always someone to talk to, and it was perfectly legitimate to have an interest in basic research. Unlike the other professors, Colin had no background in maths – he was originally a philosopher! – and maybe that was why he was trying to avoid heavy mathematical lingo, trying to be simple and precise in his writing at the same time. I learned a lot from him, also in that respect.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">After Søren returned to Denmark, he left academia and got a job in the private sector. He still lives near Aarhus. Sadly we lost touch with each other, in all likelihood because our lives turned out so different. We got back in touch recently, when we were told about the reward and we look forward to finally meeting each other again. Colin retired recently, and I really hope to see him again, when I am able to travel to Scotland again some day.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: medium none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">Luca: How much of your later work has built on your award-winning paper?

What is more, the open problems that remained were major challenges. Some were only solved much later (such as the decidability of bisimilarity for pushdown automata, a result due to Sénizergues, the proof later greatly simplified by Colin) or remain open (such as the decidability of weak bisimilarity for BPA). Eventually I drifted down the slippery slope and became interested in other, related topics, and focused somewhat more directly on program properties. The follow-up result that most directly relates to my paper with Søren and Colin is the result from 1994 that bisimilarity is also the only equivalence that is decidable for BPP. This is a result that I am also quite proud of. It grew out of discussions with Javier Esparza and Yoram Hirshfeld, when I was back in Edinburgh for a while in 1993. Ironically, there was a subtle flaw in the proof that Naoki Kobayashi discovered many years later. Naoki and one of his student found out how to repair the proof, and the three of us co-authored the journal version that came out many years later. The reason why Naoki became interested in BPP was that he was trying to use the calculus as a behavioural type system for a pi-calculus. As it happened, this was also the route that I had taken.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Those of my later results that I am most proud of have to do with this area: My work on type systems for psi-calculus (CONCUR 2011 and later) and a session type system for bounded name use in the pi-calculus (Acta Informatica 2019). The latter paper also has a CONCUR connection; it grew out of attending a talk by Roland Meyer at CONCUR 2013 and wondering why they were not trying to characterize notions of name-boundedness in the pi-calculus by means of a type system. It turned out that Meyer et al. were not familiar with type systems at all. It took me an awful long time to work out a type-based characterization (using session types), as you can probably tell.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">As you can tell, I have not worked on bisimulation for quite some time. Not that there is anything wrong with bisimulation, of course, but if one wants results that are applicable for automated reasoning about program behaviour, decidability is important. One can then either choose to go for a less expressive model of computation (which is what researchers in the model checking community do) or keep the model of computation and go for sound, but incomplete characterizations of program properties (which is what researchers interested in type systems and related static analysis methods do). I ended up in the latter camp.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">Luca: To your mind, what are the most interesting or unexpected uses in the literature of the notions and techniques you developed in "Bisimulation Equivalence is Decidable for all Context-Free Processes"? </span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Hans: BPA, BPP and similar process calculi can be used as the basis of behavioural type systems, and I am thrilled that my old research interests and my current research interests are so directly related. </span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">In 2018 I discovered that Vasco Vasconcelos and Peter Thiemann had devised a session type system for a functional programming language in which session types were not regular expressions (which is essentially what they are in the original work by Honda, Kubo and Vasconcelos) but BPA processes. Vasco and Peter knew that type equivalence should be decidable but they were not so familiar with our results from the early 1990s. At POPL 2019 I attended a talk by Andreia Mordido, one of Vasco’s collaborators, and she mentioned our paper from CONCUR 1992! Later that day, I ended up talking to Andreia and Vasco about my work on BPA from all those years ago.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">Luca: The last forty years have seen a huge amount of work on process algebra and process calculi. However, the emphasis on that field of research within concurrency theory seems to have diminished over the last few years, even in Europe. What advice would you give to a young researcher interested in working on process calculi today? </span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Hans: That they should still work on process calculi! There remains a lot of interesting work to be done. One reason why research topics drift in and out of focus is simply that researchers lose interest; it is hardly ever the case that a topic runs out of interesting research questions. Another reason is rather grim: Basic research is nowhere near as well-respected as it used to be. If you look at the funding schemes that we have today, only the very successful few can get funding for basic research; I am not among them and it does get frustrating quite often. Most topics these days deal with applied research. There is nothing wrong with applied research per se; some of what I do is on that side of things, but there has to be more to research than that. </span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: medium none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">Luca: What are the research topics that currently excite you the most?</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK">Hans: I have slowly become more and more interested in programming language theory, and some of my current collaborators have taken a similar route, beginning in concurrency theory, drifting into the world of behavioural type systems and finally wanting to apply all of their skills to actual programming languages. Right now Mario Bravetti, Adrian Francalanza, António Ravara and myself are involved in working on a behavioural type system related to the Mungo tool for a subset of Java. I am fortunately enough to have had three exceptionally clever and productive MSc students involved as well, and this has been extremely helpful. Mungo is in many ways the work of Simon Gay and Ornela Dardha at Glasgow University, and they, too, began their careers working on process calculi.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div><div align="justify" style="border: none; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><br/></div><div align="justify" style="border: medium none; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; padding: 0in; text-decoration: none;"><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="en-US">Luca: You have a keen interest in teaching at university level.

I by far prefer having a dialogue with students that focuses on the problems that they encounter to the monologue style of a lecture. All my teaching activities are now flipped and I am happy to say that some of my colleagues are now thinking along similar lines. It is always good to have someone to talk to. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br/><span style="color: black;"><span><span style="background: transparent;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="da-DK"> </span></span></span></span></span></span></div></div>
