to the recently studied Low Rank Compressive Sensing (LRCS) problem: recover an
nxq low-rank matrix from column-wise linear projections. An important
application where this problem occurs, and a decentralized solution is
desirable is in federated sketching: efficiently compressing the vast amounts
of distributed images/videos generated by smartphones and various other devices
while respecting the users' privacy. Images from different devices, once
grouped by category, are similar and hence the matrix formed by the vectorized
images of a certain category is well-modeled as being low rank. Suppose there
are p nodes (say p smartphones), and each store a subset of the sketches of its
images. We develop a decentralized projected gradient descent (GD) based
approach to jointly reconstruct the images of all the phones/users from their
respective stored sketches. The algorithm is such that the phones/users never
share their raw data but only summaries of this data with the other phones at
each algorithm iteration. Also, the reconstructed images of user g are obtained
only locally. Other users cannot reconstruct them. Only the column span of the
matrix is reconstructed globally. By "decentralized" we mean that there is no
central node to which all nodes are connected and thus the only way to
aggregate the summaries from the various nodes is by use of an iterative
consensus algorithm that eventually provides an estimate of the aggregate at
each node, as long as the network is strongly connected. We validated the
effectiveness of our algorithm via extensive simulation experiments.

    <title>New Computing Model of $GN_eTM$ Turing Machine On Solving Even Goldbach Conjecture</title>

to verify the truth of even Goldbach conjecture, we will deeply discuss this
question and present a new computing model of $G{{N}_{e}}TM$ Turing Machine.
This paper proves the infinite existence of even Goldbach's conjecture and
obtains the following new results:
</p>
<p>1. The criterion of general probability speculation of the existence judgment
for even Goldbach conjecture is studied, and which at least have a formula
satisfy the deduction result of matching requirements for even Goldbach
conjecture in the model $\bmod \overset{\equiv }{\mathop{M}}\,({{N}_{e}})$.
</p>
<p>2. In the controller of the $G{{N}_{e}}TM$ model, the algorithm problem of
the prime matching rule is given, regardless of whether the computer can be
recursively solved, the rule algorithm for designing prime numbers in
controllers is computer recursively solvable.
</p>
<p>3. The judgment problem that about even Goldbach conjecture whether infinite
existence is studied. The new research result has shown that according to the
constitution model of the full arranged matrix of given even number ${N}_{e}$,
and if only given an even number ${N}_{e}$, it certainly exists the matrix
model $Mod\overset{\equiv }{\mathop{X}}\,(p)$ and is proved to be equivalent.
Therefore, it proves indirectly that the model $G{{N}_{e}}TM$ does not exist
halting problem, and it also indicate that the even Goldbach conjecture is
infinity existence.

and we can test only a proportion of the possible edges to check whether they
are present in $G$. If $G$ has high modularity, is the observed graph $G'$
likely to have high modularity? We see that this is indeed the case under a
mild condition, in a natural model where we test edges at random. We find that
$q^*(G') \geq q^*(G)-\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$, as
long as the expected number edges in $G'$ is large enough. Similarly, $q^*(G')
\leq q^*(G)+\varepsilon$ with probability at least $1-\varepsilon$, under the
stronger condition that the expected average degree in $G'$ is large enough.
Further, under this stronger condition, finding a good partition for $G'$ helps
us to find a good partition for $G$.

networks. We study the shortest path edge interdiction problem for defending
Active Directory style attack graphs. The problem is formulated as a
Stackelberg game between one defender and one attacker. The attack graph
contains one destination node and multiple entry nodes. The attacker's entry
node is chosen by nature. The defender chooses to block a set of edges limited
by his budget. The attacker then picks the shortest unblocked attack path. The
defender aims to maximize the expected shortest path length for the attacker,
where the expectation is taken over entry nodes.
</p>
<p>We observe that practical Active Directory attack graphs have small maximum
attack path lengths and are structurally close to trees. We first show that
even if the maximum attack path length is a constant, the problem is still
$W[1]$-hard with respect to the defender's budget. Having a small maximum
attack path length and a small budget is not enough to design fixed-parameter
algorithms. If we further assume that the number of entry nodes is small, then
we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm.
</p>
<p>We then propose two other fixed-parameter algorithms by exploiting the
tree-like features. One is based on tree decomposition and requires a small
tree width. The other assumes a small number of splitting nodes (nodes with
multiple out-going edges). Finally, the last algorithm is converted into a
graph convolutional neural network based heuristic, which scales to larger
graphs with more splitting nodes.

applications, algorithms using communication compression have attracted
significant attention and are widely used in practice. Moreover, there exists
client-variance in federated learning due to the total number of heterogeneous
clients is usually very large and the server is unable to communicate with all
clients in each communication round. In this paper, we address these two issues
together by proposing compressed and client-variance reduced methods.
Concretely, we introduce COFIG and FRECON, which successfully enjoy
communication compression with client-variance reduction. The total
communication round of COFIG is
$O(\frac{(1+\omega)^{3/2}\sqrt{N}}{S\epsilon^2}+\frac{(1+\omega)N^{2/3}}{S\epsilon^2})$
in the nonconvex setting, where $N$ is the total number of clients, $S$ is the
number of communicated clients in each round, $\epsilon$ is the convergence
error, and $\omega$ is the parameter for the compression operator. Besides, our
FRECON can converge faster than COFIG in the nonconvex setting, and it
converges with $O(\frac{(1+\omega)\sqrt{N}}{S\epsilon^2})$ communication
rounds. In the convex setting, COFIG converges within the communication rounds
$O(\frac{(1+\omega)\sqrt{N}}{S\epsilon})$, which is also the first convergence
result for compression schemes that do not communicate with all the clients in
each round. In sum, both COFIG and FRECON do not need to communicate with all
the clients and provide first/faster convergence results for convex and
nonconvex federated learning, while previous works either require full clients
communication (thus not practical) or obtain worse convergence results.

speed-ups with factor $w$, where $w$ is the computer word size. For example,
edit distance of two strings of length $n$ can be solved in $O(n^2/w)$ time. In
a reasonable classical model of computation, one can assume $w=\Theta(\log n)$.
There are conditional lower bounds for such problems stating that speed-ups
with factor $n^\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ would lead to breakthroughs in
complexity theory. However, these conditional lower bounds do not cover quantum
models of computing. Moreover, it is open if problems like edit distance can be
solved in truly sub-quadratic time using quantum computing. To partially
address this question, we study another bit-parallel algorithm for a problem
that admits a quadratic conditional lower bound, and show how to convert its
bit-parallelism into a realistic quantum algorithm that attains speed-up with
factor $n$. The technique we use is simple and general enough to apply to many
similar bit-parallel algorithms, where dependencies are local. However, it does
not immediately yield a faster algorithm for more complex problems like edit
distance, whose bit-parallel dynamic programming solutions require breaking
more global dependencies. We hope that this initial study sheds some light on
how, in general, bit-parallelism could be converted to quantum parallelism.

setting, where columns in $[0,1]^d$ of the constraint matrix are revealed
sequentially, and the goal is to pick a subset of the columns that sum to at
most $B$ in each coordinate while maximizing the objective. Excellent results
are known in the secretary setting, where the columns are adversarially chosen,
but presented in a uniformly random order. However, these existing algorithms
are susceptible to adversarial attacks: they try to "learn" characteristics of
a good solution, but tend to over-fit to the model, and hence a small number of
adversarial corruptions can cause the algorithm to fail.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give the first robust algorithms for Packing Integer
Programs, specifically in the recently proposed Byzantine Secretary framework.
Our techniques are based on a two-level use of online learning, to robustly
learn an approximation to the optimal value, and then to use this robust
estimate to pick a good solution. These techniques are general and we use them
to design robust algorithms for PIPs in the prophet model as well, specifically
in the Prophet-with-Augmentations framework. We also improve known results in
the Byzantine Secretary framework: we make the non-constructive results
algorithmic and improve the existing bounds for single-item and matroid
constraints.

    <title>The Quantum Trellis: A classical algorithm for sampling the parton shower with interference effects</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1640649600</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Macaluso:Sebastian.html">Sebastian Macaluso</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/c/Cranmer:Kyle.html">Kyle Cranmer</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12795">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Simulations of high-energy particle collisions, such as those used at the
Large Hadron Collider, are based on quantum field theory; however, many
approximations are made in practice. For example, the simulation of the parton
shower, which gives rise to objects called `jets', is based on a semi-classical
approximation that neglects various interference effects. While there is a
desire to incorporate interference effects, new computational techniques are
needed to cope with the exponential growth in complexity associated to quantum
processes. We present a classical algorithm called the quantum trellis to
efficiently compute the un-normalized probability density over N-body phase
space including all interference effects, and we pair this with an MCMC-based
sampling strategy. This provides a potential path forward for classical
computers and a strong baseline for approaches based on quantum computing.

    <title>An Exact Algorithm for the Linear Tape Scheduling Problem</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Honor=eacute=:Valentin.html">Valentin Honoré</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Simon:Bertrand.html">Bertrand Simon</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Suter:Fr=eacute=d=eacute=ric.html">Frédéric Suter</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09384">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Magnetic tapes are often considered as an outdated storage technology, yet
they are still used to store huge amounts of data. Their main interests are a
large capacity and a low price per gigabyte, which come at the cost of a much
larger file access time than on disks. With tapes, finding the right ordering
of multiple file accesses is thus key to performance. Moving the reading head
back and forth along a kilometer long tape has a non-negligible cost and
unnecessary movements thus have to be avoided. However, the optimization of
tape request ordering has then rarely been studied in the scheduling
literature, much less than I/O scheduling on disks. For instance, minimizing
the average service time for several read requests on a linear tape remains an
open question. Therefore, in this paper, we aim at improving the quality of
service experienced by users of tape storage systems, and not only the peak
performance of such systems. To this end, we propose a reasonable
polynomial-time exact algorithm while this problem and simpler variants have
been conjectured NP-hard. We also refine the proposed model by considering
U-turn penalty costs accounting for inherent mechanical accelerations. Then, we
propose a low-cost variant of our optimal algorithm by restricting the solution
space, yet still yielding an accurate suboptimal solution. Finally, we compare
our algorithms to existing solutions from the literature on logs of the mass
storage management system of a major datacenter. This allows us to assess the
quality of previous solutions and the improvement achieved by our low-cost
algorithm. Aiming for reproducibility, we make available the complete
implementation of the algorithms used in our evaluation, alongside the dataset
of tape requests that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind
to be publicly released.

    <title>TR21-180 |  Proving as Fast as Computing: Succinct Arguments with Constant Prover Overhead | 

	Noga Ron-Zewi, 

	Ron Rothblum</title>
    <summary>Succinct arguments are proof systems that allow a powerful, but untrusted, prover to convince a weak verifier that an input $x$ belongs to a language $L \in NP$, with communication that is much shorter than the $NP$ witness. Such arguments, which grew out of the theory literature, are now drawing immense interest also in practice, where a key bottleneck that has arisen is the high computational cost of \emph{proving} correctness.

In this work we address this problem by constructing succinct arguments for general computations, expressed as Boolean circuits (of bounded fan-in), with a \emph{strictly linear} size prover. The soundness error of the protocol is an arbitrarily small constant. Prior to this work, succinct arguments were known with a \emph{quasi-}linear size prover for general Boolean circuits or with linear-size only for arithmetic circuits, defined over large finite fields.

In more detail, for every Boolean circuit $C=C(x,w)$, we construct an $O(\log |C|)$-round argument-system in which the prover can be implemented by a size $O(|C|)$ Boolean circuit (given as input both the instance $x$ and the witness $w$), with arbitrarily small constant soundness error and using $poly(\lambda,\log |C|)$ communication, where $\lambda$ denotes the security parameter. The verifier can be implemented by a size $O(|x|) + poly(\lambda, \log |C|)$ circuit following a size $O(|C|)$ private pre-processing step, or, alternatively, by using a purely public-coin protocol (with no pre-processing) with a size $O(|C|)$ verifier. The protocol can be made zero-knowledge using standard techniques (and with similar parameters). The soundness of our protocol is computational and relies on the existence of collision resistant hash functions that can be computed by linear-size circuits, such as those proposed by Applebaum et al. (ITCS, 2017).

 At the heart of our construction is a new information-theoretic  \emph{interactive oracle proof} (IOP), an interactive analog of a PCP, for circuit satisfiability, with constant prover overhead. The improved efficiency of our IOP is obtained by bypassing a barrier faced by prior IOP constructions, which needed to (either explicitly or implicitly) encode the entire computation using a multiplication code.</summary>

<h3>Our August 2019 Oberwolfach meeting.</h3>
<p>At the end of August 2019 we had in Oberwolfach a very fruitful meeting on Geometric, algebraic, and topological combinatorics. (In <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/01/richard-ehrenborgs-problem-on-spanning-trees-in-bipartite-graphs/">this post</a>, I mentioned an open problem from the problem session.) I came to Oberwolfach just after a visit, with my son in low, Eran, to CERN near Genève. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/04/computer-science-and-its-impact-on-our-future/">this post</a> for pictures from ATLAS, CERN, and this post regarding my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/21/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-cern-colloquium-and-a-new-paper/">CERN colloquium</a>.)</p>
<p>The August 2019 Oberwolfach meeting was the seventh meeting in a series of meetings that started in 1995.  Here is, by the way, is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematics-as-a-team-sport-20200331/">a very nice article i</a>n Quanta Magazine about an Oberwolfach Meeting. (And feel free to share Oberwolfach memories in the comment section.)</p>
<p>The sequence in the title of the post is not a DNA sequence or something similar but rather it refers to these meetings in Oberwolfach and this post is devoted to these series of meetings and other meetings in Oberwolfach.</p>
<h2>Oberwolfach: AGC, 1995; GTC, 1999; TGC, 2003; GTC, 2007; TGC, 2011; GAC, 2015; GATC, 2019.</h2>
<p>Here A stands for ‘Algebraic’, G stands for ‘Geometric’, T stands for ‘Topological’ and C stands for ‘Combinatorics’.</p>
<p>These series of conferences are devoted to algebraic, geometric, and topological combinatorics. Both algebraic and geometric combinatorics are very large areas (and topological combinatorics is pretty large) and usually participants of the conference are divided to several overlapping much appreciated minorities. Actually, living in a country where every citizen is a member of a much appreciated minority seems like a nice political setting to me.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="https://oda.mfo.de/handle/mfo/397">the review</a> of the first conference in the series AGC95.</p>
<h3>AGC 1995</h3>
<p>I was a little younger than 40 years old. The meeting, organized by Anders Björner, Günter Ziegler and me, took place before a sabbatical semester at IAS, Princeton on fall 1995. Here are a few topics that were discussed:</p>
<p><strong>Cluster algebras to be.</strong> Sergey Fomin’s lecture was on Piecewise-linear maps, total positivity, and pseudoline arrangements, it represented a joint work with Arkady Bernstein and Andrei Zelevinsky. This paper was the starting point of a vastly influential cluster algebras that Sergey, Arkady, and Andrei started developing around that time.</p>
<p><strong>Polytopes spheres and face numbers.</strong> Tom Braden talked about Intersection homology and polytopes – recent progress, this was about his paper with Bob MacPherson where (among other things) a conjecture that I made some years earlier was settled.</p>
<p><strong>Convexity in the Grassmanian.</strong> Eli Goodman talked about a joint work with Ricky Pollack on  Some combinatorial questions for convex sets on affine Grassmanian. Finding the right notion of convexity for subset of the Grassmanian is a fascinating and unexplored question.</p>
<p><strong>Optimization.</strong> Monique Laurent talked about  the geometry of the set of positive semidefinite matrices with diagonal entries. Rekha Thomas talked about using Gröbner bases to solve integer programs (and a Comparison between linear and integer programming).</p>
<p><strong>The two 2-lecture series.  </strong>Nati Linial gave a series of two lectures on <strong>the geometry of graph</strong>. He talked about his program to think about graphs as metric objects and apply insights regarding metric spaces to theoretical computer science. This was shortly after the Linial-London Rabinovich paper that had large impact in theoretical computer science and combinatorics appeared.  Rade Zivaleivich  gave two lectures on methods of obstruction theory, related to topological and colorful Tverberg theorems and measure partitions and other questions. We came back to this topic in future conferences in the series.</p>
<p><strong>Real algebraic geometry.</strong> Ricky Pollack talked about Complexity and algorithms in real algebraic geometry.</p>
<p><strong>Triangulations of cyclic polytopes and the generalized Baues Conjecture</strong>.<br/>
Jorg Rambau taled about a counterexample to the “Generalized Baues Conjecture” and Vic Reiner talked about Triangulations of cyclic polytopes: the higher Stasheff-Tamari posets.</p>
<p><strong>Universality. </strong>Jürgen Richter Gebert explained why Realization spaces of 4-polytopes are universal!</p>
<p>See the review for some more talks on the topics listed above and on other topics such as <strong>Lattices of parabolic subgroups, </strong><strong>Discrepency theory, </strong><strong>Combinatorics of knots </strong>and more<strong>.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Flashback: my first meeting at Oberwolfach</span></strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/8229/www_view">Konvexe Körper 1982</a></h3>
<p>I was a 27 years old graduate student. It was just after the 1982 Lebanon war. I had one one year old daughter and following the meeting my wife and I toured Italy for a week. It was great!  My thesis supervisor Micha A. Perles and my academic brother Michael Kallay also participated. At that conference I met for the first time many mathematicians and some of them remained my good friends ever since. The meetings on Konvexe Körper took place every two years and I participated in several subsequent meetings.</p>
<h3>Oberwolfach’s Combinatorics meetings from January 2000 to January 2020</h3>
<p>The other series of conferences in Oberwolfach that I attended regularly is the combinatorics meeting that takes place on the first week of January every 2-3 years. The <a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/0001/www_view">first one</a> in the series was also the first Oberwolfach meeting after 2000.  The <a href="https://www.mfo.de/occasion/2002/www_view">last meeting</a> in this series was in January 2020 and just before the meeting my wife and I spent four great days in Rome. This was in fact our last travel outside Israel until September 2021 (not counting a 1-day <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/02/11/petra-jordan/">visit to Petra</a>).</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">And the answer is: GATC (2023) </span></strong></h2>
<p>Half a year ago Isabella Novik, Paco Santos, Volkmar Welker and I submitted a proposal for a 2023 meeting which is going to be the 8th meeting in this series. Recently the meeting was approved! It will take place on December 10-16, 2023.</p>

    <title>Raytracing diamonds</title>
    <summary>This comes from a question posed to me and others in 2019 by Stefan Langerman, a computational geometer who also happens to be a diamond dealer. The classic brilliant cut shape of diamonds has a flat “table” face on the top (visible) side of the gem, and many other smaller facets on the sides (“crown”) and back (“pavilion”), with angles chosen so that most of the light that enters through the table is reflected back out through the table, making the diamond look bright. Can we simulate this reflection process efficiently, without having to trace all the reflections of all (or a sufficiently dense sample of all) possible light rays?</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This comes from a question posed to me and others in 2019 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Langerman">Stefan Langerman</a>, a computational geometer who also happens to be a diamond dealer. The classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_(diamond_cut)">brilliant cut</a> shape of diamonds has a flat “table” face on the top (visible) side of the gem, and many other smaller facets on the sides (“crown”) and back (“pavilion”), with angles chosen so that most of the light that enters through the table is reflected back out through the table, making the diamond look bright. Can we simulate this reflection process efficiently, without having to trace all the reflections of all (or a sufficiently dense sample of all) possible light rays?</p>

<p>This appears to be an interesting problem even for a very simple abstraction of the diamond’s shape: a two-dimensional isosceles triangle, with the base of the triangle as its table and the two equal sides as its pavilion. What you need to know about light reflections in gems is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_angle_(optics)">critical angle</a>, determined from the high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index">refractive index</a> of diamonds and other gems. Inside the gem, rays that hit a face at an angle shallower than the critical angle; rays that hit more steeply than the critical angle will escape. Any light ray hitting the table will always enter the gem, and will be refracted so that it enters along a ray steeper than the critical angle. It will then bounce around within the gem until it happens to hit a face steeply enough to escape. The question is to predict where this escape ray escapes, more quickly than the obvious algorithm of calculating explicitly the entire sequence of reflections that it performs. Or if we can’t, can we at least provide good bounds on the lengths of these reflection sequences?</p>

<p>Three of the simplest cases involve the isosceles triangles for which the triangle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_tessellation">tiles the plane by copies reflected across its edges</a>, the equilateral triangle, isosceles right triangle, and 30-30-120 isosceles triangle. The paths of a reflected light ray within such a triangle are combinatorially equivalent to the paths of a straight line through this triangulation: they pass through the same types of edges, at the same angles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Reflection through many faces in a 30-30-120 gem" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/30-30-120.svg" width="80%"/></p>

<p>For all three of these triangle shapes, a line that enters the gem through any edge can only pass through a constant number of tiles in the tiling, before passing through another edge with the same angle, at which it must necessarily leave the gem (if it has not done so already). For instance, the red line shown, if it enters at its bottom left endpoint on the table of a green triangle, will exit after at most three reflections, through the parallel table of a blue triangle. The constant in the number of reflections here is absolute, not depending on the critical angle.</p>

<p>The next simplest case is the isosceles triangle with apex angle \(2\pi/5\). This triangle does not tile the plane, but we can still form a partial tiling by “unrolling” the path of reflections through the triangle into a line through a sequence of reflected triangles. In order to avoid exiting through one of the sides (by passing through it more perpendicularly than the entrance angle) and in order to miss the closest two copies of the table that are parallel to the entrance, there is only one passage that can be followed in the unrolled triangulation, the one shown by the red ray in the figure. Because this passage is perpendicular to one of the reflected sides of the triangle, a ray that is more perpendicular to the table than to this side can only continue for \(O(1)\) steps through this passage before hitting an exit. Here, though, the critical angle comes into play: critical angles that are closer to a right angle will allow larger (but constant) numbers of reflections.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Reflection in a 2pi/5 isosceles triangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/pentagonal-isosceles-reflections.svg" width="40%"/></p>

<p>Isosceles triangles with apex \(\pi/4\) are even messier. When a ray entering the table exits by a side, or exits by the table without first bouncing off the table, it always does so within $O(1)$ steps. The trickier cases are when a ray entering through the table misses the opposite table in the octagon formed by reflected copies of the triangle, and passes through a sequence of diagonal or horizontal reflections into other octagons before escaping. In the case that there are no horizontal reflections, only diagonal ones, we just need to divide the vertical distance that the ray needs to travel to hit the next row of vertical edges by the slope of the ray, and round. The case that there is at least one horizontal reflection (shown) is a little more compicated, but again appears to involve a finite calculation. So it seems that with a little more calculation it is still possible to determine algorithmically what happens in this case, in constant time rather than having to simulate the unbounded number of bounces triangle-by-triangle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Reflection in a pi/4 isosceles triangle" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/octagonal-reflex.svg"/></p>

<p>All of these triangles have angles that are rational multiples of \(2\pi\). For reflections within polygons of this type, the reflected line will only pass through a constant number of slopes. The rays of a single slope that hit a given line of the polygon can be describes as an interval, and the mapping on rays that takes each ray starting on one of the sides with one of these slopes to the start of its next reflection is a special kind of mapping studied in the theory of dynamical systems, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_exchange_transformation">interval exchange transformation</a>. So from a geometric question on ray-tracing, we are led to a more abstract question: given an interval exchange transformation, and a starting point in that transformation, how easy is it to determine the number of times one would need to repeat the transformation to return back to the same interval?</p>

<p>I have no real progress to report on any of these questions, in part because the continuous nature of these problems lead to difficult numerical issues. Instead, I have a new arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11607">“The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation” (arXiv:2112.11607
)</a> on related but more combinatorial problems. Suppose one has an invertible mapping \(f\) on a finite (but exponentially large) set of states, that is easy to compute, such as an interval exchange transformation on integers rather than real numbers. Suppose also that you want to repeat this mapping for a given initial state \(x\) and a large number \(n\) of steps. Is there anything you can do to compute the result \(f^{(n)}(x)\) of this iterated mapping, more efficiently than the obvious method of just computing \(x\), \(f(x)\), \(f(f(x))\), one step at a time? One property that appears highly relevant here is that these mappings are reversible: they are one-to-one, and more strongly the inverse mapping is also an interval exchange transformation. In contrast, it is easy to find mappings that are not reversible and for which computing iterated values is \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete: consider, for instance, the state transition map of a space-bounded Turing machine.</p>

<p>For some similar systems, we do know of effective methods in practice if not in theory. For Conway’s Game of Life, for instance, it appears to be \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\)-complete to compute what happens to an initial state after \(n\) steps (although I’m not sure this exact claim has been published in the literature), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife">hashlife</a> (as implemented in <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">Golly</a>) can run many complicated and large patterns in an amount of runtime substantially less than the number of generated steps. The Game of Life is not reversible, but some other interesting cellular automata with similar behavior such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critters_(cellular_automaton)">Critters</a> are. Can we say anything about the computational complexity of simulating Critters or other reversible rules? My new paper addresses these questions by formulating a complexity class that includes computing \(f^{(n)}(x)\) for reversible cellular automaton simulation, integer interval exchange transformations, and others. It sandwiches this class between \(\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{PH}}\) and \(\mathsf{PSPACE}\), and finds complete problems for it including the simulation of reversible cellular automata and of piecewise linear tranformations. The complete cellular automata include the two-dimensional billiard ball model, already known for its ability to simulate reversible circuits, and a new one-dimensional automata that can simulate some two-dimensional automata including the billiard ball model. Because Critters can in turn simulate the billiard ball model, it is also complete in the same sense. But I wasn’t able to prove completeness for integer interval exchange transformations, let alone say anything useful about the non-integer transformations needed to understand diamond reflections.</p>

<p>PS, added 2021-12-27 to appease the request on the YC discussion for an actual ray-traced diamond image: Here’s one from my paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.2218">Isometric diamond subgraphs</a>”, otherwise unrelated to this latest post:</p>

<p>Richard Stanley, a most famous and influential mathematician in my area of combinatorics, the master of finding deep connections between combinatorics and other areas of pure mathematics, and my postdoctoral advisor, has just won the Steele prize for lifetime achievement, among the most prestigious mathematical prizes. </p>



<p>The citation reads: “Stanley has revolutionized enumerative combinatorics, revealing deep connections with other branches of mathematics, such as commutative algebra, topology, algebraic geometry, probability, convex geometry, and representation theory. In doing so, he solved important longstanding combinatorial problems, often reinvigorating these other fields with new combinatorial methods. Through his outstanding research; excellent expository works; and many PhD students, collaborators and colleagues, he continues to influence the field of combinatorics worldwide.” </p>



<p>Congratulations to Richard and to the community of combinatorics. </p>

<p>In the following January, Harvard GSAS kindly supports me to offer a <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/mini-course" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">mini-course on <em>“What is Computation? From Turing Machines to Blackholes and Neurons”</em></a>. In this blog post, I’m going to share the motivation for teaching this mini-course and give an overview on what you will learn if you are interested in participating!</p>



<p>Computation is not an exotic word for people living in the 21st century. In high school, kids have to learn and do all sorts of computations in arithmetics (and some even start to write computer programs!). For scientists, computational methods become more and more common and sometimes even completely change the paradigm of a field. There are computers of different forms hiding in our daily life ranging from your smartphones to the toy of your pets. Also, from time to time we see excitement on the news about the development of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Computation has become central in human civilization, however, do we really understand what computation is?</p>



<p>Let me first convince you why asking and attempting to answer this question is important.</p>



<p>Traditionally, at least on Wikipedia, computation is defined as <em>“any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and which follows a well-defined model (e.g. an algorithm)”</em>. Indeed, for computer scientists and mathematicians, computation is about solving <em>computational problems</em> via an abstract mathematical model known as <em>Turing machine</em>. In particular, the <em>Church-Turing Thesis</em>, which can be viewed as Newton’s laws in computer science, asserts that all effective computational methods in the world can be captured by Turing machines. That is to say, in the mathematical world, computation is something axiomatized and can be studied and understood parallel to the empirical world.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for the majority of people, computation is something more concrete and has a physical realization such as a digital computer. The rise of computer science in the past few decades is certainly owing to the great technological success of building up modern computers. The fascinating advances of technology seem to close the gap between theory and reality (similar to Newton’s laws!). Nevertheless, in the frontier of scientific research, the recent surging developments of quantum computing and artificial neural networks started to challenge our understanding in computation – the ways they compute are so different from the traditional Turing machines and we don’t really know why and how they work so well!</p>



<p>In my opinion, we need to revisit the notion of computation in order to attack these mysteries. Specifically, the approach should be interdisciplinary.</p>



<p>As computer scientists are used to think of computations as composing different <em>resources</em> and <em>subroutines</em>, the computations in physics and biology tend to be rather <em>holistic</em> and <em>open-ended</em>. When talking about computations, people from different fields often think a bit differently. Such distinctions across fields should not be barriers or problems, instead, it could potentially serve as seeds to enrich our understanding in the essence of computation.</p>



<p>This mini-course is an invitation to rethink about what computation is through different angles. We will focus on but not limit to three perspectives including mathematics, physics, and biology. Through theories, examples, and experiments, we are going to see the similarities and differences between these disciplines. Six guest speakers coming from a diverse background (from computer science and physics to neuroscience and modern art) will join us and provide lots of examples and stories from their home field. The aim of this mini-course is to remind people of the diverse nature of computation and envision the possibilities of future interdisciplinary research.</p>



<p>There will be three modules and each contains three 50-minute interactive lectures and 1-3 guest talk(s). The first module focuses on the mathematical foundation of computations in which the students will learn the concept of Turing machines, computability, reductions, and most importantly, the underlying philosophy. The second module is about the computations in the physical world where we will launch from classical mechanics, to statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and gravity. The third module looks into the computations in biology, ranging from genomes, evolution, to neuroscience. The mini-course will end with a panel discussion with all the guest speakers and students.</p>



<p>Please visit the <a href="http://cnchou.github.io/mini-course/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">course website</a> for more information and hope to see you in January!</p></div>

    <title>Recursive bijective numbering</title>
    <summary>Ordinary radix systems for representing numbers, like binary or decimal, use fixed finite sets of digits. The same is true for bijective numeration, used for columns of spreadsheets. In bijective numbering, every string of digits represents a unique number, shorter strings represent smaller numbers, and strings of equal length have the usual order. In spreadsheets, the digits are letters A–Z, one-letter strings represent numbers \(1\) through \(26\), two-letter strings represent \(27\) through \(26+26^2=702\), etc. Instead, mixed radix systems like the factorial number system have position-varying digit sets. In factorial numbering, the \(i\)th digit can range from \(0\) to \(i-1\), with place value \((i-1)!\). The value of a digit string is the sum of digits times place values. One could combine these ideas and get a bijective factorial number system, in which strings of at most \(i\) digits can represent numbers up to the sum of the first \(i\) factorials. But in all of these mixed radix systems, the digits are not drawn from a finite set. Maybe we need another numbering system just to describe each digit of a mixed-radix number? This leads to the idea of a recursive numbering system, where the digits of a mixed-radix system are themselves numbers in the same system.</summary>

But in all of these mixed radix systems, the digits are not drawn from a finite set. Maybe we need another numbering system just to describe each digit of a mixed-radix number? This leads to the idea of a <em>recursive</em> numbering system, where the digits of a mixed-radix system are themselves numbers in the same system.</p>

<p>An example might clarify this idea. Let’s start with a recursive numbering system based on binary. Like other mixed-radix systems, we’ll number the digit positions starting with \(i=0\) at the right. Each position has a place value, the product of the numbers of choices for earlier digits, and the value of a sequence of digits is the sum of digits times place value. We’ll start with two choices of digit in position \(0\), like binary, and in later positions we’ll use the values we’ve already constructed as allowable digits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), the two available digits given in the base case are \(0\) and \(1\), allowing us to represent only the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) as one-digit strings.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are still only two digits available, the two numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that have shorter representations. In this position, they have place value \(2\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(3\) to be represented as a two-digit string.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), we now have four digits available, the numbers from \(0\) to \(3\). These have place value \(4\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(15\) to be represented with three digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>At each successive level of this structure, the number of available digits and place values will be equal. Each new digit squares the range of representable numbers. In any position \(i&gt;0\), we will have \(2^{2^{i-1}}\) digits available, with place value \(2^{2^{i-1}}\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(2^{2^{i}}-1\) to be represented. In some sense, though, we haven’t done anything very interesting yet. Like binary, we just get powers of two. The recursive-binary representation of a number can be obtained in a trivial way from its binary representation, by partitioning the bits into groups of 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, … bits.</p>

<p>Instead, a bijective numbering system leads to more interesting results when handled recursively. For recursive bijective numbering, we can start with a much simpler base case, the empty string, which can be interpreted in any bijective numbering system as representing the number \(0\). With this base case, we can define a bijective numbering system in which the available digits in position \(i\) (starting from \(i=0\) in the rightmost digit) are the numbers that can be represented by strings of length at most \(i\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), there is only one available digit, the number \(0\) (already represented by the empty string), producing only one single-digit value, representing the number \(1\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are two available digits, the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that we have already represented, so there are two two-digit sequences possible, representing two more numbers \(2\) and \(3\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), there are four available digits, providing eight three-digit sequences that can represent the numbers \(4\) through \(11\).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we let \(n_i\) denote the number of values that can be obtained by strings of exactly \(i\) digits, then we obtain a recurrence \(n_0=1\) (the zero-length strings represent only one value, zero) and \(n_i=n_{i-1}\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) (there are \(n_{i-1}\) choices for the string up to its last digit, and \(\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) choices for the last digit). This recurrence has the sequence of values <a href="http://oeis.org/A001697">1, 1, 2, 8, 96, 10368, 108615168, …</a> and its partial sums <a href="http://oeis.org/A001696">1, 2, 4, 12, 108, 10476, 108625644, …</a> give the total number of values that can be represented by strings of up to \(i\) digits.</p>

<p>The same idea can be represented graphically. Given a number represented by this recursive bijective numbering system, draw an ordered tree, where an \(i\)-digit number is represented by a tree whose root has \(i\) children, one for each digit, and where each digit is represented in the same way by a subtree. Conversely, if we have an ordered tree, we can think of it as representing a recursive bijective number, whose digits are computed recursively from the children of the root. In our recursive bijective numbers, we required that each digit be representable as a string of length at most its position; translating this requirement into tree terminology, each node that is the \(i\)th child of its parent (again starting with \(i=0\) on the right) must have degree at most \(i\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Equivalence between recursive bijective numbering and tree enumeration" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/recursive-bijective.svg" width="60%"/></p>

<p>It follows that the sequences of numbers of representable values for \(i\)-digit strings and for \(\le i\)-digit strings, above, also give the numbers of ordered trees that obey this degree constraint, with root degree \(i\) or \(\le i\), respectively.</p>

    <summary xml:lang="en-US">I’m about to leave for a family vacation—our first such since before the pandemic, one planned and paid for literally the day before the news of Omicron broke.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I’m about to leave for a family vacation—our first such since before the pandemic, one planned and paid for literally the day before the news of Omicron broke.  On the negative side, staring at the case-count graphs that are just now going vertical, I estimate a ~25% chance that at least one of us will get Omicron on this trip.  On the positive side, I estimate a ~60% chance that in the next 6 months, at least one of us would’ve gotten Omicron or some other variant even <em>without</em> this trip—so maybe it’s just as well if we get it now, when we’re vaxxed to the maxx and ready and school and university are out.</p>



<p>If, however, I <em>do</em> end this trip dead in an ICU, I wouldn’t want to do so without having clearly set out my values for posterity.  So with that in mind: in the comments of my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">previous post</a>, someone asked me why I identify as a liberal or a progressive, if I passionately support educational practices like tracking, ability grouping, acceleration, and (especially) <em>encouraging kids to learn advanced math whenever they’re ready for it</em>.  (Indeed, that might be my single stablest political view, having been held, for recognizably similar reasons, since I was about 5.)</p>



<p>Incidentally, that previous post was guest-written by my colleagues Edith Cohen and Boaz Barak, and linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> that now has almost 1500 signatories.  Our goal was, and is, to fight the imminent dumbing-down of precollege math education in the United States, spearheaded by the so-called “California Mathematics Framework.”  In our joint efforts, we’ve been careful with every word—making sure to maintain the assent of our entire list of signatories, to attract broad support, to stay narrowly focused on the issue at hand, and to bend over backwards to concede much as we could.  Perhaps because of those cautions, we—amazingly—got some actual traction, reaching people in government (such as Rep. Ro Khanna, D – Silicon Valley) and technology leaders, and forcing the “no one’s allowed to take Algebra in 8th grade” faction to respond to us.</p>



<p>This was disorienting to me.  On this blog, I’m used just to howling into the wind, having some agree, some disagree, some take to Twitter to denounce me, but in any case, having no effect of any kind on the real world.  </p>



<p>So let me return to howling into the wind.  And return to the question of what I “am” in ideology-space, which doesn’t have an obvious answer.</p>



<p>It’s like, what do you call someone who’s absolutely terrified about global warming, and who thinks the best response would’ve been (and actually, still is) a historic surge in nuclear energy, possibly with geoengineering to tide us over?</p>



<p>… who wants to end world hunger … and do it using GMO crops?</p>



<p>… who wants to smash systems of entrenched privilege in college admissions … and believes that the SAT and other standardized tests are the best tools ever invented for that purpose?</p>



<p>… who feels a personal distaste for free markets, for the triviality of what they so often elevate and the depth of what they let languish, but tolerates them because they’ve done more than anything else to lift up the world’s poor?</p>



<p>… who’s happiest when telling the truth for the cause of social justice … but who, if told to <em>lie</em> for the cause of social justice, will probably choose silence or even, if pushed hard enough, truth?</p>



<p>… who wants to legalize marijuana and psychedelics, and <em>also</em> legalize all the promising treatments currently languishing in FDA approval hell?</p>



<p>… who feels little attraction to the truth-claims of the world’s ancient religions, <em>except</em> insofar as they sometimes serve as prophylactics against newer and now even more virulent religions?</p>



<p>… who thinks the covid response of the CDC, FDA, and other authorities was a historic disgrace—not because it infringed on the personal liberties of antivaxxers or anything like that, but on the contrary, because it was weak, timid, bureaucratic, and slow, where it should’ve been like that of a general at war?</p>



<p>… who thinks the Nazi Holocaust was <em>even worse</em> than the mainstream holds it to be, because in addition to the staggering, one-lifetime-isn’t-enough-to-internalize-it human tragedy, the Holocaust <em>also</em> sent up into smoke whatever cultural process had just produced Einstein, von Neumann, Bohr, Szilard, Born, Meitner, Wigner, Haber, Pauli, Cantor, Hausdorff, Ulam, Tarski, Erdös, and Noether, and with it, one of the wellsprings of our technological civilization?</p>



<p>… who supports free speech, to the point of proudly tolerating views that <em>really, actually</em> disgust them at their workplace, university, or online forum?</p>



<p>… who believes in patriotism, the police, the rule of law, to the extent that they don’t understand why all the enablers of the January 6 insurrection, up to and including Trump, aren’t currently facing trial for treason against the United States?</p>



<p>… who’s (of course) disgusted to the core by Trump and everything he represents, but who’s <em>also</em> disgusted by the elite virtue-signalling hypocrisy that made the rise of a Trump-like backlash figure predictable?</p>



<p>… who not only supports abortion rights, but also looks forward to a near future when parents, if they choose, are free to use embryo selection to make their children happier, smarter, healthier, and free of life-crippling diseases (unless the “bioethicists” destroy that future, as a previous generation of Deep Thinkers destroyed our nuclear future)?</p>



<p>… who, when reading about the 1960s Sexual Revolution, instinctively sides with free-loving hippies and against the scolds … even if today’s scolds are themselves former hippies, or intellectual descendants thereof, who now clothe their denunciations of other people’s gross, creepy sexual desires in the garb of feminism and social justice?</p>



<p>What, finally, do you call someone whose image of an ideal world might include a young Black woman wearing a hijab, an old Orthodox man with black hat and sidecurls, a broad-shouldered white guy from the backwoods of Alabama, and a trans woman with purple hair, face tattoos and a nose ring … all of them standing in front of a blackboard and arguing about what would happen if Alice and Bob jumped into opposite ends of a wormhole?</p>



<p>Do you call such a person “liberal,” “progressive,” “center-left,” “centrist,” “Pinkerite,” “technocratic,” “neoliberal,” “libertarian-ish,” “classical liberal”?  Why not simply call them “correct”? <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p></div>

<p>
Jonathan Borwein passed away a few years ago. He had been one of the top experts on <img alt="{\pi=3.141592653\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%3D3.141592653%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and especially its computation. He also was a close associate of David Bailey, and they had been prominent advocates of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_mathematics">experimental</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uexm20">mathematics</a>. </p>
<p>
Today we talk about the hardness of predicting mathematical and computational advances.</p>
<p>
Borwein wrote a wonderful <a href="https://www.carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/future.pdf">article</a> on the future of mathematics. It was titled “The Future of Mathematics: 1965 to 2065” and was written for the 2015 centenary of the <a href="https://www.maa.org/">MAA</a>, midway in his range of time. </p>
<p>
Thus, his article looked forward by first looking backward at what would have been looking forward back then. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Prediction is Hard </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Borwein talks about predicting the future and how hard it is. He does this by listing a few predictions that were not correct: </p>
<ul>
<li>
“Radio has no future. Heavier than air flying machines are impossible. X-rays will prove to be a hoax.” — William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), English physicist and inventor, 1899. <p/>
</li><li>
“This telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.” — Western Union internal memo, 1876. <p/>
</li><li>
“Folks, the Mac platform is through— totally.” — John Dvorak, <em>PC Magazine</em>, 1998. <p/>
</li><li>
“The problem with television is that people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn’t time for it.”— New York Times, 1949. <p/>
</li><li>
“Where … the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weights 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh only 1.5 tons.” — <i>Popular Mechanics</i>, 1949.
</li></ul>
<p>
Ken’s favorites are ones that have long been technologically feasible but never became economical. An example is that in 1959, Arthur Summerfield—then US Postmaster General—<a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/missile-mail.pdf">predicted</a> that in a a few years, bulk canisters of air mail would be sent across oceans in hours by intercontinental missile. This was said without any inkling of e-mail. And whereas e-mail is “non-physical,” our physical packages arrive no faster than 60 years ago—indeed slower with this year’s supply-chain issues at Pacific ports. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/missilemail2/" rel="attachment wp-att-19432"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19432" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MissileMail2.jpg?resize=277%2C240&amp;ssl=1" width="277"/></a></p>
<p/><h2> Why Are Predictions Hard? </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One reason the future is hard to predict is that we tend to make predictions that are too conservative. For example: replace the last prediction by:</p>
<p>
“Where … the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weights 30 tons, computers in the future may weigh <b>one</b> pound.”</p>
<p>
The trouble is people would have laughed at this as ridiculous. How could 30 tons be reduced to a single pound? Indeed.</p>
<p>
Of course today people are talking about computers that weight almost nothing and can flow through your bloodstream. See <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/these-tiny-robots-could-be-disease-fighting-machines-inside-body-ncna861451">nanobots</a>. </p>

<p>
A year ago, we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/10/the-future-of-mathematics/">covered</a> a paper and <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf">slides</a> by Kevin Buzzard titled, “The future of mathematics?” His third slide embeds a hint on what makes prediction hard:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/s/" rel="attachment wp-att-19421"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19421" height="205" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/s.png?resize=320%2C205&amp;ssl=1" width="320"/></a></p>
<p>
The key is what he says about AI advances coming in a <em>phase change</em>. A phase change is different from a bolt-from-the-blue. Before the change, the situation seems to be one that is well understood to be progressing slowly. Then a year passes, and boom. Again what happens is that predictions that seemed to be well-founded are exposed as too conservative. </p>
<p>
Understanding how this supplements the bolt-from-the-blue kind of event leads to the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The future is whippy. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
And that is why predictions are hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Some Predictions </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Nevertheless, we wish to make a few predictions ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The P versus NP problem will be solved by the following date: 2032 <img alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> years. We make no prediction which way it is resolved. (This is squarely within the 2030-to-2040 range that Ken gave in 2002 in Bill Gasarch’s first P=NP <a href="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs4104/heath/Spring2006/Resources/PversusNPpoll.pdf">poll</a>.) <p/>

Quantum computers will be able to factor all numbers up to one million <em>purely</em> via Peter Shor’s algorithm by 2030. This may not seem impressive—and it isn’t—but compare what Wikipedia summarizes about the past decade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_records#Records_for_efforts_by_quantum_computers">here</a>. <p/>

The Bitcoin protocol will be broken in at most five years. This will have a huge impact of course on the real markets. <p/>

A super-linear lower bound on Boolean complexity will be found for some concrete problem.

    <title>Backpropagation ≠ Chain Rule</title>
    <summary>The chain rule is a fundamental result in calculus. Roughly speaking, it states that if a variable is a differentiable function of intermediate variables , and each intermediate variable is itself a differentiable function of , then we can compute the derivative as follows: Besides being a handy tool for computing derivatives in calculus homework, the chain rule is closely related to the backpropagation algorithm that is widely-used for computing derivatives (gradients) in neural network training. This blog post by Boaz Barak is a beautiful tutorial on the chain rule and the backpropagation algorithm. As in Barak’s post, the backpropagation algorithm is usually taught as an application of the chain rule in machine learning classes. This leads to a common belief that “backpropagation is just applying the chain rule repeatedly”. While this is in a sense true, we wish to point out in this blog post that this belief is over-simplifying and can lead to incorrect implementations of the backpropagation algorithm.

<p>In the calculations above, note the difference between partial and full derivatives. For example, the partial derivative <img alt="\frac{\partial b_2}{\partial a} = 3" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+a%7D+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas the full derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} b_2}{{\mathrm d} a} = 3\times 1 + 1\times 2 = 5" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_2%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D+%3D+3%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+2+%3D+5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Similarly, the partial derivative <img alt="\frac{\partial c}{\partial b_1} = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_1%7D+%3D+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, whereas the full derivative <img alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} b_1} = 5\times 1 + 1\times 4 = 9" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_1%7D+%3D+5%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+4+%3D+9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Intuitively, for every edge in the graph, we can compute the corresponding partial derivative locally (after the <em>forward pass</em>, to be precise), but a full derivative may require longer calculations.</p>



<p>Now it should be clear that equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> cannot be <em>directly</em> explained as the standard chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a>. The key difference is that in the chain rule, we need partial derivatives of a single variable w.r.t. multiple other variables, whereas in <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a>, we need partial derivatives of multiple variables w.r.t. the same variable.</p>



<p>Of course, one can prove the correctness of backpropagation using the chain rule in various ways, but the simple proof “backpropagation uses the standard chain rule at every step” is incomplete. Also, it is certainly possible to compute derivatives (gradients) on a neural network directly using the chain rule similarly to <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-2">(2)</a>, but in neural network training one typically wants to calculate the derivatives of a single output variable w.r.t. a large number of input variables, in which case backpropagation allows a more efficient implementation than using the standard chain rule directly.</p>



<h2 id="the-real-chain-rule-in-actual-backpropagation">The real chain rule in actual backpropagation</h2>



<p>When implementing the backpropagation algorithm, it is more convenient and efficient to add in the two terms (or any number of terms in general) on the right-hand-side of <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> at <em>different</em> steps of the algorithm. This is described in Barak’s <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">tutorial</a>, which also has an actual Python implementation! In contrast to the failure of naively explaining equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> as the chain rule, there is a way to explain this implementation using the chain rule directly.</p>



<p>To describe the implementation, suppose <img alt="b_1,\ldots,b_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> are all the variables, including input variables <img alt="b_1,\ldots,b_m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, intermediate variables <img alt="b_{m+1},\ldots,b_{n-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%7Bm%2B1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, and the only output variable <img alt="c = b_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+b_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Assume the variables are arranged in topological order: for every <img alt="i = m+1,\ldots,n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+m%2B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, variable <img alt="b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is locally a function of variables <img alt="b_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. We can write this as <img alt="b_i = b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i+%3D+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Note that some variables <img alt="b_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> with <img alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> may not have an edge to <img alt="b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, in which case <img alt="\frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} = 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>For each variable <img alt="b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, backpropagation stores in <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> a “temporary derivative/gradient” w.r.t. <img alt="b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Initially, <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_n = 1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_n+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_i = 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for <img alt="i &lt; n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3C+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. The backpropagation algorithm iterates over <img alt="i = n,n-1,\ldots,m+1" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+n%2Cn-1%2C%5Cldots%2Cm%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and performs the following updates in each iteration:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-4"><img alt="\begin{aligned}{\mathsf {grad}}_j \gets {\mathsf {grad}}_j + {\mathsf {grad}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} ,\ \textnormal{for all}\ j = 1,\ldots,i-1. &amp;&amp; (4) \end{aligned}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%5Cgets+%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%2B+%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%2C%5C+%5Ctextnormal%7Bfor+all%7D%5C+j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2Ci-1.+%26%26+%284%29+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>Of course, it suffices to update <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> only when there is an edge from <img alt="b_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> to <img alt="b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, because otherwise <img alt="\frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} = 0" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and the update does not change <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>.</p>



<p>The update rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-4">(4)</a> can be explained as a direct application of the chain rule as follows. If we know the values of <img alt="b_1,\ldots,b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we can evaluate the remaining variables <img alt="b_{i+1},\ldots,b_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%7Bi%2B1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> one by one, so in this sense, the output variable <img alt="c = b_n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+b_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is a function <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> of <img alt="b_1,\ldots,b_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>. Using the function <img alt="b_i = b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i+%3D+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>, we can relate functions <img alt="c_i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> and <img alt="c_{i-1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_%7Bi-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img alt="\begin{aligned}c_{i-1}(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1}) = c_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1}, b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})).\end{aligned}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7Dc_%7Bi-1%7D%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29+%3D+c_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%2C+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29%29.%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>By the chain rule,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-5"><img alt="\begin{aligned}\frac{\partial c_{i-1}}{\partial b_j} = \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_j} + \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_i} \cdot \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j},\ \text{for all}\ j = 1,\ldots, i-1. &amp;&amp; (5) \end{aligned}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_%7Bi-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D%2C%5C+%5Ctext%7Bfor+all%7D%5C+j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2C+i-1.+%26%26+%285%29+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/></p>



<p>The correspondence between <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-4">(4)</a> and <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-5">(5)</a> completes the explanation: if <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j = \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every <img alt="j \le i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%5Cle+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> before the update, we have <img alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j = \frac{\partial c_{i-1}}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_%7Bi-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> for every <img alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> after the update.

<p>A few hours ago <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/combinatorial_theory">the first issue of <em>Combinatorial Theory</em></a> was published. I am happy and proud to take part in this new endeavor. The editorial speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first issue of our new journal, </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. It is owned by mathematicians, dedicated to Diamond Open Access publishing with no fees for authors or readers, and committed to an inclusive view of the vibrant worldwide community in Combinatorics. The journal shares a similar scope with the long-running </em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A<em>(JCT A), owned by Elsevier. In 2020, almost all of the editors of JCT A resigned, deciding that it was the time to found a premier Combinatorics journal owned by mathematicians, not by a commercial publisher. Thus was born </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. That birth has allowed us to rethink how and what we publish. We are proud to have assembled a broad and diverse team of editors. We are also pleased with two new features in our editorial process: </em>doubly-anonymous refereeing<em> to mitigate implicit biases during peer review, and the inauguration of </em>Expository Article<em> submissions to encourage inclusion of valuable well-written expositions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have warm feelings toward <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A</em> and the earlier <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory</em> (before it split to Ser A and Ser B), which was among the first journals of combinatorics, had important role for the development of our field, and which is still running under new editors.</p>

    <title>Near-Optimal Distributed Degree+1 Colouring</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>
