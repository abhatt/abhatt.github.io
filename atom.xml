<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="822b">The year was 2005. I was applying for a PhD program in Computer Science in the top US universities. I have applied to 14 US universities. On Dec 2nd 2015, I received the following email (see the screenshot below) from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Penn Engineering, Office of Academic Programs, Graduate Admissions. I have redacted the name, email address and the phone numbers in the emails, to preserve their privacy.</p>
<p><img alt="upenn1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1226" src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/upenn1.png?w=660"/></p>
<p>Here are the photos of the original transcript (I received from IIT Kharagpur when I graduated) and the additional transcripts (I received from IIT Kharagpur when I requested them for my PhD application). They are all <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">laminated by IIT Kharagpur</strong> and sent to me. Feel free to laugh at my appearance on the transcript. I do too <img alt="&#x1F609;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p><img alt="kgp" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1227" src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/kgp.jpeg?w=660"/></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="e20e">IIT Kharagpur stated the following in their transcripts policy.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="60be"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Institute does not take responsibility of sending the duplicate copy of grade cards (transcripts) directly to other institutions/organizations, in connection with the applicants’ admission/employment etc.”</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a381">My reply to the above email and the response from UPenn are shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><img alt="upenn2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1228" src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/upenn2.png?w=660"/></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="1fc0">In Summary, UPenn was concerned that my transcript is laminated and opened. Surprised at their response (“Your application will not go any further with the opened transcript”), I have spent couple of hours searching online and discovered that there is a lot of scam involving fake degrees and fake transcripts. There are “professionals” in India and China creating the “highest quality fakes”. These fakes are often laminated. So, UPenn decided not to process any applications with opened and laminated credentials. All my credentials are valid and correct, but my application was not processed because IIT Kharagpur has no way to “securely send” valid transcripts and UPenn has no way to “efficiently validate applicants’ transcripts”.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0588">I have applied to 14 universities and some of them rejected me because ‘they found a better candidate’ or ‘the research group is not looking for new PhD students’ etc etc. But my UPenn application not going further because of an “inefficient and broken system” is frustrating, to say the least.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="291f">After a week, I have recovered from this frustration and went back to my daily routine of reading research papers on Theoretical Computer Science. I said to myself “I will get into one of the remaining 13 universities and I have to focus on research and resolve the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">P vs NP problem</a>” <img alt="&#x1F609;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bc4f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">On a lighter note:</strong> There is a simple way to verify that my transcript is valid — ‘Simply open it and look at my grades’. I have received several B’s, some C’s and even couple of D’s. My CGPA is just average. Nobody in their right senses would create a fake transcript with those grades <img alt="&#x1F642;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;"/> During the last decade, whenever I met any IITian I first set them up telling <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://shivakintali.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my credentials</a> (B-Tech from IIT Kharagpur, Masters from USC, PhD from GeorgiaTech, Taught at Princeton) and after they say “wow”, I bet with them that their CGPA at IIT is greater than mine. I never lost till date. I take pride in this fact <img alt="&#x1F609;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;"/> In my defense, I was an all-rounder at IIT Kharagpur, balancing studies, serving as a ‘secretary of fine arts, modeling and dramatics’ of my hostel, painting, learning guitar and many more things.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d9e1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A second incident:</strong> During summer 2010 (at the end of my fourth year as a PhD student at GeorgiaTech), I was offered an internship at Yahoo labs and the Yahoo HR team said they want to verify all my credentials (my IIT B-Tech degree, USC Master’s degree, work experience). Yahoo uses a third-party service to rigorously verify all credentials of potential employees / interns. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/farewell-yahoo-ceo-scott-thompson-ousted-for-a-resume-lie" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo fired their own CEO</a> when they found that he lied in his resume. This process is very rigorous, but very time-consuming. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">verification of all my credentials took more than couple of months</strong>. Meanwhile, I was waiting with my fingers-crossed (figuratively speaking) and hoping these verifications happen soon, so that I can start my internship and earn some serious summer money for two months and see a bank balance of more than $1,000 dollars for the first time during my grad school <img alt="&#x1F609;" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;"/></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="f5fc">Later that year, when I discovered Bitcoin white paper and the underlying Blockchain, my first thought was to use the technology to build a ‘document integrity platform’ to issue tamper-proof credentials (degrees, transcripts, employment certificates, Visas, Identity documents, driver’s license etc), which can be verified instantaneously and securely on the blockchain.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="96cb">Early 2011, I got busy with writing thesis and joined the CS department Princeton University in September 2011. I have spent the first couple of years teaching at Princeton, mining Bitcoin, keeping track of Blockchain news and hoping that somebody will develop a ‘document integrity platform’. To my relief, some entrepreneurs tried to develop a ‘credential verification solutions’. To my frustration, none of those solutions are perfect. So I started preparing myself to become a full-time entrepreneur and left Princeton in summer 2015.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="5810">Today, I am very glad we have a complete data integrity solution (for universities, employers and enterprises) and I am very excited that we are preventing fraud and corruption in several areas using our <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://truecerts.co/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TrueCerts</a> platform.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="e378">Every week I read several stories about fraud and corruption online (Eg: the recent <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_college_admissions_bribery_scandal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">college admissions scandal</a>). I approach the involved parties and explain how such instances can be rigorously prevented using technology.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="d84e">I feel very fortunate to have discovered an exciting vision towards a fraud-free and efficient future. This discovery happened through the above mentioned unfortunate events. Sometimes the lowest points in your life have the greatest potential to show you the right path to your highest points.</p></div>

    <link href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/04/good-article-terrible-headline.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/>
    <title>Good article, terrible headline</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">About a month ago (after my P NP poll appeared) I got email from Jacob Aron asking me some questions about it. One thing he was excited about was that the number of people who thought P vs NP would be solved in the next decade had increased from 11% to 22%. I told him that this also surprised me and <i>there had been no major advances to warrant that increase.</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
Then the article came out. Here is the pointer to the headline and the first few lines, the rest is behind a paywall<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2198151-we-could-solve-the-biggest-problem-in-maths-in-the-next-decade/">here</a><br/>
<br/>
You may notice that the headline is<br/>
<br/>
<i>We could solve the biggest problem in math in the next decade</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
I emailed Jacob to send me the article, which he did. The article was fine, even quoting me as saying that the increase of people who thought it would be solved soon was unwarranted.<br/>
<br/>
1) So, article fine, headline terrible.<br/>
<br/>
2)  A more honest headline would be<br/>
<br/>
<i>The Complexity Theory Community slightly more optimistic about when P vs NP will be resolved for no apparent reason.</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
3) More bad science:<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329780-400-turings-oracle-the-computer-that-goes-beyond-logic/">here</a><br/>
<br/>
Headline is<br/>
<br/>
<i>Turing's Oracle: The computer that goes beyond logic</i><br/>
<br/>
I think the article was about how a Turing Machine with an oracle for HALT can solve HALT. (If I am wrong about this let me know in the comments and I'll correct it.)<br/>
<br/>
4) More bad science:<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/finally-a-problem-that-only-quantum-computers-will-ever-be-able-to-solve-20180621/">here</a><br/>
<br/>
Headline<br/>
<br/>
<i>Finally, a problem that only Quantum Computers will ever be able to solve.</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
This was about the oracle such that BQP is not in PH. Really!<br/>
<br/>
5) I invite you to add your own.<br/>
<br/>
6) OKAY, so why is the press SO BAD at reporting on our field? And is it just our field? I have one explanation, though I am sure there are many.<br/>
<br/>
Our field is about showing the LIMITS of computation. Its hard to make that sexy so they ... lie? exaggerate. They themselves don't really understand our field? Note:<br/>
<br/>
To explain to someone who does not really know CS why its important to have an oracle where BQP is not in PH is hard<br/>
<br/>
To explain this to someone IN CS but not in Theory is still hard!<br/>
<br/>
To explain this to someone IN CS and even in CS Theory, but not complexity (e.g., algorithms) might be hard, though it may depend on the person.<br/>
<br/>
7) The old saying is `I don't care if you get the story wrong so long as you spell my name right' And indeed, they did spell my name right. So there is that! But more seriously and less about me or even the article that refers to my poll--- is it bad that science reporting is often wrong?<br/>
<br/>

    <title>Sylvester-Gallai type theorems for quadratic polynomials</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1555286400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Shpilka:Amir.html">Amir Shpilka</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06245">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We prove Sylvester-Gallai type theorems for quadratic polynomials.
Specifically, we prove that if a finite collection $\mathcal Q$, of irreducible
polynomials of degree at most $2$, satisfy that for every two polynomials
$Q_1,Q_2\in {\mathcal Q}$ there is a third polynomial $Q_3\in{\mathcal Q}$ so
that whenever $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ vanish then also $Q_3$ vanishes, then the linear
span of the polynomials in ${\mathcal Q}$ has dimension $O(1)$. We also prove a
colored version of the theorem: If three finite sets of quadratic polynomials
satisfy that for every two polynomials from distinct sets there is a polynomial
in the third set satisfying the same vanishing condition then all polynomials
are contained in an $O(1)$-dimensional space. This answers affirmatively two
conjectures of Gupta [ECCC 2014] that were raised in the context of solving
certain depth-$4$ polynomial identities. To obtain our main theorems we prove a
new result classifying the possible ways that a quadratic polynomial $Q$ can
vanish when two other quadratic polynomials vanish. Our proofs also require
robust versions of a theorem of Edelstein and Kelly (that extends the
Sylvester-Gallai theorem to colored sets).

matchings of a graph, is there a sequence of flip operations that transforms
one into the other? Here, a flip operation exchanges the edges in an
alternating cycle of length four. We are interested in the complexity of this
decision problem from the viewpoint of graph classes. We first prove that the
problem is PSPACE-complete even for split graphs and for bipartite graphs of
bounded bandwidth with maximum degree five. We then investigate polynomial-time
solvable cases. Specifically, we prove that the problem is solvable in
polynomial time for strongly orderable graphs (that include interval graphs and
strongly chordal graphs), for outerplanar graphs, and for cographs (also known
as $P_4$-free graphs). Furthermore, for each yes-instance from these graph

    <title>P-Optimal Proof Systems for Each Set in NP but no Complete Disjoint NP-pairs Relative to an Oracle</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1555286400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/d/Dose:Titus.html">Titus Dose</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06175">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Consider the following conjectures:
</p>
<p>- $\mathsf{DisjNP}$: there exist no many-one complete disjoint NP-pairs.
</p>
<p>- $\mathsf{SAT}$: there exist P-optimal proof systems for SAT.
</p>
<p>Pudl\'ak [Pud17] lists several conjectures (among these, $\mathsf{DisjNP}$
and $\mathsf{SAT}$) and asks for new equivalences or oracles that separate
corresponding relativized conjectures. We partially answer this question by
constructing an oracle relative to which
</p>
<p>- no many-one complete disjoint NP-pairs exist
</p>
<p>- and each problem in NP has a P-optimal proof system,
</p>
<p>i.e., there is no relativizable proof for
$\mathsf{DisjNP}\Rightarrow\mathsf{SAT}$. Since Khaniki [Kha19] constructs an
oracle showing that there exists no relativizable proof for the converse
implication, the conjectures $\mathsf{DisjNP}$ and $\mathsf{SAT}$ are
independent in a relativized way. In a similar way, our oracle shows that
$\mathsf{DisjNP}$ and $\mathsf{TFNP}$ as well as $\mathsf{DisjNP}$ and
$\mathsf{DisjCoNP}$ are also independent in a relativized way, where
$\mathsf{TFNP}$ is the conjecture that TFNP has complete elements with respect
to polynomial reductions and $\mathsf{DisjCoNP}$ is the conjecture that there
exist no many-one complete disjoint coNP-pairs.

Joint Linearity and TLLA workshops (part of FLOC 2018) held on July 7-8, 2018
in Oxford. Linearity has been a key feature in several lines of research in
both theoretical and practical approaches to computer science. On the
theoretical side there is much work stemming from linear logic dealing with
proof technology, complexity classes and more recently quantum computation. On
the practical side there is work on program analysis, expressive operational
semantics for programming languages, linear programming languages, program
transformation, update analysis and efficient implementation techniques. Linear
logic is not only a theoretical tool to analyse the use of resources in logic
and computation. It is also a corpus of tools, approaches, and methodologies
(proof nets, exponential decomposition, geometry of interaction, coherent
spaces, relational models, etc.) that were originally developed for the study
of linear logic's syntax and semantics and are nowadays applied in several
other fields.

    <title>Maximizing Online Utilization with Commitment</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Schwiegelshohn:Chris.html">Chris Schwiegelshohn</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Schwiegelshohn:Uwe.html">Uwe Schwiegelshohn</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06150">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We investigate online scheduling with commitment for parallel identical
machines. Our objective is to maximize the total processing time of accepted
jobs. As soon as a job has been submitted, the commitment constraint forces us
to decide immediately whether we accept or reject the job. Upon acceptance of a
job, we must complete it before its deadline $d$ that satisfies $d \geq
(1+\epsilon)\cdot p + r$, with $p$ and $r$ being the processing time and the
submission time of the job, respectively while $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the slack of the
system. Since the hard case typically arises for near-tight deadlines, we
consider $\varepsilon\leq 1$. We use competitive analysis to evaluate our
algorithms. Our first main contribution is a deterministic preemptive online
algorithm with an almost tight competitive ratio on any number of machines. For
a single machine, the competitive factor matches the optimal bound
$\frac{1+\epsilon}{\epsilon}$ of the greedy acceptance policy. Then the
competitive ratio improves with an increasing number of machines and approaches
$(1+\epsilon)\cdot\ln \frac{1+\epsilon}{\epsilon}$ as the number of machines
converges to infinity. This is an exponential improvement over the greedy
acceptance policy for small $\epsilon$. In the non-preemptive case, we present
a deterministic algorithm on $m$ machines with a competitive ratio of $1+m\cdot
\left(\frac{1+\epsilon}{\epsilon}\right)^{\frac{1}{m}}$. This matches the
optimal bound of $2+\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ of the greedy acceptance policy for a
single machine while it again guarantees an exponential improvement over the
greedy acceptance policy for small $\epsilon$ and large $m$. In addition, we
determine an almost tight lower bound that approaches $m\cdot
\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{\frac{1}{m}}$ for large $m$ and small
$\epsilon$.

    <title>Parametrised Complexity of Model Checking and Satisfiability in Propositional Dependence Logic</title>

in the field of Dependence Logics which finds its origin in the Dependence
Logic of V\"a\"an\"anen from 2007. We study a propositional variant of this
logic (PDL) and investigate a variety of parametrisations with respect to the
central decision problems. The model checking problem (MC) of PDL is
NP-complete. The subject of this research is to identify a list of
parametrisations (formula-size, treewidth, treedepth, team-size, number of
variables) under which MC becomes fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, we
show that the number of disjunctions or the arity of dependence atoms
(dep-arity) as a parameter both yield a paraNP-completeness result. Then, we
consider the satisfiability problem (SAT) showing a different picture: under
team-size, or dep-arity SAT is paraNP-complete whereas under all other
mentioned parameters the problem is in FPT. Finally, we introduce a variant of
the satisfiability problem, asking for teams of a given size, and show for this
problem an almost complete picture.

values of single-particle operators in bosonic and fermionic multi-particle
product states. Such expectation values appear, in particular, in
full-counting-statistics problems. Depending on the initial multi-product
state, the expectation values may be either easy to compute (the required
number of operations scales polynomially with the particle number) or hard to
compute (at least as hard as a permanent of a matrix). However, if we only
consider full counting statistics in a finite number of final single-particle
states, then the full-counting-statistics generating function becomes easy to
compute in all the analyzed cases. We prove the latter statement for the
general case of the fermionic product state and for the single-boson product
state (the same as used in the boson-sampling proposal). This result may be
relevant for using multi-particle product states as a resource for quantum
computing.

    <title>The Lanczos Algorithm Under Few Iterations: Concentration and Location of the Ritz Values</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1555286400</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Jorge Garza Vargas, Archit Kulkarni <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06012">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We study the Lanczos algorithm where the initial vector is sampled uniformly
from $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. We show
that when run for few iterations, the output of the algorithm on $A$ is almost
deterministic. For instance, we show that there exists $c &gt;0$ depending only on
a certain global property of the spectrum of $A$ (in particular, not depending
on $n$) such that when Lanczos is run for at most $c \log n$ iterations, the
Jacobi coefficients and the Ritz values deviate from their medians by $t$ with
probability at most $e^{-\sqrt{n} t^2}$, for $t&lt;\Vert A \Vert_{\text{op}}$.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we show that the Lanczos algorithm fails with high probability
to identify outliers of the spectrum when run for at most $c' \log n$
iterations, where again $c'$ depends only on the same global property of the
spectrum of $A$. Classical results imply that the bound $c' \log n$ is tight up
to a constant factor.
</p>
<p>Our techniques also yield asymptotic results: Suppose we have a sequence of
Hermitian matrices $A_n \in M_n(\mathbb{C})$ whose spectral distributions
converge in Kolmogorov distance with rate $O(n^{-\varepsilon})$ to a density,
for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Then we show that for large enough $n$, and for
$k=O(\sqrt{\log n})$, the Ritz values after $k$ iterations concentrate around
the roots of the $k$th orthogonal polynomial with respect to the limiting
density.

every vertex ranks its neighbors in a strict order of preference. A matching
$M$ in $G$ is popular if $M$ does not lose a head-to-head election against any
matching $N$. That is, $\phi(M,N) \ge \phi(N,M)$ where $\phi(M,N)$ (similarly,
$\phi(N,M)$) is the number of votes for $M$ (resp., $N$) in the $M$-vs-$N$
election. Popular matchings are a well-studied generalization of stable
matchings, introduced with the goal of enlarging the set of admissible
solutions, while maintaining a certain level of fairness. Stable matchings are,
in fact, popular matchings of minimum size. Unfortunately, unlike in the case
of stable matchings, it is NP-hard to find a popular matching of minimum cost,
when a linear cost function is given on the edge set -- even worse, the
min-cost popular matching problem is hard to approximate up to any factor.
</p>
<p>The goal of this paper is to obtain efficient algorithms for computing
desirable matchings (wrt cost) by paying the price of mildly relaxing
popularity. Call a matching $M$ quasi-popular if $\phi(M,N) \ge \phi(N,M)/2$
for every matching $N$. Our main positive result is a bi-criteria algorithm
that finds in polynomial time a quasi-popular matching of cost at most opt,
where opt is the cost of a min-cost popular matching. Key to the algorithm are
a number of results for certain polytopes related to matchings and that we
believe to be of independent interest. In particular, we give a polynomial-size
extended formulation for an integral polytope sandwiched between the popular
and quasi-popular matching polytopes. We complement these results by showing
that it is NP-hard to find a quasi-popular matching of minimum cost, and that
both the popular and quasi-popular matching polytopes have near-exponential
extension complexity.

datasets, we explore the use of coreset to reduce the communication overhead.
Coreset is a summary of the original dataset in the form of a small weighted
set in the same sample space. Compared to other data summaries, coreset has the
advantage that it can be used as a proxy of the original dataset, potentially
for different applications. However, existing coreset construction algorithms
are each tailor-made for a specific machine learning problem. Thus, to solve
different machine learning problems, one has to collect coresets of different
types, defeating the purpose of saving communication overhead. We resolve this
dilemma by developing coreset construction algorithms based on k-means/median
clustering, that give a provably good approximation for a broad range of
machine learning problems with sufficiently continuous cost functions. Through
evaluations on diverse datasets and machine learning problems, we verify the
robust performance of the proposed algorithms.

    <title>Monochromatic grids in colored grids</title>
    <summary>Color the points of an grid with two colors. How big a monochromatic grid-like subset can you find? By “grid-like” I mean that it should be possible to place equally many horizontal and vertical lines, partitioning the plane into cells each of which contains a single point.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Color the points of an  grid with two colors. How big a monochromatic grid-like subset can you find? By “grid-like” I mean that it should be possible to place equally many horizontal and vertical lines, partitioning the plane into  cells each of which contains a single point.</p>

<p>So for the coloring of the  grid below, there are several  monochromatic grid-like subsets. The image below shows one, and the completely red and blue southwest and northeast quadrants provide two others.
The blue quadrant prevents any red grid-like subset from being larger than , and vice versa, so these are the largest grid-like subsets in this grid.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Monochromatic grid-like subset in a colored grid" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/subgrid.svg"/></p>

<p>It’s not hard to prove that there always exists a monochromatic grid-like subset of size at least .
Just use vertical and horizontal lines to partition the big grid into blocks of that size. If one of those blocks is monochromatic, then it’s the grid-like subset you’re looking for. And if not, you can choose a red point from each block to get a grid-like subset of the same size.</p>

<p>In the other direction, there exist colorings of an  grid for which the largest monochromatic grid-like subset has size only a little bigger, . To find such a coloring, partition the big grid into square blocks of size , and make each block monochromatic with a randomly chosen color.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Coloring a grid by dividing into square blocks and coloring each block randomly" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/blocked-coloring.svg"/></p>

<p>Now, consider any partition by axis-parallel lines into (irregular) rectangles, each containing one of the points of a grid-like subset.  Only one row or column of the rectangles can cross each line of the partition into square blocks, so the number of rectangles that include parts of two or more square blocks is . Any remaining rectangles of the partition must come from a grid-like subset of square blocks that are all colored the same as each other. But with a random coloring, the expected size of this largest monochromatic subset of square blocks is . Therefore, the number of rectangles that stay within a single square block is limited to the total number of points in this grid-like subset of square blocks, which is again .</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to eliminate the remaining  gap between these two bounds, or which way it should go.</p>

<p>One application of these ideas involves the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpattern">superpatterns</a>, permutations that contain as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_pattern">pattern</a> every smaller permutation up to some size .
If  is a superpattern for the permutations of size , then we can obtain a point set by interpreting the position and value of each element of  as Cartesian coordinates. This point set includes a grid-like subset of size , coming from a permutation of size  that translates to a grid-like set of points.
If the elements of the superpattern are colored with two colors, there still exists a monochromatic grid-like subset of size .
And this monochromatic grid-like subset corresponds to a superpattern, for permutations of size . So, whenever the elements of a superpattern are colored with two (or finitely many) colors, there remains a monochromatic subset of elements that is still a superpattern for permutations of some smaller but non-constant size.</p>

    <title>TR19-057 |  Proof Complexity of Symmetry Learning in QBF | 

	Joshua Blinkhorn, 

	Olaf Beyersdorff</title>
    <summary>For quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), a resolution system with a symmetry rule was recently introduced by Kauers and Seidl (Inf. Process. Lett. 2018). In this system, many formulas hard for QBF resolution admit short proofs.

Kauers and Seidl apply the symmetry rule on symmetries of the original formula. Here we propose a new formalism where symmetries are dynamically recomputed during the proof on restrictions of the original QBF. This presents a theoretical model for the potential use of symmetry learning as an inprocessing rule in QCDCL solving.

We demonstrate the power of symmetry learning by proving an exponential separation between Q-resolution with the symmetry rule and Q-resolution with our new symmetry learning rule. In fact, we show that bounding the number of symmetry recomputations gives rise to a hierarchy of QBF resolution systems of strictly increasing strength.</summary>

    <title>TR19-056 |  A Lower Bound for Relaxed Locally Decodable Codes | 

	Tom Gur, 

	Oded Lachish</title>
    <summary>A locally decodable code (LDC) C:{0,1}^k -&gt; {0,1}^n is an error correcting code wherein individual bits of the message can be recovered by only querying a few bits of a noisy codeword. LDCs found a myriad of applications both in theory and in practice, ranging from probabilistically checkable proofs to distributed storage. However, despite nearly two decades of extensive study, the best known constructions of O(1)-query LDCs have super-polynomial blocklength.

The notion of relaxed LDCs is a natural relaxation of LDCs, which aims to bypass the foregoing barrier by requiring local decoding of nearly all individual message bits, yet allowing decoding failure (but not error) on the rest. State of the art constructions of O(1)-query relaxed LDCs achieve blocklength n = O(k^{1+ \gamma}) for an arbitrarily small constant \gamma.

We prove a lower bound which shows that O(1)-query relaxed LDCs cannot achieve blocklength n = k^{1+ o(1)}. This resolves an open problem raised by Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004).</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The study of entanglement through the length of interactive proof systems has been one of the most productive applications of complexity theory to the physical sciences that I know of. Last week Anand Natarajan and John Wright, postdoctoral scholars at Caltech and MIT respectively, added a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">major stone</a> to this line of work. Anand &amp; John (hereafter “NW”) establish the following wild claim: it is possible for a classical polynomial-time verifier to decide membership in any language in <em>non-deterministic doubly exponential time</em> by asking questions to two infinitely powerful, but untrusted, provers sharing entanglement. In symbols, NEEXP <img alt="{\subseteq}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csubseteq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\subseteq}"/> MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>! (The last symbol is for emphasis — no, we don’t have an MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>! class — yet.)</p>
<p>What is amazing about this result is the formidable gap between the complexity of the verifier and the complexity of the language being verified. We know since the 90s that the use of interaction and randomness can greatly expand the power of polynomial-time verifiers, from NP to <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=146609">PSPACE</a> (with a single prover) and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2794945">NEXP</a> (with two provers). As a result of the work of Natarajan and Wright, we now know that yet an additional ingredient, the use of <em>entanglement</em> between the provers, can be leveraged by the verifier — the same verifier as in the previous results, a classical randomized polynomial-time machine — to obtain an exponential increase in its verification power. Randomness and interaction brought us one exponential; entanglement gives us another.</p>
<p>To gain intuition for the result consider first the structure of a classical two-prover one-round interactive proof system for non-deterministic doubly exponential time, with exponential-time verifier. Cutting some corners, such a protocol can be obtained by “scaling up” a standard two-prover protocol for non-deterministic singly exponential time. In the protocol, the verifier would sample a pair of exponential-length questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/>, send <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> to each prover, receive answers <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/>, and perform an exponential-time computation that verifies some predicate about <img alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}"/>.</p>
<p>How can entanglement help design an <em>exponentially more efficient</em> protocol? At first it may seem like a polynomial-time verifier has no way to even get started: if it can only communicate polynomial-length messages with the provers, how can it leverage their power? And indeed, if the provers are classical, it can’t: it is known that even with a polynomial number of provers, and polynomially many rounds of interaction, a polynomial-time verifier cannot decide any language beyond NEXP.</p>
<p>But the provers in the NW protocol are not classical. They can share entanglement. How can the verifier exploit this to its advantage? The key property that is needed is know as the <em>rigidity</em> of entanglement. In words, rigidity is the idea that by verifying the presence of certain statistical correlations between the provers’ questions and answers the verifier can determine precisely (up to a local change of basis) the quantum state and measurements that the provers must have been using to generate their answers. The most famous example of rigidity is the <em>CHSH game</em>: as already shown by <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/AIHPA_1988__49_2_215_0/">Werner and Summers</a> in 1982, the CHSH game can only be optimally, or even near-optimally, won by measuring a maximally entangled state using two mutually unbiased bases for each player. No other state or measurements will do, unless they trivially imply an EPR pair and mutually unbiased bases (such as a state that is the tensor product of an EPR pair with an additional entangled state).</p>
<p>Rigidity gives the verifier control over the provers’ use of their entanglement. The simplest use of this is for the verifier to force the provers to share a certain number <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> of EPR pairs and measure them to obtain identical uniformly distributed <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings. Such a test for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> EPR pairs can be constructed from <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> CHSH games. In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03821">paper</a> with Natarajan we give a more efficient test that only requires questions and answers of length that is poly-logarithmic in <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>. Interestingly, the test is built on classical machinery — the low-degree test — that plays a central role in the analysis of some classical multi-prover proof systems for NEXP.</p>
<p>At this point we have made an inch of progress: it is possible for a polynomial-time (in <img alt="{n=\log N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D%5Clog+N%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n=\log N}"/>) verifier to “command” two quantum provers sharing entanglement to share <img alt="{N=2^n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%3D2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N=2^n}"/> EPR pairs, and measure them in identical bases to obtain identical uniformly random <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings. What is this useful for? Not much — yet. But here comes the main insight in NW: suppose we could similarly force the provers to generate, not identical uniformly random strings, but a pair of <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/>-bit strings <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> that is distributed as a pair of questions from the verifier in the aforementioned interactive proof system for NEEXP with exponential-time (in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) verifier. Then we could use a polynomial-time (in <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>) verifier to “command” the provers to generate their exponentially-long questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> by themselves. The provers would then compute answers <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A,B)}"/> as in the NEEXP protocol. Finally, they would prove to the verifier, using a polynomial interaction, that <img alt="{(A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A,B)}"/> is a valid pair of answers to the pair of questions <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> — indeed, the latter verification is an NEXP problem, hence can be verified using a protocol with polynomial-time verifier.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy? Yes. But they did it! Of course there are many issues with the brief summary above — for example, how does the verifier even know the questions <img alt="{X,Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%2CY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X,Y}"/> sampled by the provers? The answer is that it doesn’t need to know the entire question; only that it was sampled correctly, and that the quadruple <img alt="{(X,Y,A,B)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%2CA%2CB%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y,A,B)}"/> satisfies the verification predicate of the exponential-time verifier. This can be verified using a polynomial-time interactive proof.</p>
<p>Diving in, the most interesting insight in the NW construction is what they call “introspection”. What makes multi-prover proof systems powerful is the ability for the verifier to send correlated questions to the provers, in a way such that each prover has only partial information about the other’s question — informally, the verifier plays a variant of prisonner’s dilemma with the provers. In particular, any interesting distribution <img alt="{(X,Y)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28X%2CY%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(X,Y)}"/> will have the property that <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> are not fully correlated. For a concrete example think of the “planes-vs-lines” distribution, where <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/> is a uniformly random plane and <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> a uniformly random line in <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. The aforementioned test for <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{N}"/> EPR pairs can be used to force both provers to sample the same uniformly random plane <img alt="{X}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{X}"/>. But how does the verifier ensure that one of the provers “forgets” parts of the plane, to only remember a uniformly random line <img alt="{Y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{Y}"/> that is contained in it? NW’s insight is that the information present in a quantum state — such as the prover’s half-EPR pairs — can be “erased” by commanding the prover to perform a measurement in the <em>wrong</em> basis — a basis that is mutually unbiased with the basis used by the other prover to obtain its share of the query. Building on this idea, NW develop a battery of delicate tests that provide the verifier the ability to control precisely what information gets distributed to each prover. This allows a polynomial-time verifier to perfectly simulate the local environment that the exponential-time verifier would have created for the provers in a protocol for NEEXP, thus simulating the latter protocol with exponentially less resources.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of the NW result I like best is that they showed how the “history state barrier” could be overcome. Previous works attempting to establish strong lower bounds on the class MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/>, such as the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12166">paper</a> by Yuen et al., relies on a compression technique that requires the provers to share a history state of the computation performed by a larger protocol. Unfortunately, history states are very non-robust, and as a result such works only succeeded in developing protocols with vanishing completeness-soundness gap. NW entirely bypass the use of history states, and this allows them to maintain a constant gap.</p>
<p>Seven years ago Tsuyoshi Ito and I showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0550">MIP<img alt="{}^\star" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7D%5E%5Cstar&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{}^\star"/> contains NEXP</a>. At the time, we thought this may be the end of the story — although it seemed challenging, surely someone would eventually prove a matching upper bound. Natarajan and Wright have defeated this expectation by showing that MIP<img alt="{^\star}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5E%5Cstar%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{^\star}"/> contains NEEXP. What next? NEEEXP? The halting problem? I hope to make this the topic of a future post.</p></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was saddened about the results of the Israeli election.  The Beresheet lander, which lost its engine and crashed onto the moon as I was writing this, seems like a fitting symbol for where the country is now headed.  Whatever he was at the start of his career, Netanyahu has become the Israeli Trump—a breathtakingly corrupt strongman who appeals to voters’ basest impulses, sacrifices his country’s future and standing in the world for short-term electoral gain, considers himself unbound by laws, recklessly incites hatred of minorities, and (despite zero personal piety) cynically panders to religious fundamentalists who help keep him in power.  Just like with Trump, it’s probably futile to hope that lawyers will swoop in and free the nation from the demagogue’s grip: legal systems simply aren’t designed for assaults of this magnitude.</p>



<p>(If, for example, you were designing the US Constitution, how would you guard against a presidential candidate who <em>openly</em> supported and was supported by a hostile foreign power, and won anyway?  Would it even occur to you to include such possibilities in your definitions of concepts like “treason” or “collusion”?)</p>



<p>The original Zionist project—the secular, democratic vision of Herzl and Ben-Gurion and Weizmann and Einstein, which the Nazis turned from a dream to a necessity—matters more to me than most things in this world, and that was true even before I’d spent time in Israel and before I had a wife and kids who are Israeli citizens.  It would be depressing if, after a century of wildly improbable victories against external threats, Herzl’s project were finally to eat itself from the inside.  Of course I have analogous worries (scaled up by two orders of magnitude) for the US—not to mention the UK, India, Brazil, Poland, Hungary, the Philippines … the world is now engaged in a massive test of whether Enlightenment liberalism can long endure, or whether it’s just a metastable state between one Dark Age and the next.  (And to think that people have accused me of uncritical agreement with Steven Pinker, the world’s foremost optimist!)</p>



<p>In times like this, one takes one’s happiness where one can find it.</p>



<p>So, yeah: I’m happy that there’s now an “image of a black hole” (or rather, of radio waves being bent around a black hole’s silhouette).  If you really want to understand what the now-ubiquitous image is showing, I strongly recommend <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com/2019/04/09/a-non-experts-guide-to-a-black-holes-silhouette/">this guide</a> by Matt Strassler.</p>



<p>I’m happy that integer multiplication can apparently <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/papers/nlogn/">now be done</a> in O(n log n), capping a decades-long quest (see also <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">here</a>).</p>



<p>I’m happy that there’s now apparently a spectacular fossil record of the first minutes after the asteroid impact that ended the Cretaceous period.  Even better will be if this finally proves that, yes, some non-avian dinosaurs were still alive on impact day, and had not gone extinct due to unrelated climate changes slightly earlier.  (Last week, my 6-year-old daughter sang a song in a school play about how “no one knows what killed the dinosaurs”—the verses ran through the asteroid and several other possibilities.  I wonder if they’ll retire that song next year.)  If you haven’t yet read it, the <em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died">New Yorker</a></em><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-day-the-dinosaurs-died"> piece on this</a> is a must.</p>



<p>I’m happy that my good friend Zach Weinersmith (legendary author of <a href="http://smbc-comics.com/">SMBC Comics</a>), as well as the GMU economist Bryan Caplan (rabblerousing author of <em>The Case Against Education</em>, which I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3678">reviewed here</a>), have a new book out: a graphic novel that makes a moral and practical case for open borders (!).  Their book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Open-Borders-Science-Ethics-Immigration/dp/1250316979/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=A2TM1SK1AE3QXC3DEC99">now available for pre-order</a>, and at least at some point cracked Amazon’s top 10.  Just last week I met Bryan for the first time, when he visited UT Austin to give a talk based on the book.  He said that meeting me (having known me only from the blog) was like meeting a fictional character; I said the feeling was mutual.  And as for Bryan’s talk?  It felt great to spend an hour visiting a fantasyland where the world’s economies are run by humane rationalist technocrats, and where walls are going down rather than up.</p>



<p>I’m happy that, according to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true">this </a><em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true">Vanity Fair</a></em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/02/men-are-scum-inside-facebook-war-on-hate-speech?verso=true"> article</a>, Facebook will still ban you for writing that “men are scum” <em>or</em> that “women are scum”—having ultimately rejected the demands of social-justice activists that it ban only the latter sentence, not the former.  According to the article, everyone on Facebook’s Community Standards committee agreed with the activists that this was the right result: dehumanizing comments about women have no place on the platform, while (superficially) dehumanizing comments about men are an important part of feminist consciousness-raising that require protection.  The problem was simply that the committee couldn’t come up with any <em>general principle</em> that would yield that desired result, without also yielding bad results in other cases.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the 737 Max jets are grounded and will hopefully be fixed, with no thanks to the FAA.  Strangely, while this was still the top news story, I gave a short talk about quantum computing to a group of Boeing executives who were visiting UT Austin on a previously scheduled trip.  The title of the session they put me in?  “Disruptive Computation.”</p>



<p>I’m happy that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg">Greta Thunberg</a>, the 15-year-old Swedish climate activist, has attracted a worldwide following and might win the Nobel Peace Prize.  I hope she does—and more importantly, I hope her personal story will help galvanize the world into accepting things that it already knows are true, as with the example of Anne Frank (or for that matter, Gandhi or MLK).  Confession: back when I was an adolescent, I often daydreamed about doing exactly what Thunberg is doing right now, leading a worldwide children’s climate movement.  I didn’t, of course.  In my defense, I wouldn’t have had the charisma for it anyway—and also, I got sidetracked by even more pressing problems, like working out the quantum query complexity of recursive Fourier sampling.  But fate seems to have made an excellent choice in Thunberg.  She’s not the prop of any adult—just a nerdy girl with Asperger’s who formed the idea to sit in front of Parliament every day to protest the destruction of the world, because she couldn’t understand why everyone else wasn’t.</p>



<p>I’m happy that the college admissions scandal has finally forced Americans to confront the farcical injustice of our current system—a system where elite colleges pretend to peer into applicants’ souls (or the souls of the essay consultants hired by the applicants’ parents?), and where they preen about the moral virtue of their “holistic, multidimensional” admissions criteria, which amount in practice to shutting out brilliant working-class Asian kids in favor of legacies and rich badminton players.  Not to horn-toot, but Steven Pinker and I tried to raise the alarm about this travesty five years ago (see for example <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">this post</a>), and were both severely criticized for it.  I do worry, though, that people will draw <em>precisely</em> the wrong lessons from the scandal.  If, for example, a few rich parents resorted to outright cheating on the SAT—all their other forms of gaming and fraud apparently being insufficient—then the SAT itself must be to blame so we should get rid of it.  In reality, the SAT (whatever its flaws) is almost the only bulwark we have against the <em>complete</em> collapse of college admissions offices into nightclub bouncers.  <a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY">This </a><em><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY">Quillette</a></em><a href="https://quillette.com/2019/03/13/standardized-testing-and-meritocracy/?fbclid=IwAR0mvO48sFgBps3mrSJ0bdK-qGzmiFd06vG6Au6enANaBC5Qh_YAa9tloJY"> article</a> says it much better than I can.</p>



<p>I’m happy that there will a <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">symposium from May 6-9</a> at the University of Toronto, to honor Stephen Cook and the (approximate) 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the discovery of NP-completeness.  I’m happy that I’ll be attending and speaking there.  If you’re interested, there’s still time to register!</p>



<p>Finally, I’m happy about the following “Sierpinskitaschen” baked by CS grad student and friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://twitter.com/optimistsinc?lang=en">Jess Sorrell</a>, and included with her permission (Jess says she got the idea from <a href="https://seattlelocalfood.com/2011/03/20/sierpinski-hamantaschen-sierpinskitaschen/?fbclid=IwAR1Qvoe8OYFXGbcke8u8XBS40tJMG2SkdJ8RI34u3CTSdjB2Fk1uob4OKzo">Debs Gardner</a>).</p>

    <title>Elwyn Berlekamp Died April 9, 2019</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elwyn R. Berlekamp entered this world on Sept 6, 1940, and left it on April 9, 2019.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwyn_Berlekamp">Wikipedia</a> calls him <i>An American Mathematician</i> which seems to narrow to me. He worked on a variety of topics which were Math, Comp Sci, finance, and likely others --- if you know any that I missed leave comments.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the things he worked on:<br/>
<br/>
1) Factoring Polynomials over large finite fields (See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2004849?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a> from 1970)<br/>
<br/>
I quote the abstract<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
This paper reviews some of the known algorithms for factoring polynomials over finite fields and presents a new deterministic procedure for reducing the problem of factoring an arbitrary polynomial over the Galois field GP(p<sup>m</sup>) to the problem of finding roots in GF(p) of certain other polynomials over GP(p). The amount of computation and the storage space required by these algorithms are algebraic in both the degree of the polynomial to be factored and the log of the order of the field.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Certain observations on the application of these methods to factorization of polynomials over the rational integers are also included. </blockquote>
I think he meant what we would call polynomial time when he says algebraic.<br/>
<br/>
2) Combinatorial Games. He co-wrote the classic Winning Ways For your Mathematical Plays with John Conway and Richard Guy.  These books are like NIM on steroids. They are FUN and have some serious math in them. (My blog system thinks Combinatorial is not a word. It is wrong)<br/>
<br/>
3) Combinatorial Games. He was very interested in Go via Combinatorial Games. I have an article (alas, not online) by him entitled Introductory Overview of Mathematical Go Endgames.  There has been further work on this that is on the web, see <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wqy/research/Honor%20Thesis.pdf">here</a>. I wonder what ERB would think of the ALPHAGO program.<br/>
<br/>
4) Berlekamp-Massey Algorithm finds the shortest linear feedback shift register for a given binary output sequence.<br/>
<br/>
5) Berlekamp-Welch Algorithm efficiently corrects errors in Reed-Solomon codes.  (Berlekamp also wrote a book on Algebraic Coding Theory.)<br/>
<br/>
6) I didn't know about his work in finance until I began writing this, but the following quote from Wikipedia is impressive<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
In 1989, Berlekamp purchased the largest interest in a trading company named Axcom Trading Advisors. After the firm's futures trading algorithms were rewritten, Axcom's Medallion Fund had a return (in 1990) of 55%, net of all management fees and transaction costs. The fund has subsequently continued to realize annualized returns exceeding 30% under management by James Harris Simons and his Renaissance Technologies Corporation.</blockquote></div>

    <title>Coloring kinggraphs</title>
    <summary>Draw a collection of quadrilaterals in the plane, meeting edge to edge, so that they don’t surround any open space (the region they cover is a topological disk) and every vertex interior to the disk touches at least four quadrilaterals. Is it always possible to color the corners of the quadrilaterals with four colors so that all four colors appear in each quadrilateral?</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Draw a collection of quadrilaterals in the plane, meeting edge to edge, so that they don’t surround any open space (the region they cover is a topological disk) and every vertex interior to the disk touches at least four quadrilaterals. Is it always possible to color the corners of the quadrilaterals with four colors so that all four colors appear in each quadrilateral?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="4-colored kinggraph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/colored-kinggraph.svg"/></p>

<p>The graph of corners and quadrilateral edges is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaregraph">squaregraph</a> but this question is really about coloring a different and related graph, called a kinggraph, that also includes as edges the diagonals of each quad. It’s called that because one example of this kind of graph is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_graph">king’s graph</a> describing the possible moves of a chess king on a chessboard.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="The king's graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/kings-graph.svg"/></p>

<p>The king’s graph, and kinggraphs more generally, are examples of 1-planar graphs, graphs drawn in the plane in such a way that each edge is crossed at most once. The edges of the underlying squaregraph are not crossed at all, and the diagonals of each quad only cross each other. Squaregraphs are bipartite (like every planar graph in which all faces have an even number of edges), so they can be colored with only two colors. 1-planar graphs, in general, can require six colors (for instance you can draw the complete graph  as a 1-planar graph by adding diagonals to the squares of a triangular prism) and this is tight.
And you can easily 4-color the king’s graph by using two colors in alternation across the even rows of the chessboard, and a different two colors across the odd rows. So the number of colors for kinggraphs should be somewhere between these two extremes, but where?</p>

<p>One useful and general graph coloring method is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a> of graphs. This is the largest number  such that every subgraph has a vertex with at most  neighbors; one can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring">greedy coloring algorithm</a> to color any graph with  colors. Kinggraphs themselves always have a vertex with at most  neighbors, but unfortunately they do not have degeneracy . If you form a king’s graph on a  chessboard, and then remove its four corners, you get a subgraph in which all vertices have at least four neighbors.
This turns out to be as large as possible: every kinggraph has degeneracy at most four. This is because, if you consider the zones of the system of quads (strips of quads connected on opposite pairs of edges), there always exists an “outer zone”, a zone with nothing on one side of it (see the illustration, below). You can remove the vertices of the outer zone one at a time, in order from one end to the other, always removing a vertex of degree at most four, and then repeat on another outer zone until the whole graph is gone. So the degeneracy and greedy coloring method shows that you can 5-color every kinggraph, better than the 6-coloring that we get for arbitrary 1-planar graphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="An outer zone" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/outer-zone.svg"/></p>

<p>This turns out to be optimal! For a while I thought that every kinggraph must be 4-colorable, because it was true of all the small examples that I tried. But it’s not true in general, and here’s why. If you look at the zones of the 4-colored kinggraph above, you might notice a pattern. The edges that connect pairs of quads from the same zone have colorings that alternate between two different pairs of colors. For instance, we might have a zone that has red–yellow edges alternating with blue–green edges, or another zone that has red–blue edges alternating with green–yellow edges. This is true whenever a kinggraph can be 4-colored. But there are only three ways of coloring a zone (that is, of partitioning the four colors into two disjoint pairs, which alternate along the zone). And when two zones cross each other, they must be colored differently. So every 4-coloring of a kinggraph turns into a 3-coloring of its zones. But the graph that describes the zones and its crossings is a triangle-free <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graph</a>, and vice versa: every triangle-free circle graph describes a kinggraph. And triangle-free circle graphs may sometimes need as many as five colors, in which case so does the corresponding kinggraph.</p>

<p>I posted <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2008/03/23/ageevs-squaregraph.html">an example of a squaregraph whose circle graph needs five colors</a> on this blog in 2008. Here’s a slightly different drawing of the same graph from <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/05/29/congratulations-dr-wortman.html">a later post</a>.
Because its circle graph is not 3-colorable, the corresponding kinggraph is not 4-colorable.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="A squaregraph whose kinggraph is not 4-colorable" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2009/cd220c.svg"/></p>

<p>There are simpler examples of squaregraphs whose circle graph needs four colors. As long as the number of colors of the circle graph is more than three, the number of colors of the kinggraph will be more than four.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you can color the circle graph with three colors, then it’s also possible to translate this 3-coloring of zones back into a 4-coloring of the kinggraph. Just remove an outer zone, color the remaining graph recursively, add the removed zone back, and use the color of the zone you removed to decide which colors to assign to its vertices. Unfortunately, I don’t know the computational complexity of testing whether a circle graph is 3-colorable. There was a conference paper by Walter Unger in 1992 that claimed to have a polynomial time algorithm, but without enough details and it was never published in a journal. I think we have to consider the problem of finding a coloring as still being open.</p>

<p>The same method also leads to an easy calculation of the number of 4-colorings (in the same sense) of the usual kind of chessboard with  squares, or of a king’s graph with  vertices. In this case, the zones are just the rows and columns of the chessboard. We can use one color for the rows and two for the columns, or vice versa, so the number of 3-colorings of the zones (accounting for the fact that the 2-colorings get counted twice) is . And once the coloring of the zones is chosen, the coloring of the chessboard itself is uniquely determined by the color of any of its squares, so the total number of chessboard colorings is .</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Vertex connectivity is a classic extensively-studied problem. Given an integer k, its goal is to decide if an <img alt="n" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="n"/>-node <img alt="m" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m"/>-edge graph can be disconnected by removing <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> vertices. Although a <img alt="O(m)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(m)"/>-time algorithm was postulated since 1974 [Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman], and despite its sibling problem of edge connectivity being resolved over two decades ago [Karger STOC’96], so far no vertex connectivity algorithms are faster than <img alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^2)"/> time even for <img alt="k = 4" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+4&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k = 4"/> and <img alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m = O(n)"/>. In the simplest case where <img alt="m = O(n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%3D+O%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="m = O(n)"/> and <img alt="k = O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3D+O%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k = O(1)"/>, the <img alt="O(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="O(n^2)"/> bound dates five decades back to [Kleitman IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory’69]. For the general case, the best bound is <img alt="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28+%5Cmin%7B+kn%5E2%2C+n%5E%5Comega+%2B+nk%5E%5Comega+%7D+%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}( \min{ kn^2, n^\omega + nk^\omega } )"/> [Henzinger, Rao, Gabow FOCS’96; Linial, Lovász, Wigderson FOCS’86].</p>
<p>In this talk, I will present a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm with <img alt="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28m+%2B+k%5E3+n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}(m + k^3 n)"/> time. This algorithm proves the conjecture by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman when <img alt="k=O(1)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k=O(1)"/> up to a polylog factor, breaks the 50-year-old bound by Kleitman, is fastest for <img alt="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=4+%3C+k+%3C+n%5E%7B0.456%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="4 &lt; k &lt; n^{0.456}"/>. The story is similar for the directed graphs where we obtain an algorithm running time at most <img alt="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28k%5E2+m%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="\tilde{O}(k^2 m)"/>.</p>
<p>The key to our results is to avoid computing single-source connectivity, which was needed by all previous exact algorithms and is not known to admit <img alt="o(n^2)" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=o%28n%5E2%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="o(n^2)"/> time. Instead, we design the first local algorithm for computing vertex connectivity; without reading the whole graph, our algorithm can find a separator of size at most <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> or certify that there is no separator of size at most <img alt="k" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" title="k"/> “near” a given seed node.</p>
<p>This talk is based on joint works with Danupon Nanongkai and Sorrachai Yingchareonthawornchai.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Barna Saha, Sofya Raskhodnikova and I are organizing the second annual TCS Women event at STOC’19. We had an event at STOC’18 and it went really well. We envision an exciting program for the TCS Women event at STOC 2019. The details about the program are forthcoming.  The new TCS Women website is here: <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__sigact.org_tcswomen_&amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=CVsmSCuxoCwFoG2gFr0tpYyUk9r_oVDDLqgpNw-QTrM&amp;m=yF6ryOV_72RkpZ0_dg--Elo-VEADbvub3IKRqkerKEs&amp;s=sU7cAYjUogjxkGH7PXLNYC26FKcl0oYAZvIQjwBIQgc&amp;e=" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://sigact.org/tcswomen/</a>. There you can learn more about our initiative.</p>



<p>In addition to the event, we have secured generous funding (similar to last year) from the NSF and industrial partners such as Akamai, Amazon, Google and Microsoft for <strong>travel grants</strong> for women and underrepresented minority students and postdocs to attend STOC. These grants are separate from the STOC travel awards and you can apply to both.</p>



<p>The application deadline for the TCS Women travel scholarship is <strong>April 25th, 2019</strong>.

    <title>TR19-055 |  Lower Bounds for Oblivious Near-Neighbor Search | 

	Kasper Green Larsen, 

	Tal Malkin, 

	Omri Weinstein, 

	Kevin Yeo</title>
    <summary>We prove an $\Omega(d \lg n/ (\lg\lg n)^2)$ lower bound on the dynamic cell-probe complexity of statistically $\mathit{oblivious}$ approximate-near-neighbor search (ANN) over the $d$-dimensional Hamming cube. For the natural setting of $d = \Theta(\log n)$, our result implies an $\tilde{\Omega}(\lg^2 n)$ lower bound, which is a quadratic improvement over the highest (non-oblivious) cell-probe lower bound for ANN. This is the first super-logarithmic $\mathit{unconditional}$ lower bound for ANN against general (non black-box) data structures. We also show that any oblivious $\mathit{static}$ data structure for decomposable search problems (like ANN) can be obliviously dynamized with $O(\log n)$ overhead in update and query time, strengthening a classic result of Bentley and Saxe (Algorithmica, 1980).</summary>

As an academic, we do a lot of writing about the things we work on, but usually our audience is narrow and technical: other researchers in our sub-specialty. But it can be both fun and important to communicate to a wider audience as well. So my amazing colleague Michael Kearns and I wrote a book, called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">The Ethical Algorithm</a>. It's coming out in October (Amazon says the release date is November 1st, but my understanding is that pre-orders will start shipping on October 4).<br/><br/>This was the first time for either of us writing something like this: it's not a textbook, it's a "trade book" -- a popular science book. Its intended readership isn't just computer science PhDs, but the educated public broadly. But there should be plenty in it to interest experts too, because we cover quite a bit of ground.  The book is about the problems that arise when algorithmic decision making interacts with human beings --- and the emerging science about how to fix them. The topics we cover include privacy, fairness, strategic interactions and gaming, and the scientific reproducibility crisis.<br/><br/>Lots has been written about the problems that can arise, especially related to privacy and fairness. And we're not trying to reinvent the wheel. Instead, the focus of our book is the exciting and embryonic algorithmic science that has grown to address these issues.<br/><br/>The privacy chapter develops differential privacy, and its strengths and weaknesses. The fairness chapter covers recent work on algorithmic fairness that has come out of the computer science literature. The gaming chapter studies how algorithm design can affect the equilibria that emerge from large scale interactions. The reproducibility chapter explores the underlying issues that lead to false discovery, and recent algorithmic advances that hold promise in avoiding them.  We try and set expectations appropriately. We don't pretend that the solutions to complex societal problems can be entirely (or even primarily) algorithmic. But we argue that embedding social values into algorithms will inevitably form an important component of any solution.<br/><br/>I'm really excited for it to come out. If you want, you can pre-order it now, either at Amazon: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205</a> or directly from the publisher: <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#.XKegC9eWi2w.twitter">https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-ethical-algorithm-9780190948207?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#.XKegC9eWi2w.twitter</a></div>

    <title>TR19-054 |  Bridging between 0/1 and Linear Programming via Random Walks | 

	Joshua Brakensiek, 

	Venkatesan Guruswami</title>
    <summary>Under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, an integer linear program with $n$ Boolean-valued variables and $m$ equations cannot be solved in $c^n$ time for any constant $c &lt; 2$. If the domain of the variables is relaxed to $[0,1]$, the associated linear program can of course be solved in polynomial time. In this work, we give a natural algorithmic bridging between these extremes of $0$-$1$ and linear programming. Specifically, for any subset (finite union of intervals) $E \subset [0,1]$ containing $\{0,1\}$, we give a random-walk based algorithm with runtime $O_E((2-\text{measure}(E))^n \text{poly}(n,m))$ that finds a solution in $E^n$ to any  $n$-variable linear program with $m$ constraints that is feasible over $\{0,1\}^n$. Note that as $E$ expands from $\{0,1\}$ to $[0,1]$, the runtime improves smoothly from $2^n$ to polynomial. 
 
Taking $E = [0,1/k) \cup (1-1/k,1]$ in our result yields as a corollary a randomized $(2-2/k)^{n}\text{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for $k$-SAT, matching the best known runtime for larger $k$. While our approach has some high level resemblance to Sch\"{o}ning's beautiful algorithm, our general algorithm is based on a more sophisticated random walk that incorporates several new ingredients, such as a multiplicative potential to measure progress, a judicious choice of starting distribution, and a time varying distribution for the evolution of the random walk that is itself computed via an LP at each step (a solution to which is guaranteed based on the minimax theorem).  Plugging the LP algorithm into our earlier polymorphic framework yields fast exponential algorithms for any CSP (like $k$-SAT, $1$-in-$3$-SAT, NAE $k$-SAT) that admit so-called ``threshold partial polymorphisms."</summary>

    <title>TR19-053 |  The complexity of 3-colouring $H$-colourable graphs | 

	Andrei Krokhin, 

	Jakub Opršal</title>
    <summary>We study the complexity of approximation on satisfiable instances for graph homomorphism problems. For a fixed graph $H$, the $H$-colouring problem is to decide whether a given graph has a homomorphism to $H$.  By a result of Hell and Nešet?il, this problem is NP-hard for any non-bipartite graph $H$.  In the context of promise constraint satisfaction problems, Brakensiek and Guruswami conjectured that this hardness result extends to promise graph homomorphism as follows: fix any non-bipartite graph $H$ and another graph $G$ with a homomorphism from $H$ to $G$, it is NP-hard to find a homomorphism to $G$ from a given $H$-colourable graph.  Arguably, the two most important special cases of this conjecture are when $H$ is fixed to be $K_3$ (and $G$ is any graph with a triangle) and when $G=K_3$ (and $H$ is any 3-colourable graph). The former case is equivalent to the notoriously difficult approximate graph colouring problem. In this paper, we confirm the Brakensiek-Guruswami conjecture for the latter case.  Our proofs rely on a novel combination of the universal-algebraic approach to promise constraint satisfaction, that was recently developed by Bulín and the authors, with some ideas from algebraic topology.</summary>

    <title>TR19-052 |  Polynomial calculus space and resolution width | 

	Nicola  Galesi, 

	Leszek Kolodziejczyk, 

	Neil Thapen</title>
    <summary>We show that if a $k$-CNF requires width $w$ to refute in resolution, then it requires space $\sqrt w$ to refute in polynomial calculus, where the space of a polynomial calculus refutation is the number of monomials that must be kept in memory when working through the proof. This is the first analogue, in polynomial calculus, of Atserias and Dalmau's result lower-bounding clause space in resolution by resolution width.

As a by-product of our new approach to space lower bounds  we give a simple proof of Bonacina's recent result that total space in resolution (the total number of variable occurrences that must be kept in memory) is lower-bounded by the width squared. As corollaries of the main result we obtain some new lower bounds on the PCR space needed to refute specific formulas, as well as partial answers to some open problems about relations between space, size, and degree for polynomial calculus.</summary>

Today I want to discuss a recent paper of hers.</p>
<p>
Okay, not so recent. Well it was published in 1976. It is a joint paper of ours. The topic was information flow with applications to security and cryptography: “The Enforcement of Security Policies for Computation.” Anita and I thought that is was a pretty neat paper. The paper was eventually accepted for the the operating system conference (SOSP) conference in 1975 and later appeared in the JCSS journal—see <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Enforcement-of-Security-Policies-for-Jones-Lipton/c25e7f6e3e9d5c55dff9e842d969788025fb6afe">here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Missing The Boat </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Two comments on our paper. It was indeed accepted to SOSP, but the acceptance was complicated. It might make a good story, but it happened so long ago that I doubt anyone who would be interested. The paper also totally missed the boat. We had a good idea, a good topic, but we totally missed getting the right model. Totally.</p>
<p>
Here is the boat we missed:</p>
<p/><p/>
<table style="margin: auto;">
<tbody><tr>

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/09/seeing-is-believing/missedboat/" rel="attachment wp-att-15746"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15746" height="124" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/missedboat.png?w=300&amp;h=124" width="300"/></a>

<p>
We missed it because we looked for a deterministic theory of information flow. An application of the theory was to be to security and cryptography. It was at least partially successful in explaining several puzzles that were around then. But we missed seeing that the best theory had to be probabilistic. That a good theory of information flow needs to argue about probabilities… We missed this totally. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Seeing A Value </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
So we are going to introduce a probabilistic theory of <img alt="{\dots}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\dots}"/> No we are still interested in deterministic information flow. We wish to introduce the notion of <i>seeing</i> a value. The intuition is that often in making arguments we may need to say that we can “see” a certain value. This happens naturally in arguments in cryptography. For example, we can express that a function is invertible as: if we can see the value of <img alt="{F(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x)}"/> we can see the value of <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/>. Let <img alt="{\Box E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box E}"/> mean that we can see the value <img alt="{E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E}"/>. Think of the symbol <img alt="{\Box}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box}"/> as an “eye” that can see the value of the expression <img alt="{E}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{E}"/>. Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Box F(x) \implies \Box x " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CBox+F%28x%29+%5Cimplies+%5CBox+x+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Box F(x) \implies \Box x "/></p>
<p>means that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> is an invertible function. Rather than formally define <img alt="{\Box}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box}"/> let’s give some simple rules that should explain the notion. </p>

</p><p/><h2> Applications </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here is a real application to demonstrate the notion of “seeing”. It comes not directly from security but from a 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10921">paper</a> by Saminathan Ponnusamy and Victor Starkov on the Jacobian Conjecture. We have however <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/08/04/crypto-aspects-of-the-jacobian-conjecture/">covered</a> cryptographic aspects of the conjecture. The authors look at functions <img alt="{F(x)=y}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%3Dy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F(x)=y}"/> of the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  y_{k} = x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++y_%7Bk%7D+%3D+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  y_{k} = x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), "/></p>
<p>
where <img alt="{z = x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz+%3D+x_%7B1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+x_%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{z = x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n}}"/> and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{k} \gamma_{k} = 0. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{k} \gamma_{k} = 0. "/></p>
<p>They give a proof that this function is invertible. Here is one using our “seeing” notion: </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle \begin{array}{l} \Box\, y_{k} \text{ for all } k. \\ \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. \\ \Box \left( \sum_{k} x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { adding up.} \\ \Box \left( x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n} \right) \text { by assumption } \sum_{k} \gamma_{k}=0. \\ \Box\, z \text{ by definition.} \end{array} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Bl%7D+%5CBox%5C%2C+y_%7Bk%7D+%5Ctext%7B+for+all+%7D+k.+%5C%5C+%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+for+all+%7D+k.+%5C%5C+%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+adding+up.%7D+%5C%5C+%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+x_%7B1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+x_%7Bn%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+by+assumption+%7D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D%3D0.+%5C%5C+%5CBox%5C%2C+z+%5Ctext%7B+by+definition.%7D+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle \begin{array}{l} \Box\, y_{k} \text{ for all } k. \\ \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. \\ \Box \left( \sum_{k} x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { adding up.} \\ \Box \left( x_{1} + \cdots + x_{n} \right) \text { by assumption } \sum_{k} \gamma_{k}=0. \\ \Box\, z \text{ by definition.} \end{array} "/></p>
<p>
Then we get that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Box \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Box \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right), "/></p>
<p>and recall that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CBox+%5Cleft%28+x_%7Bk%7D+%2B+%5Cgamma_%7Bk%7D+%5Cleft%28+a_%7B1%7Dz%5E%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+a_%7Bm%7Dz%5E%7Bm%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Cright%29+%5Ctext+%7B+for+all+%7D+k.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \Box \left( x_{k} + \gamma_{k} \left( a_{1}z^{2} + \cdots + a_{m}z^{m} \right) \right) \text { for all } k. "/></p>
<p>Thus by subtraction it follows that we get <img alt="{\Box x_{k}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBox+x_%7Bk%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\Box x_{k}}"/> for each <img alt="{k}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{k}"/>. This proves that <img alt="{F}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{F}"/> is invertible. </p>
<p>
Note, the proof in the above paper is quite short. However it is a bit complicated and we believe that the above proof is quite transparent. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this notion of any use? Also how hard will it be to formally define this notion?</p>

    <title>TR19-051 |  Pseudorandom bits and lower bounds for randomized Turing machines | 

	Emanuele Viola</title>
    <summary>We exhibit a pseudorandom generator with nearly quadratic stretch for randomized Turing machines, which have a one-way random tape and a two-way work tape. This is the first generator for this model. Its stretch is essentially the best possible given current lower bounds. We use the generator to prove a polynomial lower bound for the stronger Turing machine model where we also have a two-way read-only input tape. This is the first lower bound for this model.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 2011, as a graduate student <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~minilek/">Jelani Nelson</a> founded the <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder course</a> on algorithms and coding for high schoolers in Addis Ababa Ethiopia.  Since then the course has been offered twice more, and this summer it will occur again for the fourth time. Over 330 students have completed the course, and some of its <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/#alumni">alumni</a> are now students in top institutions in the U.S., Ethiopia, and all over the world. I was a lecturer in this course in 2016 and will be again this summer (together with Jelani,  <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~tgebru/">Timnit Gebru</a>, and  <a href="https://ddkang.github.io/">Daniel Kang</a>).</p>



<p>The students in AddisCoder come from all over Ethiopia, and many have never considered computer science as a potential field of study or even touched a computer. Once when meeting an alum, I asked whether he enjoyed the course. He told me that he didn’t just enjoy it, it was a lifechanging experience for him, and I believe the same holds for many other graduates.</p>



<p>The reason for this post is that AddisCoder is now a tax-exempt non profit organization, which you can <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/#donate">donate to</a> through our website. It is a fairly lean operation, but funds are needed for travel of teaching staff (with TA’s that come from all over the world). Please consider supporting AddisCoder yourself (any amount helps!), and forward this information to any friends or colleagues. If you work for a company that might be interested in supporting AddisCoder, you can contact Jelani at the email minilek+addiscoder@gmail.com .</p></div>
