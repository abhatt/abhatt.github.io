    <title>TR22-059 |  Diameter versus Certificate Complexity of Boolean Functions | 

	Siddhesh Chaubal, 

	Anna Gal</title>
    <summary>In this paper, we introduce a measure of Boolean functions we call diameter, that captures the relationship between certificate complexity and several other measures of Boolean functions. Our measure can be viewed as a variation on alternating number, but while alternating number can be exponentially larger than certificate complexity, we show that diameter is always upper bounded by certificate complexity. We argue that estimating diameter may help to get improved bounds on certificate complexity in terms of sensitivity, and other measures.

Previous results due to Lin and Zhang  imply that $s(f) \ge \Omega(n^{1/3})$ for transitive functions with constant alternating number. We improve and extend this bound and prove that $s(f) \ge \sqrt{n}$ for transitive functions with constant alternating number, as well as for transitive functions with constant diameter. We also show that $bs(f) \ge \Omega(n^{3/7})$ for transitive functions under the weaker condition that the ``minimum'' diameter is constant.

Furthermore, we prove that the log-rank conjecture holds for functions of the form $f(x \oplus y)$ for functions $f$ with diameter bounded above by a polynomial of the logarithm of the Fourier sparsity of the function $f$.</summary>

$\mathbb{R}^d$ with Euclidean norm at most one, there always exists a $\pm 1$
coloring such that the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm of the signed-sum vector is a
constant independent of $n$ and $d$. We prove this conjecture in a smoothed
analysis setting where the vectors are perturbed by adding a small Gaussian
noise and when the number of vectors $n =\omega(d\log d)$. The dependence of
$n$ on $d$ is the best possible even in a completely random setting.
</p>
<p>Our proof relies on a weighted second moment method, where instead of
considering uniformly randomly colorings we apply the second moment method on
an implicit distribution on colorings obtained by applying the Gram-Schmidt
walk algorithm to a suitable set of vectors. The main technical idea is to use
various properties of these colorings, including subgaussianity, to control the
second moment.

    <title>String Rearrangement Inequalities and a Total Order Between Primitive Words</title>

concatenate them so that the obtained string is lexicographically smallest (or
largest, respectively). We show that this problem reduces to sorting the given
words so that their repeating strings are non-decreasing (or non-increasing,
respectively), where the repeating string of a word $A$ refers to the infinite
string $AAA\ldots$. Moreover, for fixed size alphabet $\Sigma$, we design an
$O(L)$ time sorting algorithm of the words (in the mentioned orders), where $L$
denotes the total length of the input words. Hence we obtain an $O(L)$ time
algorithm for the rearrangement problem. Finally, we point out that comparing
primitive words via comparing their repeating strings leads to a total order,
which can further be extended to a total order on the finite words (or all
words).

    <title>Listing, Verifying and Counting Lowest Common Ancestors in DAGs: Algorithms and Fine-Grained Lower Bounds</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Mathialagan:Surya.html">Surya Mathialagan</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Williams:Virginia_Vassilevska.html">Virginia Vassilevska Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/x/Xu:Yinzhan.html">Yinzhan Xu</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10932">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The AP-LCA problem asks, given an $n$-node directed acyclic graph (DAG), to
compute for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ in the DAG a lowest common
ancestor (LCA) of $u$ and $v$ if one exists. In this paper we study several
interesting variants of AP-LCA, providing both algorithms and fine-grained
lower bounds for them. The lower bounds we obtain are the first conditional
lower bounds for LCA problems higher than $n^{\omega-o(1)}$, where $\omega$ is
the matrix multiplication exponent. Some of our results include:
</p>
<p>- In any DAG, we can detect all vertex pairs that have at most two LCAs and
list all of their LCAs in $O(n^\omega)$ time. This algorithm extends a result
of [Kowaluk and Lingas ESA'07] which showed an $\tilde{O}(n^\omega)$ time
algorithm that detects all pairs with a unique LCA in a DAG and outputs their
corresponding LCAs.
</p>
<p>- Listing $7$ LCAs per vertex pair in DAGs requires $n^{3-o(1)}$ time under
the popular assumption that 3-uniform 5-hyperclique detection requires
$n^{5-o(1)}$ time. This is surprising since essentially cubic time is
sufficient to list all LCAs (if $\omega=2$).
</p>
<p>- Counting the number of LCAs for every vertex pair in a DAG requires
$n^{3-o(1)}$ time under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, and
$n^{\omega(1,2,1)-o(1)}$ time under the $4$-Clique hypothesis. This shows that
the algorithm of [Echkardt, M\"{u}hling and Nowak ESA'07] for listing all LCAs
for every pair of vertices is likely optimal.
</p>
<p>- Given a DAG and a vertex $w_{u,v}$ for every vertex pair $u,v$, verifying
whether all $w_{u,v}$ are valid LCAs requires $n^{2.5-o(1)}$ time assuming
3-uniform 4-hyperclique requires $n^{4 - o(1)}$ time. This defies the common
intuition that verification is easier than computation since returning some LCA
per vertex pair can be solved in $O(n^{2.447})$ time [Grandoni et al. SODA'21].

    <title>An Algorithm to Find Sums of Consecutive Powers of Primes</title>

$c_k$ is a constant depending solely on $k$, roughly $k^2$ in magnitude. This
also bounds the asymptotic running time of our algorithm. We also present some
computational results, using our algorithm, that imply this bound is, at worst,
off by a constant factor near 0.6. Our work extends the previous work by
Tongsomporn, Wananiyakul, and Steuding (2022) who examined consecutive sums of
squares of primes.

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>As you might remember, last December I hosted a <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">guest post</a> about the “California Mathematics Framework” (CMF), which was set to cause radical changes to precollege math in California—e.g., eliminating 8th-grade algebra and making it nearly impossible to take AP Calculus.  I linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> setting out my and my colleagues’ concerns about the CMF.  That letter went on to receive more than 1700 signatures from STEM experts in industry and academia from around the US, including recipients of the Nobel Prize, Fields Medal, and Turing Award, as well as a lot of support from college-level instructors in California. </p>



<p>Following widespread pushback, a <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">new version of the CMF</a> appeared in mid-March.  I and others are gratified that the new version significantly softens the opposition to acceleration in high school math and to calculus as a central part of mathematics.  Nonetheless, we’re still concerned that the new version promotes a narrative about data science that’s a recipe for cutting kids off from any chance at earning a 4-year college degree in STEM fields (including, ironically, in data science itself).</p>



<p>To that end, some of my Californian colleagues have <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mathindatamatters/home"><strong>issued a new statement today</strong></a> on behalf of academic staff at 4-year colleges in California, aimed at clearing away the fog on how mathematics is related to data science.  I strongly encourage my readers on the academic staff at 4-year colleges in California to sign this commonsense statement, which has already been signed by over 250 people (including, notably, at least 50 from Stanford, home of two CMF authors).</p>



<p>As a public service announcement, I’d also like to bring to wider awareness <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/5-CCR-Sec-18533">Section 18533 of the California Education Code</a>, for submitting written statements to the California State Board of Education (SBE) about errors, objections, and concerns in curricular frameworks such as the CMF.  </p>



<p>The SBE is scheduled to vote on the CMF in mid-July, and their remaining meeting before then is on May 18-19 according to <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/st/index.asp">this site</a>, so it is really at the May meeting that concerns need to be aired.  Section 18533 requires submissions to be written (yes, snail mail) and postmarked at least 10 days before the SBE meeting.  So to make your voice heard by the SBE, please send your written concern by certified mail (for tracking, but <em>not</em> requiring signature for delivery), no later than Friday May 6, to State Board of Education, c/o Executive Secretary of the State Board of Education, 1430 N Street, Room 5111, Sacramento, CA 95814, complemented by an email submission to <a href="mailto:sbe@cde.ca.gov" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sbe@cde.ca.gov</a> and <a href="mailto:mathframework@cde.ca.gov" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">mathframework@cde.ca.gov</a>.</p></div>

    <summary>It is well-known that Resolution proofs can be efficiently simulated by Sherali-Adams (SA) proofs. We show, however, that any such simulation needs to exploit huge coefficients: Resolution cannot be efficiently simulated by SA when the coefficients are written in unary. We also show that Reversible Resolution (a variant of MaxSAT Resolution) cannot be efficiently simulated by Nullstellensatz (NS).

These results can be interpreted in the language of total NP search problems. We show that PPADS, PPAD, SOPL are captured by unary-SA, unary-NS, and Reversible Resolution, respectively. Consequently, relative to an oracle, PLS $\not\subseteq$ PPADS and SOPL $\not\subseteq$ PPA.</summary>

generation. We use the leakage resilience properties of the Learning With
Errors problem to address a key issue left open in previous work - the rate of
generation of randomness. Our new protocol can certify $\Omega(n)$ fresh bits
of randomness in constant rounds, where $n$ is a parameter of the protocol and
the total communication is $O(n)$, thus achieving a nearly optimal rate. The
proof that the output is statistically random is conceptually simple and

problem. In the classical model, the cost of each agent is her distance to the
nearest facility. In this paper, we consider a new model, where there is a
location-dependent entrance fee to the facility. Thus, in our model, the cost
of each agent is the sum of the distance to the facility and the entrance fee
of the facility. This is a refined generalization of the classical model. We
study the model and design strategyproof mechanisms. For one and two
facilities, we provide upper and lower bounds for the approximation ratio given
by deterministic and randomized mechanisms, with respect to the utilitarian
objective and the egalitarian objective. Most of our bounds are tight and these
bounds are independent of the entrance fee functions. Our results are as
general as possible because the entrance fee function we consider is arbitrary.

which fosters a variety of similarity-based machine learning and data mining
applications. In big data analytics, it is impractical to compute the exact
similarity of data instances due to high computational cost. To this end, the
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique has been proposed to provide
accurate estimators for various similarity measures between sets or vectors in
an efficient manner without the learning process. Structured data (e.g.,
sequences, trees and graphs), which are composed of elements and relations
between the elements, are commonly seen in the real world, but the traditional
LSH algorithms cannot preserve the structure information represented as
relations between elements. In order to conquer the issue, researchers have
been devoted to the family of the hierarchical LSH algorithms. In this paper,
we explore the present progress of the research into hierarchical LSH from the
following perspectives: 1) Data structures, where we review various
hierarchical LSH algorithms for three typical data structures and uncover their
inherent connections; 2) Applications, where we review the hierarchical LSH
algorithms in multiple application scenarios; 3) Challenges, where we discuss
some potential challenges as future directions.

In this problem, there are two players, a leader and a follower, who pick items
from a common set. Both the leader and the follower have their own
(multi-dimensional) budgets, respectively. Each item is associated with a
profit, which is the same to the leader and the follower, and will consume the
leader's (follower's) budget if it is selected by the leader (follower). The
leader and the follower will select items in a sequential way: First, the
leader selects items within the leader's budget. Then the follower selects
items from the remaining items within the follower's budget. The goal of the
leader is to minimize the maximum profit that the follower can obtain. Let
$s_A$ and $s_B$ be the dimension of the leader's and follower's budget,
respectively. A special case of our problem is the bilevel knapsack problem
studied by Caprara et al. [SIAM Journal on Optimization, 2014], where
$s_A=s_B=1$. We consider the general problem and obtain an
$(s_B+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm when $s_A$ and $s_B$ are both
constant. In particular, if $s_B=1$, our algorithm implies a PTAS for the
bilevel knapsack problem, which is the first O(1)-approximation algorithm. We
also complement our result by showing that there does not exist any
$(4/3-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm even if $s_A=1$ and $s_B=2$. We also
consider a variant of our problem with resource augmentation when $s_A$ and
$s_B$ are both part of the input. We obtain an O(1)-approximation algorithm
with O(1)-resource augmentation, that is, we give an algorithm that returns a
solution which exceeds the given leader's budget by O(1) times, and the
objective value achieved by the solution is O(1) times the optimal objective
value that respects the leader's budget.

allows deletions of simplices besides insertions. However, computing zigzag
persistence usually takes considerably more time than the standard persistence.
This paper sheds light on narrowing this efficiency gap. Our main result is
that an input simplex-wise zigzag filtration can be converted to a cell-wise
non-zigzag filtration of a $\Delta$-complex with the same length, where the
cells are copies of the input simplices. This conversion step incurs very
little cost. Furthermore, the barcode of the original filtration can be easily
read from the barcode of the new cell-wise filtration because the conversion
embodies a series of diamond switches known in topological data analysis. This
seemingly simple observation opens up the vast possibilities for improving the
computation of zigzag persistence because any efficient algorithm/software for
standard persistence can now be applied to computing zigzag persistence. Our
experiment shows that this indeed achieves substantial performance gain over
the existing state-of-the-art softwares.

of implicit ribbon and bounding surfaces, whose pairwise intersections
determine the natural boundaries of the patch. Our goal is to show how a
collection of smoothly connected I-patches can be used to approximate
triangular meshes. We start from a coarse, user-defined vertex graph which
specifies an initial subdivision of the surface. Based on this, we create
ribbons that tightly fit the mesh along its edges in both positional and
tangential sense, then we optimize the free parameters of the patch to better
approximate the interior. If the surfaces are not sufficiently accurate, the
network needs to be refined; here we exploit that the I-patch construction
naturally supports T-nodes. We also describe a normalization method that nicely
approximates the Euclidean distance field, and can be efficiently evaluated.
The capabilities and limitations of the approach are analyzed through several
examples.

changes in their topological structure over time. However, it is challenging to
design dynamic algorithms that are capable of supporting such graph changes
efficiently. To circumvent the challenge, we propose a batch-dynamic framework
for answering distance queries, which combines offline labelling and online
searching to leverage the advantages from both sides - accelerating query
processing through a partial distance labelling that is of limited size but
provides a good approximation to bound online searches. We devise batch-dynamic
algorithms to dynamize a distance labelling efficiently in order to reflect
batch updates on the underlying graph. In addition to providing theoretical
analysis for the correctness, labelling minimality, and computational
complexity, we have conducted experiments on 14 real-world networks to
empirically verify the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms.

    <title>A Ihara-Bass Formula for Non-Boolean Matrices and Strong Refutations of Random CSPs</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Tommaso d'Orsi, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/t/Trevisan:Luca.html">Luca Trevisan</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10881">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We define a notion of "non-backtracking" matrix associated to any symmetric
matrix, and we prove a "Ihara-Bass" type formula for it. Previously, these
notions were known only for symmetric 0/1 matrices.
</p>
<p>We use this theory to prove new results on polynomial-time strong refutations
of random constraint satisfaction problems with $k$ variables per constraints
(k-CSPs). For a random k-CSP instance constructed out of a constraint that is
satisfied by a $p$ fraction of assignments, if the instance contains $n$
variables and $n^{k/2} / \epsilon^2$ constraints, we can efficiently compute a
certificate that the optimum satisfies at most a $p+O_k(\epsilon)$ fraction of
constraints.
</p>
<p>Previously, this was known for even $k$, but for odd $k$ one needed $n^{k/2}
(\log n)^{O(1)} / \epsilon^2$ random constraints to achieve the same
conclusion.
</p>
<p>Although the improvement is only polylogarithmic, it overcomes a significant
barrier to these types of results. Strong refutation results based on current
approaches construct a certificate that a certain matrix associated to the
k-CSP instance is quasirandom. Such certificate can come from a Feige-Ofek type
argument, from an application of Grothendieck's inequality, or from a spectral
bound obtained with a trace argument. The first two approaches require a union
bound that cannot work when the number of constraints is $o(n^{\lceil k/2
\rceil})$ and the third one cannot work when the number of constraints is
$o(n^{k/2} \sqrt{\log n})$.

    <title>TR22-057 |  When Arthur has Neither Random Coins nor Time to Spare: Superfast Derandomization of Proof Systems | 

	Lijie Chen, 

	Roei Tell</title>
    <summary>What is the actual cost of derandomization? And can we get it for free? These questions were recently raised by Doron et. al (FOCS 2020) and have been attracting considerable interest. In this work we extend the study of these questions to the setting of *derandomizing interactive proofs systems*. 

First, we show conditional derandomization of $\mathcal{MA}$ and of $\mathcal{AM}$ with *optimal runtime overhead*, where optimality is under the  $\#NSETH$ assumption. Specifically, denote by $\mathcal{AM}\mathcal{TIME}^{[\rightleftharpoons c]}[T]$ a protocol with $c$ turns of interaction in which the verifier runs in polynomial time $T$. We prove that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that:

1. $\mathcal{MATIME}[T]\subseteq \mathcal{NTIME}[T^{2+\epsilon}]$, and

2. $\mathcal{AM}\mathcal{TIME}^{[\rightleftharpoons c]}[T] \subseteq \mathcal{NTIME}[n\cdot T^{\lceil c/2 \rceil+\epsilon}]$,

where $(1)$ follows if there is a property $\Pi$ of Boolean functions that can be recognized from a $2^n$-length truth-table in $\mathcal{NTIME}[2^{(2+\epsilon/3)\cdot n}]$ such that functions with $\Pi$ are hard for $(\mathcal{N}\cap co\mathcal{N})\mathcal{TIME}[2^{(2-\delta)\cdot n}]/2^{(1-\delta)\cdot n}$; and $(2)$ follows if for every $k\ge1$ there is a $\Pi$ that can be recognized from a $2^n$-length truth-table in $\mathcal{NTIME}[2^{(k+\epsilon/3)\cdot n}]$ such that functions with $\Pi$ are hard for $\mathcal{MAMTIME}[2^{(1-\delta)\cdot k n}]/2^{(1-\delta)\cdot n}$.

To obtain faster derandomization, we introduce the notion of a *deterministic effective argument system*: This is a deterministic verifier $V$ such that correct claims $x\in L$ can be proved to $V$ (i.e., there is a proof $\pi$ such that $V(x,\pi)=1$), and for every probabilistic polynomial-time adversary $\tilde{P}$, the probability that $\tilde{P}$ finds an incorrect claim $x\notin L$ and a misleading proof $\pi$ such that $V(x,\pi)=1$ is negligible.

Under strong hardness assumptions, we prove that *any constant-round proof system can be compiled into a deterministic effective argument system, with essentially no time overhead*. As one corollary, under the foregoing hardness assumptions, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there is a deterministic verifier $V$ that gets as input an $n$-bit formula of size $2^{o(n)}$, runs in time $2^{\epsilon \cdot n}$, and satisfies the following: For every formula $\Phi$ there is a proof $\pi$ such that $V(\Phi,\pi)$ prints the number of satisfying assignments for $\Phi$; and for every adversary $\tilde{P}$ running in time $2^{O(n)}$, the probability that $\tilde{P}$ finds $\Phi$ and $\pi$ such that $V(\Phi,\pi)$ prints an incorrect count is $2^{-\omega(n)}$.</summary>

    <title>The Roeder Problem was Solved Before I Posed it (how we missed it)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>(This is a joint post with David and Tomas Harris.)</p><p><br/></p><p>In my an earlier post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-seq-problems-was-solved.html">here</a>) I discussed the MATH behind a problem that I worked on, with David and Tomas Harris, that we later found out had already been solved. In this post we discuss HOW this happened. </p><p>Recall that Bill Gasarch read a column of Oliver Roeder (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-number-any-number/">here</a>) on Nate Silvers' blog where he challenged his readers to the following:</p><p>Find the longest sequence using numbers from {1,...,100} such that every number is either a factor or multiple of the previous number. (A later column (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-bathroom-occupied/">here</a> ) revealed the answer to be 77 via a computer search, which we note is not a human-readable proof.)</p><p>Bill wrote a blog post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/09/a-problem-i-thought-was-interesting-now.html">here</a>) and an open problems column (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/nate.pdf">here</a> ) asking about the general case of {1,...,n}. Before doing this Bill DID try to check the literature to see what was known, but he didn't check very hard since this was not going to be a published paper. Also, he vaguely thought that if it was a known problem then one of his readers would tell him.</p><p>QUESTION: Is it appropriate to blog on things that you have not done a search of the literature on?</p><p>ANSWER: Yes, but you should SAY SO in the blog post.</p><p>As measured by comments, the post did not generate much interest- 10 comments. 2 were me (Gasarch) responding to comments.</p><p>David (who has a PhD from UMCP under Aravind Srinivasan) asked Bill to find a HS project for his son Tomas. Bill gave Tomas the sequence problem (as he called it) to look at- perhaps write a program to find what happens for {1,...,n} for small n, perhaps find human-readable proofs of weaker bound, for small n or for n=100.</p><p>David got interested in the MATH behind the problem so the project became three projects: Tomas would look at the programing aspects and the human-readable aspects, David would look at the Math, and Bill would...  hmmm, not clear what Bill would do, but he did write up a great deal of it and cleaned up some of the proofs.</p><p>David showed</p><p>Omega( n/( (log n)^{1.68} )  LE  L(n)  LE  O( n/( (log n)^{0.79} ). </p><p>Tomas and Bill obtained a human-readable proof that L(100) LE 83. (Comments on my blog sketched a proof that L(100) LE 83, and someone else that L(100) LE 80). See my previous post (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-seq-problems-was-solved.html">here</a>) for more on the known numbers for L. </p><p>At that point David did a brief literature search; however, he didn't know what to look for.</p><p>BILL still thought of this as a HS project so he didn't think much about a paper coming out of it, or if it was original. So he didn't do the due diligence of seeing what was already known.</p><p>David and Tomas were busy working on it, so they only did a few cursory checks of the literature.</p><div><div><br/></div><div>With the two results above,  we had a paper! David then looked much more carefully at the literature. He DID find some earlier papers -- he did a Google search for Roeder's puzzle, which mentioned another mathematician, who was quoted in a blog by another mathematician, who eventually mentioned Pomerance's old paper on the topic. Once he found a reference to an actual math paper it was easy to use Google Scholar to find forward/backward citations and find the current state of the art.</div><div><br/></div><div>His email had subject title</div><div><br/></div><div>                        SHUT IT ALL DOWN!!!</div><div><br/></div><div>Which made Bill think it involved a nuclear reactor undergoing The China Syndrome rather than just telling us that other people did had better and earlier results. </div><div><br/></div><div><p class="MsoNormal">In 1995 Gerald Tenenbaum showed, in a paper written in French,  that there exists a,b such that </p><p class="MsoNormal">                               n/(log n)^a LE L(n) LE n/(log n)^b (see <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/ASENS_1995_4_28_2_115_0/">here</a>). </p><p class="MsoNormal">More recently, in 2021, Saias showed, in a paper written in French, that </p><p class="MsoNormal">                                      L(n) GE (0.3 - o(1)) n/log n (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03855">here</a>). </p></div><div><br/></div><div>SO, why didn't Bill, David, Tomas find that it was already known until late in the process:</div><div><br/></div><div>1) They didn't know the right search term: <i>Divisor Graph</i></div><div><br/></div><div>2) The literature was in French so the right search term is <i>graphe divisoriel</i></div><div><br/></div><div>3) The transition from FUN HS PROJECT to SERIOUS MATH PAPER was somewhat abrupt and caught Bill by surprise.</div><div><br/></div><div>Was this a disappointment?</div><div><br/></div><div>1) We all learned some math from it, so that was nice.</div><div><br/></div><div>2) We were in a position to read and understand the paper since we knew all of the difficulties --- however, it was in French which I do not read. David reads some, Tomas does not read French.  I prefer to be scooped in English, but even then  I might not be able to read up on the problem since  math is... hard. When did math get so hard? see my blog on that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/when-did-math-get-so-hard.html">here</a>. When did CS theory get so hard? See my blog on that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/11/when-did-computer-science-theory-get-so.html">here</a>.)</div><div><br/></div><div>Could this happen again?</div><div><br/></div><div>1) Yes. Language barriers are hard to overcome. Though this is rare nowadays--- not much serious mathematics seems to be done outside English. French mathematicians seem to like to keep their language alive, although they probably know English as well. There may be a few other countries (China, perhaps), where English language skills are not advanced and researchers are cut off from the English literature.</div><div><br/></div><div>2) Yes. I've heard of cases where many people discovered the same theorem but were unaware of each others results since they were in different fields.</div><div><br/></div><div>3) Is it easier or harder to reprove a theorem now then it was X years ago?</div><div><br/></div></div><div>We have better search tools, but we also have more to search. </div><div><br/></div></div>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>There is a fundamental difference between form and meaning. Form is the physical structure of something, while meaning is the interpretation or concept that is attached to that form. For example, the form of a chair is its physical structure – four legs, a seat, and a back. The meaning of a chair is that it is something you can sit on.</p>



<p>This distinction is important when considering whether or not an AI system can be trained to learn semantic meaning. AI systems are capable of learning and understanding the form of data, but they are not able to attach meaning to that data. In other words, AI systems can learn to identify patterns, but they cannot understand the concepts behind those patterns.</p>



<p>For example, an AI system might be able to learn that a certain type of data is typically associated with the concept of “chair.” However, the AI system would not be able to understand what a chair is or why it is used. In this way, we can see that an AI system trained on form can never learn semantic meaning.</p>

    <title>TR22-056 |  Optimal Coding Theorems in Time-Bounded Kolmogorov Complexity | 

	Zhenjian Lu, 

	Igor Carboni Oliveira, 

	Marius Zimand</title>
    <summary>The classical coding theorem in Kolmogorov complexity states that if an $n$-bit string $x$ is sampled with probability $\delta$ by an algorithm with prefix-free domain then K$(x) \leq \log(1/\delta) + O(1)$. In a recent work, Lu and Oliveira [LO21] established an unconditional time-bounded version of this result, by showing that if $x$ can be efficiently sampled with probability $\delta$ then rKt$(x) = O(\log(1/\delta)) + O(\log n)$, where rKt denotes the randomized analogue of Levin's Kt complexity. Unfortunately, this result is often insufficient when transferring applications of the classical coding theorem to the time-bounded setting, as it  achieves a  $O(\log(1/\delta))$ bound instead of the information-theoretic optimal $\log(1/\delta)$.

Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate optimal coding theorems in the time-bounded setting. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows.

Efficient coding theorem for rKt with a factor of $2$. Addressing a question from [LO21], we show that if $x$ can be efficiently sampled with probability at least $\delta$ then rKt$(x) \le (2 + o(1)) \cdot \log(1/\delta) + O\!\left(\log n\right)$. As in previous work, our coding theorem is efficient in the sense that it provides a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm that, when given $x$, the code of the sampler, and $\delta$,  it outputs, with  probability $\ge 0.99$, a probabilistic representation of $x$ that certifies this rKt complexity bound.

Optimality under a cryptographic assumption. Under a hypothesis about the security of cryptographic pseudorandom generators, we show that no efficient coding theorem can achieve a bound of the form rKt$(x) \leq (2 - o(1)) \cdot \log(1/\delta) +$ poly$(\log n)$. Under a weaker assumption, we exhibit a gap between efficient coding theorems and existential coding theorems with near-optimal parameters.

Optimal coding theorem for pK$^t$ and unconditional Antunes-Fortnow. We consider pK$^t$ complexity [GKLO22], a variant of rKt where the randomness is public and the time bound is fixed. We observe the existence of an optimal coding theorem for pK$^t$, and employ this result to establish an unconditional version of a theorem of Antunes and Fortnow [AF09] which characterizes the worst-case running times of languages that are in average polynomial-time over all P-samplable distributions.</summary>

    <title>TR22-055 |  Simple Hard Instances for Low-Depth Algebraic Proofs | 

	Nashlen Govindasamy, 

	Tuomas Hakoniemi, 

	Iddo  Tzameret</title>
    <summary>We prove super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of propositional proof systems operating with constant-depth algebraic circuits over fields of zero characteristic. Specifically, we show that the subset-sum variant $\sum_{i,j,k,l\in[n]} z_{ijkl}x_ix_jx_kx_l-\beta = 0$, for Boolean variables, does not have polynomial-size IPS refutations where the refutations are multilinear and written as constant-depth circuits.

Andrews and Forbes (STOC’22) established recently a constant-depth IPS lower bound, but their hard instance does not have itself small constant-depth circuits, while our instance is computable already with small depth-2 circuits. 

Our argument relies on extending the recent breakthrough lower bounds against constant-depth algebraic circuits by Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (FOCS’21) to the functional lower bound framework of Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret and Wigderson (ToC’21), and may be of independent interest. Specifically, we construct a polynomial $f$ computable with small-size constant-depth circuits, such that the multilinear polynomial computing $1/f$ over Boolean values and its appropriate set-multilinear projection are hard for constant-depth circuits.</summary>

    <title>TR22-054 |  A Lower Bound for $k$-DNF Resolution on Random CNF Formulas via Expansion | 

	Anastasia Sofronova, 

	Dmitry Sokolov</title>
    <summary>Random $\Delta$-CNF formulas are one of the few candidates that are expected to be hard to refute in any proof system. One of the frontiers in the direction of proving lower bounds on these formulas is the $k$-DNF Resolution proof system (aka $\mathrm{Res}(k)$). Assume we sample $m$ clauses over $n$ variables. There are two known lower bounds.
1. Segerlind, Buss, Impagliazzo showed an exponential lower bound for any constant $k$, $\Delta = \mathcal{O}(k^2)$ in case $m = \mathcal{O}(n^{7 / 6})$.
2. Alekhnovich showed lower bound for $k = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}})$, any $\Delta \ge 3$ in case $m = \mathcal{O}(n)$.


Both of these papers used the same technique: the so-called small restriction switching lemma. However, they used different properties of the dependency graph of the random formula. In this paper we present a new technique with the same flavour though based on a different complexity measure that we call closure covering. We use only the expansion of the dependency graph of the formula. This technique allows us to unify and improve both of these bounds simultaneously. In particular, as a corollary we show:
1) an exponential lower bound for any constant $k$, $\Delta = \mathcal{O}(1)$ in case $m = \mathrm{poly}(n)$;
2) an exponential lower bound for $k = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$, $\Delta = \mathcal{O}(1)$ in case $m = \mathcal{O}(n)$.

It is the first lower bound that works for clause density $\frac{m}{n} &gt; n^{1 / 6}$ (density can even be superpolynomial for random $\log n$-CNF).</summary>

    <summary>We investigate the complexity of languages that correspond to algebraic real numbers, and we present improved upper bounds on the complexity of these languages.  Our key technical contribution is the presentation of improved uniform TC^0 circuits
for division, matrix powering, and related problems, where the improvement is in terms of "majority depth" (initially studied by Maciel and Therien). As a corollary, we obtain improved bounds on the complexity of certain problems involving arithmetic circuits, which are known to lie in the counting hierarchy, and we answer a question posed by Yap.</summary>

<p>Last week, Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry posted a preprint to the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">“Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure,”</a> that represents some of the most exciting progress in quantum complexity theory in years.  I wish I’d thought of it.  tl;dr they show that relative to a random oracle (!), there’s an NP search problem that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster than classical ones.  And yet this is 100% consistent with the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>A student brought my attention to <a href="https://deduckproject.github.io/quantle/">Quantle</a>, a variant of Wordle where you need to guess a true equation involving 1-qubit quantum states and unitary transformations.  It’s really well-done!  Possibly the best quantum game I’ve seen.</p>

<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-has-demonstrated-the-underlying-physics-required-to-create-a-new-kind-of-qubit/">announced on the web</a> that it had achieved an experimental breakthrough in topological quantum computing: not <em>quite</em> the creation of a topological qubit, but some of the underlying physics required for that.  This followed their needing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z">retract</a> their previous claim of such a breakthrough, due to the criticisms of Sergey Frolov and others.  One imagines that they would’ve taken far greater care this time around.  Unfortunately, a research paper doesn’t seem to be available yet.  Anyone with further details is welcome to chime in.</p>

<p>Woohoo!  Maximum flow, maximum bipartite matching, matrix scaling, and isotonic regression on posets (among many others)—all algorithmic problems that I was familiar with way back in the 1990s—are now solvable in nearly-linear time, thanks to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671">breakthrough by Chen et al.</a>!  Many undergraduate algorithms courses will need to be updated.</p>

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/db/" rel="attachment wp-att-19928"><img alt="" class="alignright wp-image-19928" height="165" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/db.jpg?resize=220%2C165&amp;ssl=1" width="220"/></a></p>
<p>
Dietrich Braess is a professor of mathematics at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany.  He is famous for the discovery of a paradox. When he was doing research on traffic modeling in 1968, he discovered that the flow in a road network could be <i>hindered</i> by <i>adding</i> a new road.</p>
<p>
Today we note a connection between him and the new ACM Athena Award winner, Éva Tardos, whom we congratulate.</p>
<p>
The paradox has a paradox riding on it.  The original is about the game theory of elective actions by drivers individually trying to optimize their routes. Yet it shows up in purely physical dynamics.  Consider the following <a href="http://www.davros.org/science/roadparadox.html">network</a> of springs and strings:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/par/" rel="attachment wp-att-19929"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19929" height="192" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/par.png?resize=100%2C192&amp;ssl=1" width="100"/></a></p>
<p>
Quoting Clive Feathers, who <a href="http://www.davros.org/">studies</a> Britain’s railways and the London Underground:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If all the strings are taut, then each of them will be carrying one-third of the weight of the block. So if the purple string is cut, the remaining strings will carry more of the weight and the block will drop down a bit as the springs take up the load, right?</em></p><em>
<p>
Wrong!</p>
</em><p><em>
As shown, each string has a tension of 4N, so the springs will each be under a tension of 8N and will stretch accordingly. Now, when the purple string is cut the remaining strings have a tension of 6N, and so does each spring. So there is less tension in the springs, and they will contract accordingly, making the block rise. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Braess Paradox </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Who cares about springs and strings? Indeed. </p>
<p>
The point is that this paradox arises in problems we study in CS. It is named now as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess's_paradox">Braess’s Paradox</a>. Springs and strings can be changed to edges. Edges in turn relate to networks of many kinds; the following figure comes from a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aad490">paper</a> on power grids:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/smile/" rel="attachment wp-att-19931"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19931" height="282" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/smile.jpg?resize=500%2C282&amp;ssl=1" width="500"/></a></p>
<p>
The original paradox is that adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down overall traffic flow through it. The new road initially makes its use locally optimal for everyone until a saturation point <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is reached. The limit on choices before and after using the new road, however, also makes the <img alt="{N}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> usage increase the cost of the previously optimal strategies. This evolves a worse configuration for everyone that is not locally improvable. </p>
<p>
The flip side is that a clog-prone network can sometimes be improved by removing certain parts of it. This paradox has been used to explain instances of improved traffic flow when existing major roads are closed. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws12/ct/Braess-paradox.pdf">In Stuttgart, Germany</a> after investments into the road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve until a section of newly-built road was closed for traffic again.<p/>
<p/></li><li>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/health/what-if-they-closed-42d-street-and-nobody-noticed.html">ON Earth Day</a> this year (1990), New York City’s Transportation Commissioner decided to close 42d Street, which as every New Yorker knows is always congested. “Many predicted it would be doomsday,” said the Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio. “You didn’t need to be a rocket scientist or have a sophisticated computer queuing model to see that this could have been a major problem.”<p/>
<p>
But to everyone’s surprise, Earth Day generated no historic traffic jam. Traffic flow actually improved when 42d Street was closed.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Today’s News and the Paradox </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This started as a post on Éva Tardos, who is a professor at Cornell University. She just was named the 2022-2023 ACM <a href="https://awards.acm.org/athena">Athena Lecturer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science. Each year ACM honors a preeminent woman computer scientist as the Athena Lecturer. The recipient gives an invited talk at a major ACM conference of her choice. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
What is the connection between Tardos as Athena Lecturer and the Braess Paradox? Indeed, the citation notes her contributions to algorithmic game theory. These are game-theory situations in her purview.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/et-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-19933"><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-19933" height="200" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/et.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
She has many papers that bound approximations to optimal solutions. Often the answers are likely to be hard to solve exactly—they are NP-complete for example. But she has some wonderful papers that study questions where paradoxes apply regardless of whether <img alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> or <img alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/> is true.</p>
<p>
One is the <a href="http://www.timroughgarden.org/papers/mcbp.pdf">paper</a> by Henry Lin, Tim Roughgarden, Eva Tardos, and Asher Walkover, and is titled, “Stronger Bounds On Braess’s Paradox And The Maximum Latency Of Selfish Routing.” It addresses the flip-side paradox: how much can the performance of a network be improved by removing one edge? One might expect that removing an edge might be less likely to improve the smallest networks, as well as less impactful on larger networks, so that the highest improvement would come in some mid-size example. In fact, they show that Braess’s original example of four nodes and five edges has the highest improvement. </p>
<p>
They also show that the problem of finding the maximum improvement possible within a sub-network of a large network is <img alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002"/>-hard to approximate, even sub-exponentially. We wonder how this connects to an earlier <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~fan/wp/braess_rsa.pdf">paper</a> by Fan Chung, Stephen Young, and Wenbo Zhao showing that expander graphs tend to have many subgraphs exhibiting the Braess paradox. This is surprising because expanders by-and-large promote free network flows.</p>
<p/><p>
We add that Tardos is just the third Athena Lecturer from the theory area since the first award in 2006: Shafi Goldwasser in 2008 and Nancy Lynch in 2012. Congrats, Éva. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I did not know about the Braess Paradox before reading about her award; Ken thinks he saw it a decade or so ago. Previously my favorite result of Tardos was in the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/Gap.Between.Monotone.NonMonotone.Circuit.Complexity.is.Exponential.pdf">paper</a>, “The Gap Between Monotone And Non-Monotone Circuit Complexity Is Exponential.” Now not so clear.</p>
<p>
What is your favorite of her results?</p>

<p><i>
“Missingness”, or the absence of features from an input, is a concept that is fundamental to many model debugging tools. In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">latest paper</a>, we examine the challenges of implementing missingness in computer vision. In particular, we demonstrate how current approximations of missingness introduce biases into the debugging process of computer vision models. We then show how a natural implementation of missingness based on VITs can mitigate these biases and lead to more reliable model debugging.
</i></p>

<p>Deep learning models can learn powerful features. However, these learned features can be unintuitive or spurious. Indeed, recent studies have pointed out that ML models often leverage unexpected—and, in fact, undesirable—associations. These include image pathology detection models that rely on <a href="https://cerre.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai_explainability_whitepaper_google.pdf">pen marks made by radiologist</a> and image classifiers that focus too much on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">backgrounds</a> or on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">texture</a>. Such prediction mechanisms can cause models to fail in downstream tasks or new environments.</p>

<p>How can we detect model failures caused by relying on such brittle or undesirable associations? Answering this question is a major goal of model debugging. Work in this context brought forth techniques that allow, for example, surfacing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796">human aligned</a> <a href="https://gradientscience.org/glm_saga/">concepts</a>, <a href="https://gradientscience.org/3db/">probing specific types of bias a model uses</a>, or highlighting features that were <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07451">important for a</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">specific prediction</a>.</p>

<p>A common theme in many of these debugging methods is to study model behavior on so-called counterfactual inputs, i.e., inputs with and without specific features. For example, consider the image of a dog being held by its owner below. By removing the owner from the image, we can study how much our model’s prediction depends on the presence of a human. In a similar vein, we can remove parts of the dog (head, body, paws) to identify which ones among them are most critical for correctly classifying the image. This concept of “the absence of a feature” from the input is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/">missingness</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Woman-Dog Example" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/woman_dog_example.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
        By removing parts of the image, we can study how much our model depends on a given input feature (such as the human, or the dog's snout).  
</div>

<p>Indeed, this primitive of missingness is used quite a lot in model debugging techniques. For example, widely-used methods such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">integrated gradients</a> leverage it. It also has been applied to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07623">radiology images</a> to understand the regions of the scan that are important for diagnoses, or to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04301">flag spurious correlations</a>. Finally, in natural language processing, model designers often remove words <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12487">to understand their impact on the output</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Example of LIME" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/main_lime.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
LIME, a popular model debugging method, relies on the  missingness primitive to generate model explanations. The method first generates a set of ablations by randomly removing parts of the image. These ablations are then used to generate a model explanation, typically obtained by fitting a sparse linear model to them. 
</div>

<h2 id="challenges-of-implementing-missingness-in-computer-vision">Challenges of implementing missingness in computer vision</h2>

<p>Missingness is a rather intuitive notion: we simply would like the model to predict as if the corresponding part of the input didn’t exist. Also, in a domain such as NLP implementing this primitive is fairly straightforward: we simply drop the corresponding words from the sentence. However, in the context of computer vision, its proper implementation turns out to be much more challenging. This is because images are spatially contiguous objects: it is unclear how to leave a “hole” in the image.</p>

<p>Researchers thus have come up with all kinds of ways to “fill” such hole, i.e., approximating missingness by replacing the region with other pixels. This involves <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf">blacking out the pixels</a>, replacing them with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf">random noise</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03296.pdf">blurring the corresponding image region</a>. However, these approaches, even though very natural, turn out to have unintended effects. For example, researchers found that <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/">saliency maps generated with integrated gradients are quite sensitive to the chosen baseline color of the filling</a>, and thus can change significantly based on the (arbitrary) choice of that missingness approximation.</p>

<p><img alt="Woman-Dog Example" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/various_approx_original.png" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Practitioners often approximate missingness in computer vision by replacing the removed region with other types of pixels. Examples include blacking out, using the mean pixel color, filling with random noise, or blurring the image.
</div>

<!-- What impact do missingness approximations have—especially with respect to model debugging? In our [recent work][arxiv], we systematically investigate how approximations like blacking out pixels can create bias, where the model uses masked out regions to make predictions rather than ignoring them. Moreover, we find that this _missingness bias_ can hinder our ability to debug models. We then show how transformer-based architectures can enable a more natural implementation of missingness, allowing us to mitigate this bias and thus improve model debugging.  -->

<h2 id="missingness-approximations-can-create-bias">Missingness approximations can create bias</h2>

<p>So, what impact do such missingness approximations actually have on the resulting model predictions? In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">recent work</a>, we systematically investigate the bias that these approximations can imbue. Specifically, <i>we find that models end up using masked out regions to make predictions rather than simply ignoring them.</i></p>

<p>For example, take a look below at the image of a spider from ImageNet, where we have removed various regions from the image by blacking out the corresponding pixels.</p>

<div id="bias_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
    Various regions of an image are removed by blacking out pixels. Regardless of what regions from the image are masked, a ResNet-50 outputs a wrong class. 
</div>

<p>It turns out that irrespective of what subregions of the image are removed, a standard CNN (e.g., ResNet-50) outputs incorrect classes, even when most of the foreground object is not obscured. In fact, taking a closer look at the randomly masked images, we find that the model seems to be relying on the masking pattern itself to make the prediction (e.g., predicting class “crossword”).</p>

<p>To analyze this bias more quantitatively, we measure how missingness approximations impact the output class distribution of a Resnet-50 classifier (over the whole dataset).  Specifically, we iteratively black out parts of ImageNet images, and keep track of how the probability of predicting any one class changes. Before blacking out any pixels, the model predicts a roughly equal number of each class on the ImageNet test set (which is what one would expect given that this test set is class balanced). However, when we apply missingness approximations, this distribution skews heavily toward classes such as maze, crossword puzzle, and carton.</p>

<div id="anno"> 
    <canvas height="15%" id="resnet_bar_chart" width="30%"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
    We measure the shift in output class distribution after applying a (blacking out) missingness approximations. As patches are increasingly blacked out, the ResNet-50 classifier's predictions skew from a uniform distribution toward a few specific classes such as maze, crossword puzzle, and carton.
</div>

<p>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">paper</a> investigates this missingness bias in more depth by exploring different approximations, datasets, mask sizes, etc.</p>

<h2 id="missingness-bias-in-model-debugging-a-case-study-on-lime">Missingness bias in model debugging: A case study on LIME</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, missingness primitive is often used by model debugging techniques—how does the above-mentioned bias impact them? To answer this question, we focus on a popular feature attribution method: local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a>.</p>

<div id="lime_examples_widget" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
    Examples of generated LIME explanations represented as a heat map. High-intensity regions contribute more to the prediction of the model than low-intensity ones. On the right, the top 20 image regions identified by the LIME explanation are masked in black.
</div>

<p>The image above depicts an example LIME explanation generated for a ResNet-50 classifier. Specifically, for a given image, LIME generates a heatmap highlighting the regions of the image based on how much they impact prediction (according to LIME). While sometimes LIME highlights the foreground object (which is what one would expect), in most cases it also highlights rather irrelevant regions scattered all over the image. Why is this the case?</p>

<p>Although we can’t say for sure, we suspect that this behavior is caused in large part by the fact that the underlying ResNet-50 classifier relies on masked regions in the image to make predictions, and this tricks it into believing that these regions are important. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">our paper</a>, we perform a more detailed quantitative analysis of the missingness bias in LIME explanations, and find that it indeed makes them more inconsistent and, during evaluation, indistinguishable from random explanations.</p>

<h2 id="a-more-natural-implementation-of-missingness">A more natural implementation of missingness</h2>
<p>What is the right way to represent missing pixels then? Ideally, since replacing pixels with other pixels can lead to missingness bias, we would like to be able to remove these regions altogether. But what about the need of having the images be represented by contiguous inputs?</p>

<p>Certainly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require such spatial contiguity because convolutions slide filters across the image. But do we even need to use CNNs? Not really!</p>

<p>How about we turn to a different architecture:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">vision transformers</a> (ViTs)? Unlike CNNs, ViTs do not use convolutions and operate instead on sets of patches that correspond to positionally encoded regions of the image. Specifically, a ViT has two stages when processing an input image:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: split the image into square patches, and positionally encode these patches into tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-attention</strong>: pass the set of tokens through several self-attention layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>After tokenization, the self-attention layers operate on the set of tokens rather than the entire image. Thus, ViTs enables a far more natural implementation of missingness: <i>we can simply drop the tokens that encode the region we want to remove!</i></p>

    ViTs split the image into a set of tokens, where each token represents a patch in the image. In order to implement missingness, we can simply drop the tokens corresponding to the regions we would like to remove.
</div>

<h2 id="mitigating-missingness-bias-through-vits">Mitigating missingness bias through ViTs</h2>

<p>As we now demonstrate,  using this more natural implementation of missingness turns out to substantially mitigate the missingness bias that we saw earlier. Indeed, recall that, with a ResNet-50, blacking out pixels biased the model toward specific classes (such as crossword). But, a similarly sized ViT-small (ViT-S) architecture is able to side-step this bias (when we implement token dropping), maintaining a correct (or at least related) prediction.</p>

<div id="bias_examples_widget2" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
   When we remove image regions by dropping tokens with a ViT-S classifier, the model maintains its original prediction or, at least, predicts a related class.
</div>

<p>This difference is even more striking when we examine the output class distribution corresponding to removal of image regions: while for our ResNet-50 classifier we have seen this distribution being skewed toward certain classes, for the ViT classifier, this distribution remains close to uniform.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="improving-model-debugging-with-vits">Improving model debugging with ViTs</h2>

<p>So, we have seen that ViTs allow us to mitigate missingness bias. Can we thus use ViTs to improve model debugging too? We return to our case study of LIME. As we demonstrated earlier, LIME relies on a notion of missingness, and is thus vulnerable to missingness bias when using approximations like blacking out pixels. What happens when we use ViTs and token dropping instead?</p>

<div id="lime_examples_widget2" style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;"/>
<div class="footnote">
Examples of generated LIME explanations for a ResNet (blacking out pixels) and a ViT (dropping tokens). 
</div>

<p>The figure above displays examples of the LIME explanations generated for a ResNet classifier and for a ViT classifier (dropping tokens). Qualitatively, one can see that the explanations for the ViT seem more aligned with human intuition, highlighting the main object instead of regions in the background. We confirm these observations with a more quantitative analysis in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">our paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we studied how missingness approximations can lead to biases and, in turn, impact the model debugging techniques that leverage them. We also demonstrated how transformer-based architectures can enable a seamless implementation of missingness that allows us to side-step missingness bias and lead to more reliable model debugging.</p>

    <title>TR22-052 |  Verifying The Unseen: Interactive Proofs for Label-Invariant Distribution Properties | 

	Tal Herman, 

	Guy Rothblum</title>
    <summary>Given i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution over a large domain $[N]$, approximating several basic quantities, including the distribution's support size, its entropy, and its distance from the uniform distribution, requires $\Theta(N / \log N)$ samples [Valiant and Valiant, STOC 2011].

Suppose, however, that we can interact with a powerful but untrusted prover, who knows the entire distribution (or a good approximation of it). Can we use such a prover to approximate (or rather, to approximately {\em verify}) such statistical quantities more efficiently? We show that this is indeed the case: the support size, the entropy, and the distance from the uniform distribution, can all be approximately verified via a 2-message interactive proof, where the communication complexity, the verifier's running time, and the sample complexity are $\widetilde{O}({\sqrt{N}})$. For all these quantities, the sample complexity is tight up to $\polylog N$ factors (for any interactive proof, regardless of its communication complexity or verification time).

More generally, we give a tolerant interactive proof system with the above sample and communication complexities for verifying a distribution's proximity to any label-invariant property (any property that is invariant to re-labeling of the elements in the distribution's support). The verifier's running time in this more general protocol is also $\widetilde{O}({\sqrt{N}})$, under a mild assumption about the complexity of deciding, given a compact representation of a distribution, whether it is in the property or far from it.</summary>

    <title>TR22-051 |  Low Degree Testing over the Reals | 

	Noah Fleming, 

	Vipul Arora, 

	Arnab Bhattacharyya, 

	Esty Kelman, 

	Yuichi Yoshida</title>
    <summary>We study the problem of testing whether a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $d$ in the distribution-free testing model. Here, the distance between functions is measured with respect to an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ from which we can draw samples. In contrast to previous work, we do not assume that $\mathcal{D}$ has finite support. 
    
We design a tester that given query access to $f$, and sample access to $\mathcal{D}$, makes $(d/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}$ many queries to $f$, accepts with probability $1$ if $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d$, and rejects with probability at least $2/3$ if every degree-$d$ polynomial $P$ disagrees with $f$ on a set of mass at least $\varepsilon$ with respect to $\mathcal{D}$. Our result also holds under mild assumptions when we receive only a polynomial number of bits of precision for each query to $f$, or when $f$ can only be queried on rational points representable using a logarithmic number of bits. Along the way, we prove a new stability theorem for multivariate polynomials that may be of independent interest.</summary>

    <title>1-week long Summer School for Ugrads Interested in Theory, and my comments on it</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Recently a grad student in CS at UMCP emailed me the following email he got,  thinking (correctly) that I should forward it to interested ugrads. </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Are you interested in theoretical computer science including topics like algorithms, cryptography, machine learning, and others? If so, please consider applying to the New Horizons in Theoretical Computer Science week-long online summer school! The school will contain several mini-courses from top researchers in the field. The course is free of charge,and we welcome applications from undergraduates majoring in computer science or related fields. We particularly encourage applications from students that are members of groups that are currently under-represented in theoretical computer science.</p><p>Students from previous years have shared with us that the mini-lectures, online group activities, and interactions with other students and the friendly TAs were extraordinarily engaging and fun.</p><p>For full consideration, please complete the application (it’s short and easy!) by April 25, 2022. The summer school will take place online from June 6 to June 10.</p><p>Please see our website for details: see <a href="https://tcs-summerschool.ttic.edu/">here</a> </p><p>Any questions can be directed to summer-school-admin-2022@ttic.edu.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A few points about this</p><p>1) I emailed them asking `why do people need to apply if its online and free?'</p><p>I had one answer in mind, but they gave me another one</p><p><i>Their Answer: </i>They want to have SMALL online activities in groups. If they had X students and want groups of size g then if X is large, X/g may be too large. </p><p><i>My Answer</i>: If people REGISTER for something they are more likely to actually show up. (I know of a conference that got MORE people going once they had registation, and even MORE when they began charging for it.) </p><p>2) I emailed them asking if the talks will, at some later point, be on line. They will be. I then realized that there are already LOTS of theory talks online that I have not gotten around to watching, and perhaps never will. Even so, the talks on line may well benefit people who goto the summer school if they want to look back and something. </p><p>3) Online conferences PROS and CONS:</p><p>PROS: Free (or very low cost), no hassle getting airfare and hotel, and if talks are recorded then you can see them later (that applies to in-person as well). </p><p>CONS: Less committed to going to it. Can go in a half-ass way. For example, you can go and then in the middle of a talk go do your laundry. Being FORCED to be in a ROOM with the SPEAKER may be good. Also, of course, no informal conversations in the hallways.  Also, less serendipity. </p><p>I want to say <i>It would to be good to see talks outside of my area </i>however, this may only be true for easy talks, perhaps talks in a new field, OR talks that are just barely outside my area so I have some context. </p><p>4) I was surprised I didn't get the email directly since I have more contact with ugrads (and I have this blog) then the grad student who alerted me to it. However, I have learned that information gets to people in random ways so perhaps not to surprising. </p></div>

    <title>TR22-050 |  Circuits Resilient to Short-Circuit Errors |

    <summary>Given a Boolean circuit $C$, we wish to convert it to a circuit $C'$ that computes the same function as $C$ even if some of its gates suffer from adversarial short circuit errors, i.e., their output is replaced by the value of one of their inputs [KLM97]. Can we design such a resilient circuit $C'$ whose size is roughly comparable to that of $C$? Prior work [KLR12, BEGY19] gave a positive answer for the special case where $C$ is a formula.

We study the general case and show that any Boolean circuit $C$ of size $s$ can be converted to a new circuit $C'$ of quasi-polynomial size $s^{O(\log s)}$ that computes the same function as $C$ even if a $1/51$ fraction of the gates on any root-to-leaf path in $C'$ are short circuited. Moreover, if the original circuit $C$ is a formula, the resilient circuit $C'$ is of near-linear size $s^{1+\epsilon}$. The construction of our resilient circuits utilizes the connection between circuits and DAG-like communication protocols} [Raz95, Pud10, Sok17], originally introduced in the context of proof complexity.</summary>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Optimal transport (OT) has recently gained lot of interest in machine learning. It is a natural tool to compare in a geometrically faithful way probability distributions. It finds applications in both supervised learning (using geometric loss functions) and unsupervised learning (to perform generative model fitting). OT is however plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since it might require a number of samples which grows exponentially with the dimension. In this talk, I will explain how to leverage entropic regularization methods to define computationally efficient loss functions, approximating OT with a better sample complexity. More information and references can be found on <a href="https://optimaltransport.github.io/">the website of our book</a> “Computational Optimal Transport.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We give the first almost-linear time algorithm for computing exact maximum flows and minimum-cost flows on directed graphs. By well-known reductions, this implies almost-linear time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching, optimal transport, and undirected vertex connectivity.</p>
<p>Our algorithm uses a new Interior Point Method (IPM) that builds the optimal flow as a sequence of an almost-linear number of approximate undirected minimum-ratio cycles, each of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynamic data structure.</p>
<p>Our framework extends to give an almost-linear time algorithm for computing flows that minimize general edge-separable convex functions to high accuracy. This gives the first almost-linear time algorithm for several problems including entropy-regularized optimal transport, matrix scaling, p-norm flows, and Isotonic regression.</p>

    <title>The Roeder Seq Problems was Solved Before I Posed it (Math)</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>  (Joint Post by Bill Gasarch, David Harris, and Tomas
Harris) </p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The divisor graph D(n) is an undirected graph with</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">vertex set V={1,...,n}$ and</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">edge set E={(a,b) :  a  divides  b 
or  b  divides  a }</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We denote the length of the longest simple path in D(n) by
L(n).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">EXAMPLE: if n=10 then one long-ish sequence is</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1,8,4,2,6,3,9</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">so L(10) GE 7. I leave it to the reader to do better OR to
show its optimal. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2017 Oliver Roeder asked for L(100) (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-number-any-number/">here</a>)
In a later post Roeder reported that Anders Kaseorg claimed L(100)=77
(see  <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-bathroom-occupied/">here</a>).
Anders gave a sequence and claimed that, by a computer search, this was
optimal. The column also claims that other people also claimed 77 and nobody
got a sequence of length 78, so the answer probably is 77 (it is now known that
it IS 77).  Roeder also mentions the case of n=1000 for which Kaseorg
showed L(1000) GE 418. No nontrivial lower bounds are known. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2019 I (Gasarch) asked about asymptotic results for
L(n)  (see my blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/09/a-problem-i-thought-was-interesting-now.html">here</a> and
my open problems column <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/nate.pdf">here</a>.)
I began working on it with David and Tomas Harris. David proved that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Omega( n/( (log n)^{1.68} )  LE  L(n) 
LE  O( n/( (log n)^{0.79} ).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We also studied human-readable proofs that L(100) LE X for
some reasonable X, though getting a human-readable proof for X=77 seemed
impossible. We did get L(100) LE 83, in a human-readable proof. (Some
commenters on my post to sketched a proof  that L(100) LE 83 and another
that L(100) LE 80 as well.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> But it turned out that this problem had already been
studied, predating Roeder's column. (This blog post is all about the math, bout
the math, no treble.  My next post will be about how we didn't know the
literature until our paper was close to being finished.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1982 Pomerance showed L(n)  LE o(n) (see <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/divisorgraph.pdf">here</a>).
Pollington had earlier shown </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
                     
    L(n) GE ne^{polylog(n)};</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">however, the paper is not online and hence is lost to
history forever. (If you can find an online copy please email me the pointer
and I will edit this post.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1995 Gerald Tenenbaum showed, in a paper written in
French,  that there exists a,b such that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
               n/(log n)^a LE L(n) LE
n/(log n)^b (see <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/ASENS_1995_4_28_2_115_0/">here</a>). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">More recently, in 2021, Saias showed, in a paper written in
French, that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
                     
L(n) GE (0.3 - o(1)) n/log n (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03855">here</a>). </p><p class="MsoNormal">(ADDED LATER:  I got a very angry email telling me that the paper was in English and that I am a moron. It turns out that the abstract is in English but the paper is in French, hence the person who send the letter only read the abstract which explains their mistake.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He conjectures that L(n)  SIM cn/log n where c is
likely in the interval [3,7]. (Apparently, no other information is known about
the relevant constant factors in the estimates.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Interestingly, the work of Tenenbaum and Saias also
demonstrates why the study of L(n)  is not an idle problem in recreational
mathematics. The upper bounds come from results on certain density conditions
for prime factorization of random integers. That is, given an integer x chosen
uniformly at random from the range {1,..., n} with prime factorization p1 GE p2
GE ... one wants to show that, with high probability, the primes pi are close
to each other in a certain sense. Most recent results on L(n) have been tied
closely with improved asymptotic estimates for deep number theory problems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Determining the value of L(100) (i.e., Roeder's problem) was
mentioned in Saias's paper. He claims that L(100) = 77 was discovered by Arnaud
Chadozeau, who himself has written a number of papers on other properties of
D(n). Since this paper was in 2021 it was after Roeder's column; however, we
believe that the different discoveries of L(100) are independent. The recent
work around Roeder's column appears to be done independently from the extensive
French-language literature on the topic.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following problems are  likely still open:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a) Find L(n) exactly for as many n as you can.  This
would clearly need a computer program.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A listing of L(n) for n = 1 ... 200, computed by Rob Pratt
and Nathan McNew,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">appears as OEIS #A337125. This also includes additional
references.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">b) Find human-readable proofs for upper bounds on L(n)
(likely not exact) for as many</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">n as you can.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">  </p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">ADDED LATER: Gaétan Berthe emailed me </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm the author of the last comment on your article about
Roeder Sequence , as your curious about the subject I can share what we've done
with my friend Paul Revenant those last few years for fun.</p><p class="MsoNormal">
<br/>
It all started with a competition between our classmates (see <a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gaetan.berthe/challenge.php">here</a> though note that its in French) for the 100 and 1000 cases, after a few months Paul using a MIP solver gurobi
was able to found a solution of size 666, and last year by studying the
structure of the 666 solution we were able, with the help of gurobi again, to
prove that there was no 667 solution either.<br/>
<br/>
Paul then achieve to find very probable value of the sequence for 1 to 1000 (we
didn't automatize the proof of 666 but it should be doable). On my side I tried
to look for good solutions for the 10000 case, again using gurobi and the structure
that appeared in the solution of size 666. The structure enable to cut the
problem in two subpart, so the search goes faster I was able to find a solution
of size 5505.<br/>
<br/>
So I would say that the two mains reasons we're able to prove optimality for high
numbers as 1000 are:<br/>
<br/>
- MIP solver such as gurobi are very powerful tools.<br/>
<br/>
- The longest path in the divisor graph are highly structured.<br/>
<br/>
I joined our informal proof of the 666 case (the solution at the end), what is
interesting is to understand how the solution is composed of different blocks
depending of the prime decomposition of the elements. I joined lower bound from
1 to 1000 computed by Paul, that are very likely to be optimal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He also emailed me</p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">1)  a list of the numbers I call L(n) for n=1 to 1000.
These have not been refereed though I think they are correct. The list is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/1-1000.txt">here</a></p><p class="MsoNormal"/>

<p class="MsoNormal">AND</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2)  a PROOF that L(1000)\le 666 (and they HAVE a
sequence of length 666, so L(1000)=666).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Again, not refereed, but you can read the proof
yourself <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/proof1000.pdf">here</a> WARNING- the proof is in ENGLISH, so you cannot use it to improve your
mathematical French. </p></div>
