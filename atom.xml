    <title>Efficient Algorithms for Ortho-Radial Graph Drawing</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552435200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Niedermann:Benjamin.html">Benjamin Niedermann</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rutter:Ignaz.html">Ignaz Rutter</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/w/Wolf:Matthias.html">Matthias Wolf</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05048">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Orthogonal drawings, i.e., embeddings of graphs into grids, are a classic
topic in Graph Drawing. Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the
number of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms
is the existence of an orthogonal representation that allows to describe such
drawings purely combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges
around each vertex and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any
kind of geometric information such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths. Barth
et al. [2] have established the existence of an analogous ortho-radial
representation for ortho-radial drawings, which are embeddings into an
ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are concentric circles around the origin and
straight-line spokes emanating from the origin but excluding the origin itself.
While any orthogonal representation admits an orthogonal drawing, it is the
circularity of the ortho-radial grid that makes the problem of characterizing
valid ortho-radial representations all the more complex and interesting. Barth
et al. prove such a characterization. However, the proof is existential and
does not provide an efficient algorithm for testing whether a given
ortho-radial representation is valid, let alone actually obtaining a drawing
from an ortho-radial representation. In this paper we give quadratic-time
algorithms for both of these tasks. They are based on a suitably constrained
left-first DFS in planar graphs and several new insights on ortho-radial
representations. Our validity check requires quadratic time, and a naive
application of it would yield a quartic algorithm for constructing a drawing
from a valid ortho-radial representation. Using further structural insights we
speed up the drawing algorithm to quadratic running time.

Optimization Problems (CPOP): Sum of Squares (SOS), Sum of Diagonally Dominant
Polynomials (SDSOS), Sum of Nonnegative Circuits (SONC), and the Sherali Adams
(SA) hierarchies. We prove a collection of dependencies among these hierarchies
both for general CPOPs and for optimization problems on the Boolean hypercube.
Key results include for the general case that the SONC and SOS hierarchy are
polynomially incomparable, while SDSOS is contained in SONC. A direct
consequence is the non-existence of a Putinar-like Positivstellensatz for
SDSOS. On the Boolean hypercube, we show as a main result that Schm\"udgen-like
versions of the hierarchies SDSOS*, SONC*, and SA* are polynomially equivalent.
Moreover, we show that SA* is contained in any Schm\"udgen-like hierarchy that
provides a O(n) degree bound.

    <title>conLSH: Context based Locality Sensitive Hashing for Mapping of noisy SMRT Reads</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1552435200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Angana Chakraborty, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Bandyopadhyay:Sanghamitra.html">Sanghamitra Bandyopadhyay</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04925">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing is a recent advancement of Next
Gen technology developed by Pacific Bio (PacBio). It comes with an explosion of
long and noisy reads demanding cutting edge research to get most out of it. To
deal with the high error probability of SMRT data, a novel contextual Locality
Sensitive Hashing (conLSH) based algorithm is proposed in this article, which
can effectively align the noisy SMRT reads to the reference genome. Here,
sequences are hashed together based not only on their closeness, but also on
similarity of context. The algorithm has $\mathcal{O}(n^{\rho+1})$ space
requirement, where $n$ is the number of sequences in the corpus and $\rho$ is a
constant. The indexing time and querying time are bounded by $\mathcal{O}(
\frac{n^{\rho+1} \cdot \ln n}{\ln \frac{1}{P_2}})$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^\rho)$
respectively, where $P_2 &gt; 0$, is a probability value. This algorithm is
particularly useful for retrieving similar sequences, a widely used task in
biology. The proposed conLSH based aligner is compared with rHAT, popularly
used for aligning SMRT reads, and is found to comprehensively beat it in speed
as well as in memory requirements. In particular, it takes approximately
$24.2\%$ less processing time, while saving about $70.3\%$ in peak memory
requirement for H.sapiens PacBio dataset.

is the complement of an induced cycle of length at least $4$. A hole or

$k$-prism is the graph consisting of two cliques of size $k$ joined by a

variety of fundamental problems, including sorting, semisorting, list ranking,
tree contraction, range minima, and set union, intersection and difference. In
the binary-forking model, tasks can only fork into two child tasks, but can do
so recursively and asynchronously, and join up later. The tasks share memory,
and costs are measured in terms of work (total number of instructions), and
span (longest dependence chain).
</p>
<p>Due to the asynchronous nature of the model, and a variety schedulers that
are efficient in both theory and practice, variants of the model are widely
used in practice in languages such as Cilk and Java Fork-Join. PRAM algorithms
can be simulated in the model but at a loss of a factor of $\Omega(\log n)$ so
most PRAM algorithms are not optimal in the model even if optimal on the PRAM.
All algorithms we describe are optimal in work and span (logarithmic in span).
Several are randomized. Beyond being the first optimal algorithms for their
problems in the model, most are very simple.

    <summary>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead. The one whose preprint appears today, “Counting polygon triangulations is hard” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04737">arXiv:1903.04737</a>), proves that it’s -complete to count the triangulations of a polygon with holes.</p>

<p>It’s easy to prove that it’s -hard to count maximum non-crossing subsets of line segment arrangements: the intersections graphs of line segments include all the planar graphs, so this follows immediately from the -completeness of maximum independent sets in planar graphs. The gadgets in my paper (drawn below) turn a single line segment into a part of a polygon for which many triangulations use diagonals in approximately the same position as the line segment, and there are few other triangulations. By using these gadgets, one could easily construct a polygon in which most of the triangulations correspond to maximum non-crossing subsets, showing that it’s also -hard to count triangulations. But this is unsatisfactory because it’s the wrong kind of completeness. For counting problems, we want -completeness, not just -hardness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Gadgets for proving hardness of polygon triangulation" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/tricount-gadgets.svg"/></p>

<p>The reason the outline above isn’t already a -completeness proof is that we need to control the rest of the triangulation better. It’s not enough for most triangulations to come from maximum non-crossing subsets. We need each maximum non-crossing subset of line segments to contribute exactly the same number of triangulations (or at least a predictable and controlled number) so that we can recover the number of maximum non-crossing subsets from the number of triangulations. The gadgets control the parts of the triangulation near each segment of the non-crossing subsets, but we also need to control the parts of the triangulation that are not near those segments. Achieving this took much of the work in my new paper. There are two main ideas: First, we use special arrangements with the property that, when you close off the gadgets of a maximum non-crossing subset, the remaining parts of the polygon form pieces of predictable shapes for which we can count the triangulations. In these arrangements, there are two colors of segments, red and blue; each blue segment is crossed by two red segments, and each red segment is crossed in the order blue-red-blue. So we need a new counting reduction from graph independent sets that produces arrangements of this type. And second, we decompose the total number of maximum non-crossing subsets into a sum of smaller numbers, of subsets that have a given number of red segments. Subsets with the same number of red segments leads to the same numbers of triangulations, allowing the terms in the sum to be recovered from the number of triangulations.</p>

<p>A secondary goal was to do this all using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">polynomial-time counting reduction</a> rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction">Turing reductions</a> that are more commonly used for -completeness. One cannot use an even stronger notion of reduction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimonious_reduction">parsimonious reductions</a>, to reduce  problems that might have zero solutions to a problem like triangulation that always has at least one. But to me, counting reductions are more closely analogous to the many-one reductions used for -completeness. We can use them, so we should use them. So the reductions in the paper are polynomial-time counting reductions, but more work would be needed to prove that the starting graph problem I used (counting independent sets in regular planar graphs) is complete for those reductions.</p>

<p>Surprisingly to me, this appears to be the first published proof of a -completeness result in two-dimensional computational geometry. And although some 2d geometric structures have been proven -hard to construct (and therefore -hard to count) it seems to be the first hardness proof of any kind for counting 2d structures that can be constructed rather than counted in polynomial time. But as I said at the top of this post, it’s not what I really wanted to prove. I was hoping to prove hardness for counting non-crossing structures on point sets, such as simple polygons, triangulations, non-crossing matchings, or pointed pseudotriangulations. The polygon question was suggested to me by Sara Billey when I visited her last April, in connection with a different problem we were working on (and still haven’t published). And counting the triangulations of a point set would fit the theme of my recent book, because this count is a numerical parameter that depends only on the order type of the points and mostly behaves monotonically under point deletion (exception: delete the center point of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx">quincunx</a>). Instead I had to settle for polygon triangulations. But maybe another paper can take this line of research one step farther, to counting problems on points.</p>

    <title>TR19-040 |  The Complexity of Finding {$S$}-factors in Regular Graphs | 

	Sanjana Kolisetty, 

	Linh Le, 

	Ilya Volkovich, 

	Mihalis Yannakakis</title>
    <summary>A graph $G$ has an \emph{$S$-factor} if there exists a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that for all $v \in V: \deg_F(v) \in S$.
The simplest example of such factor is a $1$-factor, which corresponds to a perfect matching in a graph. In this paper we study the computational complexity of finding $S$-factors in regular graphs.
Our techniques combine some classical as well as recent tools from graph theory.</summary>

    <title>TR19-039 |  Planarity, Exclusivity, and Unambiguity | 

	Eric Allender, 

	Archit Chauhan, 

	Samir Datta, 

	Anish Mukherjee</title>
    <summary>We provide new upper bounds on the complexity of the s-t-connectivity problem in planar graphs, thereby providing additional evidence that this problem is not complete for NL. This also yields a new upper bound on the complexity of computing edit distance. Building on these techniques, we provide new upper bounds on the complexity of several other computational problems on planar graphs. All of these problems are shown to be solvable in logarithmic time on a concurrent-read exclusive-write (CREW) PRAM. The new upper bounds are provided by making use of a known characterization of CREW algorithms in terms of "unambiguous" AC$^1$ circuits. This seems to be the first occasion where this characterization has been used in order to provide new upper bounds on natural problems.</summary>

    <title>Richard Karp: His influence and how to honor him</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When I first saw the definition of NP-Complete I first thought<i> if there are NP-complete problems I suspect they are contrived. </i>When I saw the proof that  SAT is NP-complete I thought <i>okay, so there is one natural problem  NP-complete by a trick of encoding, but I suspect there aren't any more.</i>  I then read Karp's article that had 22 NP-complete problems. I thought <i>okay, there are 22, but I suspect there are no more. </i>No I didn't think that. But the point is that Cook and Karp together birthed modern complexity theory by introduction NP-completeness and showing that there are MANY natural problems that are NP-complete.<br/>
<br/>
How many people has Richard Karp inspired? I don't know but I suspect it's a  cardinal between countable and the reals so it may depend on your model of set theory. Later in this post I will present Samir Khuller's story of how Richard Karp inspired him.<br/>
<br/>
How to honor him?  The Simons inst. is currently welcoming contributions to the Richard M Karp Fund, which honors the scientific contributions of Founding Director Dick Karp. The fund will provide vital support for the mission and activities of the Simons institute. They have a deadline of Pi-Day. You can go <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/support/donate">here</a> to contribute and/or <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/goldwasserkarp.txt">here</a> for a letter from Shafi Goldwasser, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Umesh Vazirani about the fund.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, Samir's story:<br/>
<br/>
<div>
<b>Mentoring and Influence via a Train Journey...</b></div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
Almost to the day, 33 years ago I was running from my dorm room to catch an unreliable bus to the train station as I headed home for a mid-semester break.  On the way,I  stopped by the mailroom, and not knowing where to put the CACM that had just arrived,  stuffed it into the side of my bag and in the process, dropping my   notebook in the process. On the train, when I looked for my  notebook to go over  some material I realized it was missing! All I had was a CACM and a very long train ride. Skimming through the journal, I found Karp’s Turing Award article “Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness“. I  started reading this article, and was riveted! It was one of those life changing moments for me, when my immediate future became clear - I wanted to study Theoretical Computer Science and specifically the complexity of combinatorial problems. Without ever having met Dick Karp, he changed my life forever.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I met Dick long after he influenced me via his Turing Award Lecture and it was a real privilege to have had the opportunity to interview him via a fireside chat at Simons. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DT_UeJwps">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br/></div>
<div>
I am delighted about the fund Bill mentions above as the money that goes to it will help inspire others as Karp inspired me.</div>

<p/><p>
Bill Gasarch and Clyde Kruskal are colleagues in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. They have just seen the publication of their <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261">book</a> <em>Problems With a Point</em>.</p>
<p>
Today Dick and I congratulate them on the book and give a brief overview of it.</p>
<p>
The tandem of Bill and Clyde were <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/theorems-are-forever-a-great-one-from-1492/">featured</a> before on this blog in connection with a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.138.6154">series</a> of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apsurvey.pdf">papers</a> with James Glenn on sets of numbers that have no arithmetical progressions of length 3. </p>
<p>
Can a “series” have only two members? We could add a third <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11821069_13">paper</a> to the series, but it is by Glenn and Bill with Richard Beigel rather than Clyde and is on the different topic of multi-party communication complexity. But Clyde gets into the act since it is the topic of Chapter 19 of the book. That chapter analyzes a game form of problems that go back to a 1983 <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/multiparty-vdw.pdf">paper</a> by Dick with Ashok Chandra and Merrick Furst. Does this mean Dick should get some royalties? Note that this last link is to Bill’s website. And ‘vdw’ in this link seems to refer to van der Waerden’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden's_theorem">theorem</a>, which is a pillar of both Ramsey theory and number theory, which in turn receive much attention in the book.</p>
<p>
My last paragraph flits through divergent questions but they are representative of things that we working mathematical computing theorists think about every day—and of various kinds of content in the book. Of course, Bill partners on Lance Fortnow’s prominent <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/">blog</a> and so has shared all kinds of these musings. The book, which incorporates numerous posts by Bill but is not a “blog book” <em>per-se</em>, furnishes contexts for them. Let’s look at the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Book </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The book has three main parts, titled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stories With a Point. <p/>
</li><li>
Problems With a Point. <p/>
</li><li>
Theorems With a Point.
</li></ul>
<p>
All the chapters except three are prefaced with a section titled “Point”—or “The Point” or “Points”—after one sentence on prior knowledge needed, which often reads, “None.”</p>
<p>
The first part begins with a chapter titled, “When Terms From Math are Used By Civilians,” one of several with social discussion. The second is about how human aspects of sports upset statistical regularities one might expect to see. For example, many more baseball hitters have had season batting averages of .300 than .299 or .301, evidently because .300 is a “goal number” everyone strives to meet. There are numerous things in the book I didn’t know. </p>
<p>
The next chapter largely reproduces this record-long <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/07/disproofing-myth-that-many-early.html">post</a> on the blog but adds much extra commentary. Then there are chapters on what makes a mathematical function worth defining, on how mathematical objects are named, on Bill’s visit to a “Gathering for [Martin] Gardner” <a href="http://www.gathering4gardner.org/">conference</a>, on coloring the plane, two on imagined applications of Ramsey Theory to medieval history, and one on the methodological and social impact of having theorems that represent barriers to ways of trying to prove other theorems. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Chapter Ten </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
This last chapter of Part I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/lets-prove-something-instead-of-proving.html">draws</a> on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/but-seriously-now-folks-what-do-you.html">several</a> of Bill’s <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/other-fields-of-math-dont-prove-barrier.html">posts</a>. It goes most to the heart of what we all in computational complexity grapple with daily and benefits from having more context: As we just mused in this blog’s 10-year anniversary <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/18/have-ten-years-brought-us-closer/">post</a>, the major questions in complexity are not only as open as when we started, but as open as when the field started 50-plus years ago. There has barely been any discernible direct progress, and this is not only a concern for entering students but a retardant on everyone—about which we’ve given <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/lets-mention-foundations/">exhortation</a>.</p>
<p>
There are instead <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/barriers-to-pnp-proofs/">barrier</a> theorems saying <em>why</em> the main questions will not be resolvable by the very techniques that were used to build the field. Of three broad categories of barriers, “oracle results” de-fang all the methods typically taught in intro graduate complexity courses. Those methods meter computations at inputs and outputs but not how they “progress” inside toward a solution. Oracle languages supply blasts of external information that either make progress trivially quick or allow conditioning the terms of the complexity-class relation under analysis to information in the oracle that is tailored to obfuscate. Oracles of the former kind usually collapse complexity classes together, such as <img alt="{A =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A =}"/> any polynomial-space complete language making <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EA+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}"/>, whereas oracles <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> of the latter kind drive them apart (so <img alt="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EB+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}"/>) but often for reasons that frustrate as much as enlighten. When contemplating a new complexity class relation it is incumbent to frame a “relativized” version of it and see if some oracles can make it true and others false. Such oracle constructions were initially easy to come by—“fast food” for research—but their ultimate besideness-of-the-point is reflected in this early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/i-hate-oracle-results/">post</a> by Dick.</p>
<p>
Next after oracles is the “Natural Proofs” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">barrier</a>, which basically cuts against all the techniques taught in advanced graduate complexity courses unless they can somehow be weirdly narrow or intensely complex in their conceptual framing. The attitude on those is captured by the title of another early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">post</a> by Dick titled, “Who’s Afraid of Natural Proofs?” The third barrier is <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/algstoc.pdf">algebrization</a>, which cuts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Results_about_difficulty_of_proof">against</a> efforts to escape from oracles. </p>
<p>
Amid all this environment of obstruction, what of consequence can we prove? Well, the chapter on this has by far the highest concentration of Bill’s trademark all-capital letters and exclamation points. The initial “Point” section is titled, “Rant.” (The chapter also includes a page on the attempts to prove Euclid’s parallel postulate, which might be called the original “problem with a point.”)</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Part II </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Much of Part II involves the kind of problems that were used or considered for high-school mathematics competitions. By definition those are not research problems but they often point toward frontiers by representing accessible cases of them. The appealing ones blend equal parts research relevance, amusement value, and reward of technical command. Often they require mathematical “street smarts” and a repertoire of useful tricks and proof patterns. Practicing researchers will find this aspect of the book most valuable. The problems are mainly on the number-theory side of recreational mathematics, plus geometric and coloring problems. Egyptian fractions, prime-factor puzzles, sums over digits, summation formulas, and of course Ramsey theory all make their appearance. Here is one problem I mention partly to correct a small content error, where the correction seems to make the problem more interesting. Say that <img alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(n,m)}"/> holds if there are integers <img alt="{n_1,\dots,n_m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cn_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n_1,\dots,n_m}"/> such that </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  n_1 + \cdots + n_m = n \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_m} = 1. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++n_1+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+n_m+%3D+n+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Band%7D%5Cqquad+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_1%7D+%2B+%5Ccdots+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn_m%7D+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  n_1 + \cdots + n_m = n \qquad\text{and}\qquad \frac{1}{n_1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n_m} = 1. "/></p>
<p>A general principle discovered by Joseph Sylvester gives cases such as <img alt="{C(1861,5)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%281861%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(1861,5)}"/> being witnessed by </p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  1861 = 2 + 3 + 7 + 43 + 1806 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{43} + \frac{1}{1806}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++1861+%3D+2+%2B+3+%2B+7+%2B+43+%2B+1806+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Band%7D%5Cqquad+1+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B43%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1806%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  1861 = 2 + 3 + 7 + 43 + 1806 \qquad\text{and}\qquad 1 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{43} + \frac{1}{1806}. "/></p>
<p>How can it and related ideas be extended to other cases? The particular problem is given <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> to find <img alt="{m_n =}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n =}"/> the least <img alt="{m}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m}"/> such that <img alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{C(n,m)}"/> holds—and to find a witnessing sum. The error is an assertion that <img alt="{m_n \leq n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n \leq n}"/> “by writing <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> as a sum of <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>‘s,” but then the reciprocals add up to <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/> not <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. So is there any bound on <img alt="{m_n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{m_n}"/>? That is rather fun to think about. </p>
<p>
This problem’s chapter is made from a short <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/12/is-this-problem-too-hard-for-hs-math.html">post</a> with an enormous comments section.  There is also a chapter on the boundary between a fair problem and a “trick question” that much extends an April Fool’s post on the blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Part III </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Part III continues the nature of the problem content with emphasis on the worths of proofs of theorems. One illustration involving perfect numbers and sums of cubes notes that the proof loses value because it also applies to certain non-perfect numbers. Two things <em>en-passant</em>: First, Lemma 21.1 in this chapter needs qualification that <img alt="{a,b}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{a,b}"/> are relatively prime and <img alt="{x+1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x+1}"/> is prime. Second, this prompts me to note <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/">via</a> Gil Kalai the discovery by Tim Browning that the number 33 is a sum of three cubes: </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  33 = 8,\!866,\!128,\!975,\!287,\!528^3 + (-8,\!778,\!405,\!442,\!862,\!239)^3 + (-2,\!736,\!111,\!468,\!807,\!040)^3. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+8%2C%5C%21866%2C%5C%21128%2C%5C%21975%2C%5C%21287%2C%5C%21528%5E3+%2B+%28-8%2C%5C%21778%2C%5C%21405%2C%5C%21442%2C%5C%21862%2C%5C%21239%29%5E3+%2B+%28-2%2C%5C%21736%2C%5C%21111%2C%5C%21468%2C%5C%21807%2C%5C%21040%29%5E3.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  33 = 8,\!866,\!128,\!975,\!287,\!528^3 + (-8,\!778,\!405,\!442,\!862,\!239)^3 + (-2,\!736,\!111,\!468,\!807,\!040)^3. "/></p>
<p/><p><br/>
Gil points to a Quora <a href="https://affinemess.quora.com/HOLY-CRAP-33-IS-THE-SUM-OF-THREE-CUBES">post</a> by Alon Amit. There is only the bare equation on Browning’s <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~tbrownin/">homepage</a>, and nothing about his methods or how much he used computer search is known. The theme of proofs by computer runs through several chapters of Bill and Clyde’s book. It is also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">current</a> on Scott Aaronson’s blog—we would be remiss if we did not mention Scott in this post—and more widely.</p>
<p>
The penultimate chapter covers the beautiful theory of rectangle-free colorings of grids. We mentioned Bill’s involvement with this Ramsey-style problem in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/how-deep-is-your-coloring/">post</a> on what happened to be this blog’s third anniversary. We connected it to Kolmogorov complexity, which together with uncomputability is the subject of the last chapter. This and other chapters I’ve mentioned exemplify how the research ambit connects traditional mathematics with the terms and concerns of computing theory. How to work in this ambit may be the greatest value of the book for students. In all I found the book light, lighthearted, and enlightening.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The big open problem with the book is how it might help gear us up to tackle the big open problems.</p>

    <title>TR19-038 |  Statistical Difference Beyond the Polarizing Regime | 

	Itay Berman, 

	Akshay Degwekar, 

	Ron D. Rothblum, 

	Prashant Nalini Vasudevan</title>
    <summary>The polarization lemma for statistical distance ($\mathrm{SD}$), due to Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003), is an efficient transformation taking as input a pair of circuits $(C_0,C_1)$ and an integer $k$ and outputting a new pair of circuits $(D_0,D_1)$ such that if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1)\geq\alpha$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \geq 1-2^{-k}$ and if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1) \leq \beta$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \leq 2^{-k}$. The polarization lemma is known to hold for any constant values $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$, but extending the lemma to the regime in which $\alpha^2 \leq \beta &lt; \alpha$ has remained elusive. The focus of this work is in studying the latter regime of parameters. Our main results are:

1. Polarization lemmas for different notions of distance, such as Triangular Discrimination ($\mathrm{TD}$) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($\mathrm{JS}$), which enable polarization for some problems where the statistical distance satisfies $\alpha^2 &lt; \beta &lt; \alpha$. We also derive a polarization lemma for statistical distance with any inverse-polynomially small gap between $\alpha^2$ and $\beta$ (rather than a constant).

2. The average-case hardness of the statistical difference problem (i.e., determining whether the statistical distance between two given circuits is at least $\alpha$ or at most $\beta$), for any values of $\beta &lt; \alpha$, implies the existence of one-way functions. Such a result was previously only known for $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$.

3. A (direct) constant-round interactive proof for estimating the statistical distance between any two distributions (up to any inverse polynomial error) given circuits that generate them.</summary>

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Via <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">Scott</a>, John Horgan wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">blog post</a> following on his 1993 Scientific American article <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">The Death of Proof</a>. The article talked about computer-generated proofs, experimental mathematics and even mentioned some of our work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/103418.103428">transparent proofs</a> (basically time-efficient probabilistically checkable proofs). I got (sarcastically I think) accused of killing mathematics after that article but of course we had traditional proofs about probabilistically check proofs. Andrew Wiles got a sidebar titled "A Splendid Anachronism?" for merely solving the most famous open problem in all of mathematics. Somehow traditional mathematical proofs survived the article.<div>

Meanwhile in CACM, Moshe Vardi writes <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/3/234913-lost-in-math/fulltext">Lost in Math?</a> </div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
TCS is surely blessed with mathematical beauty. As a graduate student a long time ago, it was mathematical beauty that attracted me to TCS, and continued to lead my research for many years. I find computational complexity theory (or complexity theory, for short), with its theorems (for example, the time-hierarchy and space-hierarchy theorems) and its open questions (for example, P vs NP), to be hauntingly beautiful. Beauty, yes; but what about truth?</blockquote>
Here here on the beauty of complexity. So what about truth? I cover much of this in my <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext">P v NP survey</a>. In short the P v NP captures the most critical aspects of what is efficiently computable but it is not the endpoint. Nevertheless P v NP captures both truth and beauty and that's why the problem has so captivated and guided me throughout my research career.</div>

    <title>A dream come true, sort of: E-ink monitors</title>
    <summary>Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.

    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p style="text-align: justify;">Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dream is now becoming reality, sort of.  The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Ink-Paperlike-13-3-Monitor/dp/B07GWGFW1B/ref=asc_df_B07GWGFW1B/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=309743296044&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4273202700836301476&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9002067&amp;hvtargid=pla-571127059636&amp;psc=1">Dasung E-ink monitor </a>has no backlight and instead reportedly uses electric flows to move ink droplets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some consideration, spending yet more hours reading reviews online and watching youtube videos about it sealed the deal.  I shelled out $1300 and bought the thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have had it for a few days now and I am sort of happy. I went from using a giant 30-inch monitor far away (my theory for avoiding eye strain) to using a ~13-inch monitor at pretty much the same distance as reading a book. I had to avoid sunlight, now I seek it (see the picture).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img alt="20190307_094550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/20190307_094550.jpg?w=640"/></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monitor makes your computer look like Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen from the 80’s. The refresh is slow, and there is a ghosting effect, meaning there are shadows of previous images — which you can clear out. Also, it’s 4:3 instead of 16:9, which is a pain because it means I have to change resolution when I am forced to use my other monitor (for example if I have to check colors — the screen is gray-scale, did I mention that?). It makes browsing the internet quite painful, which is a nice side effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to advice, I am using it as my primary monitor. I am sort of happy with it and don’t regret buying it. I have started writing and reading papers with it and it’s working well enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think as soon as the technology improves the market for these things will be huge.  Already having a 17″ monitor in 16:9 ratio, ideally touch-screen, even if gray scale, would be a dream come true.</p></div>

    <title xml:lang="en-US">Death of proof greatly exaggerated</title>
    <summary xml:lang="en-US">In 1993, the science writer John Horgan—who’s best known for his book The End of Science, and (of course) for interviewing me in 2016—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for Scientific American entitled “The Death of Proof.” Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was […]</summary>
    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>In 1993, the science writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horgan_(journalist)">John Horgan</a>—who’s best known for his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Science-Knowledge-Twilight-Scientific/dp/0465065929">The End of Science</a></em>, and (of course) for <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">interviewing me in 2016</a>—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for <em>Scientific American</em> entitled <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e56/c6fea76922082400dfc6e13a3a169ae7b9a6.pdf">“The Death of Proof.”</a>  Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was undergoing a fundamental change, with traditional deductive proofs being replaced by a combination of non-rigorous numerical simulations, machine-generated proofs, probabilistic and probabilistically-checkable proofs, and proofs using graphics and video.  Horgan also suggested that Andrew Wiles’s then-brand-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">proof</a> of Fermat’s Last Theorem—which might have looked, at first glance, like a spectacular counterexample to the “death of proof” thesis—could be the “last gasp of a dying culture” and a “splendid anachronism.”  Apparently, “The Death of Proof” garnered one of the largest volumes of angry mail in <em>Scientific American</em>‘s history, with mathematician after mathematician arguing that Horgan had strung together half-digested quotes and vignettes to manufacture a non-story.</p>



<p>Now Horgan—who you could variously describe as a wonderful sport, or a ham, or a sucker for punishment—has written a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">26-year retrospective</a> on his “death of proof” article.  The prompt for this was Horgan’s recent discovery that, back in the 90s, David Hoffman and Hermann Karcher, two mathematicians annoyed by the “death of proof” article, had named a nonexistent mathematical object after its author.  The so-called <em><a href="https://minimalsurfaces.blog/home/repository/non-existent-surfaces/the-horgan-surface/">Horgan surface</a></em> is a minimal surface that numerical computations strongly suggested should exist, but that can be rigorously proven not to exist after all.  “The term was intended as an insult, but I’m honored anyway,” Horgan writes.</p>



<p>As a followup to his blog post, Horgan then decided to solicit commentary from various people he knew, including yours truly, about “how proofs are faring in an era of increasing computerization.”  He wrote, “I’d love to get a paragraph or two from you.”  Alas, I didn’t have the time to do as requested, but only to write <i>eight</i> paragraphs.  So Horgan suggested that I make the result into a post on my own blog, which he’d then link to.  Without further ado, then:</p>



<hr/>



<p>John, I like you so I hate to say it, but the last quarter century has not been kind to your thesis about “the death of proof”!  Those mathematicians sending you the irate letters had a point: there’s been no fundamental change to mathematics that deserves such a dramatic title.  Proof-based math remains quite healthy, with (e.g.) a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">Poincaré conjecture</a> since your article came out, as well as to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05363">Erdős discrepancy problem</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem">Kadison-Singer conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture">Catalan’s conjecture</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.998&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">bounded gaps in primes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">testing primality in deterministic polynomial time</a>, etc. — just to pick a few examples from the tiny subset of areas that I know anything about.</p>



<p>There are evolutionary changes to mathematical practice, as there always have been.  Since 2009, the website <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a> has let mathematicians query the global hive-mind about an obscure reference or a recalcitrant step in a proof, and get near-instant answers.  Meanwhile <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/">“polymath” projects</a> have, with moderate success, tried to harness blogs and other social media to make advances on long-standing open math problems using massive collaborations.</p>



<p>While humans remain in the driver’s seat, there are persistent efforts to increase the role of computers, with some notable successes.  These include Thomas Hales’s 1998 computer-assisted proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Kepler Conjecture</a> (about the densest possible way to pack oranges) — now fully machine-verified from start to finish, after <del>the </del><em><del>Annals of Mathematics</del></em><del> refused to publish a mixture of traditional mathematics and computer code</del> (seems this is not exactly what happened; see the comment section for more).  It also includes William McCune’s 1996 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_algebra">Robbins Conjecture</a> in algebra (the computer-generated <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/eqp-theorem.proof.txt">proof</a> was only half a page, but involved substitutions so strange that for 60 years no human had found them); and at the “opposite extreme,” the 2016 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">Pythagorean triples problem</a> by Marijn Heule and collaborators, which weighed in at 200 terabytes (at that time, “the longest proof in the history of mathematics”).</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that someday, computers will replace humans at all aspects of mathematical research — but it’s also conceivable that, by the time they can do that, they’ll be able to replace humans at music and science journalism and everything else!</p>



<p><a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/proofs.ppt">New notions of proof</a> — including probabilistic, interactive, zero-knowledge, and even quantum proofs — have seen further development by theoretical computer scientists since 1993.  So far, though, these new types of proof remain either entirely theoretical (as with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01664">quantum proofs</a>), or else they’re used for cryptographic protocols but not for mathematical research.  (For example, zero-knowledge proofs now play a major role in certain cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash">Zcash</a>.)</p>



<p>In many areas of math (including my own, theoretical computer science), proofs have continued to get longer and harder for any one person to absorb.  This has led some to advocate a split approach, wherein human mathematicians would talk to each other only about the handwavy intuitions and high-level concepts, while the tedious verification of details would be left to computers.  So far, though, the huge investment of time needed to write proofs in machine-checkable format — for almost no return in new insight — has prevented this approach’s wide adoption.</p>



<p>Yes, there are non-rigorous approaches to math, which continue to be widely used in physics and engineering and other fields, as they always have been.  But none of these approaches have displaced proof as the gold standard whenever it’s available.  If I had to speculate about why, I’d say: if you use non-rigorous approaches, then even if it’s clear to you under what conditions your results can be trusted, it’s probably much less clear to others.  Also, even if only one segment of a research community cares about rigor, whatever earlier work that segment builds on will need to be rigorous as well — thereby exerting constant pressure in that direction.  Thus, the more collaborative a given research area becomes, the more important is rigor.</p>



<p>For my money, the elucidation of the foundations of mathematics a century ago, by Cantor, Frege, Peano, Hilbert, Russell, Zermelo, Gödel, Turing, and others, still stands as one of the greatest triumphs of human thought, up there with evolution or quantum mechanics or anything else.  It’s true that the ideal set by these luminaries remains mostly aspirational.  When mathematicians say that a theorem has been “proved,” they still mean, as they always have, something more like: “we’ve reached a social consensus that all the ideas are now in place for a strictly formal proof that could be verified by a machine … with the only task remaining being massive rote coding work that none of us has any intention of ever doing!”  It’s also true that mathematicians, being human, are subject to the full panoply of foibles you might expect: claiming to have proved things they haven’t, squabbling over who proved what, accusing others of lack of rigor while hypocritically taking liberties themselves.  But just like love and honesty remain fine ideals no matter how often they’re flouted, so too does mathematical rigor.</p>

    <title>TR19-037 |  Closure of VP under taking factors: a short and simple proof | 

	Mrinal Kumar, 

	Chi-Ning  Chou, 

	Noam Solomon</title>
    <summary>In this note, we give a short, simple and almost completely self contained proof of a classical result of Kaltofen [Kal86, Kal87, Kal89] which shows that if an n variate degree $d$ polynomial f can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size s, then each of its factors can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size at most poly(s, n, d). 

However, unlike Kaltofen's argument, our proof  does not  directly give an efficient algorithm for computing the circuits for the factors of f.</summary>

    <title>TR19-036 |  On the complexity of computing a random Boolean function over the reals | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We say that a first-order formula $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ over $\mathbb{R}$ defines a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, if for every $x_1,\dots,x_n\in\{0,1\}$, $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is true iff $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=1$. We show that:

(i) every $f$ can be defined by a formula of size $O(n)$, 
(ii) if $A$ is required to have at most $k\geq 1$ quantifier alternations, there exists an $f$ which requires  a formula of size $2^{\Omega(n/k)}$. 
 
The latter result implies several previously known as well as some new lower bounds in computational complexity. We note that (i) holds over any field of characteristic zero, and (ii) holds for any real closed or algebraically closed field.</summary>

    <title>TR19-035 |  PIT for depth-4 circuits and Sylvester-Gallai theorem for polynomials | 

	Alexey Milovanov</title>
    <summary>This text is a development of  a preprint of Ankit Gupta. 

We present an approach for devising a deterministic polynomial time whitekbox identity testing (PIT) algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.
This approach is similar to Kayal-Saraf approach for depth-$3$ circuits. Kayal and Saraf  based their algorithm on Sylvester-Gallai-type theorem about linear polynomials. We show how it is possible to generalize this approach to depth-$4$ circuits. However we failed to implement this plan completely. We succeeded to construct a polynomial time deterministic algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin and its correctness requires a hypothesis. Also we present a  polynomial-time (unconditional) algorithm for some subclass of   depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.</summary>

    <title>TR19-034 |  On $\epsilon$-sensitive monotone computations | 

	Pavel Hrubes</title>
    <summary>We show that strong-enough lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits or the non-negative rank of a matrix imply unconditional lower bounds in arithmetic or Boolean circuit complexity. First, we show that if a polynomial $f\in {\mathbb {R}}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ of degree $d$ has an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ then $(x_1+\dots+x_n+1)^d+\epsilon f$ has a monotone arithmetic circuit of size $O(sd^2+n\log n)$, for some $\epsilon&gt;0$.  Second, if $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a Boolean function,  we associate with $f$ an explicit exponential-size matrix $M(f)$ such that the Boolean circuit size of $f$ is at least $\Omega(\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))- 2n)$, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix and $\hbox{rk}_+$ denotes the non-negative rank of a matrix. In fact, the quantity $\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))$ characterizes how hard is it to distinguish rejecting and accepting inputs of $f$ by means of a linear program. 
Finally, we introduce a proof system resembling the Boolean monotone calculus and show that similar $\epsilon$-sensitive lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits imply lower bounds on proof-size in the system.</summary>

    <title>TR19-033 |  Counting basic-irreducible factors mod $p^k$ in deterministic poly-time and $p$-adic applications | 

	Ashish Dwivedi, 

	Rajat Mittal, 

	Nitin Saxena</title>
    <summary>Finding an irreducible factor, of a polynomial $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$, is not known to be in deterministic polynomial time. Though there is such a classical algorithm that {\em counts} the number of irreducible factors of $f\bmod p$. We can ask the same question modulo prime-powers $p^k$. The irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ blow up exponentially in number; making it hard to describe them. Can we count  those irreducible factors $\bmod~p^k$ that remain irreducible mod $p$? These are called {\em basic-irreducible}. A simple example is in $f=x^2+px \bmod p^2$; it has $p$ many basic-irreducible factors. Also note that, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible but not basic-irreducible!

We give an algorithm to count the number of basic-irreducible factors of $f\bmod p^k$ in deterministic poly($\deg(f),k\log p$)-time. This solves the open questions posed in (Cheng et al, ANTS'18 \&amp; Kopp et al, Math.Comp.'19). In particular, we are counting roots $\bmod\ p^k$; which gives the first deterministic poly-time algorithm to compute Igusa zeta function of $f$. Also, our algorithm efficiently partitions the set of all basic-irreducible factors (possibly exponential) into merely $\deg(f)$-many disjoint sets, using a compact tree data structure and {\em split} ideals.</summary>

    <title>TR19-031 |  Non-deterministic Quasi-Polynomial Time is Average-case Hard for ACC Circuits | 

	Lijie Chen</title>
    <summary>Following the seminal work of [Williams, J. ACM 2014], in a recent breakthrough, [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018] proved that NQP (non-deterministic quasi-polynomial time) does not have polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits.
	
We strengthen the above lower bound to an average case one, by proving that for all constants c, there is a language in NQP, which is not 1/2+1/log^c(n)-approximable by polynomial-size ACC^0 circuits. In fact, our lower bound holds for a larger circuit class: 2^(log^a n)-size ACC^0 circuits with a layer of threshold gates at the bottom, for all constants a. Our work also improves the average-case lower bound for NEXP against polynomial-size ACC circuits by [Chen, Oliveira, and Santhanam, LATIN 2018].
	
Our new lower bound builds on several interesting components, including: 
	
Barrington's theorem and the existence of an NC^1-complete language which is random self-reducible.
		
The sub-exponential witness-size lower bound for NE against ACC^0 and the conditional non-deterministic PRG construction in [Williams, SICOMP 2016].
		
An ``almost'' almost-everywhere MA average-case lower bound (which strengthens the corresponding worst-case lower bound in [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018]). 
		
A PSPACE-complete language which is same-length checkable, error-correctable and also has some other nice reducibility properties, which builds on [Trevisan and Vadhan, Computational Complexity 2007]. Moreover, all its reducibility properties have corresponding low-depth non-adaptive oracle circuits.

Like other lower bounds proved via the ``algorithmic approach'', the only property of ACC^0 of THR exploited by us is the existence of a non-trivial  SAT algorithm for ACC^0 of THR [Williams, STOC 2014]. Therefore, for any typical circuit class C, our results apply to them as well if the corresponding non-trivial SAT (in fact, GAP-UNSAT) algorithms are discovered.</summary>

    <title>How are there 20 copies of my new book through other booksellers and why are they so highly priced</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(This is about my book PROBLEMS WITH A POINT: exploring Math and computer science<br/>
by Gasarch and Kruskal, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Point-Exploring-Computer-Science/dp/9813279974/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=gasarch&amp;qid=1551731760&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1">here</a>. This post is NOT a plug.)<br/>
<br/>
I often see weird pricing on amazon but don't have enough inside information to explain it. This time I have seen some weird pricing on amazon but DO have enough information to be truly baffled.<br/>
<br/>
My book is on amazon. You can buy it<br/>
<br/>
Softcover new: $38.00<br/>
<br/>
Hardcover new: $68.00<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that all makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
OR you can buy it from some other source.<br/>
<br/>
There are 10 copies of the softcover, they claim new,  ranging from $38.00 to $57.00.<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 copies of the softcover, they claim used (how used could it be?), $49 and $53<br/>
<br/>
There are 9 copies of the hardcover, they claim new, ranging from $68.00 to $91.00<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 copies of the hardcover, they claim used, $84.00 and $88.00<br/>
<br/>
This raises two questions<br/>
<br/>
1) I have a copy, Clyde got a copy, and two copy's were send to reviewers. Neither Clyde nor I have sold our copy. So how did 20 or so copies get out there?<br/>
<br/>
2) Why do they cost MORE than list price.<br/>
<br/>
I've asked around and got some answers, but I INVITE you to give more possible answers. If your answer is not just speculation (e.g., `I used to be in the black market  book business and here's the real scoop') then that would be great; however, I will take specuation<br/>
<br/>
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR HOW SOMEONE GOT COPIES<br/>
<br/>
1) Clyde and I haven't gotten our free copies yet. Hijacked?  Here's hoping the hijackers read it and enjoyed it before posting it. However, this theory is unlikely since I inquired with World Scientific (our publisher) and found out we'll be getting our free copies in 2 weeks. So this theory will either be confirmed or denied in 2 weeks. I would bet against OR those are some really bad hijackers.<br/>
<br/>
2) Complete ripoff. You pay the money and get NOTHING. I think this was more likely in the early days of amazon (or e-bay or....) but now things are pretty well monitored. I have sold books on amazon and am very impressed with how foolproof it is. Still --- could be.<br/>
<br/>
3) Someone hacked my computer. Really? Where did they get the orange covers? Why would they bother? This is not Harry Potter. Plus I asked our staff and NO this could not happen.<br/>
<br/>
4) Some of the shipment dates are fairly far in the future, so they plan to get an order, then<br/>
order the book, and have it send to the buyer, at a profit. Seems like too much sugar for a satoshi, BUT could be profitable if its a bot and its automated to do this with lots of books.<br/>
<br/>
5) My publisher also send the book to other sellers. That does not explain the higher prices.<br/>
<br/>
WHY THE HIGHER PRICES?<br/>
<br/>
1) They are counting on people assuming that other sellers are cheaper without checking. Would people do that? People still fall for the Nigerian billionaire scam, so maybe yes.<br/>
<br/>
2) The seller themselves, which is possibly an army of bots, didn't bother checking but priced it<br/>
similar to other books. This is plausible since $38.00 is fairly cheap, so looking at similar books may get you a higher price.<br/>
<br/>
-----<br/>
Any speculation is welcome so long as it does not involve space aliens or astrology.<br/>
<br/>

<p><strong>Local Computation Algorithms for Spanners</strong>, by Merav Parter, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Ali Vakilian, Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08266">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of computing a \(k\)-spanner for a graph \(G\). This is a subgraph \(H\), where (for any pair of vertices) the shortest path distance in \(H\) is at most \(k\) times the corresponding distance in \(G\). A Local Computation Algorithm (LCA) essentially gives sublinear query access to (some spanner) \(H\), without any preprocessing on \(G\). In other words, an LCA takes as input an edge \((i,j)\) in \(G\), and in sublinear time says “yes” or “no”. Despite no preprocessing, it is guaranteed that all the “yes” answers form a spanner, and the number of “yes” answers is small. One of the main challenges in LCAs for graph problems is getting a polynomial dependence on \(\Delta\), the maximum degree. (Many results end up with an exponential dependence on \(\Delta\), essentially assuming bounded-degree.) This paper give an LCA outputting spanners of optimal size for \(k=3,5\), with query complexity \(n^{1-\alpha}\) (for constant \(\alpha\) depending on \(k\)). The second result works for general \(k\), but has a query complexity that is \(O(\Delta^4n^{2/3})\).</p>



<p><strong>Set Cover in Sub-linear Time</strong>, by Piotr Indyk, Sepideh Mahabadi, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Ali Vakilian, Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03534">arXiv</a>). Set cover needs no introduction. This paper considers sublinear algorithms for set cover. It is convenient to think of the instance as a binary \(m \times n\) matrix, for \(m\) sets over a universe of size \(n\). The query model gives access to the \(j\)th non-zero entry in a desired column/row. The aim is this paper is to actually construct a set cover, and not just approximate its size (the latter problem with initiated in <a href="https://onak.pl/download/publications/Nguyen_Onak-constant_time_approximation.pdf">Nguyen-Onak</a>). The first result shows a black-box conversion of any set cover algorithm into a sublinear query complexity algorithm. Any \(\alpha\)-approximation for set cover can be converted into an \(O(\alpha)\)-approximation, that makes \(O(m(n/k)^{\beta} + nk)\) (where \(k\) is the optimal set cover size, and \(\beta &lt; 1\) depends on \(\alpha\)). For large \(k\), the paper gives an \(O(mn/k)\) query, \(O(\log n)\)-approximation algorithm. There are various lower bounds given, that show these dependencies are necessary.</p>



<p><strong>Distributional Property Testing in a Quantum World</strong> by András Gilyén and Tongyang Li (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00814">arXiv</a>). There are two aspects to quantum distribution testing. First, we can think of faster distribution testing (for classical problems) using quantum computation. Second, we can generalize the problem of distribution testing to its quantum equivalent, called density operator testing (this papers gives the first result for this quantum generalization). A distribution is a non-negative vector in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with unit \(l_1\)-norm. The quantum generalization, a density operator, is a PSD matrix in \(\mathbb{C}^n\) with unit trace. This paper has a number of results, along both aspects. For example, for the well-known problem of testing equality of distributions under total variation distance, the papers gives an \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon)\) tester (an improvement over classical lower bounds). For testing equality of density operators under the same distance, the paper gives an \(O(n/\epsilon)\) tester (note that the trivial bound is \(O(n^2)\), since the operator is a matrix).</p></div>

<p><span class="qu"><span class="gD"><i><a href="https://ac.cs.princeton.edu/online/">Analytic Combinatorics</a> </i></span></span>page provides access to online lectures, lecture slides, and assignments for use in teaching and learning from the (famous) book <strong><em>Analytic Combinatorics </em></strong>by <strong><em><a class="footer" href="http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/">Philippe Flajolet </a></em></strong>and <strong><em><a class="footer" href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs">Robert Sedgewick</a></em></strong>.</p>
<p>Both courses are appropriate for use by instructors as the basis for a “flipped” class on the subject, or for self-study by individuals. Are these courses for you? The short answer is YES, but for a longer answer <a href="https://aofa.cs.princeton.edu/online/slides/AA00-Cardinality.pdf">below are introductory slide for both courses.</a></p>

<p>
Jimmy Wales is the co-founder of Wikipedia. Of course this is the wonderful online non-profit encyclopedia we all know and love.</p>
<p>
Today I want to talk about using the web to search for math information.<br/>
<span id="more-15662"/></p>
<p>
I do a huge amount of research on the web. Years ago I would spend hours and hours each week in the library. I looked for books and articles on various math issues. No more. Today it’s all web-based resources. What has happened is that primary sources—research papers—have become as easily browsable as Wikipedia. Many of them, anyway.</p>
<p>
Wikipedia often does not include proofs of mathematical theorems—those are linked to primary papers or authoritative surveys or books. There is a website <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">Proof Wiki</a> which tries to bridge the gap without the reader needing to follow links into papers. Right now they are <a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Euclid's_Theorem">featuring</a> Euclid’s Theorem on the infinitude of primes—which we have posted about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/01/29/primes-and-polynomials/">recently</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/07/11/you-cannot-do-that/">before</a>. They have style guides for how the reasoning is laid out.</p>
<p>
There are also many style guides around the web for writing good mathematics and computer science papers. But the guides seem to stop short of the level of the phrases that irk me. When those phrases show up in the primary sources, there’s no fallback. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> The Phrases </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Here are a few top ones. I omit the well known ones, the ones that are obvious, and some that are in preparation for a future post—just kidding. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>It is well known</i>. Not by me. The reason I am searching for papers on this subject is that I do not know the basics of the area. If you must say this phrase please add a possible reference. That would be extremely helpful.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Clear from the proof of the theorem</i>. Not by me. This means that the author did not state the proof in the greatest generality possible. We all do this, but it may help if this is avoided.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <i>It is easy to see</i>. Similar to the last item. Ken vividly remembers a seminar in the early 1980s by Peter Neumann at Oxford that showed excerpts from a French mathematician in which the phrase “Il est aisé de voir” appeared often. The French phrase even reads just like the English one. But that mathematician had a reasonable excuse. He was Évariste Galois, and he had a duel early the next morning.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Proof omitted</i>. Please no.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>Easy calculation</i>. Not by me. The reason it usually is avoided is that it is too difficult a computation. </p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>This case is the same as the previous case</i>. Not always. This has been the source of errors for me and others over the years. Good place to check the argument. Maybe a suggestion that there should be a Lemma that covers both cases.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>In our paper in preparation</i>. Please no. I cannot read a paper that does not exist yet.</p>
<p>
Finally the worst in my opinion.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet }"/> <i>It costs $37.95</i>. Oh no. Many times we find papers that are behind a pay-wall. I always hate this. The authors of course wish to make they work available to all possible. But the reality is that often papers are protected. Thanks to our friends at Wikipedia and Arxiv that this is not the case for lots of stuff. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/bill-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-15665"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15665" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/bill.png?w=600"/></a></p>
<p>
But I have wondered who ever pays the crazy amount of $37.95? Does anyone ever pay that? Is it equivalent to saying: This paper is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Ken’s Examples </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Ken has one example that has driven him crazy for years and again these past two weeks. Many of you have probably used it often.</p>
<p>
<img alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\bullet}"/> <i>This procedure runs in polynomial time.</i> Excuse me, <em>what</em> polynomial time? At least tell us the best exponent you know…</p>
<p>
A related matter is attending to “edge cases” of theorems. Sometimes the edge cases are meant to be excluded. For example, “Let <img alt="{\alpha &gt; 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha &gt; 0}"/>” excludes <img alt="{\alpha = 0}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\alpha = 0}"/>; maybe nothing more needs to be said. But in other cases it is not so clear. A theorem may suggest limits and it is nice to say what happens if one tries to take those limits. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
What are you favorite phrases that drive you crazy?</p></font></font></div>

    <p>Paul Erdős died in 1996, but <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/pre_tres_egyptian.pdf">his most recent paper</a> is from 2015, nearly 20 years later!

It’s about Egyptian fractions – representations of rationals as sums of distinct unit fractions – and is motivated by the conjecture that it’s always possible for all denominators to be semiprime. That’s still open, but they prove that every integer has a representation with all denominators products of three primes.</p>

    <title>Flying Pigs Unsafe at Any Speed</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Take a moment and imagine a flying pig. Do you see a pig with tiny wings lazily guiding along. But pigs are not particularly slow animals as anyone has seen a <a href="https://youtu.be/-eMV1jxfl40?t=73">pig race</a> at a county fair can attest to that. So why not in the air shouldn't a pig go faster than an unladen African swallow?<br/>
<br/>
I have a point discussing the fastness of a flying pig. Consider my favorite flying pig, P = NP. I would put more probability on an actual flying pig (thanks CRISPR) than polynomial-time algorithms for traveling salesman.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get in the following conversation:<br/>
<br/>
<b>AI person</b>: The P v NP problem is irrelevant as we have machine learning and SAT solvers and we can for all practical purposes solve NP-complete problems.<br/>
<b>Me</b>: If P = NP we can solve AI!<br/>
<b>AI</b>: If P = NP it's likely to have a very slow poly-time algorithm with high exponents and constants and be for all practical purposes useless.<br/>
<br/>
Let's break that down. The claim is E(running time of SAT|running time of SAT is poly) = cn<sup>k</sup> for some large c and k. First of all you are conditioning on a probability zero event. Beyond that nearly all the known problems we know that sit in polynomial time have practical efficient solutions. So under the assumption that SAT is one of these problems, why shouldn't the same rule apply. You've already made the assumption we can reduce its running time from exponential to polynomial, so why would it stop at some high polynomial?<br/>
<br/>
If we are going to talk about the hypothetical flying pig P = NP world, let my algorithms run fast.</div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: A matroid is an abstract combinatorial object which generalizes the notions of spanning trees, and linearly independent sets of vectors. I will talk about an efficient algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to approximately count the number of bases of any given matroid.</p>
<p>The proof is based on a new connections between high dimensional simplicial complexes, and a new class of multivariate polynomials called completely log-concave polynomials. In particular, we exploit a fundamental fact from our previous work that the bases generating polynomial of any given matroid is a log-concave function over the positive orthant.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Nima Anari, Kuikui Liu, and Cynthia Vinzant.</p></blockquote>

    <content type="xhtml" xml:lang="en-US"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>If I’m being honest, the most exciting recent development in my life is this: a little over a month ago,<strong> I stopped checking “SneerClub”</strong> (a place I’d previously resolved not even to name here, but I think an exception is warranted now).  Permanently, cold turkey.  I won’t even visit to read their sneers about this post.  I’ve made progress cutting down on other self-destructive social media fixations as well.  Many friends suggested this course to me, and I thank them all, though I ultimately had to follow my own path to the obvious.</p>



<p>Ironically, <em>the SneerClubbers themselves</em> begged me to stop reading them (!), so presumably for once they’ll be okay with something I did (but if not, I don’t care).  If any of them still have something to say to me, they can come to <em>this</em> blog, or email me, or if they pass through Austin, set up a time to hash it out over chips and queso (my treat).  What I’ll no longer do is spend hours every week binge-reading a forum of people who’ve adopted nastiness and bad faith as their explicit principles.  I’ll no longer toss and turn at night wondering how it came about that two thousand Redditors hate Scott Aaronson so much, and what I could say or do (short of total self-abnegation) that would make them hate me less.  I plan to spend the freed-up time <em>being</em> Scott Aaronson.</p>



<p>Resolving to ignore one particular online hate pit—and then <em>sticking</em> to the resolution, as so far I have—has been a pure, unmitigated improvement to my quality of life.  If you don’t believe me, ask my wife and kids.  I recommend this course to anyone.</p>



<p>You could sensibly ask: why did I <em>ever</em> spend time worrying about an anti-nerds-like-me forum that’s so poisonous for its targets and participants alike?  After long introspection, I think the answer is: there’s a part of me, perhaps a gift from the childhood bullies, that’s so obsessed with “society’s hatred of STEM nerds,” that it <em>constantly seeks out evidence to confirm that its fears are justified—</em>evidence that it can then wave in front of the rest of my brain to say “you see??  what did I always tell you?”  And alas, whenever that part of my brain seeks such evidence, the world dutifully supplies mountains of it.  It’s never once disappointed.</p>



<p>Now the SneerClubbers—who are perceptive and talented in their cruelty, if in nothing else—notice this about me, and gleefully ridicule me for it.  But they’re oblivious to the central irony: that unlike the vast majority of humankind, or even the vast majority of social justice activists, they (the SneerClubbers) <em>really do</em> hate everyone like me.  They’re <em>precisely</em> what the paranoid part of my brain wrongly fears that everyone else I meet is secretly like.  They’re like someone who lectures you about your hilariously overblown fear of muggers, <em>while simultaneously mugging you</em>.</p>



<p>But at least they’re not the contented and self-confident bullies of my childhood nightmares, kicking dirt down at nerds from atop their pinnacle of wokeness and social adeptness.  If you spend enough time studying them, they themselves come across as angry, depressed, pathetic.  So for example: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/aexi9v/michael_atiyah_has_passed_away/edtrcc5/">here’s</a> one of my most persistent attackers, popping up on a math thread commemorating Michael Atiyah (one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century), just to insult Atiyah—randomly, gratuitously, and a few days after Atiyah had died.  Almost everything posted all over Reddit by this individual—who uses the accurate tagline “unpleasantly radical”—has the same flavor.  Somehow seeing this made it click for me: wait a second, <em>these</em> are the folks are lecturing <em>me</em> about my self-centeredness and arrogance and terrible social skills?  Like, at least I <em><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Scott-Aaronson-so-nice">try</a></em> to be nice.</p>


<hr/>
<p>Scott Alexander, who writes the <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">world’s best blog</a> and is a more central target of SneerClub than I’ve been, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/02/22/rip-culture-war-thread/">recently announced</a> that he asked the moderators of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/">r/ssc</a> to close its notorious “Culture War” thread, and they’ve done so—moving the thread to a new home on Reddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/">“TheMotte.”</a></p>
<p>For those who don’t know: r/ssc is the place on Reddit to discuss Scott’s SlateStarCodex blog, though Scott himself was never too involved as more than a figurehead.  The Culture War thread was the place within r/ssc to discuss race, gender, immigration, and other hot-button topics.  The thread, which filled up with a bewildering thousands of comments per week (!), attracted the, err … <em>full range</em> of political views, including leftists, libertarians, and moderates but also alt-righters, neoreactionaries, and white nationalists. Predictably, SneerClub treated the thread as a gift from heaven: a constant source of inflammatory material that they could use to smear Scott personally (even if most of the time, Scott hadn’t even <em>seen</em> the offending content, let alone endorsing it).</p>


<p>Four months ago, I was one of the apparently many friends who told Scott that I felt he should dissociate the Culture War thread from his brand.  So I congratulate him on his decision, which (despite his eloquently-expressed misgivings) I feel confident was the right one.  Think about it this way: nobody’s freedom of speech has been curtailed—the thread continues full steam at TheMotte, for anyone who enjoys it—but meanwhile, the sneerers have been deprived of a golden weapon with which to slime Scott.  Meanwhile, while the sneerers themselves might never change their minds about anything, Scott has demonstrated to third parties that he’s open and reasonable and ready to compromise, like the debater who happily switches to his opponent’s terminology.  What’s not to like?</p>


<hr/>
<p>A couple weeks ago, while in Albuquerque for the <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2019/index.php">SQuInT</a> conference, I visited the excellent <a href="https://www.nuclearmuseum.org/">National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</a>.  It was depressing, as it should have been, to tour the detailed exhibits about the murderous events surrounding the birth of the nuclear era: the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was depressing in a different way to tour the exhibits about the early Atomic Age, and see the boundless optimism that ‘unleashing the power of the atom’ would finally usher in a near-utopia of space travel and clean energy—and then to compare that vision to where we are now, with climate change ravaging the planet and (in a world-historic irony) the people who care most about the environment having denounced and marginalized the most reliable source of carbon-free energy, the one that probably had the best chance to avert our planet’s terrifying future.</p>


<p>But on the bright side: how wonderful to have born into a time and place when, for the most part, those who hate you have only the power to destroy your life that you yourself grant them.  How wonderful when one can blunt their knives by simply refusing to open a browser tab.</p></div>
