graph with $m$ edges in $m^{1+o(1)}$ time. Although the fastest deterministic
algorithm by Henzinger, Rao, and Wang [SODA'17] has a faster running time of
$O(m\log^{2}m\log\log m)$, we believe that our algorithm is conceptually
simpler. The key tool for this simplication is the expander decomposition. We
exploit it in a very straightforward way compared to how it has been previously
used in the literature.

    <title>Quality tetrahedral mesh generation with HXT</title>

Delaunay kernel for tetrahedral mesh generation. This kernel was however
incomplete in the sense that it lacked the necessary mesh improvement tools.
The present paper builds on that previous work and proposes a fast parallel
mesh improvement stage that delivers high-quality tetrahedral meshes compared
to alternative open-source mesh generators. Our mesh improvement toolkit
includes edge removal and improved Laplacian smoothing as well as a brand new
operator called the Growing SPR Cavity, which can be regarded as the mother of
all flips. The paper describes the workflow of the new mesh improvement
schedule, as well as the details of the implementation. The result of this
research is a series of open-source scalable software components, called HXT,
whose overall efficiency is demonstrated on practical examples by means of a
detailed comparative benchmark with two open-source mesh generators: Gmsh and
TetGen.

    <title>Novel Results on the Number of Runs of the Burrows-Wheeler-Transform</title>

one of the fundamental components of many current data structures in string
processing. It is central in data compression, as well as in efficient query
algorithms for sequence data, such as webpages, genomic and other biological
sequences, or indeed any textual data. The BWT lends itself well to compression
because its number of equal-letter-runs (usually referred to as $r$) is often
considerably lower than that of the original string; in particular, it is well
suited for strings with many repeated factors. In fact, much attention has been
paid to the $r$ parameter as measure of repetitiveness, especially to evaluate
the performance in terms of both space and time of compressed indexing data
structures.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we investigate $\rho(v)$, the ratio of $r$ and of the number
of runs of the BWT of the reverse of $v$. Kempa and Kociumaka [FOCS 2020] gave
the first non-trivial upper bound as $\rho(v) = O(\log^2(n))$, for any string
$v$ of length $n$. However, nothing is known about the tightness of this upper
bound. We present infinite families of binary strings for which $\rho(v) =
\Theta(\log n)$ holds, thus giving the first non-trivial lower bound on
$\rho(n)$, the maximum over all strings of length $n$.
</p>
<p>Our results suggest that $r$ is not an ideal measure of the repetitiveness of
the string, since the number of repeated factors is invariant between the
string and its reverse. We believe that there is a more intricate relationship
between the number of runs of the BWT and the string's combinatorial
properties.

    <title>Stable Matchings with Restricted Preferences: Structure and Complexity</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1597881600</feedworld_mtime>

Cheng</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rosenbaum:Will.html">Will Rosenbaum</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08480">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>It is well known that every stable matching instance $I$ has a \emph{rotation
poset} $R(I)$ that can be computed efficiently and the downsets of $R(I)$ are
in one-to-one correspondence with the stable matchings of $I$. Furthermore, for
every poset $P$, an instance $I(P)$ can be constructed efficiently so that the
rotation poset of $I(P)$ is isomorphic to $P$. In this case, we say that $I(P)$
\emph{realizes} $P$. Many researchers exploit the rotation poset of an instance
to develop fast algorithms or to establish the hardness of stable matching
problems.
</p>
<p>To make the problem of sampling stable matchings more tractable, Bhatnagar et
al. [SODA 2008] introduced stable matching instances whose preference lists are
restricted but nevertheless model situations that arise in practice. In this
paper, we study four such parameterized restrictions; our goal is to
characterize the rotation posets that arise from these models: $k$-bounded,
$k$-attribute, $(k_1, k_2)$-list, $k$-range.
</p>
<p>We prove that there is a constant $k$ so that \emph{every} rotation poset is
realized by some instance in the first three models for some fixed constant
$k$. We describe efficient algorithms for constructing such instances given the
Hasse diagram of a poset. As a consequence, the fundamental problem of counting
stable matchings remains $\#$BIS-complete even for these restricted instances.
</p>
<p>For $k$-range preferences, we show that a poset $P$ is realizable if and only
if the Hasse diagram of $P$ has pathwidth bounded by functions of $k$. Using
this characterization, we show that the following problems are fixed parameter
tractable when parametrized by the range of the instance: exactly counting and
uniformly sampling stable matchings, finding median, sex-equal, and balanced
stable matchings.

multiset $S$ of $n$ integers in $0..m$, and a target integer $t$, whether there
exists a subset of $S$ with elements summing to $t \pmod{m}$, and to report
such a set if it exists. We give a simple $O(m \log m)$-time with high
probability (w.h.p.) algorithm for the modular subset sum problem. This builds
on and improves on a previous $\tilde{O}(m)$ w.h.p. algorithm from Axiotis,
Backurs, Jin, Tzamos, and Wu (SODA 19). Our method utilizes the ADT of the
dynamic strings structure of Gawrychowski et. al (SODA 18). However, as this
structure is rather complicated we present a much simpler alternative which we
call the Data Dependent Tree. As an application, we consider the computational
version of a fundamental theorem in zero-sum Ramsey theory. The
Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv Theorem states that a multiset of $2n - 1$ integers
always contains a subset of cardinality exactly $n$ whose values sum to a
multiple of $n$. We give an algorithm for finding such a subset in time $O(n
\log n)$ w.h.p. which improves on an $O(n^2)$ algorithm due to Del Lungo,
Marini, and Mori (Disc. Math. 09).

and a collection of $k$ vertex pairs, $\{(s_i,t_i)\}_{i=1}^k$, and the
objective is to determine whether there exists a collection $\{P_i\}_{i=1}^k$
of $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint paths in $G$ where the end-vertices of $P_i$
are $s_i$ and $t_i$. This problem was shown to admit an $f(k)n^3$-time
algorithm by Robertson and Seymour (Graph Minors XIII, The Disjoint Paths
Problem, JCTB). In modern terminology, this means that Disjoint Paths is fixed
parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to $k$. Remarkably, the above algorithm
for Disjoint Paths is a cornerstone of the entire Graph Minors Theory, and
conceptually vital to the $g(k)n^3$-time algorithm for Minor Testing (given two
undirected graphs, $G$ and $H$ on $n$ and $k$ vertices, respectively, determine
whether $G$ contains $H$ as a minor).
</p>
<p>In this semi-survey, we will first give an exposition of the Graph Minors
Theory with emphasis on efficiency from the viewpoint of Parameterized
Complexity. Secondly, we will review the state of the art with respect to the
Disjoint Paths and Planar Disjoint Paths problems. Lastly, we will discuss the
main ideas behind a new algorithm that combines treewidth reduction and an
algebraic approach to solve Planar Disjoint Paths in time
$2^{k^{O(1)}}n^{O(1)}$ (for undirected graphs).

and a partition of its edges into $h$ queues, such that no two independent
edges of the same queue nest. The minimum $h$ such that $G$ admits an $h$-queue
layout is the queue number of $G$. We present two fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms that exploit structural properties of graphs to compute optimal
queue layouts. As our first result, we show that deciding whether a graph $G$
has queue number $1$ and computing a corresponding layout is fixed-parameter
tractable when parameterized by the treedepth of $G$. Our second result then
uses a more restrictive parameter, the vertex cover number, to solve the
problem for arbitrary $h$.

matching records within a database. Blocking is a typical stage in this process
that involves cheaply finding candidate pairs of records that are potential
matches for further processing. We present here Hashed Dynamic Blocking, a new
approach to blocking designed to address datasets larger than those studied in
most prior work. Hashed Dynamic Blocking (HDB) extends Dynamic Blocking, which
leverages the insight that rare matching values and rare intersections of
values are predictive of a matching relationship. We also present a novel use
of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to build blocking key values for huge
databases with a convenient configuration to control the trade-off between
precision and recall. HDB achieves massive scale by minimizing data movement,
using compact block representation, and greedily pruning ineffective candidate
blocks using a Count-min Sketch approximate counting data structure. We
benchmark the algorithm by focusing on real-world datasets in excess of one
million rows, demonstrating that the algorithm displays linear time complexity
scaling in this range. Furthermore, we execute HDB on a 530 million row
industrial dataset, detecting 68 billion candidate pairs in less than three
hours at a cost of $307 on a major cloud service.

Robert Reckhow with his advsior Stephen Cook famously started the formal study of the complexity of proofs with their 1979 <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/cook_reckhow.pdf">paper</a>. They were interested in the length of the shortest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_complexity">proofs</a> of propositional statements. Georg Kreisel and others may have looked at proof length earlier, but one of the key insights of Reckhow and Cook is that low level propositional logic is important.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might look at the complexity of proofs.</p>
<p>
Cook and Reckhow were motivated by issues like: How hard is it to prove that a graph has no clique of a certain size? Or how hard to prove that some program halts on all inputs of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>? All of these questions ask about the length of proofs in a precise sense. Proofs have been around forever, back to Euclid at least, but Cook and Reckhow were the first to formally study the lengths of proofs. </p>
<p>
They were not directly interested in actual proofs. The kind you can find in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/archive/math">arXiv</a> or in a math journal, or at a conference—online or not. The kind that are in their paper.<br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/08/19/logical-complexity-of-proofs/paper-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-17432"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17432" height="60" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/paper.png?w=300&amp;h=60" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>We are talking today about these types of proofs. Not proofs that graphs have cliques. But proofs that a no planar graph can have a <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/> clique. </p>

</p><p/><h2> Proofs </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Proofs are what we strive to find ever day. They the coin that measures progress in a mathematical field like complexity theory. We do sometimes work out examples, sometimes do computations to confirm conjectures on small examples, sometimes consider analogies to other proofs. But mostly we want to understand proofs. We want to create new ones and understand others proofs. </p>
<p>
Years ago when studying the graph isomorphism problem, I did some extensive computations for the random case. That is for the case of isomorphism for a random dense graphs against a worst case other graph. The computations helped me improve my result. It did not yield a proof, of course, but helped me realize that a certain lemma could be improved from a bound <img alt="{\log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log n}"/> to <img alt="{O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(1)}"/>. My results were dominated by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stanley_Selkow/publication/220618511_Random_Graph_Isomorphism/links/00463537d337e6a35d000000/Random-Graph-Isomorphism.pdf">paper</a> of Laszlo Babai, Paul Erdös, and Stanley Selkow. Oh well. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proofs Complexity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There are several measures of complexity for proofs. One is the length. Long proofs are difficult to find, difficult to write up, difficult to read, and difficult to check. Another less obvious measure is the logical structure of a proof. What does this mean?</p>
<p>
Our idea is that a proof can be modeled by a formula from propositional logic. The <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> is what we are trying to prove and the letters <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and so on are for statements we already know.  </p>
<li>
<img alt="{(A \rightarrow P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A+%5Crightarrow+P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A \rightarrow P)}"/>  This is a direct proof. <p/>
</li><li>
<img alt="{(\neg P \rightarrow \neg A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cneg+P+%5Crightarrow+%5Cneg+A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\neg P \rightarrow \neg A)}"/>  This is a proof by contradiction. <p/>
</li><li>
<img alt="{( A \vee \neg A \rightarrow P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28+A+%5Cvee+%5Cneg+A+%5Crightarrow+P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{( A \vee \neg A \rightarrow P)}"/>  This is proof that uses a statement <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> that may be true or false. <p/>
<p>
The last is a slight cheat, we use <img alt="{A \vee \neg A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cvee+%5Cneg+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \vee \neg A}"/> to stand for a kind of axiom. A perfect example is from number theory. Let <img alt="{\pi(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi(X)}"/> be the number of primes less than <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and the function <img alt="{li(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bli%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{li(x)}"/> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logarithmic_integral_function&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1">logarithmic function</a>. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  li(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t}.

It was noted that <img alt="{li(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bli%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{li(x)}"/> is larger than <img alt="{\pi(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi(x)}"/> for known values. The obvious question was that could 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  li(x) \ge \pi(x), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++li%28x%29+%5Cge+%5Cpi%28x%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  li(x) \ge \pi(x), "/></p>
<p>be always true? If so this would be an interesting inequality. In 1914 John Littlewood famously <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/2SUrpE8NK6sC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=John+Littlewood+pi+nd+li">proved</a> that this was not true: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If the Riemann Hypothesis is true: 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+-+li%28x%29+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) "/></p>
<p>is infinitely often positive and negative. If the Riemann Hypothesis is false: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+-+li%28x%29+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) "/></p>
</em><p><em>is infinitely often positive and negative. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Thus he proved that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+-+li%28x%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) "/></p>
<p>is infinitely often positive and negative whether the the Riemann is true or not. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proofs in Trouble </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A sign of a proof in danger is, in my opinion, is not just the length. A better measure I think is the logical flow of proof. I know of no actual proof that uses this structure: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ((A \vee C) \rightarrow (B \vee C)) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28A+%5Crightarrow+B%29+%5Crightarrow+%28%28A+%5Cvee+C%29+%5Crightarrow+%28B+%5Cvee+C%29%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ((A \vee C) \rightarrow (B \vee C)) "/></p>
<p>Do you? Even if your proof is only a few lines or even pages, if the high level flow was the above tautology I would be worried. </p>
<p>
Another example is <img alt="{P \rightarrow P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%5Crightarrow+P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P \rightarrow P}"/>. This of course is a circular proof. It seems hard to believe we would actually do this, but it has happen. The key is that no one says: I will assume the theorem to prove it. The flaw is disguised better than that.</p>
<p>
I cannot formally define this measure. Perhaps it is known, but I do think that it would be an additional measure. For actual proofs, ones we use every day, perhaps it would be valuable. I know I have looked at an attempted proof of X and noticed the logical flow in this sense was too complex. So complex that it was wrong. The author of the potential proof was me. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this measure, the logical flow of a proof, of any interest? </p>

    <title>Moment Multicalibration for Uncertainty Estimation</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This blog post is about<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037" target="_blank"> a new paper</a> that I'm excited about, which is joint work with <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~chrjung/" target="_blank">Chris Jung</a>,<a href="https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/people/changhwa-lee" target="_blank"> Changhwa Lee</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/malleshpai/">Mallesh Pai</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quaerereverum9/">Ricky Vohra</a>. <div><br/></div><div>Suppose you are diagnosed with hypertension, and your doctor recommends that you take a certain drug to lower your blood pressure. The latest research, she tells you, finds that the drug lowers diastolic blood pressure by an average of 10 mm Hg. You remember your statistics class from college, and so you ask about confidence intervals. She looks up the paper, and tells you that it reports a 95% confidence interval of [5, 15]. How should you interpret this? </div><div><br/></div><div>What you might naively hope is that [5, 15] represents a <i>conditional prediction interval</i>. If you have some set of observable features $x$, and a label $y$ (in this case corresponding to your decrease in diastolic blood pressure after taking the drug), a 95% conditional prediction interval would promise that:</div><div>$$\Pr_y [y \in [5, 15] | x] \geq 0.95$$</div><div><br/></div><div>In other words, a conditional prediction interval would promise that given all of your observed features, <i>over the unrealized/unmeasured randomness of the world</i>, there is a 95% chance that your diastolic blood pressure will decrease by between 5 and 15 points. </div><div><br/></div><div>But if you think about it, coming up with a conditional prediction interval is essentially impossible in a rich feature space. If $x$ contains lots of information about you, then probably there was nobody in the original study population that exactly matched your set of features $x$, and so we have no information at all about the conditional distribution on $y$ given $x$ --- i.e. no samples at all from the distribution over which our coverage probability supposedly holds! So how can you expect any sort of promise at all? There are two typical ways around this difficulty. </div><div><br/></div><div>The first is to make heroic assumptions about the data generation process. For example, if we assume that the world looks like an ordinary least squares model, and that there is a linear relationship between $y$ and $x$, then we can form a confidence region around the parameters of the model, and from that derive prediction intervals. But these prediction intervals are not valid if the model fails to hold, which it inevitably will. </div><div><br/></div><div>The second is to give up on conditional prediction intervals, and instead give <i>marginal prediction intervals</i>. This is what the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3188" target="_blank">conformal prediction</a> literature aims to do. A marginal prediction interval looks quite similar to a conditional prediction interval (at least syntactically), and promises:</div><div>$$\Pr_{(x,y)} [y \in [5, 15] ] \geq 0.95$$</div><div><br/></div><div>Rather than conditioning on your features $x$, a marginal prediction interval averages over all people, and promises that 95% of people who take the drug have their diastolic blood pressure lowered by between 5 and 15 points. But the semantics of this promise are quite different than that of a conditional prediction interval. Because the average is now taken over a large, heterogeneous population, very little is promised to <i>you</i>. For example, it might be that for patients in your demographic group (e.g. middle aged women with Sephardic Jewish ancestry and a family history of diabetes) that the drug is actually expected to raise blood pressure rather than lower it. Because this subgroup represents less than 5% of the population, it is entirely consistent with the marginal prediction interval being correct. Of course, if you are lucky, then perhaps someone has conducted a study of people from this demographic group and has computed marginal prediction intervals over it! But what if there are multiple different groups that you are a member of, over which the results seem to conflict? For example, you might also have a low BMI value and have unusually good cholesterol readings --- features of a group for which the drug works unusually well. Which uncertainty estimate should you trust, if you are a member of both groups? </div><div><br/></div><div>These concerns actually arise already when we think about the semantics of mean estimations ("the expected drop in blood pressure amongst patients who take this drug is 10 mm Hg"). Ideally, if you were a patient with features $x$, then 10 would be an estimate of $\mathbb{E}[y | x]$. But just as with uncertainty estimation, in a large feature space, we typically have no information about the distribution on $y$ conditional on $x$ (because we have never met anyone exactly like <i>you</i> before), and so instead what we have is just an estimate of $\mathbb{E}[y]$ --- i.e. averaging over people. If you have a method of making predictions $f(x)$ as a function of features $x$, then a standard performance metric is <i>calibration</i> --- which informally asks that for every prediction $p$, amongst all people for whom we predicted $f(x) = p$, the average of the realized labels $y$ should be $p$. Again, estimates of this form promise little to individuals, because they are averages over a large and heterogeneous population.   </div><div><br/></div><div>Several years ago, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513" target="_blank">Hebert-Johnson et al.</a> proposed a nice way to interpolate between the (impossible) ideal of offering conditional mean predictions  $f(x) = \mathbb{E}[y | x]$, and the weak guarantee of merely offering calibrated predictions $f$. Roughly speaking, they proposed to specify a very large collection of potentially intersecting groups $G$ (representing e.g. demographic groups like Sephardic Jewish women with a family history of diabetes, and hypertensive patients with low cholesterol and BMI values, etc) and to ask that a trained predictor be <i>simultaniously</i> calibrated on each sufficiently large group in $G$. They showed how to accomplish this using a polynomially sized sample from the underlying distribution, with polynomial running time overhead, on top of the cost of solving learning problems over $G$. </div><div><br/></div><div>In our paper, we --- roughly speaking --- show how to accomplish the same thing, but for variances and other higher moments, in addition to just means. And our "multicalibrated moment estimates" can be used to construct prediction intervals in exactly the same way that real moments of the conditional label distribution could be used. If you used the real (unknown) label distribution moments, you would have gotten conditional prediction intervals. If you use our multi-calibrated moments, you get marginal prediction intervals that are simultaneously valid as averaged over each of the groups in $G$. So, for example, our hypertensive patient above could interpret her prediction interval --- if it was constructed from multicalibrated moment estimates computed from her features --- as an average over each of the demographic groups that she is a member of (so long as they are contained within $G$), and all of those interpretations would be simultaneously valid. </div><div><br/></div><div>I'll leave the details to the paper --- including what exactly we mean by "moment multicalibration". I'll just note that a major difficulty is that variances and higher moments --- unlike expectations --- do not combine linearly, so it is no longer sensible to ask that "amongst all people for whom we predicted variance v, the true variance should be v" --- because even the true conditional label variances do not satisfy this property. But it <i>is </i>sensible to ask that a pair of mean and moment predictions be calibrated in this way: "amongst all people for whom we predicted mean $\mu$ and variance v, the true mean should be $\mu$ and the true variance should be $v$." This is what we call "mean-conditioned moment calibration", and it is satisfied by the true distributional moments. </div><div><br/></div><div>The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037">Moment Multicalibration for Uncertainty Estimation</a>.</div><div><br/></div></div>

    <title>TR20-126 |  Indistinguishability Obfuscation from Well-Founded Assumptions | 

	Aayush  Jain, 

	Huijia Lin, 

	Amit Sahai</title>
    <summary>In this work, we show how to construct indistinguishability obfuscation from subexponential hardness of four well-founded assumptions. We prove:

Let $\tau \in (0,\infty), \delta \in (0,1), \epsilon \in (0,1)$ be arbitrary constants. Assume sub-exponential security of the following assumptions, where $\lambda$ is a security parameter, and the parameters $\ell,k,n$ below are large enough polynomials in $\lambda$:

- The SXDH assumption on asymmetric bilinear groups of a prime order $p = O(2^\lambda)$,

- The LWE assumption over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ with subexponential modulus-to-noise ratio $2^{k^\epsilon}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the LWE secret,

- The LPN assumption over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with polynomially many LPN samples and error rate $1/\ell^\delta$, where $\ell$ is the dimension of the LPN secret,

- The existence of a Boolean PRG in $\mathsf{NC}^0$ with stretch $n^{1+\tau}$,
 
Then, (subexponentially secure) indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size circuits exists.</summary>

    <title>Amortized Edge Sampling</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1597795200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/e/Eden:Talya.html">Talya Eden</a>, Saleet Mossel, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rubinfeld:Ronitt.html">Ronitt Rubinfeld</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08032">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>We present a sublinear time algorithm that allows one to sample multiple
edges from a distribution that is pointwise $\epsilon$-close to the uniform
distribution, in an \emph{amortized-efficient} fashion. We consider the
adjacency list query model, where access to a graph $G$ is given via degree and
neighbor queries.
</p>
<p>The problem of sampling a single edge in this model has been considered by
Eden and Rosenbaum (SOSA 18). Let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and
edges of $G$, respectively. Eden and Rosenbaum provided upper and lower bounds
of $\Theta^*(n/\sqrt m)$ for sampling a single edge in general graphs (where
$O^*(\cdot)$ suppresses $\textrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ and $\textrm{poly}(\log n)$
dependencies). We ask whether the query complexity lower bound for sampling a
single edge can be circumvented when multiple samples are required. That is,
can we get an improved amortized per-sample cost if we allow a more costly
preprocessing phase? We answer in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>We present an algorithm that, if one knows the number of required samples $q$
in advance, has an overall cost of $O^*(\sqrt q \cdot(n/\sqrt m))$, which is
strictly preferable to $O^*(q\cdot (n/\sqrt m))$ cost resulting from $q$
invocations of the algorithm by Eden and Rosenbaum. More generally, for an
input parameter $x&gt;1$, our algorithm has a preprocessing phase with
$O^*(n/(x\cdot d_{avg}))$ cost, which then allows an $O(x/\epsilon)$ per-sample
cost, where $d_{avg}$ denotes the average degree of the graph.

For several basic
clustering problems, including Euclidean DensestBall, 1-Cluster, k-means, and
k-median, we give efficient differentially private algorithms that achieve
essentially the same approximation ratios as those that can be obtained by any
non-private algorithm, while incurring only small additive errors. This
improves upon existing efficient algorithms that only achieve some large
constant approximation factors.
</p>
<p>Our results also imply an improved algorithm for the Sample and Aggregate
privacy framework. Furthermore, we show that one of the tools used in our
1-Cluster algorithm can be employed to get a faster quantum algorithm for
ClosestPair in a moderate number of dimensions.

set of non-overlapping unordered fragments, is fundamental to numerous
applications, and yet most of the literature has focused thus far on less
realistic puzzles whose pieces are identical squares. Here we formalize a new
type of jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are general convex polygons generated by
cutting through a global polygonal shape with an arbitrary number of straight
cuts, a generation model inspired by the celebrated Lazy caterer's sequence. We
analyze the theoretical properties of such puzzles, including the inherent
challenges in solving them once pieces are contaminated with geometrical noise.
To cope with such difficulties and obtain tractable solutions, we abstract the
problem as a multi-body spring-mass dynamical system endowed with hierarchical
loop constraints and a layered reconstruction process. We define evaluation
metrics and present experimental results to indicate that such puzzles are
solvable completely automatically.

shortest paths meet twice, we study a question posed by Greg Bodwin: Given a
geodetic graph $G$, i.e., an unweighted graph in which the shortest path
between any pair of vertices is unique, is there a philogeodetic drawing of
$G$, i.e., a drawing of $G$ in which the curves of any two shortest paths meet
at most once? We answer this question in the negative by showing the existence
of geodetic graphs that require some pair of shortest paths to cross at least
four times. The bound on the number of crossings is tight for the class of
graphs we construct. Furthermore, we exhibit geodetic graphs of diameter two
that do not admit a philogeodetic drawing.

performance in accelerating many numerical and graph algorithms, such as
iterative methods for solving large sparse matrices, spectral partitioning of
undirected graphs, vectorless verification of power/thermal grids,
representation learning of large graphs, etc. However, prior spectral graph
sparsification methods rely on fast Laplacian matrix solvers that are usually
challenging to implement in practice. This work, for the first time, introduces
a solver-free approach (SF-GRASS) for spectral graph sparsification by
leveraging emerging spectral graph coarsening and graph signal processing (GSP)
techniques. We introduce a local spectral embedding scheme for efficiently
identifying spectrally-critical edges that are key to preserving graph spectral
properties, such as the first few Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since
the key kernel functions in SF-GRASS can be efficiently implemented using
sparse-matrix-vector-multiplications (SpMVs), the proposed spectral approach is
simple to implement and inherently parallel friendly. Our extensive
experimental results show that the proposed method can produce a hierarchy of
high-quality spectral sparsifiers in nearly-linear time for a variety of
real-world, large-scale graphs and circuit networks when compared with the
prior state-of-the-art spectral method.

    <title>Cardinality estimation using Gumbel distribution</title>
    <feedworld_mtime>1597795200</feedworld_mtime>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Aleksander Łukasiewicz, Przemysław Uznański <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07590">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Cardinality estimation is the task of approximating the number of distinct
elements in a large dataset with possibly repeating elements. LogLog and
HyperLogLog (c.f. Durand and Flajolet [ESA 2003], Flajolet et al. [Discrete
Math Theor. 2007]) are small space sketching schemes for cardinality
estimation, which have both strong theoretical guarantees of performance and
are highly effective in practice. This makes them a highly popular solution
with many implementations in big-data systems (e.g. Algebird, Apache
DataSketches, BigQuery, Presto and Redis). However, despite having simple and
elegant formulation, both the analysis of LogLog and HyperLogLog are extremely
involved -- spanning over tens of pages of analytic combinatorics and complex
function analysis.
</p>
<p>We propose a modification to both LogLog and HyperLogLog that replaces
discrete geometric distribution with a continuous Gumbel distribution. This
leads to a very short, simple and elementary analysis of estimation guarantees,
and smoother behavior of the estimator.

(SCMA) has been recently proposed to provide uplink high spectral efficiency
transmission. The message passing algorithm (MPA) is employed to detect the
transmitted signals, which suffers from high complexity. This paper proposes
three low-complexity algorithms for the first time to the SM-SCMA. The first
algorithm is referred to as successive user detection (SUD), while the second
algorithm is the modified version of SUD, namely modified SUD (MSUD). Then, for
the first time, the tree-search of the SM-SCMA is constructed. Based on that
tree-search, another variant of the sphere decoder (SD) is proposed for the
SM-SCMA, referred to as fixed-complexity SD (FCSD). SUD provides a benchmark
for decoding complexity at the expense of bit-error-rate (BER) performance.
Further, MSUD slightly increases the complexity of SUD with a significant
improvement in BER performance. Finally, FCSD provides a near-optimum BER with
a considerable reduction of the complexity compared to the MPA decoder and also
supports parallel hardware implementation. The proposed algorithms provide
flexible design choices for practical implementation based on system design
demands. The complexity analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations of the BER are
provided for the proposed algorithms.

    <title>TR20-125 |  Efficient reconstruction of depth three circuits with top fan-in two | 

	Gaurav  Sinha</title>
    <summary>In this paper we develop efficient randomized algorithms to solve the black-box reconstruction problem for polynomials(over finite fields) computable by depth three arithmetic circuits with alternating addition/multiplication gates, such that top(output) gate is an addition gate with in-degree $2$. Such circuits naturally compute polynomials of the form $G\times(T_1 + T_2)$, where $G,T_1,T_2$ are product of affine forms computed at the first(addition) layer in the circuit, and polynomials $T_1,T_2$ have no common factors. Rank of such a circuit is defined to be the dimension of vector space spanned by all affine factors of $T_1$ and $T_2$. For any polynomial $f$ computable by such a circuit, $rank(f)$ is defined to be the minimum rank of any such circuit computing it. Our work develops randomized algorithms, which take as input a black-box computing polynomial $f$, with coefficients in a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, exhibiting such a circuit. Here are the results. 

$[$Low rank$]:$ When $5\leq r = rank(f) = O(\log^3 d)$, it runs in time $(nd^{\log^3d}\log |\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$ and outputs a depth three circuit computing $f$ (with high probability), with top addition gate having in-degree $\leq d^{rank(f)}$.

$[$High rank$]:$ When $rank(f) = \Omega(\log^3 d)$, it runs in time $(nd\log |\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$, and with high probability outputs a depth three circuit computing $f$, with top addition gate having in-degree $2$.

Prior to our work, black-box reconstruction for this circuit class was addressed in [Shp07, KS09, Sin16b]. Reconstruction algorithm in [Shp07] runs in time quasi-polynomial in $n,d,|\mathbb{F}|$ and that in [KS09] is quasi-polynomial in $d,|\mathbb{F}|$. Algorithm in [Sin16b] works only for polynomials over characteristic zero fields. Thus ours is the first blackbox reconstruction algorithm for this class of circuits that runs in time polynomial in $\log |\mathbb{F}|$. This problem has been mentioned as an open problem in [GKL12] (STOC 2012). In the high rank case, our algorithm runs in $(nd\log|\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$ time, thereby significantly improving the existing algorithms in [Shp07, KS09].</summary>

    <title>TR20-124 |  A Strong XOR Lemma for Randomized Query Complexity | 

	Joshua Brody, 

	JaeTak Kim, 

	Peem Lerdputtipongporn, 

	Hariharan Srinivasulu</title>
    <summary>We give a strong direct sum theorem for computing $XOR \circ g$.  Specifically, we show that the randomized query complexity of computing the XOR of $k$ instances of $g$ satisfies $\bar{R}_\varepsilon(XOR \circ g)=\Theta(\bar{R}_{\varepsilon/k}(g))$.  This matches the naive success amplification bound and answers a question of Blais and Brody.

As a consequence of our strong direct sum theorem, we give a total function $g$ for which $R(XOR \circ g) = \Theta(k\log(k)R(g))$, answering an open question from Ben-David et al.</summary>

    <title>TR20-123 |  An Optimal Tester for k-Linear | 

	Nader Bshouty</title>
    <summary>A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ is $k$-linear if it returns the sum (over the binary field $F_2$) of $k$ coordinates of the input. In this paper, we study property testing of the classes $k$-Linear, the class of all $k$-linear functions, and $k$-Linear$^*$, the class $\cup_{j=0}^kj$-Linear.
We give a non-adaptive distribution-free two-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear that makes
$$O\left(k\log k+\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$$ queries.
This matches the lower bound known from the literature.

We then give a non-adaptive distribution-free one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear$^*$ that makes the same number of queries and show that any non-adaptive uniform-distribution one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear must make at least $ \tilde\Omega(k)\log n+\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries. The latter bound, almost matches the upper bound $O(k\log n+1/\epsilon)$ known from the literature. We then show that any adaptive uniform-distribution one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear must make at least $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{k})\log n+\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries.</summary>

    <title>Mathematics is not commutative</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In my poll of P vs NP and other issues, one of the questions was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                             <i>Is factoring in P?</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
One of the most interesting answers was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                            <i> I don't really see why it shouldn't be. - Peter Shor</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
Recall that Peter Shor proved Factoring is in Quantum-P which lead to intense interest in Quantum Computing.<br/>
<br/>
1) What if factoring was in P and this was shown before Shor's algorithm? Would Shor or someone else have ever proven factoring in quantum P? Would there be as much intense interest in quantum computing as there is now? Perhaps by physicists more than CS people?<br/>
<br/>
2) What if factoring was in P and this was shown before RSA? Where would crypto be now? Zip drives with a googleplex random (or nearly random) bits and more 1-time pads? More lattice based crypto? Or RSA but with larger numbers? This may depend on how good the factoring algorithm is.<br/>
<br/>
3) More generally, how much does the order of events matter for science?<br/>
<br/>
a) If the Banach-Tarski paradox was discovered early on, would we have just tossed out the Axiom of Choice before so much more was build on it? Darling thinks we should toss out AC NOW because of Banach-Tarski.<br/>
<br/>
b) In the model of set theory L you can do ALL of math except some parts of set theory and maybe a few other things (note quite: Harvey Friedman has found some combinatorial statements that need large cardinals to prove). Had L been discovered earlier then could we all now be working in L (except a few people who look at other models, but they are not in the mainstream)? We might know more about L and less about forcing. We would KNOW that AC and CH are true. Or we would think we know.<br/>
<br/>
c) If  Engineers were the first ones to look at SAT and reductions, might they have been content to know that  if SAT \le A then A is probably hard? No need for the Cook-Levin Theorem! And then when someone proved Cook-Levin would the Engineers not really cares since they already knew SAT was hard?<br/>
<br/>d) I can imagine Ramsey's Theorem being discovered much later for some application, or perhaps never being discovered at all.<div><br/></div><div>e) VDW's theorem has so few application, I can imagine it never being discovered. </div><div><br/></div><div>4) There are cases where if A was discovered before B then B has an easy proof, whereas if B was discovered before A, then B has a hard proof. I'll give one example:</div><div><br/></div><div>Given HALT is undecidable, Godel's theorem is easy.</div><div><br/></div><div>Assume HALT is undecidable. </div><div><br/></div><div>Let STAT(e) be the statement M_e(0) does not  halt.</div><div><br/></div><div>There is some e such that M_e(0) does not halt  but ZFC cannot prove this.</div><div><br/></div><div>PROOF: Assume, By Way of Contradiction that for all e such that M_e(0) does not halt,</div><div>ZFC could prove this. Then HALT is DECIDABLE:</div><div><br/>Given e, run M_e(0) and at the same time enumerate all proofs in ZFC. It is guaranteed that</div><div>you will either find M_e(0) halts or a proof that M_e(0) does not halt. Hence you will,</div><div>in finite time, know if M_e(0) halts OR NOT.</div><div><br/></div><div>END OF PROOF</div><div><br/></div><div>Is the sequence of events where HALT is proven undecidable  before Godel's theorem plausible.</div><div>I  think so</div><div><br/></div><div>I INVITE my readers to give there own examples of when Math is not commutative- meaning that</div><div>the order of events matters.</div><div>

    <title>TR20-122 |  Size Bounds on Low Depth Circuits for Promise Majority | 

	Joshua Cook</title>
    <summary>We give two results on the size of AC0 circuits computing promise majority. $\epsilon$-promise majority is majority promised that either at most an $\epsilon$ fraction of the input bits are 1, or at most $\epsilon$ are 0.

First, we show super quadratic lower bounds on both monotone and general depth 3 circuits for promise majority.

For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, monotone depth 3 AC0 circuits for $\epsilon$-promise majority have size 
$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\epsilon^3 n^{2 + \frac{\ln(1 - \epsilon)}{\ln(\epsilon)}}\right)$
         
For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, general depth 3 AC0 circuits for $\epsilon$-promise majority have size
$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\epsilon^3 n^{2 + \frac{\ln(1 - \epsilon^2)}{2\ln(\epsilon)}}\right)$

These are the first nontrivial size lower bounds on depth 3 promise majority circuits for $\epsilon &lt; 0.45$.
        
Second, we give both uniform and non-uniform sub-quadratic size constant depth circuits for promise majority.

For integer $k \geq 1$, constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, there exists monotone non uniform AC0 circuits of depth $2 + 2 \cdot k$ computing $\epsilon$-promise majority with size
$\tilde{O}\left(n^{\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-k}}}\right)$

For integer $k \geq 1$, constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, there exists monotone uniform AC0 circuit of depth $2 + 2 \cdot k$ computing $\epsilon$-promise majority with size
$n^{\frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k} + o(1)}$

These circuits are based on incremental improvements to existing depth 3 circuits for promise majority given by Ajtai and Viola combined with a divide and conquer strategy.</summary>

    <title>TR20-121 |  Fractional Pseudorandom Generators from the $k$th Fourier Level | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jason Gaitonde, 

	Abhishek Shetty</title>
    <summary>In recent work by Chattopadhyay et al.[CHHL19,CHLT19], the authors exhibit a simple and flexible construction of pseudorandom generators for classes of Boolean functions that satisfy $L_1$ Fourier bounds. [CHHL19] show that if a class satisfies such tail bounds at all levels, this implies a PRG whose seed length depends on the quality of these bounds through their innovative random walk framework that composes together fractional PRGs that polarize quickly to the Boolean hypercube. On the other hand, [CHLT19] show that, by derandomizing the analysis of [RT19], just level-two Fourier bounds suffice to construct a pseudorandom generator using their framework; as this is a much weaker assumption on the class, [CHLT19] naturally obtain exponentially worse dependence on the error in the seed length compared to [CHHL19]. Moreover, this derandomization relies on simulating nearly independent Gaussians for the fractional pseudorandom generator, which necessitates the  polynomial dependence on $1/\epsilon$ in each fractional step.
    
    In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two results. Namely, we partially answer an open question by [CHLT19] that nearly interpolates between them. In particular, we show that if one has bounds up to the level-$k$ $L_1$ Fourier mass of a closely related class of functions, where $k&gt;2$, one can obtain improved seed length, the degree to which is determined by how high $k$ can be taken. Our analysis shows that for error $\epsilon=1/\text{poly}(n)$, one needs control at just level $O(\log n)$ to recover the seed length of [CHHL19], without assumptions on the entire tail. We avoid this by providing a simple, alternate analysis of their fractional PRG that instead relies on Taylor's theorem and $p$-biased Fourier analysis to avoid assumptions on the weights of the higher-order terms. This further allows us to show that this framework can handle the class of low-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with slightly worse dependence than the current state-of-the-art, which was not previously known. We hope that this alternate analysis will be fruitful in improving the understanding of this new and powerful framework.</summary>

    <title>Why Privacy Needs Composition</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We’re back!  In our last <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\average-case-dp">post</a> we discussed some of the subtle pitfalls of formulating the assumptions underlying average-case relaxations of differential privacy.  This time we’re going to look at the composition property of differential privacy—that is, the fact that running two independent differentially private algorithms on your data and combining their outputs is still differentially private. This is a key property of differential privacy and is actually closely related to the worst-case nature of differential privacy.</p>

<p>Composition is really the crucial property that has made differential privacy successful. Data analysis doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and the greatest threat to privacy comes from combining multiple pieces of information. These pieces of information can come from a single source that releases detailed statistics, or they could come from separate sources. So it’s critical to understand how the composition of multiple pieces of information can affect privacy.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll give some examples to illustrate why we need composition, and why composition is challenging for average-case relaxations of differential privacy.  Composition is what allows you to design sophisticated differentially private algorithms out of simple building blocks, and it’s what allows one organization to release differentially private statistics without having to understand the entire ecosystem of related information that has been or will be released.  As we’ll see, the challenges of composing average-case privacy guarantees are also very closely related to the subtleties that arise in thinking about the adversary’s beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="differencing-attacks">Differencing Attacks</h3>

<p>Let’s start with a simple example of composition that was alluded to in our last post.</p>

<p>You’ve just started a new job and signed up for the health insurance provided by your employer. Thus, your employer is able to obtain aggregated data from the insurance provider. In particular, your employer can ask “How many of our employees have submitted claims for condition X?”  However, your employer should not be able to find out whether or not <em>you</em> have condition X. 
For concreteness, condition X could be a mental health condition, drug addiction, being pregnant, terminal cancer, or an expensive chronic illness. Each of these could result in some kind of employment discrimination.</p>

<p>The employer may find out that 417 employees have condition X.  That’s OK; on its own, this number reveals very little about whether or not <em>you</em> have condition X, as long as your employer is uncertain about how many employees <em>other than you</em> have condition X.  We can formalize this as some kind of average-case or Bayesian privacy guarantee. Thus the health-insurance company is comfortable releasing this number exactly.  But, yesterday, before you started your job, it also seemed reasonable to allow your employer to ask the exact same question, and yesterday the answer was 416. Thus your employer concludes that you have condition X.</p>

<p>In this example, we see how two pieces of information—the count before you started and the count after you started—each of which seems innocuous on its own can be combined to reveal private information. This is a simple example of a <em>differencing attack</em> and composition is important in part because it prevents these attacks.</p>

<p>This example involves only two pieces of information. However, an attack could combine many pieces of information. For example, the counts could be broken down by sex, race/ethnicity, age, location, and tobacco use.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> Additional data may also be obtained from other sources, such as public records, social media, voluntary disclosures, healthcare providers, financial records, employment records, or even illicit sources. The possibilities for attacks grow rapidly as more information is made available. And an employer is only one example of a potential privacy adversary.</p>

<p>The point of this example is that it’s easy to argue that one piece of information is harmless to privacy by making plausible-looking assumptions about the adversary. But this intuition rapidly breaks down once you consider the bigger picture where there are many pieces of information that can complete the puzzle. That’s why we need rigorous methods for understanding privacy and its composition.</p>

<h3 id="quantifying-composition">Quantifying Composition</h3>

<p>How does differential privacy prevent a differencing attack like the one we just discussed? The simplest way is to add a little bit of random noise to each answer. On the first day, instead of releasing the exact count 416, we could release a noisy count, say, 420. Then on the second day, instead of releasing the true count 417, we release another noisy count, say, 415. More precisely, it is common to add noise to counts drawn from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution.  These figures are still close enough to the true values to be useful, but the difference of 1 is now obscured by the noise, so your privacy is protected.</p>

<p>Since the noise is unknown to <em>any</em> potential adversary, it introduces uncertainty that protects the contribution that an individual makes to the count. Taking the difference of two independent noisy counts results in something that is still noisy. However, we must be careful to quantify this privacy guarantee, particularly when it comes to composition.</p>

<p>So, how much noise do we need to add? Let’s go back to the example and suppose the insurance company provides noisy answers where the noise has mean zero and some fixed variance. Your employer could simply ask the same question again and again and each time receive a different noisy answer. Averaging these noisy answers will effectively reduce the variance of the added noise and allow the true answer to be discerned. That leaves us back where we started.</p>

<p>The moral of this revised example is that the scale of the noise must increase if we allow more access to the data, so more questions means more noise in each answer.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup> 
Asking the same question again and again may seem silly. There are easy ways to defend against this and some similar attacks. (E.g., by returning the same answer each time instead of generating fresh noise.) But, unfortunately, the underlying phenomenon cannot be circumvented. One of the seminal works that led to differential privacy <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/773153.773173" title="Irit Dinur, Kobbi Nissim. Revealing Information While Preserving Privacy. PODS 2003"><strong>[DN03]</strong></a> showed that there is an inherent tradeoff between the number of questions to be answered and the amount of noise that needs to be added to protect privacy. The general attack is simple: Instead of asking the same query again and again, the attacker asks “random” queries.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3">3</a></sup> This attack only requires basic linear algebra and, importantly, has been demonstrated on real systems <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05692" title="Aloni Cohen, Kobbi Nissim. Linear Program Reconstruction in Practice. 2018."><strong>[CN18]</strong></a>.</p>

<h3 id="adaptive-composition">Adaptive Composition</h3>

<p>There are actually two kinds of composition to consider. There is <strong>non-adaptive composition</strong>, where the questions to be asked are pre-specified and thus independent of the data, and there is <strong>adaptive composition</strong>, where the questions may themselves depend on the results of prior access to the data. Adaptive composition arises in an interactive system where queries are submitted one-by-one and each answer is returned before the next query is submitted. So far, we have really only considered non-adaptive composition.</p>

<p>Any interactive system must take adaptive composition into account.  A natural algorithm which asks adaptive questions is gradient descent for minimizing a function that is determined by private data (e.g., for logistic regression on medical records). At each step, the algorithm asks for a gradient of the function, which depends on the private data, at the current point. Then the point is updated according to the reported gradient and the process repeats. Since the updated point depends on the previous answer, the next gradient computation is adaptive.</p>

<p>The good news is that differential privacy can handle adaptive composition just fine.  However, to handle adaptive composition, it’s really important that you have a worst-case privacy definition like differential privacy. As we will see below, average-case variants of differential privacy cannot handle adaptive composition. Intuitively, the problem is that whatever distributional assumption you might make about the data or query a priori is unlikely to hold when you condition on past interactions with the same data or related data.</p>

<p>Here’s a technical example that shows the difficulty of adaptive composition. Our data \(x \in \{-1,+1\}^n\) is a vector of \(n\) bits, one bit per person.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4">4</a></sup>  Because we’re considering average-case differential privacy, we’ll model this vector as uniformly random.  Consider the following slightly odd algorithm \(M_2(x,v)\)—it takes a vector \(v \in \{-1,+1\}^n\) from the user, and, if the correlation \(\langle x, v \rangle / n\) between \(v\) and \(x\) is smaller than \(\varepsilon/2\), the query returns \(\emptyset\), but, if the correlation between \(v\) and \(x\) is larger than \(\varepsilon/2\), the query returns the dataset \(x\).  In isolation this algorithm satisfies an average-case version of differential privacy, because if \(n\) is large enough and \(x\) is uniformly random, then it’s very unlikely that the user can guess a vector \(v\) that causes this algorithm to output anything other than \(\emptyset\).  This algorithm may seem contrived; it is a simple stand-in for any algorithm that behaves very well most of the time, but fails completely on some rare inputs.</p>

<p>Now, consider another, more familiar differentially private algorithm called randomized response <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2283137?seq=1" title="Stanley Warner. Randomized Response: A Survey Technique for Eliminating Evasive Answer Bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association 1965."><strong>[W65]</strong></a>.  For those not familiar, this algorithm \(M_1(x)\) outputs a vector \(y \in \{-1,+1\}^n\), where \(y_i\) is slightly more likely to be \(x_i\) than \(-x_i\).  Specifically, we set \(y_i = x_i\) with probability \((1+\varepsilon)/2\) and \(y_i = - x_i\) otherwise. This satisfies \(\log(\frac{1+\varepsilon}{1-\varepsilon})\)-differential privacy or, roughly, \(2\varepsilon\)-differential privacy. The upshot is that we obtain a vector \(y\) where the correlation between \(x\) and \(y\) is about \(\varepsilon\), i.e. \(\langle x , y \rangle / n \approx \varepsilon\).</p>

<p>OK, so \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) both satisfy strong average-case versions of differential privacy when the data is uniform, but what about their composition?  Well, the bad news is that running \(y = M_1(x)\) followed by \(M_2(x,y)\) is going to return the dataset \(x\) with probability approaching 100%!  That’s because \(y\) was designed precisely to be a vector with correlation about \(\varepsilon\) with \(x\), and this is exactly the key that gets \(M_2\) to unlock the dataset.</p>

<p>What went wrong here is that, even if \(x\) really is uniformly random, it’s very far from it when conditioned on the output \(y=M_1(x)\). To analyze \(M_2(x,y)\) we must look at the distribution of \(x\) conditioned on \(y\). This distribution is going to be messy and may as well be a worst-case distribution, which means we must leave the realm of average-case privacy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Composition guarantees that, as long as each part of your system is differentially private, then the overall system is too. It would be difficult to build sophisticated systems without this property. And it’s what allows one organization to release differentially private statistics without having to worry about what other information might be out there. In short, composition is what allows differential privacy to deal with the complexities of the real world.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that differential privacy would have taken off as a field of research without this composition property. Any proposal for an alternative approach to privacy-preserving data analysis should first be evaluated in terms of how it handles composition.</p>

<p>This post only scratches the surface. In particular, we haven’t talked about the quantitative aspects of composition; that’s where the fun really begins. We will leave you with some pointers to further reading on the topic:</p>

      <p>A good rule of thumb is that, if the number of released values is much larger than the number of people, then a privacy attack is probably possible. This is analogous to the rule from algebra that, if the number of constraints (released values) is greater than the number of unknown variables (people’s data), then the unknowns can be worked out. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1">↩</a></p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06045">Rota’s Basis Conjecture holds asymptotically</a>, by Alexey <span style="color: #000000;">Pokrovskiy</span></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rota’s Basis Conjecture is a well known problem from matroid theory, that states that for any collection of n bases in a rank n matroid, it is possible to decompose all the elements into n disjoint rainbow bases. Here an asymptotic version of this is proved. We show that it is possible to find <em>n − o(n)</em> disjoint rainbow independent sets of size <em>n − o(n)</em>.</p>

<p>(I thank Nati Linial for telling me about it.)</p>
<p>Another way to formulate Rota’s basis conjecture (for representable matroids) is that if <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>B</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>B<sub>n</sub></em> are <em>n</em> bases of an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector space <em>V</em> (not necessarily distinct or disjoint), then there exists an <em>n</em> × <em>n</em> grid of vectors (<em>v<sub>ij</sub></em>) such that</p>
<p>1. the <em>n</em> vectors in row <em>i</em> are the members of the <em>i</em>th basis <em>B<sub>i</sub></em> (in some order), and</p>
<p>2. in each column of the matrix, the <em>n</em> vectors in that column form a basis of <em>V</em>.</p>
<p>If all the bases are the standard basis then this reduces to the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square">Latin squares</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated trivia question:</strong>  AGC-GTC-TGC-GTC-TGC-GAC-GATC-? what comes next in the sequence?</p>
<p>We mentioned Rota’s basis conjecture in various earlier posts.  A classic paper on the subject is the <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/huang-rota.pdf">1989 paper by Rosa Huang and Gian Carlo-Rota</a>. Three and a half years ago Timothy Chow lunched a polymath project (Polymath 12) to solve it. (Here is my<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/02/26/timothy-chow-launched-polymath12-on-rota-basis-conjecture-and-other-news/"> post on the project with various variants of the conjecture</a>, the <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/2017/02/23/rotas-basis-conjecture-polymath-12/">first post on the polymath blog</a>, and the <a href="https://asone.ai/polymath/index.php?title=Rota%27s_conjecture">wiki</a>).

<p>
Keith Conrad is a professor in the mathematics department at UCONN—the University of Connecticut. My dear wife Kathryn Farley and I are about to move to join him—not as faculty but as another resident of the “Constitution State.”</p>
<p>
Today we thank him for his work on explaining mathematics.</p>
<p>
Conrad is a prolific writer of articles on mathematics. He makes hard concepts clear, he makes easy concepts interesting. He has a sense of humor; his <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu">website</a> is filled with fun of all kinds.</p>
<p>
He has interesting license plates, photos of streets that bear his first name, a Russian <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/">update</a> to Tom Lehrer’s “Elements” song, and more links to others’ items. </p>
<p>
If you’d like a video example of fun see <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2OKd.gif">this</a> for a short video illusion. Too bad it is an illusion and it does not work in reality. As a chocolate lover I wish it worked—free chocolate forever. A similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_square_puzzle">illusion</a> with a triangle was once featured by Martin Gardner, leading Ken as a teenager to make a cardboard cutout version overlaid on a map of the Bermuda Triangle as an “explanation” of disappearances there.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Articles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I have not yet met Conrad in person, but have enjoyed reading his articles on math of all kinds. He has a giant <img alt="{63 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B63+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{63 \times 4}"/> <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/">grid</a> of clickable titles, grouped by subject area. </p>
<p>
For an example, he has a <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/numbersoncircle.pdf">title</a> “Roots on a Circle.” The file name says “numbers on a circle” and the essay begins disarmingly enough with a picture of the 7th roots of unity. The next page shows a simple polynomial where most but not all roots lie on the circle:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/thanks-to-an-explainer/lehmerspolynomialroots/" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17412" height="161" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/lehmerspolynomialroots.jpg?w=300&amp;h=161" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
This is enough to draw you in and stay attached as things become more complicated beginning on page 3. It helps that Conrad does not stint on algebraic details. This essay supplements a cautionary tale in mathematics: a <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/15444/examples-of-eventual-counterexamples">link</a> to a MathOverflow list whose top item is that the factors of <img alt="{x^n - 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5En+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^n - 1}"/> over <img alt="{\mathbb{Q}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Q}}"/> have no coefficient of absolute value greater than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> for <img alt="{n = 1,\dots,104}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+1%2C%5Cdots%2C104%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 1,\dots,104}"/>. Before you try to prove this by induction check out <img alt="{n = 105}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+105%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 105}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Finite Groups </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One of my favorite articles is <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/grouptheory/order.pdf">titled</a>, “Orders Of Elements In A Group.” Conrad starts with the humble concept of the order of an element in a group. Then he builds up a theory that explains various properties of order. </p>
<p>
I especially like that he supplies examples to help you with your intuition. For me, and Ken, finite groups are just counter-intuitive. Groups have magical properties but my naive conjectures about them usually fail. Conrad’s article ends with a discussion of primality testing which is dear to us in complexity theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Finite Groups that Encode Information </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I recently needed a finite group with a certain structure. In complexity theory we sometimes use matrices to encode information in a way that makes an algorithm more efficient. Algorithms like matrices since they can be stored and multiplied efficiently. As an example, suupose that we have two matrices <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  AB = -BA. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AB+%3D+-BA.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  AB = -BA. "/></p>
<p>That is the matrices anti-commute. Then we can use such matrices to encode information about a string <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> of <img alt="{A,B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A,B}"/>‘s. Every string <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> can be written as: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pm A^{k}B^{l}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpm+A%5E%7Bk%7DB%5E%7Bl%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pm A^{k}B^{l}. "/></p>
<p>The <img alt="{\pm}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm}"/> encodes the number of inversions in the string <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>. That is the number of times <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> is followed by an <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \dots B \dots A \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cdots+B+%5Cdots+A+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \dots B \dots A \dots "/></p>
<p>So <img alt="{ABBA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BABBA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{ABBA}"/> has <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> inversions, and <img alt="{AAABA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAAABA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{AAABA}"/> has <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. Here are matrices that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Clifford_algebra">anti-commute</a>. </p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+0%261%5C%5C+1%260+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}"/></p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++B+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+1%260%5C%5C+0%26-1+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}"/></p>

We can do even better. There are matrices so that 	</p>

<p>where <img alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\lambda}"/> is a root of unity. They exist as the example below shows for fourth roots of unity. But finding such matrices was curiously hard, at least for me. Lots of web searching.</p>

Conrad’s articles are helpful. In a wide variety of topics he presents both theorems and history of math concepts. What I find most attractive is the examples and additional comments that pepper his writing. </p>

    <title>An interview with Jos Baeten, outgoing director of the CWI</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After nine years, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> will step down as general director of <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/" target="_blank">CWI</a> on 30 September 2020 and there will be a <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/events/2020/farewell-symposium-jos-baeten/symposium-retirement-jos-baeten" target="_blank">retirement symposium</a> in his honour on 1 October 2020. (Jos Baeten's successor will be <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/ton-de-kok/" target="_blank">Tom de Kok</a>. You can read the CWI news item related to Tom de Kok's appointment <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/news/2020/ton-de-kok-appointed-new-director-of-cwi" target="_blank">here</a>. Tom de Kok, just like Jos Baeten before him, joins CWI from Eindhoven University of Technology.) </p><p>Jos Baeten has been one of the prime movers in the development of process algebra since 1987, and has been the driving force behind the CONCUR conference series and the CONCUR Basic Research Actions in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Apart from being general director of CWI, he has served the TCS community in a variety of roles and organisations, and has helped to connect the work of the concurrency-theory community with that done in control and mechanical engineering. He has also supervised more than 30 PhD theses. </p><p>I asked Jos a few questions via email and I am happy to share his answers with the readers of this blog. Thanks to Jos for all the contributions he has given to the research community throughout his career, and for sharing his opinions and reminiscences with us! </p><p><b>The interview</b> </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Let's start from the beginning. If I remember correctly, your background was in model theory. Could you tell us what prompted you to move to doing research in computer science? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I have a Master in logic and foundations of mathematics (with a minor in philosophy) from Utrecht University, with a Master’s thesis on lambda calculus, and a PhD in logic and foundations of mathematics from the University of Minnesota, with a PhD thesis on definability theory (a cross between recursion theory and set theory) entitled "<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0099378" target="_blank">Filters and ultrafilters over definable subsets of admissible ordinals</a>". Returning from the US, I got a job teaching undergraduate maths at Delft University. But I wanted getting into research, and meeting <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.a.bergstra/" target="_blank">Jan Bergstra</a> he said there were lots of opportunities in computer science research, not in maths. Writing a paper with him and <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jwk/" target="_blank">Jan Willem Klop</a> on term rewriting systems would qualify me, he said. So it happened, and I got a postdoc at CWI in the framework of the ESPRIT I project. I kept on doing maths, but it was called computer science. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> I have heard that you were recruited by Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop to work within their group at the CWI, and that <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/" target="_blank">Rob van Glabbeek</a> joined the team soon after you. Could you tell us about the environment at the CWI at that time? It must have been a very exciting place to be with all the activity related to work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_communicating_processes#:~:text=The%20algebra%20of%20communicating%20processes,process%20algebras%20or%20process%20calculi." target="_blank">ACP</a> and related topics. </p><p><b>Jos:</b> It was a heady period. The group of Jan and Jan Willem was expanding rapidly on EU money, with me, Rob van Glabbeek and <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~fvaan/" target="_blank">Frits Vaandrager.</a> I really liked ACP and doing universal algebra. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> What was your first paper in CS about? Which paper from your initial period at the CWI are you most proud of? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> My first paper was "<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225810594_Term_rewriting_systems_with_priorities" target="_blank">On term rewriting, Term rewriting systems with priorities</a>". I am most proud of my first ACP paper, "<a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2137499/335911.pdf" target="_blank">Syntax and defining equations for an interrupt mechanism in process algebra</a>". This is about adding the priority operator. For axiomatisation, it needed an auxiliary operator that later turned out to be almost optimal. I came up with an axiomatisation, and Jan Bergstra forced me to prove it correct by doing all the critical pairs. I found a small error in pair 101 (of the 102 pairs), corrected it and proved the result correct. This all in a couple of weeks. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Let's move on to the CONCUR project: How did it come about and what was its legacy? I recall that you came to visit <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Matthew.Hennessy/" target="_blank">Matthew Hennessy</a> at the University of Sussex when I was a PhD student there to discuss the CONCUR proposal. How did you become involved in leading such a large and high profile group of researchers so early in your career at the CWI? What was it like to lead the CONCUR project?  <br/></p><p><b>Jos:</b> This is again due to Jan Bergstra: he believes in delegating responsibilities quickly. When the new instrument of Basic Research Action came up in the EU, he wanted a BRA with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare" target="_blank">Hoare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner" target="_blank">Milner </a>and Hennessy. I got the assignment and made a trip to the UK visiting all three, and got all of them on board. The idea of the project was unification, but that did not come about, everyone kept doing their own thing. We did, however, produce excellent papers, including the curious </p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, J.A. Bergstra, C.A.R. Hoare, R. Milner, J. Parrow &amp; R. de Simone, The variety of process algebra. Deliverable ESPRIT Basic Research Action 3006, CONCUR, University of Edinburgh 1991 </p><p><b>Luca:</b> How would you summarize the history of the conference CONCUR? Can it be split into different periods, and if so, what characterizes them? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> CONCUR 90, which was the first CONCUR conference, was organised by BRA CONCUR, but with speakers from all 5 BRA’s in the area of concurrency; in 1991 Milner did not want such a conference to occur in Edinburgh, so Jan Bergstra and I did it again in Amsterdam. Then, we involved <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/ScottSmolka" target="_blank">Scott Smolka</a> for 1992 and after that, it was established, with a steering committee comprised of representatives from the 5 BRAs and Scott. As of 1993, it was firmly established, we found a niche and time period (end of August, beginning of September). All branches of concurrency were involved from the start, and over the years, it shows fashion clearly, for instance in certain years there was a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus" target="_blank">pi-calculus</a>. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> In the 80s and the 90s there were three "schools" in process algebra,     the ACP, CCS, and CSP schools. With the benefit of hindsight, which were heir main contributions? To which extent have they converged? Is this classification still important for current research? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I refer to my paper  <br/></p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2154050/200402.pdf" target="_blank">A brief history of process algebra</a>. Theoretical Computer Science 335 (2/3), 2005, pp. 131-146.  <br/></p><p>I do a comparison in there. In my opinion, the book  <br/></p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, T. Basten and M.A. Reniers, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/process-algebra-equational-theories-of-communicating-processes/0A091BDAA17DA4D3D30FCD6F52E0E6B8" target="_blank">Process Algebra: Equational Theories for Communicating Processes</a>. Cambridge Tract in Theoretical Computer Science 50, Cambridge University Press 2010  <br/></p><p>has the unification, presenting all three in the same framework. However, process algebra is out of fashion, so who cares? </p><p><b>Luca:</b>  When did you become interested in supervisory control? What motivated you to apply techniques from process algebra in that research field? Looking at the outcome of that work, both in theory and in practice, that was a very good move! Could you tell us about the position you had in Mechanical Engineering? How did it come about and what was it like to work in that department? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> More than 20 years in the department of computer science, having been dean twice, I got to know the university very well indeed. <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/je-koos-rooda" target="_blank">Koos Rooda</a>, professor of systems engineering at Mechanical Engineering, requested my assistance to get more software engineering into systems engineering, to replace his cooperation with Martin Rem, who became rector. In particular, he was interested in the combination of discrete event reasoning (i.e., process algebra) with the continuous mathematics of systems and control. Having done process algebra with timing and probabilities, I was willing to take up this challenge. Upon his retirement, with the vigorous backing of the dean of Mechanical Engineering at the time, I took over his position. At mid-life, I was ready for a change. I liked the hands-on attitude of mechanical engineering students, who are no good at theory or proofs, but are very good in using mathematics and trying out software tools. But then, I was asked to apply to the vacancy of director of CWI. This was the job I had always wanted. I had enjoyed being dean and doing research management, and CWI is a very prestigious institute with (at that time) very independent management. </p><p> </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Back at CWI: What skills do you think one needs to be the director of such a high-profile institute? What was your vision for the CWI and how much of it did you manage to achieve? What role do you think the CWI can/should have in the coming decade and beyond? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> The most important skill is hiring those early career scientists that grow out to become top scientists. Internally, you have to manage your key personnel, operating by consensus and compromise. Externally, you have to find your way in national science politics and always justify your existence. The growing tension between Dutch universities and Dutch extra-university research institutes has almost defeated me, but I managed to complete my term until retirement, and leave CWI in good shape, to my opinion. I managed to keep the excellent reputation of the institute, and also managed to bring in dynamics, rejuvenation and new subjects. What I did not achieve, is that CWI again becomes a publisher, and publishes diamond journals. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> You have played a role in organizations such as the EATCS, ERCIM and IFIP. Do you think that such societies still play a role today? How do think they should evolve to fulfill their mission? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I do, but they have to keep evolving if they want to stay relevant. It is a pity that the EATCS could not take a role in the open access movement (you certainly made a very good effort!). I think ERCIM is doing ok, but not great. IFIP, I think, has become irrelevant. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> You have been a strong supporter of open access. What is your opinion of the state of play in open access and what do you think we could do to move forward? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> Progress is slow but exists. I am a strong advocate of Plan S, that has really set some things in motion. A key point is that it looks like we can achieve immediate green, and still allow all researchers to submit articles wherever they want. I do not like the way it is going with transformative agreements, you'd think that by now, publishers would be putting all their efforts to become sellers of data analytics services.</p><p><b>Acknowledgements:</b> I thank <a href="https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/" target="_blank">Javier Esparza</a>, the chair of the CONCUR Steering Committee, for contributing some the questions to Jos.  <br/></p></div>

    <title>Simons Institute Gets Another Decade</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/simons-foundation-announces-new-355-million-grant-simons-institute-theory-computing-press">Great news</a> out of the Simons Institute.</p><blockquote><p>The Simons Foundation has ensured a second decade of research and innovation for the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, based at UC Berkeley, through a $35.5 million grant. The grant, which will begin in 2022, after the conclusion of the Simons Institute's first 10 years, will support the Simons Institute's mission and activities through June 2032.</p></blockquote><p>Congrats to Shafi Goldwasser and her team and of course a special thanks to Jim Simons and his foundation for their support for the theory community. </p><p>Time flies. I remember when I was on Team Chicago in the final rounds back in 2011. We lost but the theory community won as Berkeley did the institute well with amazing collaborative spaces, thanks mainly I hear from Alistair Sinclair, and the strong programs and workshops organized by the many volunteers across the theory community. </p><p>The institute started right when I started as a department chair so I never had the opportunity for the true Simons experience, joining for a semester-long program. When I did sneak away for a week at Simons I purposely avoided the workshops for Simons is at its best when strong researchers, connected by one of the programs, just talk, work and socialize together. I joined an amazing collection of complexity theorists to form a rather mediocre pub trivia team.</p><p>Even if you never make it there, the institute has a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SimonsInstitute">collection of videos</a> of its workshops, talks and celebrations. COVID-19 has driven Simons on-line but that just opens up their <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops">workshops</a> and other events to a wider audience.</p><p>Congrats again to the Simons Institute for what it's given to the theory community and to its next dozen years with hopefully many more to follow!</p></div>

    <title>Benchmarks for Subpopulation Shift</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><a class="bbutton" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04859">

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04859">new paper</a>, we develop a
framework for simulating realistic subpopulation shifts between training
and deployment conditions for machine learning models. Evaluating
standard models on the resulting benchmarks reveals that these models
are highly sensitive to such shifts. Moreover, training models to be
invariant to existing families of synthetic data perturbations falls
short of remedying this issue.   </i></p>

<p>Consider what is probably the most prototypical classification task:
distinguishing between pictures of dogs and cats. By now, we have a fairly
established approach to tackling this task. It involves sourcing a set of
(labeled) cat and dog pictures and then training our model on that set.
Intuitively, we understand that for this approach to succeed our training set
has to be sufficiently large and diverse, capturing a variety of real-world
conditions. In particular, one might want to make sure that it contains
representatives of many of the possible breeds of dogs and cats. Is it critical
though that <i>all</i> breeds are represented? That is, if our classifier truly
learns how to distinguish dogs from cats, wouldn’t we expect it to generalize to
unseen breeds as well?</p>

<p>This is just an illustration of a broader challenge: building ML models that are
robust to <i>subpopulation shift</i>, i.e., they are able to generalize to data
subpopulations that were not encountered during training. This notion of
robustness is essential for models to perform reliably in the real world. After
all, we cannot expect our training set to capture all possible subpopulation
variations it can encounter during deployment. (Think of, e.g., differences in
weather/road conditions in the context of self-driving cars, or variability in
diagnostic equipment and patients’s exact characteristics in the
context of medical applications.)</p>

<h2 id="tackling-subpopulation-shifts">Tackling subpopulation shifts</h2>

<p>To make progress on this challenge, we need to first develop a principled way to
measure such robustness (or lack thereof). So, how can we measure the extent to
which our models are robust to such train-test subpopulation shifts?</p>

<p>A natural approach would be to first partition the subpopulations present in data for each class (e.g., dog or cat breeds) into two
disjoint sets: one set that is used for training the model, and one set that is held-out for
evaluation. Then, one can just examine the performance of the model on the held-out data.</p>

<p>This setup ensures that the actual task remains unchanged between
training and testing—i.e., classifying inputs into the original
classes (“dog” vs. “cat”). Therefore, the observed performance can give
us a sense how well that model will perform when exposed to novel data
subpopulations encountered during deployment.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in implementing this strategy, however, is that
standard datasets do not contain annotations that are fine-grained
enough to identify the subpopulations of interest. Also, rectifying this
issue by collecting additional human annotations would be complicated
(not every class lends itself to identifying a natural and explicit
subpopulation structure) and costly (due to the scale of
state-of-the-art classification datasets).</p>

<p>In this post, we will outline an approach that circumvents some of the
aforementioned issues, allowing us to automatically construct a suite of
subpopulation shift benchmarks of varying difficulty, with minimal effort.</p>

<h2 id="the-breeds-methodology">The <span class="sc">Breeds</span> methodology</h2>

<p>Our approach is to <i>simulate</i> class subpopulations by grouping semantically
similar classes into <i>super</i>classes (e.g., aggregate the 100+ dog breed classes
in ImageNet into a “dog superclass”). Then, considering the classification task
over such superclasses enables us to repurpose the original dataset annotations
as explicit indicators of the subpopulation structure. Note that this new task
is entirely based on <em>existing</em> datasets, so we do not need to deal with,
gathering new data points or annotations, hence avoiding the additional biases
these might introduce (see our previous posts on
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias">dataset replication</a> and
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/benchmarks">annotation pipelines</a>).</p>

<p>After this task restructuring, we can train our model on the resulting
superclass classification task while having full control over  which
subpopulations are included in training and which subpopulations are encountered
during testing. For example, if our original dataset contains classes: Labrador,
Husky, Tabby cat, and Persian cat, which we group into “dog” and “cat”
superclasses as [Labrador, Husky] and [Tabby cat, Persian cat], we can train a
model on the Labrador vs. Tabby cat task and test how well it can distinguish
Huskies from Persian cats. (Note that this framework can also naturally
incorporate milder subpopulation shifts where test subpopulations are
underrepresented, but not entirely missing, in the training set—see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02060">here</a>.) Pictorially:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" id="pipeline" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/pipeline.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Overview of the <span class="sc">Breeds</span>
methodology.</strong> We group classes into superclasses and derive a
classification task over superclasses. Then we randomly assign each of the
original classes to be used for training (source) or evaluation (target) of the
model, thus inducing a subpopulation shift between training and testing
conditions. By controlling the granularity of the superclass grouping we can
construct shifts of varying severity.</div>

<p>The dog vs. cat breeds example served as the motivation for our
framework (as well as its name), but the underlying principle is quite
general. In fact, we can (and do) apply this methodology to group
together a wide variety of classes that share similar characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="obtaining-meaningful-superclasses">Obtaining meaningful superclasses</h3>

<p>In order for such a “breeds” benchmark be tractable from an image classification
viewpoint, we need to ensure that the classes we group together into
superclasses actually share visual characteristics. (After all, we cannot expect
a model to generalize across an arbitrary train-test partition of classes).
Ideally, we would group dataset classes based on a hierarchy that captures their
<i>visual</i> similarity—thus, allowing us to construct superclasses of varying
granularity (which would lead to benchmarks of varying difficulty).</p>

<div class="footnote">     
  <strong>Note:</strong> Having access to a class
hierarchy is a relatively mild requirement. Most of the popular vision datasets
are already equipped with such a hierarchy (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet, PASCAL-
VOC and OpenImages). Even in cases where an explicit class hierarchy is missing,
it is more likely than not that the dataset classes obey some natural groupings
which could be recovered either manually, or with the assistance of proxies such
as word embeddings. 
</div>

<p>From this point of view, the ImageNet dataset is a natural candidate for
building our benchmarks—aside from its breadth and scale, it also comes
equipped with a class hierarchy, i.e., the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet hierarchy</a>. However,
taking a closer look at that hierarchy reveals a few important shortcomings: (a)
classes are grouped together based on abstract (as opposed to visual)
characteristics (e.g., “umbrella” and “roof” are both “coverings); (b) nodes at
the same level of the hierarchy can have vastly different granularity (e.g.,
“street sign” and “living thing”), not necessarily mirroring the specificity of
the class itself; and (c) the hierarchy is not a tree (e.g., “bread” is in both
“starches” and “baked goods”). Grouping ImageNet classes based on this hierarchy
would thus result in poorly calibrated tasks.</p>

<p>All these shortcomings stem from the fact that WordNet is a <em>semantic</em> rather
than <em>visual</em> hierarchy—words are grouped together based on their meaning
rather than the visual appearance of the objects they correspond to. To remedy
this, we performed extensive edits to the existing ImageNet class hierarchy to
better capture visual object similarity. Specifically, we removed all abstract
nodes (e.g., “covering”) and calibrated the depth to ensure that nodes at the
same level have comparable granularity (by adding/removing redundant
nodes)—the modified hierarchy can be explored 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/breeds_class_hierarchy">here</a> or through the
notebook we provide in the <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/BREEDS-Benchmarks">code repo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-breeds-benchmarks">Constructing <span class="sc">Breeds</span> benchmarks</h3>

<p>Equipped with such a modified class hierarchy, we can construct subpopulation
shift benchmarks of varying difficulty in an essentially automated manner: we
simply choose a level of the hierarchy and treat each node at that level as a
superclass. The original dataset classes that are descendants of this node then
become the subclasses or “breeds”. These subclasses are then split
<em>randomly</em> into two groups—one of these is used to sample
training data points (<em>source domain</em>), and the other to sample test data points
(<em>target domain</em>).</p>

<div class="footnote">     
  <strong>Note:</strong> Using our methodology, one can also precisely
  control the extent to which the source and target domain subpopulations 
  differ—i.e., instead of random splits one 
  could make the splits more/less 
  adversarial)—see our paper for details.
</div>
<p>By varying the level in the hierarchy of the superclasses we
select, we can create an entire suite of benchmarks. For our analysis below, we
will use the following benchmarks.

</div>

<h3 id="validating-the-benchmarks-using-human-annotation">Validating the benchmarks using human annotation</h3>

<p>As already discussed, to ensure that the benchmarks we create are actually
meaningful, we need to validate that the superclasses therein contain visually
coherent subpopulations, so that good cross-subpopulation generalization is
possible. To this end, we leverage human annotators to measure the robustness of
humans to the subpopulation shifts encapsulated by (simplified versions of)
<span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks. Specifically, we randomly pick pairs of superclasses and then show
annotators two groups of images corresponding to samples from the source domain
of the respective superclasses. Then, we present them with random images from
the target domain of <em>both</em> superclasses (mixed together) and ask them to assign
these images to one of the two groups (superclasses). Crucially, we do <em>not</em>
reveal to the annotators the name of either of the superclasses. Here is what
the task looks like:</p>

<div>
  <img class="bigimg" id="pipeline" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/task.png" width="80%"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Illustration of subpopulation shift task presented 
to annotators.</strong> Annotators are shown random images from the source
domains of two random superclasses. Then, they are presented with images from
the target domains of these superclasses and asked to assign them into the
correct superclass.</div>

<p>If our superclasses are indeed well-calibrated for the task, annotators should
be able to associate new images with the correct group. That is, images from the
target domain of a superclass should be more similar to the source domain of the
<em>same</em> superclass, rather than the other one. Also, to establish a baseline, we
repeat the same experiment while asking the annotators to classify unseen
samples from the source domain (i.e., when there is no subpopulation shift).</p>

<p>So how well do our annotators perform?</p>

<div id="anno"> 
<canvas height="35%" id="bar" width="100%"/>

<div class="footnote"> <strong>Annotator performance on <span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks.</strong> Annotators are quite robust to subpopulation shift.
Their ability to identify the correct superclass does not change significantly
between the source and the target domain, especially for the
<span class="sc">Living-17</span> and <span class="sc">Entity-30</span>
benchmarks. </div>

<p>As we can see, the difference in average annotator accuracy (in terms of
classifying unseen inputs into the correct group/superclass) between the source
and target domain is quite small. This suggests that the superclasses do indeed
correspond to visually meaningful object groupings, and, moreover, that humans
are quite robust to the distribution shifts captured within the <span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks.
Let us now compare this drop to the one that our models incur.</p>

<h3 id="subpopulation-robustness-of-standard-models">Subpopulation robustness of standard models</h3>

<p>To assess whether standard models are sensitive to subpopulation shifts, we

domain and then measure model performance on data from the target domain.
Specifically, we will plot the <em>target accuracy</em> of each model as a function of
its <em>source accuracy</em>.</p>

<p>Across the board, all models suffer a clear drop in performance under
subpopulation shifts—-accuracy drops by more than 30 percentage points between
the source and target domains. This indicates that the features models rely on
to perform well are somewhat specific to the subpopulations they encounter
during training, and thus tend to lose their predictive power even under
seemingly mild shifts in test-time subpopulations. 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/feed.xml#anno_model" id="reveal_model">[CLICK THIS to compare model
performance to that of human annotators.]</a></p>

<p>A natural question to ask then is: can these models be adapted to the target
domain by simply re-training their last layer with data from this domain? 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/feed.xml#std_ft" id="reveal_retrain">[CLICK THIS to add the re-training 
line.]</a> The answer seems to be nuanced. On one hand,
re-training significantly increases model performance, indicating that the
representations learned in the earlier layers of these (source-domain trained)
models are useful also for the subpopulations in the target domain. On the other
hand, these representations still fall short of what one would hope for—the
target accuracy post retraining remains much lower than that of a model trained
directly on the target domain.</p>

<h3 id="robustness-interventions">Robustness interventions</h3>

<p>Given that standard models turned out to be very sensitive to subpopulation
shifts, one might hope that applying a number of existing robustness
interventions—designed to increase model robustness to specific synthetic
perturbations—might change this state of affairs. To assess this, we
evaluate the subpopulation shift robustness of classifiers that have been
trained: (a) via <a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_opt_pt1">robust optimization</a> against L2 adversaries of
different epsilon; (b) on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">stylized version</a> of ImageNet (relying less on
texture and thus more on shape); and (c) with random noise (Gaussian or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896">Erase</a>).</p>

<p>To control for the significant impact on the standard (source) accuracy that
these methods can have, we focus on  the <em>relative target accuracy</em> of the
resulting models—that is the fraction of accuracy that is preserved in the
target domain (target accuracy over source accuracy).</p>

<div>
  <img class="bigimg" id="intervene" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/intervene.png"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Effect of train-time interventions on subpopulation shift robustness.</strong>
We plot the ratio of the target accuracy to the source accuracy as a function of
the source accuracy. Train-time interventions have small, yet non-trivial,
impact on model robustness.
</div>

<p>We observe that these robustness interventions do have an impact on the target
accuracy of the model. Moreover, even when the resulting models have comparable
source accuracies, their target accuracies can be quite different. For instance,
erase noise improves robustness without particularly impacting source accuracy
(relative to standard models), while adversarially trained models improve
robustness at the expense of source accuracy. Overall, these results indicate
that while existing interventions make models slightly less sensitive to
subpopulation shifts, there is still significant room for improvement.</p>

<p>To obtain a more complete picture, we also measure the performance of the above
models after retraining the final layer with data from the target domain. Again,
our goal is to understand whether the employed training methods lead to
representations that are more general, and can be directly repurposed for the
target domain.</p>

<div>
  <img class="bigimg" id="intervene_ft" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/intervene_ft.png"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Adapting model trained with robustness interventions for subpopulation shift.</strong> We plot model accuracy on the target domain after re-training the last layer on that domain. We can see that adversarially-trained model have significantly better accuracy, in certain cases almost recovering the original source accuracy.
</div>

<p>Interestingly, we see that models trained with erase noise are not better than
standard models after we allow for such fine-tuning. This indicates that the
gain in robustness it provides may not stem from learning better
representations. In contrast, adversarially trained models are significantly
better than other models (including standard ones) after fine-tuning. This is in
line with recent results showing that adversarially trained models are more
suited for transfer learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05869">here</a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">here</a>). At
the same time, models trained on the stylized version of ImageNet are
consistently worse than other models, even relative to models with similar
source accuracy. This could indicate that texture is a particularly useful
feature for this classification task, especially in the presence of
subpopulation shift.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this post, we demonstrate how one can utilize a class
hierarchy to simulate a range of subpopulation shifts within existing
classification datasets. These shifts turn out to pose a challenge for standard
models (seemingly more so than for humans) and this challenge cannot really be
overcome using existing robustness interventions or re-training the last
layer. Thus, there is a need for designing new methods to address this core
robustness requirement. Overall, we believe that subpopulation shifts are an
important piece of the robustness puzzle and we hope that the benchmarks we
develop will serve as a guide for future progress on this front.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-120 |  A Parallel Repetition Theorem for the GHZ Game | 

	Justin Holmgren, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that parallel repetition of the (3-player) GHZ game reduces the value of the game polynomially fast to 0. That is, the value of the GHZ game repeated in parallel $t$ times is at most $t^{-\Omega(1)}$. Previously, only a bound of $\approx \frac{1}{\alpha(t)}$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, was known.

The GHZ game was recently identified by Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen as a multi-player game where all existing techniques for proving strong bounds on the value of the parallel repetition of the game fail. Indeed, to prove our result we use a completely new proof technique. Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen speculated that progress on bounding the value of the parallel repetition of the GHZ game may lead to further progress on the general question of parallel repetition of multi-player games. They suggested that the strong correlations present in the GHZ question distribution represent the ``hardest instance'' of the multi-player parallel repetition problem.

Another motivation for studying the parallel repetition of the GHZ game comes from the field of quantum information. The GHZ game, first introduced by Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, is a central game in the study of quantum entanglement and has been studied in numerous works. For example, it is used for testing quantum entanglement and for device-independent quantum cryptography. In such applications a game is typically repeated to reduce the probability of error, and hence bounds on the value of the parallel repetition of the game may be useful.</summary>
