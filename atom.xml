    <title>Vertex Ordering Algorithms for Graph Coloring Problem</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>Arda Asik, Ibrahim Bugra Demir, Berker Demirel, Baris Batuhan Topal, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kaya:Kamer.html">Kamer Kaya</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11454">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>Graph coloring is a fundamental problem in combinatorics with many
applications in practice. In this problem, the vertices in a given graph must
be colored by using the least number of colors in such a way that a vertex has
a different color than its neighbors. The problem, as well as its different
variants, has been proven to be NP-Hard. Therefore, there are greedy algorithms
in the literature aiming to use a small number of colors. These algorithms
traverse the vertices and color them one by one. The vertex visit order has a
significant impact on the number of colors used. In this work, we investigated
if social network analytics metrics can be used to find this order. Our
experiments showed that when closeness centrality is used to find vertex visit
order, a smaller number of colors is used by the greedy algorithms.

of Dieudonn\'e determinant $\mathop{\rm Det} A$ of \[ A = \sum_{k=1}^m A_k x_k
t^{c_k}, \] where $A_k$ are $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{K}$,
$x_k$ are noncommutative variables, $t$ is a variable commuting $x_k$, $c_k$
are integers, and the degree is considered for $t$. This problem generalizes
noncommutative Edmonds' problem and fundamental combinatorial optimization
problems including the weighted linear matroid intersection problem. It was
shown that $\mathop{\rm deg Det} A$ is obtained by a discrete convex
optimization on a Euclidean building. We extend this framework by incorporating
a cost scaling technique, and show that $\mathop{\rm deg Det} A$ can be
computed in time polynomial of $n,m,\log_2 C$, where $C:= \max_k |c_k|$. We
apply this result to an algebraic combinatorial optimization problem arising
from a symbolic matrix having $2 \times 2$-submatrix structure.

theoretical guarantees on work and depth and coloring quality. The key idea is
to design a relaxation of the vertex degeneracy order, a well-known graph
theory concept, and to color vertices in the order dictated by this relaxation.
This introduces a tunable amount of parallelism into the degeneracy ordering
that is otherwise hard to parallelize. This simple idea enables significant
benefits in several key aspects of graph coloring. For example, one of our
algorithms ensures polylogarithmic depth and a bound on the number of used
colors that is superior to all other parallelizable schemes, while maintaining
work-efficiency. In addition to provable guarantees, the developed algorithms
have competitive run-times for several real-world graphs, while almost always
providing superior coloring quality. Our degeneracy ordering relaxation is of
separate interest for algorithms outside the context of coloring.

    <title>Flip Paths Between Lattice Triangulations</title>

    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><b>Authors: </b>William Sims, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sitharam:Meera.html">Meera Sitharam</a> <br/><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.11292">PDF</a><br/><b>Abstract: </b>The problem of finding a diagonal flip path between two triangulations has
been studied for nearly a century in the combinatorial (topological) setting
and for decades in the geometric setting. In the geometric setting, finding a
diagonal flip path between two triangulations that minimizes the number of
diagonal flips over all such paths is NP-complete. However, when restricted to
lattice triangulations - i.e. triangulations of a finite subset of the integer
lattice, or an affine transformation of this lattice, bounded by a simple,
closed polygon with lattice points as vertices - the problem has a polynomial
time algorithm. Lattice triangulations have been studied for their uses in
discriminant theory, Hilbert's 16th problem, toric varieties, quantum spin
systems, and material science. Our first main result shows that there is a
polynomial-time computable, unique partially-ordered set of diagonal flips such
that there is a bijection between valid linear-orderings of this set and
minimum diagonal flip paths between two lattice triangulations. This provides
an alternative proof of the previously known result, as well as new structural
insights into these diagonal flip paths. Our second main result characterizes
pairs of triangulations, containing sets of edges $E$ and $E'$ respectively,
such that the minimum diagonal flip path between them contains the minimum
number of diagonal flips over all minimum diagonal flip paths between pairs of
triangulations, containing sets of edges $E$ and $E'$ respectively. Remarkably,
all of our results are derived from a simple relationship between edges in
triangulations and Farey sequences.

the graph's vertex set to compute repulsive forces. Here, the efficacy of
forces diminishes with distance: a vertex can effectively only influence other
vertices in a certain radius around its position. Therefore, the algorithm
lends itself to an implementation using search data structures to reduce the
runtime complexity. NVIDIA RT cores implement hierarchical tree traversal in
hardware. We show how to map the problem of finding graph layouts with
force-directed methods to a ray tracing problem that can subsequently be
implemented with dedicated ray tracing hardware. With that, we observe speedups
of 4x to 13x over a CUDA software implementation.

For the contemporaneous, I maintain that the above is the best monitor setup available to us in 2020. I use the tiny E-ink monitor as much as possible, including now, for my blitz matches on chess.com, and of course for writing and sometimes reviewing papers. But as I mentioned earlier unfortunately for certain bureaucratic tasks that not all of us can skip altogether you just need a bigger monitor with color. So I push a button on the hdmi switch, and the image blasts open on the 30-inch screen, <em>m’illumino d’immenso</em>, and suddenly the mouse feels like the interface from <em>Minority Reports</em>.</p></div>

    <title>Sharp P and the issue of `natural problems'</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> #P was defined by Valiant as a way to pin down that the PERMANENT of a matrix is hard to compute.</p><p>The definition I give is equivalent to the one Valiant gave.</p><p>g is in #P if there exists p a poly and B in P such that</p><p>g(x) = | { y : |y| = p(|x|) and (x,y) \in B } |</p><p>A function f is #P-complete if g is in #P and for all g in #P,  f is poly-Turing reducible to g.</p><p>#SAT is the function that, given a formula, returns the number of satisfying assignments. It is #P-complete by looking at the proof the Cook-Levin Theorem. The reduction of f to #SAT only makes one query to #SAT. A common way to show that #A is #P-complete is to show that SAT \le A with a reduction that preserves the number of solutions. </p><p>Valiant proved that PERM was #P-complete (his reduction only used 1 call to PERM).</p><p>There are problems in P whose #-version is #-P complete: Matching and DNF-SAT are two of them.</p><p>Notice that I defined #SAT directly, not in terms of a poly p and a set B as above. Here is why: if you use poly p and set B one can do obnoxious things like: </p><p>SAT = { phi : exists yz 2n-bits long such that phi(y)=T and z is prime }</p><p>The # version of this definition is not really what I want (though I am sure its #P-complete).</p><p>Valiant (see <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~af1p/Teaching/MCC17/Papers/enumerate.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.math.cmu.edu/~af1p/Teaching/MCC17/Papers/permanent.pdf">here</a>) and Simon (see <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-08342-1_37.pdf">here</a>) showed that  for many known NPC-problems A, #A is #P-complete. They meant NATURAL problems. Is it true for all natural NP-complete problems?</p><p>Unfortunately the statement `All NATURAL NPC problems give rise to #P-complete functions' is hard (impossible?) to state rigorously and hence hard (impossible?) to prove. </p><p>1) Is there a natural A in NP such that #A is NOT #P-complete (under assumptions)?</p><p>2) Are there any theorems that show a large set of NPC problems have #P counterparts? Or are we doomed to, when we want to show some #A is #P-complete, come up with a new proof?</p><p>3) Can one PROVE there are NPC problems A such that #A is NOT #P-complete?

    <title>Bricard’s jumping octahedron</title>
    <summary>The Schönhardt polyhedron is a non-convex octahedron that can be formed from a convex regular octahedron by twisting two opposite faces, stretching and deforming the other faces as you twist. It’s well known for not having any interior diagonals, and for being impossible to subdivide into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices. But long before Erich Schönhardt described it in 1928 in connection with these properties, Raoul Bricard was investigating flexible octahedra, in connection with Cauchy’s theorem on the rigidity of polyhedra. The Schönhardt polyhedron forms an interesting example of flexibility, as I learned from a 1975 collection of lecture notes by Branko Grünbaum on “Lost Mathematics”). I’m not entirely sure that it was known to Bricard (it’s not clear from Bricard’s paper and Grünbaum doesn’t really say so) but it wouldn’t surprise me if it was.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhardt_polyhedron">Schönhardt polyhedron</a> is a non-convex octahedron that can be formed from a convex regular octahedron by twisting two opposite faces, stretching and deforming the other faces as you twist. It’s well known for not having any interior diagonals, and for being impossible to subdivide into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices. But long before Erich Schönhardt described it in 1928 in connection with these properties, Raoul Bricard was investigating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricard_octahedron">flexible octahedra</a>, in connection with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_theorem_(geometry)">Cauchy’s theorem on the rigidity of polyhedra</a>. The Schönhardt polyhedron forms an interesting example of flexibility, as I learned from a 1975 collection of lecture notes by Branko Grünbaum on “<a href="https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/15700/Lost%20Mathematics.pdf?fterence=1">Lost Mathematics</a>”). I’m not entirely sure that it was known to Bricard (it’s not clear from Bricard’s paper and Grünbaum doesn’t really say so) but it wouldn’t surprise me if it was.</p>

<p>Cauchy’s theorem states that the shape of every convex polyhedron is uniquely determined by the shapes and connectivity of its faces. There can be no other convex polyhedron that has faces of the same shape, connected in the same way. But in some cases (like the regular icosahedron) you can dent some of the faces in to make a different, non-convex polyhedron with the same face shapes and connectivity. So Cauchy’s theorem doesn’t immediately extend to non-convex polyhedra. In fact, certain non-convex “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_polyhedron">flexible polyhedra</a>” can deform continuously into an infinite range of shapes, without changing the shape or connectivity of their faces. Bricard’s octahedra are self-crossing examples and later investigators found examples without self-crossings.</p>

<p>But Grünbaum describes a different, non-self-crossing non-convex octahedron, the “jumping octahedron”. Rather than having a continuous range of rigid shapes, it has exactly two shapes, both of which have faces of the same shapes and connectivity. Unlike the example of the regular icosahedron and dented icosahedron, the two shapes have dihedral angles that are convex and concave in the same places. If you make this polyhedron out of perfectly rigid faces, with hinged connections at their edges, it could only be in one or the other of its two shapes: you wouldn’t be able to get it to the other shape without taking it apart and rebuilding it. But if you make it out of a material that’s stiff enough to hold its shape but flexible enough to deform a little, you can make a model that jumps or snaps from one shape to the other when you twist it. If you deform it a little out of shape, it will snap back to the nearest of its two valid shapes. Here’s one I made very roughly from some light cardstock and transparent tape, in its two shapes, one with only slightly-concave long diagonals down its sides and the other much more twisted and folded up:</p>

<div><table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tbody><tr style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
<td style="padding: 10px;"><img alt="Jumping octahedron" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/jumping-octahedron/1-m.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" width="315"/></td>
<td style="padding: 10px;"><img alt="Jumping octahedron" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/jumping-octahedron/2-m.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" width="315"/></td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>

<p>My model makes an interesting squelchy sound when I twist it from the more upright shape to the more twisted one, because these two shapes have different volumes and the air has to get out through the cracks between the faces. If I had perfectly sealed all these cracks, the pressure change would prevent it from changing shape. This change in volume is a big contrast from the Bricard octahedra and other continuously-flexible polyhedra, which must maintain constant volume as they flex.</p>

<p>The net I folded it from looks like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Net for jumping octahedron" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/jumping-octahedron-net.svg"/></p>

<p>It’s in two parts in order to make the seams of my model be symmetric, but also that way it fits better onto a single sheet of paper or card. It consists of two equilateral-triangle faces (the faces at the top and bottom of the model shown above) and six identical obtuse triangles on the sides. In my net and model, these triangles are isosceles, but that’s not important. The important part is that, if one of these triangles is projected onto the line between it and the equilateral triangle, its projected length is slightly more than the length of the connecting edge (because it’s an obtuse triangle) but not too long: longer by a factor strictly between one and</p>

\[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\approx 1.07735.\]

<p>If you make the projection too short (with a right or acute side triangle shape) then it will not have two different shapes that maintain the same faces and convex-concave relation at each dihedral. If you make the projection too long, then you won’t be able to put it together at all while keeping all the faces flat. An explanation for some of this behavior can be seen from the diagram below, which shows the bottom equilateral triangle and one of the obtuse side triangles of the polyhedron, flattened out into a single plane, from a top view.</p>

<p>If you fold these two triangles on their connecting edge, keeping the bottom equilateral triangle fixed but lifting the obtuse triangle into space, then the outer vertex of the obtuse triangle will rotate through a semicircle, but the plane of this semicircle is perpendicular to the plane of view of the diagram, so in top view it just looks like a line, the red line in the diagram. The edge along which the two triangles are attached is the axis of rotation, so it’s perpendicular to the semicircle of rotation and to the projected red line. If you fold all three edges of the bottom equilateral triangle at equal angles, then by symmetry the tips of the three folded obtuse triangles will form another equilateral triangle, and the size of this equilateral triangle will depend on the fold angle. If the vertices of this second equilateral triangle project to points on the yellow circle (the circumcircle of the bottom equilateral triangle) then this triangle will have exactly the correct size to attach the top face. This is only possible when the vertex of the obtuse triangle in the drawing is folded to a point that projects to of the two crossings of the red line and the yellow circle. The two fold angles for which this happens give the two shapes of the jumping octahedron.</p>

<p>The constraint that the side triangles be obtuse is what is needed to make the two crossing points of the red line and the circle be in the same arc of the circle relative to the vertices of the bottom equilateral triangle. The constraint that their projected length should be only a little bit longer than the side length of the equilateral triangle is what is needed to make the red line cross the circle at all. So these two constraints are necessary to make the jumping octahedron work. There’s one more necessary constraint: the height of the obtuse triangle above the edge connecting it to the equilateral triangle has to be large enough to reach both of the crossing points of the red line. When I started to make the model I was worried about a different geometric constraint: maybe the twisted state of the model is so twisted that its inner folded parts cross each other near the center of the model? But that can’t happen. If it did happen, the projected view of the model would have the side triangles folded into a position where they cover the center of the yellow circle. But that would mean that the top triangle’s vertices are too far around the yellow circle, past the point where the farthest point of the red line can cross.</p>

<h2>1. A <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/stat-quantum2.pdf">paper</a> with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham on the Statistics of Google’s experiment</h2>
<p>Yosef Rinott, Tomer Shoham and Gil Kalai:  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/stat-quantum2.pdf">Statistical aspects of the quantum supremacy demonstration</a>, (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05177">arXive</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The notable claim of quantum supremacy presented by Google’s team in 2019 consists of demonstrating the ability of a quantum circuit to generate, albeit with considerable noise, bitstrings from a distribution that is considered hard to simulate on classical computers. Verifying that the generated data is indeed from the claimed distribution and assessing the circuit’s noise level and its fidelity is a purely statistical undertaking.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The objective of this paper is to explain the relations between quantum computing and some of the statistical aspects involved in demonstrating quantum supremacy in terms that are accessible to statisticians, computer scientists, and mathematicians.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Starting with the statistical analysis in Google’s demonstration, which we explain, we study various estimators of the fidelity, and different approaches to testing the distributions generated by the quantum computer. We propose different noise models, and discuss their implications. A preliminary study of the Google data, focusing mostly on circuits of 12 and 14 qubits is discussed throughout the paper.</em></span></p></blockquote>
<p>I am greatly enjoying working with Yosi and Tomer, and I hope to devote a special post to the very interesting statistics of the Google supremacy experiment.</p>

<h2>2. My paper <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/laws-blog2.pdf">The Argument against Quantum Computers, the Quantum Laws of Nature, and Google’s Supremacy Claims</a></h2>
<p>Here is how the paper concludes</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Over the past four decades, the very idea of quantum computation has led to many advances in several areas of physics, engineering, computer science, and mathematics. I expect that the most important application will eventually be the understanding of the impossibility of quantum error-correction and quantum computation. Overall, the debate over quantum computing is a fascinating one, and I can see a clear silver lining: major advances in human ability to simulate quantum physics and quantum chemistry are expected to emerge if quantum computational supremacy can be demonstrated and quantum computers can be built, but also if quantum computational supremacy cannot be demonstrated and quantum computers cannot be built.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Some of the insights and methods characteristic of the area of quantum computation might be useful for classical computation of realistic quantum systems – which is, apparently, what nature does.</em></span></p></blockquote>

<h2>3. My Dec 2019 surprise lecture and the panel discussion</h2>
<p>My Dec  19 2019 (B.C.) surprise lecture at the mathematics of quantum computing school and the afternoon panel on the same day. It turned out that the lecture was videotaped. The slides can be seen in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/the-google-quantum-supremacy-demo/">this post</a>. Remarkably, social distancing was pioneered by the session chair toward the end of the lecture (while not justified in that case).</p>
<p/>
<p>Here once again again is <a href="https://youtu.be/_Yb7uIGBynU">the link for the panel discussion on quantum supremacy</a> of the same day (<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/12/27/the-google-quantum-supremacy-demo/">reviewed here</a>) . Here is a quote of mine from the panel.</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Of course, it is important to think what are the implications of quantum supremacy, is it useful? what does it say on the extended Church-Turing thesis? on prospects for quantum error-correction and universal quantum computers? etc. but I think that in the next few years one thing that we need to also concentrate on is the following question: Is the Google experiment correct? Is this a correct scientific verification of quantum supremacy?</span></em></p></blockquote>

    <title>TR20-127 |  $k$-Forrelation Optimally Separates Quantum and Classical Query Complexity | 

	Nikhil Bansal, 

	Makrand Sinha</title>
    <summary>Aaronson and Ambainis (SICOMP '18) showed that any partial function on $N$ bits that can be computed with an advantage $\delta$ over a random guess by making $q$ quantum queries, can also be computed classically with an advantage $\delta/2$ by a randomized decision tree making ${O}_q(N^{1-\frac{1}{2q}}\delta^{-2})$ queries. Moreover, they conjectured the $k$-Forrelation problem --- a partial function that can be computed with $q = \lceil k/2 \rceil$ quantum queries --- to be a suitable candidate for exhibiting such an extremal separation. 
    
     We prove their conjecture by showing a tight lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}_k(N^{1-1/k})$ for the randomized query complexity of $k$-Forrelation, where the advantage $\delta = 1/\mathrm{polylog}^k(N)$ and $\widetilde{\Omega}_k$ hides $\mathrm{polylog}^k(N)$ factors. Our proof relies on classical Gaussian tools, in particular, Gaussian interpolation and Gaussian integration by parts, and in fact, shows a more general statement, that to prove lower bounds for $k$-Forrelation against a family of functions, it suffices to bound the $\ell_1$-weight of the Fourier coefficients at levels $k, 2k, 3k, \ldots, (k-1)k$ for functions in the family.</summary>

<p>
Robert Reckhow with his advsior Stephen Cook famously started the formal study of the complexity of proofs with their 1979 <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sacook/homepage/cook_reckhow.pdf">paper</a>. They were interested in the length of the shortest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_complexity">proofs</a> of propositional statements. Georg Kreisel and others may have looked at proof length earlier, but one of the key insights of Reckhow and Cook is that low level propositional logic is important.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might look at the complexity of proofs.</p>
<p>
Cook and Reckhow were motivated by issues like: How hard is it to prove that a graph has no clique of a certain size? Or how hard to prove that some program halts on all inputs of length <img alt="{n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n}"/>? All of these questions ask about the length of proofs in a precise sense. Proofs have been around forever, back to Euclid at least, but Cook and Reckhow were the first to formally study the lengths of proofs. </p>
<p>
They were not directly interested in actual proofs. The kind you can find in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/archive/math">arXiv</a> or in a math journal, or at a conference—online or not. The kind that are in their paper.<br/>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/08/19/logical-complexity-of-proofs/paper-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-17432"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17432" height="60" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/paper.png?w=300&amp;h=60" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>We are talking today about these types of proofs. Not proofs that graphs have cliques. But proofs that a no planar graph can have a <img alt="{5}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{5}"/> clique. </p>

<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proofs </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Proofs are what we strive to find ever day. They the coin that measures progress in a mathematical field like complexity theory. We do sometimes work out examples, sometimes do computations to confirm conjectures on small examples, sometimes consider analogies to other proofs. But mostly we want to understand proofs. We want to create new ones and understand others proofs. </p>
<p>
Years ago when studying the graph isomorphism problem, I did some extensive computations for the random case. That is for the case of isomorphism for a random dense graphs against a worst case other graph. The computations helped me improve my result. It did not yield a proof, of course, but helped me realize that a certain lemma could be improved from a bound <img alt="{\log n}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\log n}"/> to <img alt="{O(1)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{O(1)}"/>.

</p><p/><h2> Proofs Complexity </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There are several measures of complexity for proofs. One is the length. Long proofs are difficult to find, difficult to write up, difficult to read, and difficult to check. Another less obvious measure is the logical structure of a proof. What does this mean?</p>
<p>
Our idea is that a proof can be modeled by a formula from propositional logic. The <img alt="{P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P}"/> is what we are trying to prove and the letters <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and so on are for statements we already know.  </p>
<li>
<img alt="{(A \rightarrow P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28A+%5Crightarrow+P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(A \rightarrow P)}"/>  This is a direct proof. <p/>
</li><li>
<img alt="{(\neg P \rightarrow \neg A)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cneg+P+%5Crightarrow+%5Cneg+A%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{(\neg P \rightarrow \neg A)}"/>  This is a proof by contradiction. <p/>
</li><li>
<img alt="{( A \vee \neg A \rightarrow P)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28+A+%5Cvee+%5Cneg+A+%5Crightarrow+P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{( A \vee \neg A \rightarrow P)}"/>  This is proof that uses a statement <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> that may be true or false. <p/>
<p>
The last is a slight cheat, we use <img alt="{A \vee \neg A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cvee+%5Cneg+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A \vee \neg A}"/> to stand for a kind of axiom. A perfect example is from number theory. Let <img alt="{\pi(X)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi(X)}"/> be the number of primes less than <img alt="{x}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x}"/> and the function <img alt="{li(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bli%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{li(x)}"/> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Logarithmic_integral_function&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1">logarithmic function</a>. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  li(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++li%28x%29+%3D+%5Cint_0%5Ex+%5Cfrac%7Bdt%7D%7B%5Cln+t%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  li(x) = \int_0^x \frac{dt}{\ln t}. "/></p>
<p>The prime number <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem">theorem</a> says that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) = li(x) + E(x), " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+%3D+li%28x%29+%2B+E%28x%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) = li(x) + E(x), "/></p>

It was noted that <img alt="{li(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bli%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{li(x)}"/> is larger than <img alt="{\pi(x)}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pi(x)}"/> for known values.

<p>be always true? If so this would be an interesting inequality. In 1914 John Littlewood famously <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/2SUrpE8NK6sC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=John+Littlewood+pi+nd+li">proved</a> that this was not true: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> If the Riemann Hypothesis is true: 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+-+li%28x%29+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) "/></p>
<p>is infinitely often positive and negative. If the Riemann Hypothesis is false: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+-+li%28x%29+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) "/></p>
</em><p><em>is infinitely often positive and negative. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Thus he proved that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi%28x%29+-+li%28x%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pi(x) - li(x) "/></p>
<p>is infinitely often positive and negative whether the the Riemann is true or not. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Proofs in Trouble </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
A sign of a proof in danger is, in my opinion, is not just the length. A better measure I think is the logical flow of proof. I know of no actual proof that uses this structure: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ((A \vee C) \rightarrow (B \vee C)) " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28A+%5Crightarrow+B%29+%5Crightarrow+%28%28A+%5Cvee+C%29+%5Crightarrow+%28B+%5Cvee+C%29%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow ((A \vee C) \rightarrow (B \vee C)) "/></p>
<p>Do you? Even if your proof is only a few lines or even pages, if the high level flow was the above tautology I would be worried. </p>
<p>
Another example is <img alt="{P \rightarrow P}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%5Crightarrow+P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{P \rightarrow P}"/>. This of course is a circular proof. It seems hard to believe we would actually do this, but it has happen. The key is that no one says: I will assume the theorem to prove it. The flaw is disguised better than that.</p>
<p>
I cannot formally define this measure. Perhaps it is known, but I do think that it would be an additional measure. For actual proofs, ones we use every day, perhaps it would be valuable. I know I have looked at an attempted proof of X and noticed the logical flow in this sense was too complex. So complex that it was wrong. The author of the potential proof was me. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Is this measure, the logical flow of a proof, of any interest? </p>

    <title>Moment Multicalibration for Uncertainty Estimation</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This blog post is about<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037" target="_blank"> a new paper</a> that I'm excited about, which is joint work with <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~chrjung/" target="_blank">Chris Jung</a>,<a href="https://economics.sas.upenn.edu/people/changhwa-lee" target="_blank"> Changhwa Lee</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/malleshpai/">Mallesh Pai</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/quaerereverum9/">Ricky Vohra</a>. <div><br/></div><div>Suppose you are diagnosed with hypertension, and your doctor recommends that you take a certain drug to lower your blood pressure. The latest research, she tells you, finds that the drug lowers diastolic blood pressure by an average of 10 mm Hg. You remember your statistics class from college, and so you ask about confidence intervals. She looks up the paper, and tells you that it reports a 95% confidence interval of [5, 15]. How should you interpret this? </div><div><br/></div><div>What you might naively hope is that [5, 15] represents a <i>conditional prediction interval</i>. If you have some set of observable features $x$, and a label $y$ (in this case corresponding to your decrease in diastolic blood pressure after taking the drug), a 95% conditional prediction interval would promise that:</div><div>$$\Pr_y [y \in [5, 15] | x] \geq 0.95$$</div><div><br/></div><div>In other words, a conditional prediction interval would promise that given all of your observed features, <i>over the unrealized/unmeasured randomness of the world</i>, there is a 95% chance that your diastolic blood pressure will decrease by between 5 and 15 points. </div><div><br/></div><div>But if you think about it, coming up with a conditional prediction interval is essentially impossible in a rich feature space. If $x$ contains lots of information about you, then probably there was nobody in the original study population that exactly matched your set of features $x$, and so we have no information at all about the conditional distribution on $y$ given $x$ --- i.e. no samples at all from the distribution over which our coverage probability supposedly holds! So how can you expect any sort of promise at all? There are two typical ways around this difficulty. </div><div><br/></div><div>The first is to make heroic assumptions about the data generation process. For example, if we assume that the world looks like an ordinary least squares model, and that there is a linear relationship between $y$ and $x$, then we can form a confidence region around the parameters of the model, and from that derive prediction intervals. But these prediction intervals are not valid if the model fails to hold, which it inevitably will. </div><div><br/></div><div>The second is to give up on conditional prediction intervals, and instead give <i>marginal prediction intervals</i>. This is what the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3188" target="_blank">conformal prediction</a> literature aims to do. A marginal prediction interval looks quite similar to a conditional prediction interval (at least syntactically), and promises:</div><div>$$\Pr_{(x,y)} [y \in [5, 15] ] \geq 0.95$$</div><div><br/></div><div>Rather than conditioning on your features $x$, a marginal prediction interval averages over all people, and promises that 95% of people who take the drug have their diastolic blood pressure lowered by between 5 and 15 points. But the semantics of this promise are quite different than that of a conditional prediction interval. Because the average is now taken over a large, heterogeneous population, very little is promised to <i>you</i>. For example, it might be that for patients in your demographic group (e.g. middle aged women with Sephardic Jewish ancestry and a family history of diabetes) that the drug is actually expected to raise blood pressure rather than lower it. Because this subgroup represents less than 5% of the population, it is entirely consistent with the marginal prediction interval being correct. Of course, if you are lucky, then perhaps someone has conducted a study of people from this demographic group and has computed marginal prediction intervals over it! But what if there are multiple different groups that you are a member of, over which the results seem to conflict? For example, you might also have a low BMI value and have unusually good cholesterol readings --- features of a group for which the drug works unusually well. Which uncertainty estimate should you trust, if you are a member of both groups? </div><div><br/></div><div>These concerns actually arise already when we think about the semantics of mean estimations ("the expected drop in blood pressure amongst patients who take this drug is 10 mm Hg"). Ideally, if you were a patient with features $x$, then 10 would be an estimate of $\mathbb{E}[y | x]$. But just as with uncertainty estimation, in a large feature space, we typically have no information about the distribution on $y$ conditional on $x$ (because we have never met anyone exactly like <i>you</i> before), and so instead what we have is just an estimate of $\mathbb{E}[y]$ --- i.e. averaging over people. If you have a method of making predictions $f(x)$ as a function of features $x$, then a standard performance metric is <i>calibration</i> --- which informally asks that for every prediction $p$, amongst all people for whom we predicted $f(x) = p$, the average of the realized labels $y$ should be $p$. Again, estimates of this form promise little to individuals, because they are averages over a large and heterogeneous population.   </div><div><br/></div><div>Several years ago, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513" target="_blank">Hebert-Johnson et al.</a> proposed a nice way to interpolate between the (impossible) ideal of offering conditional mean predictions  $f(x) = \mathbb{E}[y | x]$, and the weak guarantee of merely offering calibrated predictions $f$. Roughly speaking, they proposed to specify a very large collection of potentially intersecting groups $G$ (representing e.g. demographic groups like Sephardic Jewish women with a family history of diabetes, and hypertensive patients with low cholesterol and BMI values, etc) and to ask that a trained predictor be <i>simultaniously</i> calibrated on each sufficiently large group in $G$. They showed how to accomplish this using a polynomially sized sample from the underlying distribution, with polynomial running time overhead, on top of the cost of solving learning problems over $G$. </div><div><br/></div><div>In our paper, we --- roughly speaking --- show how to accomplish the same thing, but for variances and other higher moments, in addition to just means. And our "multicalibrated moment estimates" can be used to construct prediction intervals in exactly the same way that real moments of the conditional label distribution could be used. If you used the real (unknown) label distribution moments, you would have gotten conditional prediction intervals. If you use our multi-calibrated moments, you get marginal prediction intervals that are simultaneously valid as averaged over each of the groups in $G$. So, for example, our hypertensive patient above could interpret her prediction interval --- if it was constructed from multicalibrated moment estimates computed from her features --- as an average over each of the demographic groups that she is a member of (so long as they are contained within $G$), and all of those interpretations would be simultaneously valid. </div><div><br/></div><div>I'll leave the details to the paper --- including what exactly we mean by "moment multicalibration". I'll just note that a major difficulty is that variances and higher moments --- unlike expectations --- do not combine linearly, so it is no longer sensible to ask that "amongst all people for whom we predicted variance v, the true variance should be v" --- because even the true conditional label variances do not satisfy this property. But it <i>is </i>sensible to ask that a pair of mean and moment predictions be calibrated in this way: "amongst all people for whom we predicted mean $\mu$ and variance v, the true mean should be $\mu$ and the true variance should be $v$." This is what we call "mean-conditioned moment calibration", and it is satisfied by the true distributional moments. </div><div><br/></div><div>The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037">Moment Multicalibration for Uncertainty Estimation</a>.</div><div><br/></div></div>

    <title>TR20-126 |  Indistinguishability Obfuscation from Well-Founded Assumptions | 

	Aayush  Jain, 

	Huijia Lin, 

	Amit Sahai</title>
    <summary>In this work, we show how to construct indistinguishability obfuscation from subexponential hardness of four well-founded assumptions. We prove:

Let $\tau \in (0,\infty), \delta \in (0,1), \epsilon \in (0,1)$ be arbitrary constants. Assume sub-exponential security of the following assumptions, where $\lambda$ is a security parameter, and the parameters $\ell,k,n$ below are large enough polynomials in $\lambda$:

- The SXDH assumption on asymmetric bilinear groups of a prime order $p = O(2^\lambda)$,

- The LWE assumption over $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ with subexponential modulus-to-noise ratio $2^{k^\epsilon}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the LWE secret,

- The LPN assumption over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with polynomially many LPN samples and error rate $1/\ell^\delta$, where $\ell$ is the dimension of the LPN secret,

- The existence of a Boolean PRG in $\mathsf{NC}^0$ with stretch $n^{1+\tau}$,
 
Then, (subexponentially secure) indistinguishability obfuscation for all polynomial-size circuits exists.</summary>

    <title>TR20-125 |  Efficient reconstruction of depth three circuits with top fan-in two | 

	Gaurav  Sinha</title>
    <summary>In this paper we develop efficient randomized algorithms to solve the black-box reconstruction problem for polynomials(over finite fields) computable by depth three arithmetic circuits with alternating addition/multiplication gates, such that top(output) gate is an addition gate with in-degree $2$. Such circuits naturally compute polynomials of the form $G\times(T_1 + T_2)$, where $G,T_1,T_2$ are product of affine forms computed at the first(addition) layer in the circuit, and polynomials $T_1,T_2$ have no common factors. Rank of such a circuit is defined to be the dimension of vector space spanned by all affine factors of $T_1$ and $T_2$. For any polynomial $f$ computable by such a circuit, $rank(f)$ is defined to be the minimum rank of any such circuit computing it. Our work develops randomized algorithms, which take as input a black-box computing polynomial $f$, with coefficients in a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, exhibiting such a circuit. Here are the results. 

$[$Low rank$]:$ When $5\leq r = rank(f) = O(\log^3 d)$, it runs in time $(nd^{\log^3d}\log |\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$ and outputs a depth three circuit computing $f$ (with high probability), with top addition gate having in-degree $\leq d^{rank(f)}$.

$[$High rank$]:$ When $rank(f) = \Omega(\log^3 d)$, it runs in time $(nd\log |\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$, and with high probability outputs a depth three circuit computing $f$, with top addition gate having in-degree $2$.

Prior to our work, black-box reconstruction for this circuit class was addressed in [Shp07, KS09, Sin16b]. Reconstruction algorithm in [Shp07] runs in time quasi-polynomial in $n,d,|\mathbb{F}|$ and that in [KS09] is quasi-polynomial in $d,|\mathbb{F}|$. Algorithm in [Sin16b] works only for polynomials over characteristic zero fields. Thus ours is the first blackbox reconstruction algorithm for this class of circuits that runs in time polynomial in $\log |\mathbb{F}|$. This problem has been mentioned as an open problem in [GKL12] (STOC 2012). In the high rank case, our algorithm runs in $(nd\log|\mathbb{F}|)^{O(1)}$ time, thereby significantly improving the existing algorithms in [Shp07, KS09].</summary>

    <title>TR20-124 |  A Strong XOR Lemma for Randomized Query Complexity | 

	Joshua Brody, 

	JaeTak Kim, 

	Peem Lerdputtipongporn, 

	Hariharan Srinivasulu</title>
    <summary>We give a strong direct sum theorem for computing $XOR \circ g$.  Specifically, we show that the randomized query complexity of computing the XOR of $k$ instances of $g$ satisfies $\bar{R}_\varepsilon(XOR \circ g)=\Theta(\bar{R}_{\varepsilon/k}(g))$.  This matches the naive success amplification bound and answers a question of Blais and Brody.

As a consequence of our strong direct sum theorem, we give a total function $g$ for which $R(XOR \circ g) = \Theta(k\log(k)R(g))$, answering an open question from Ben-David et al.</summary>

    <title>TR20-123 |  An Optimal Tester for k-Linear | 

	Nader Bshouty</title>
    <summary>A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ is $k$-linear if it returns the sum (over the binary field $F_2$) of $k$ coordinates of the input. In this paper, we study property testing of the classes $k$-Linear, the class of all $k$-linear functions, and $k$-Linear$^*$, the class $\cup_{j=0}^kj$-Linear.
We give a non-adaptive distribution-free two-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear that makes
$$O\left(k\log k+\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$$ queries.
This matches the lower bound known from the literature.

We then give a non-adaptive distribution-free one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear$^*$ that makes the same number of queries and show that any non-adaptive uniform-distribution one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear must make at least $ \tilde\Omega(k)\log n+\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries. The latter bound, almost matches the upper bound $O(k\log n+1/\epsilon)$ known from the literature. We then show that any adaptive uniform-distribution one-sided $\epsilon$-tester for $k$-Linear must make at least $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{k})\log n+\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ queries.</summary>

    <title>Mathematics is not commutative</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In my poll of P vs NP and other issues, one of the questions was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                             <i>Is factoring in P?</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
One of the most interesting answers was<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                            <i> I don't really see why it shouldn't be. - Peter Shor</i><br/>
<i><br/></i>
Recall that Peter Shor proved Factoring is in Quantum-P which lead to intense interest in Quantum Computing.<br/>
<br/>
1) What if factoring was in P and this was shown before Shor's algorithm? Would Shor or someone else have ever proven factoring in quantum P? Would there be as much intense interest in quantum computing as there is now? Perhaps by physicists more than CS people?<br/>
<br/>
2) What if factoring was in P and this was shown before RSA? Where would crypto be now? Zip drives with a googleplex random (or nearly random) bits and more 1-time pads? More lattice based crypto? Or RSA but with larger numbers? This may depend on how good the factoring algorithm is.<br/>
<br/>
3) More generally, how much does the order of events matter for science?<br/>
<br/>
a) If the Banach-Tarski paradox was discovered early on, would we have just tossed out the Axiom of Choice before so much more was build on it? Darling thinks we should toss out AC NOW because of Banach-Tarski.<br/>
<br/>
b) In the model of set theory L you can do ALL of math except some parts of set theory and maybe a few other things (note quite: Harvey Friedman has found some combinatorial statements that need large cardinals to prove). Had L been discovered earlier then could we all now be working in L (except a few people who look at other models, but they are not in the mainstream)? We might know more about L and less about forcing. We would KNOW that AC and CH are true. Or we would think we know.<br/>
<br/>
c) If  Engineers were the first ones to look at SAT and reductions, might they have been content to know that  if SAT \le A then A is probably hard? No need for the Cook-Levin Theorem! And then when someone proved Cook-Levin would the Engineers not really cares since they already knew SAT was hard?<br/>
<br/>d) I can imagine Ramsey's Theorem being discovered much later for some application, or perhaps never being discovered at all.<div><br/></div><div>e) VDW's theorem has so few application, I can imagine it never being discovered. </div><div><br/></div><div>4) There are cases where if A was discovered before B then B has an easy proof, whereas if B was discovered before A, then B has a hard proof. I'll give one example:</div><div><br/></div><div>Given HALT is undecidable, Godel's theorem is easy.</div><div><br/></div><div>Assume HALT is undecidable. </div><div><br/></div><div>Let STAT(e) be the statement M_e(0) does not  halt.</div><div><br/></div><div>There is some e such that M_e(0) does not halt  but ZFC cannot prove this.</div><div><br/></div><div>PROOF: Assume, By Way of Contradiction that for all e such that M_e(0) does not halt,</div><div>ZFC could prove this. Then HALT is DECIDABLE:</div><div><br/>Given e, run M_e(0) and at the same time enumerate all proofs in ZFC. It is guaranteed that</div><div>you will either find M_e(0) halts or a proof that M_e(0) does not halt. Hence you will,</div><div>in finite time, know if M_e(0) halts OR NOT.</div><div><br/></div><div>END OF PROOF</div><div><br/></div><div>Is the sequence of events where HALT is proven undecidable  before Godel's theorem plausible.</div><div>I  think so</div><div><br/></div><div>I INVITE my readers to give there own examples of when Math is not commutative- meaning that</div><div>the order of events matters.</div><div>

    <title>TR20-122 |  Size Bounds on Low Depth Circuits for Promise Majority | 

	Joshua Cook</title>
    <summary>We give two results on the size of AC0 circuits computing promise majority. $\epsilon$-promise majority is majority promised that either at most an $\epsilon$ fraction of the input bits are 1, or at most $\epsilon$ are 0.

First, we show super quadratic lower bounds on both monotone and general depth 3 circuits for promise majority.

For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, monotone depth 3 AC0 circuits for $\epsilon$-promise majority have size 
$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\epsilon^3 n^{2 + \frac{\ln(1 - \epsilon)}{\ln(\epsilon)}}\right)$
         
For any $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, general depth 3 AC0 circuits for $\epsilon$-promise majority have size
$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\epsilon^3 n^{2 + \frac{\ln(1 - \epsilon^2)}{2\ln(\epsilon)}}\right)$

These are the first nontrivial size lower bounds on depth 3 promise majority circuits for $\epsilon &lt; 0.45$.
        
Second, we give both uniform and non-uniform sub-quadratic size constant depth circuits for promise majority.

For integer $k \geq 1$, constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, there exists monotone non uniform AC0 circuits of depth $2 + 2 \cdot k$ computing $\epsilon$-promise majority with size
$\tilde{O}\left(n^{\frac{1}{1 - 2^{-k}}}\right)$

For integer $k \geq 1$, constant $\epsilon \in (0, 1/2)$, there exists monotone uniform AC0 circuit of depth $2 + 2 \cdot k$ computing $\epsilon$-promise majority with size
$n^{\frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^k} + o(1)}$

These circuits are based on incremental improvements to existing depth 3 circuits for promise majority given by Ajtai and Viola combined with a divide and conquer strategy.</summary>

    <title>TR20-121 |  Fractional Pseudorandom Generators from the $k$th Fourier Level | 

	Eshan Chattopadhyay, 

	Jason Gaitonde, 

	Abhishek Shetty</title>
    <summary>In recent work by Chattopadhyay et al.[CHHL19,CHLT19], the authors exhibit a simple and flexible construction of pseudorandom generators for classes of Boolean functions that satisfy $L_1$ Fourier bounds. [CHHL19] show that if a class satisfies such tail bounds at all levels, this implies a PRG whose seed length depends on the quality of these bounds through their innovative random walk framework that composes together fractional PRGs that polarize quickly to the Boolean hypercube. On the other hand, [CHLT19] show that, by derandomizing the analysis of [RT19], just level-two Fourier bounds suffice to construct a pseudorandom generator using their framework; as this is a much weaker assumption on the class, [CHLT19] naturally obtain exponentially worse dependence on the error in the seed length compared to [CHHL19]. Moreover, this derandomization relies on simulating nearly independent Gaussians for the fractional pseudorandom generator, which necessitates the  polynomial dependence on $1/\epsilon$ in each fractional step.
    
    In this work, we attempt to bridge the gap between these two results. Namely, we partially answer an open question by [CHLT19] that nearly interpolates between them. In particular, we show that if one has bounds up to the level-$k$ $L_1$ Fourier mass of a closely related class of functions, where $k&gt;2$, one can obtain improved seed length, the degree to which is determined by how high $k$ can be taken. Our analysis shows that for error $\epsilon=1/\text{poly}(n)$, one needs control at just level $O(\log n)$ to recover the seed length of [CHHL19], without assumptions on the entire tail. We avoid this by providing a simple, alternate analysis of their fractional PRG that instead relies on Taylor's theorem and $p$-biased Fourier analysis to avoid assumptions on the weights of the higher-order terms. This further allows us to show that this framework can handle the class of low-degree polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with slightly worse dependence than the current state-of-the-art, which was not previously known. We hope that this alternate analysis will be fruitful in improving the understanding of this new and powerful framework.</summary>

    <title>Why Privacy Needs Composition</title>
    <summary type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>We’re back!  In our last <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\average-case-dp">post</a> we discussed some of the subtle pitfalls of formulating the assumptions underlying average-case relaxations of differential privacy.  This time we’re going to look at the composition property of differential privacy—that is, the fact that running two independent differentially private algorithms on your data and combining their outputs is still differentially private. This is a key property of differential privacy and is actually closely related to the worst-case nature of differential privacy.</p>

<p>Composition is really the crucial property that has made differential privacy successful. Data analysis doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and the greatest threat to privacy comes from combining multiple pieces of information. These pieces of information can come from a single source that releases detailed statistics, or they could come from separate sources. So it’s critical to understand how the composition of multiple pieces of information can affect privacy.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll give some examples to illustrate why we need composition, and why composition is challenging for average-case relaxations of differential privacy.  Composition is what allows you to design sophisticated differentially private algorithms out of simple building blocks, and it’s what allows one organization to release differentially private statistics without having to understand the entire ecosystem of related information that has been or will be released.  As we’ll see, the challenges of composing average-case privacy guarantees are also very closely related to the subtleties that arise in thinking about the adversary’s beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="differencing-attacks">Differencing Attacks</h3>

<p>Let’s start with a simple example of composition that was alluded to in our last post.</p>

<p>You’ve just started a new job and signed up for the health insurance provided by your employer. Thus, your employer is able to obtain aggregated data from the insurance provider. In particular, your employer can ask “How many of our employees have submitted claims for condition X?”  However, your employer should not be able to find out whether or not <em>you</em> have condition X. 
For concreteness, condition X could be a mental health condition, drug addiction, being pregnant, terminal cancer, or an expensive chronic illness. Each of these could result in some kind of employment discrimination.</p>

<p>The employer may find out that 417 employees have condition X.  That’s OK; on its own, this number reveals very little about whether or not <em>you</em> have condition X, as long as your employer is uncertain about how many employees <em>other than you</em> have condition X.  We can formalize this as some kind of average-case or Bayesian privacy guarantee. Thus the health-insurance company is comfortable releasing this number exactly.  But, yesterday, before you started your job, it also seemed reasonable to allow your employer to ask the exact same question, and yesterday the answer was 416. Thus your employer concludes that you have condition X.</p>

<p>In this example, we see how two pieces of information—the count before you started and the count after you started—each of which seems innocuous on its own can be combined to reveal private information. This is a simple example of a <em>differencing attack</em> and composition is important in part because it prevents these attacks.</p>

<p>This example involves only two pieces of information. However, an attack could combine many pieces of information. For example, the counts could be broken down by sex, race/ethnicity, age, location, and tobacco use.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1">1</a></sup> Additional data may also be obtained from other sources, such as public records, social media, voluntary disclosures, healthcare providers, financial records, employment records, or even illicit sources. The possibilities for attacks grow rapidly as more information is made available. And an employer is only one example of a potential privacy adversary.</p>

<p>The point of this example is that it’s easy to argue that one piece of information is harmless to privacy by making plausible-looking assumptions about the adversary. But this intuition rapidly breaks down once you consider the bigger picture where there are many pieces of information that can complete the puzzle. That’s why we need rigorous methods for understanding privacy and its composition.</p>

<h3 id="quantifying-composition">Quantifying Composition</h3>

<p>How does differential privacy prevent a differencing attack like the one we just discussed? The simplest way is to add a little bit of random noise to each answer. On the first day, instead of releasing the exact count 416, we could release a noisy count, say, 420. Then on the second day, instead of releasing the true count 417, we release another noisy count, say, 415. More precisely, it is common to add noise to counts drawn from a Laplace or Gaussian distribution.  These figures are still close enough to the true values to be useful, but the difference of 1 is now obscured by the noise, so your privacy is protected.</p>

<p>Since the noise is unknown to <em>any</em> potential adversary, it introduces uncertainty that protects the contribution that an individual makes to the count. Taking the difference of two independent noisy counts results in something that is still noisy. However, we must be careful to quantify this privacy guarantee, particularly when it comes to composition.</p>

<p>So, how much noise do we need to add? Let’s go back to the example and suppose the insurance company provides noisy answers where the noise has mean zero and some fixed variance. Your employer could simply ask the same question again and again and each time receive a different noisy answer. Averaging these noisy answers will effectively reduce the variance of the added noise and allow the true answer to be discerned. That leaves us back where we started.</p>

<p>The moral of this revised example is that the scale of the noise must increase if we allow more access to the data, so more questions means more noise in each answer.<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2">2</a></sup> 
Asking the same question again and again may seem silly. There are easy ways to defend against this and some similar attacks. (E.g., by returning the same answer each time instead of generating fresh noise.) But, unfortunately, the underlying phenomenon cannot be circumvented. One of the seminal works that led to differential privacy <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/773153.773173" title="Irit Dinur, Kobbi Nissim. Revealing Information While Preserving Privacy. PODS 2003"><strong>[DN03]</strong></a> showed that there is an inherent tradeoff between the number of questions to be answered and the amount of noise that needs to be added to protect privacy. The general attack is simple: Instead of asking the same query again and again, the attacker asks “random” queries.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3">3</a></sup> This attack only requires basic linear algebra and, importantly, has been demonstrated on real systems <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05692" title="Aloni Cohen, Kobbi Nissim. Linear Program Reconstruction in Practice. 2018."><strong>[CN18]</strong></a>.</p>

<h3 id="adaptive-composition">Adaptive Composition</h3>

<p>There are actually two kinds of composition to consider. There is <strong>non-adaptive composition</strong>, where the questions to be asked are pre-specified and thus independent of the data, and there is <strong>adaptive composition</strong>, where the questions may themselves depend on the results of prior access to the data. Adaptive composition arises in an interactive system where queries are submitted one-by-one and each answer is returned before the next query is submitted. So far, we have really only considered non-adaptive composition.</p>

<p>Any interactive system must take adaptive composition into account.  A natural algorithm which asks adaptive questions is gradient descent for minimizing a function that is determined by private data (e.g., for logistic regression on medical records). At each step, the algorithm asks for a gradient of the function, which depends on the private data, at the current point. Then the point is updated according to the reported gradient and the process repeats. Since the updated point depends on the previous answer, the next gradient computation is adaptive.</p>

<p>The good news is that differential privacy can handle adaptive composition just fine.  However, to handle adaptive composition, it’s really important that you have a worst-case privacy definition like differential privacy. As we will see below, average-case variants of differential privacy cannot handle adaptive composition. Intuitively, the problem is that whatever distributional assumption you might make about the data or query a priori is unlikely to hold when you condition on past interactions with the same data or related data.</p>

<p>Here’s a technical example that shows the difficulty of adaptive composition. Our data \(x \in \{-1,+1\}^n\) is a vector of \(n\) bits, one bit per person.<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4">4</a></sup>  Because we’re considering average-case differential privacy, we’ll model this vector as uniformly random.  Consider the following slightly odd algorithm \(M_2(x,v)\)—it takes a vector \(v \in \{-1,+1\}^n\) from the user, and, if the correlation \(\langle x, v \rangle / n\) between \(v\) and \(x\) is smaller than \(\varepsilon/2\), the query returns \(\emptyset\), but, if the correlation between \(v\) and \(x\) is larger than \(\varepsilon/2\), the query returns the dataset \(x\).  In isolation this algorithm satisfies an average-case version of differential privacy, because if \(n\) is large enough and \(x\) is uniformly random, then it’s very unlikely that the user can guess a vector \(v\) that causes this algorithm to output anything other than \(\emptyset\).  This algorithm may seem contrived; it is a simple stand-in for any algorithm that behaves very well most of the time, but fails completely on some rare inputs.</p>

<p>Now, consider another, more familiar differentially private algorithm called randomized response <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2283137?seq=1" title="Stanley Warner. Randomized Response: A Survey Technique for Eliminating Evasive Answer Bias. Journal of the American Statistical Association 1965."><strong>[W65]</strong></a>.  For those not familiar, this algorithm \(M_1(x)\) outputs a vector \(y \in \{-1,+1\}^n\), where \(y_i\) is slightly more likely to be \(x_i\) than \(-x_i\).  Specifically, we set \(y_i = x_i\) with probability \((1+\varepsilon)/2\) and \(y_i = - x_i\) otherwise. This satisfies \(\log(\frac{1+\varepsilon}{1-\varepsilon})\)-differential privacy or, roughly, \(2\varepsilon\)-differential privacy. The upshot is that we obtain a vector \(y\) where the correlation between \(x\) and \(y\) is about \(\varepsilon\), i.e. \(\langle x , y \rangle / n \approx \varepsilon\).</p>

<p>OK, so \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) both satisfy strong average-case versions of differential privacy when the data is uniform, but what about their composition?  Well, the bad news is that running \(y = M_1(x)\) followed by \(M_2(x,y)\) is going to return the dataset \(x\) with probability approaching 100%!  That’s because \(y\) was designed precisely to be a vector with correlation about \(\varepsilon\) with \(x\), and this is exactly the key that gets \(M_2\) to unlock the dataset.</p>

<p>What went wrong here is that, even if \(x\) really is uniformly random, it’s very far from it when conditioned on the output \(y=M_1(x)\). To analyze \(M_2(x,y)\) we must look at the distribution of \(x\) conditioned on \(y\). This distribution is going to be messy and may as well be a worst-case distribution, which means we must leave the realm of average-case privacy.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Composition guarantees that, as long as each part of your system is differentially private, then the overall system is too. It would be difficult to build sophisticated systems without this property. And it’s what allows one organization to release differentially private statistics without having to worry about what other information might be out there. In short, composition is what allows differential privacy to deal with the complexities of the real world.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that differential privacy would have taken off as a field of research without this composition property. Any proposal for an alternative approach to privacy-preserving data analysis should first be evaluated in terms of how it handles composition.</p>

<p>This post only scratches the surface. In particular, we haven’t talked about the quantitative aspects of composition; that’s where the fun really begins. We will leave you with some pointers to further reading on the topic:</p>

      <p>A good rule of thumb is that, if the number of released values is much larger than the number of people, then a privacy attack is probably possible. This is analogous to the rule from algebra that, if the number of constraints (released values) is greater than the number of unknown variables (people’s data), then the unknowns can be worked out. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1">↩</a></p>

      <p>Exactly quantifying how much noise is needed as the number of questions grows leads to the concept of a “privacy budget.” That is, we must precisely quantify how differential privacy degrades under composition.

The queries simply need to be “sufficiently distinct”, which can be formulated precisely as being nearly orthogonal vectors.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rota’s Basis Conjecture is a well known problem from matroid theory, that states that for any collection of n bases in a rank n matroid, it is possible to decompose all the elements into n disjoint rainbow bases. Here an asymptotic version of this is proved. We show that it is possible to find <em>n − o(n)</em> disjoint rainbow independent sets of size <em>n − o(n)</em>.</p>

<p>(I thank Nati Linial for telling me about it.)</p>
<p>Another way to formulate Rota’s basis conjecture (for representable matroids) is that if <em>B</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>B</em><sub>2</sub>, …, <em>B<sub>n</sub></em> are <em>n</em> bases of an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector space <em>V</em> (not necessarily distinct or disjoint), then there exists an <em>n</em> × <em>n</em> grid of vectors (<em>v<sub>ij</sub></em>) such that</p>
<p>1. the <em>n</em> vectors in row <em>i</em> are the members of the <em>i</em>th basis <em>B<sub>i</sub></em> (in some order), and</p>
<p>2. in each column of the matrix, the <em>n</em> vectors in that column form a basis of <em>V</em>.</p>
<p>If all the bases are the standard basis then this reduces to the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square">Latin squares</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Unrelated trivia question:</strong>  AGC-GTC-TGC-GTC-TGC-GAC-GATC-? what comes next in the sequence?</p>
<p>We mentioned Rota’s basis conjecture in various earlier posts.  A classic paper on the subject is the <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/huang-rota.pdf">1989 paper by Rosa Huang and Gian Carlo-Rota</a>. Three and a half years ago Timothy Chow lunched a polymath project (Polymath 12) to solve it. (Here is my<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/02/26/timothy-chow-launched-polymath12-on-rota-basis-conjecture-and-other-news/"> post on the project with various variants of the conjecture</a>, the <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/2017/02/23/rotas-basis-conjecture-polymath-12/">first post on the polymath blog</a>, and the <a href="https://asone.ai/polymath/index.php?title=Rota%27s_conjecture">wiki</a>).

Keith Conrad is a professor in the mathematics department at UCONN—the University of Connecticut. My dear wife Kathryn Farley and I are about to move to join him—not as faculty but as another resident of the “Constitution State.”</p>
<p>
Today we thank him for his work on explaining mathematics.</p>
<p>
Conrad is a prolific writer of articles on mathematics. He makes hard concepts clear, he makes easy concepts interesting. He has a sense of humor; his <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu">website</a> is filled with fun of all kinds.</p>
<p>
He has interesting license plates, photos of streets that bear his first name, a Russian <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/">update</a> to Tom Lehrer’s “Elements” song, and more links to others’ items. </p>
<p>
If you’d like a video example of fun see <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/d2OKd.gif">this</a> for a short video illusion. Too bad it is an illusion and it does not work in reality. As a chocolate lover I wish it worked—free chocolate forever. A similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_square_puzzle">illusion</a> with a triangle was once featured by Martin Gardner, leading Ken as a teenager to make a cardboard cutout version overlaid on a map of the Bermuda Triangle as an “explanation” of disappearances there.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Articles </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I have not yet met Conrad in person, but have enjoyed reading his articles on math of all kinds. He has a giant <img alt="{63 \times 4}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B63+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{63 \times 4}"/> <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/">grid</a> of clickable titles, grouped by subject area. </p>
<p>
For an example, he has a <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/numbersoncircle.pdf">title</a> “Roots on a Circle.” The file name says “numbers on a circle” and the essay begins disarmingly enough with a picture of the 7th roots of unity. The next page shows a simple polynomial where most but not all roots lie on the circle:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/thanks-to-an-explainer/lehmerspolynomialroots/" rel="attachment wp-att-17412"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17412" height="161" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/lehmerspolynomialroots.jpg?w=300&amp;h=161" width="300"/></a></p>
<p>
This is enough to draw you in and stay attached as things become more complicated beginning on page 3. It helps that Conrad does not stint on algebraic details. This essay supplements a cautionary tale in mathematics: a <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/15444/examples-of-eventual-counterexamples">link</a> to a MathOverflow list whose top item is that the factors of <img alt="{x^n - 1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5En+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{x^n - 1}"/> over <img alt="{\mathbb{Q}}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BQ%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\mathbb{Q}}"/> have no coefficient of absolute value greater than <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/> for <img alt="{n = 1,\dots,104}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+1%2C%5Cdots%2C104%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 1,\dots,104}"/>. Before you try to prove this by induction check out <img alt="{n = 105}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+105%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{n = 105}"/>.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Finite Groups </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
One of my favorite articles is <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/grouptheory/order.pdf">titled</a>, “Orders Of Elements In A Group.” Conrad starts with the humble concept of the order of an element in a group. Then he builds up a theory that explains various properties of order. </p>
<p>
I especially like that he supplies examples to help you with your intuition. For me, and Ken, finite groups are just counter-intuitive. Groups have magical properties but my naive conjectures about them usually fail. Conrad’s article ends with a discussion of primality testing which is dear to us in complexity theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Finite Groups that Encode Information </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
I recently needed a finite group with a certain structure. In complexity theory we sometimes use matrices to encode information in a way that makes an algorithm more efficient. Algorithms like matrices since they can be stored and multiplied efficiently. As an example, suupose that we have two matrices <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/> and <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  AB = -BA. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AB+%3D+-BA.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  AB = -BA. "/></p>
<p>That is the matrices anti-commute. Then we can use such matrices to encode information about a string <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> of <img alt="{A,B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A,B}"/>‘s. Every string <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/> can be written as: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \pm A^{k}B^{l}. " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpm+A%5E%7Bk%7DB%5E%7Bl%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \pm A^{k}B^{l}. "/></p>
<p>The <img alt="{\pm}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\pm}"/> encodes the number of inversions in the string <img alt="{S}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{S}"/>. That is the number of times <img alt="{B}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{B}"/> is followed by an <img alt="{A}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{A}"/>: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  \dots B \dots A \dots " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cdots+B+%5Cdots+A+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  \dots B \dots A \dots "/></p>
<p>So <img alt="{ABBA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BABBA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{ABBA}"/> has <img alt="{2}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{2}"/> inversions, and <img alt="{AAABA}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAAABA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{AAABA}"/> has <img alt="{1}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{1}"/>. Here are matrices that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Clifford_algebra">anti-commute</a>. </p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+0%261%5C%5C+1%260+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}"/></p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++B+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+1%260%5C%5C+0%26-1+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;-1 \end{pmatrix}"/></p>
<p>
We can do even better. There are matrices so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  AB = \lambda BA, " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AB+%3D+%5Clambda+BA%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  AB = \lambda BA, "/></p>
<p>where <img alt="{\lambda}" class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clambda%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="{\lambda}"/> is a root of unity. They exist as the example below shows for fourth roots of unity. But finding such matrices was curiously hard, at least for me. Lots of web searching.</p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{pmatrix} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+0%261%260%260%5C%5C+0%260%261%260%5C%5C+0%260%260%261%5C%5C+1%260%260%260+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  A = \begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\\ 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \end{pmatrix} "/></p>
<p/><p align="center"><img alt="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;i&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;-1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-i \end{pmatrix} " class="latex" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++B+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D+1%260%260%260%5C%5C+0%26i%260%260%5C%5C+0%260%26-1%260%5C%5C+0%260%260%26-i+%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" title="\displaystyle  B = \begin{pmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;i&amp;0&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;-1&amp;0\\ 0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;-i \end{pmatrix} "/></p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Conrad’s articles are helpful. In a wide variety of topics he presents both theorems and history of math concepts. What I find most attractive is the examples and additional comments that pepper his writing. </p>
<p>
Check him out.</p></font></font></div>

    <title>An interview with Jos Baeten, outgoing director of the CWI</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After nine years, <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/people/jos-baeten" target="_blank">Jos Baeten</a> will step down as general director of <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/" target="_blank">CWI</a> on 30 September 2020 and there will be a <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/events/2020/farewell-symposium-jos-baeten/symposium-retirement-jos-baeten" target="_blank">retirement symposium</a> in his honour on 1 October 2020. (Jos Baeten's successor will be <a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/ton-de-kok/" target="_blank">Tom de Kok</a>. You can read the CWI news item related to Tom de Kok's appointment <a href="https://www.cwi.nl/news/2020/ton-de-kok-appointed-new-director-of-cwi" target="_blank">here</a>. Tom de Kok, just like Jos Baeten before him, joins CWI from Eindhoven University of Technology.) </p><p>Jos Baeten has been one of the prime movers in the development of process algebra since 1987, and has been the driving force behind the CONCUR conference series and the CONCUR Basic Research Actions in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Apart from being general director of CWI, he has served the TCS community in a variety of roles and organisations, and has helped to connect the work of the concurrency-theory community with that done in control and mechanical engineering. He has also supervised more than 30 PhD theses. </p><p>I asked Jos a few questions via email and I am happy to share his answers with the readers of this blog. Thanks to Jos for all the contributions he has given to the research community throughout his career, and for sharing his opinions and reminiscences with us! </p><p><b>The interview</b> </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Let's start from the beginning. If I remember correctly, your background was in model theory. Could you tell us what prompted you to move to doing research in computer science? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I have a Master in logic and foundations of mathematics (with a minor in philosophy) from Utrecht University, with a Master’s thesis on lambda calculus, and a PhD in logic and foundations of mathematics from the University of Minnesota, with a PhD thesis on definability theory (a cross between recursion theory and set theory) entitled "<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0099378" target="_blank">Filters and ultrafilters over definable subsets of admissible ordinals</a>". Returning from the US, I got a job teaching undergraduate maths at Delft University. But I wanted getting into research, and meeting <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.a.bergstra/" target="_blank">Jan Bergstra</a> he said there were lots of opportunities in computer science research, not in maths. Writing a paper with him and <a href="https://www.cs.vu.nl/~jwk/" target="_blank">Jan Willem Klop</a> on term rewriting systems would qualify me, he said. So it happened, and I got a postdoc at CWI in the framework of the ESPRIT I project. I kept on doing maths, but it was called computer science. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> I have heard that you were recruited by Jan Bergstra and Jan Willem Klop to work within their group at the CWI, and that <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~rvg/" target="_blank">Rob van Glabbeek</a> joined the team soon after you. Could you tell us about the environment at the CWI at that time? It must have been a very exciting place to be with all the activity related to work on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_communicating_processes#:~:text=The%20algebra%20of%20communicating%20processes,process%20algebras%20or%20process%20calculi." target="_blank">ACP</a> and related topics. </p><p><b>Jos:</b> It was a heady period. The group of Jan and Jan Willem was expanding rapidly on EU money, with me, Rob van Glabbeek and <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~fvaan/" target="_blank">Frits Vaandrager.</a> I really liked ACP and doing universal algebra. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> What was your first paper in CS about? Which paper from your initial period at the CWI are you most proud of? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> My first paper was "<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225810594_Term_rewriting_systems_with_priorities" target="_blank">On term rewriting, Term rewriting systems with priorities</a>". I am most proud of my first ACP paper, "<a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2137499/335911.pdf" target="_blank">Syntax and defining equations for an interrupt mechanism in process algebra</a>". This is about adding the priority operator. For axiomatisation, it needed an auxiliary operator that later turned out to be almost optimal. I came up with an axiomatisation, and Jan Bergstra forced me to prove it correct by doing all the critical pairs. I found a small error in pair 101 (of the 102 pairs), corrected it and proved the result correct. This all in a couple of weeks. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Let's move on to the CONCUR project: How did it come about and what was its legacy? I recall that you came to visit <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Matthew.Hennessy/" target="_blank">Matthew Hennessy</a> at the University of Sussex when I was a PhD student there to discuss the CONCUR proposal. How did you become involved in leading such a large and high profile group of researchers so early in your career at the CWI? What was it like to lead the CONCUR project?  <br/></p><p><b>Jos:</b> This is again due to Jan Bergstra: he believes in delegating responsibilities quickly. When the new instrument of Basic Research Action came up in the EU, he wanted a BRA with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare" target="_blank">Hoare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Milner" target="_blank">Milner </a>and Hennessy. I got the assignment and made a trip to the UK visiting all three, and got all of them on board. The idea of the project was unification, but that did not come about, everyone kept doing their own thing. We did, however, produce excellent papers, including the curious </p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, J.A. Bergstra, C.A.R. Hoare, R. Milner, J. Parrow &amp; R. de Simone, The variety of process algebra. Deliverable ESPRIT Basic Research Action 3006, CONCUR, University of Edinburgh 1991 </p><p><b>Luca:</b> How would you summarize the history of the conference CONCUR? Can it be split into different periods, and if so, what characterizes them? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> CONCUR 90, which was the first CONCUR conference, was organised by BRA CONCUR, but with speakers from all 5 BRA’s in the area of concurrency; in 1991 Milner did not want such a conference to occur in Edinburgh, so Jan Bergstra and I did it again in Amsterdam. Then, we involved <a href="https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/people/faculty/ScottSmolka" target="_blank">Scott Smolka</a> for 1992 and after that, it was established, with a steering committee comprised of representatives from the 5 BRAs and Scott. As of 1993, it was firmly established, we found a niche and time period (end of August, beginning of September). All branches of concurrency were involved from the start, and over the years, it shows fashion clearly, for instance in certain years there was a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus" target="_blank">pi-calculus</a>. </p><p><b>Luca:</b> In the 80s and the 90s there were three "schools" in process algebra,     the ACP, CCS, and CSP schools. With the benefit of hindsight, which were heir main contributions? To which extent have they converged? Is this classification still important for current research? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> I refer to my paper  <br/></p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/files/2154050/200402.pdf" target="_blank">A brief history of process algebra</a>. Theoretical Computer Science 335 (2/3), 2005, pp. 131-146.  <br/></p><p>I do a comparison in there. In my opinion, the book  <br/></p><p>J.C.M. Baeten, T. Basten and M.A. Reniers, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/process-algebra-equational-theories-of-communicating-processes/0A091BDAA17DA4D3D30FCD6F52E0E6B8" target="_blank">Process Algebra: Equational Theories for Communicating Processes</a>. Cambridge Tract in Theoretical Computer Science 50, Cambridge University Press 2010  <br/></p><p>has the unification, presenting all three in the same framework. However, process algebra is out of fashion, so who cares? </p><p><b>Luca:</b>  When did you become interested in supervisory control? What motivated you to apply techniques from process algebra in that research field? Looking at the outcome of that work, both in theory and in practice, that was a very good move! Could you tell us about the position you had in Mechanical Engineering? How did it come about and what was it like to work in that department? </p><p><b>Jos:</b> More than 20 years in the department of computer science, having been dean twice, I got to know the university very well indeed. <a href="https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/je-koos-rooda" target="_blank">Koos Rooda</a>, professor of systems engineering at Mechanical Engineering, requested my assistance to get more software engineering into systems engineering, to replace his cooperation with Martin Rem, who became rector. In particular, he was interested in the combination of discrete event reasoning (i.e., process algebra) with the continuous mathematics of systems and control. Having done process algebra with timing and probabilities, I was willing to take up this challenge. Upon his retirement, with the vigorous backing of the dean of Mechanical Engineering at the time, I took over his position. At mid-life, I was ready for a change. I liked the hands-on attitude of mechanical engineering students, who are no good at theory or proofs, but are very good in using mathematics and trying out software tools. But then, I was asked to apply to the vacancy of director of CWI. This was the job I had always wanted. I had enjoyed being dean and doing research management, and CWI is a very prestigious institute with (at that time) very independent management. </p><p> </p><p><b>Luca:</b> Back at CWI: What skills do you think one needs to be the director of such a high-profile institute?

    <title>Benchmarks for Subpopulation Shift</title>

<br/></p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04859">new paper</a>, we develop a
framework for simulating realistic subpopulation shifts between training
and deployment conditions for machine learning models. Evaluating
standard models on the resulting benchmarks reveals that these models
are highly sensitive to such shifts. Moreover, training models to be
invariant to existing families of synthetic data perturbations falls
short of remedying this issue.   </i></p>

<p>Consider what is probably the most prototypical classification task:
distinguishing between pictures of dogs and cats. By now, we have a fairly
established approach to tackling this task. It involves sourcing a set of
(labeled) cat and dog pictures and then training our model on that set.
Intuitively, we understand that for this approach to succeed our training set
has to be sufficiently large and diverse, capturing a variety of real-world
conditions. In particular, one might want to make sure that it contains
representatives of many of the possible breeds of dogs and cats. Is it critical
though that <i>all</i> breeds are represented? That is, if our classifier truly
learns how to distinguish dogs from cats, wouldn’t we expect it to generalize to
unseen breeds as well?</p>

<p>This is just an illustration of a broader challenge: building ML models that are
robust to <i>subpopulation shift</i>, i.e., they are able to generalize to data
subpopulations that were not encountered during training. This notion of
robustness is essential for models to perform reliably in the real world. After
all, we cannot expect our training set to capture all possible subpopulation
variations it can encounter during deployment. (Think of, e.g., differences in
weather/road conditions in the context of self-driving cars, or variability in
diagnostic equipment and patients’s exact characteristics in the
context of medical applications.)</p>

<h2 id="tackling-subpopulation-shifts">Tackling subpopulation shifts</h2>

<p>To make progress on this challenge, we need to first develop a principled way to
measure such robustness (or lack thereof). So, how can we measure the extent to
which our models are robust to such train-test subpopulation shifts?</p>

<p>A natural approach would be to first partition the subpopulations present in data for each class (e.g., dog or cat breeds) into two
disjoint sets: one set that is used for training the model, and one set that is held-out for
evaluation. Then, one can just examine the performance of the model on the held-out data.</p>

<p>This setup ensures that the actual task remains unchanged between
training and testing—i.e., classifying inputs into the original
classes (“dog” vs. “cat”). Therefore, the observed performance can give
us a sense how well that model will perform when exposed to novel data
subpopulations encountered during deployment.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty in implementing this strategy, however, is that
standard datasets do not contain annotations that are fine-grained
enough to identify the subpopulations of interest. Also, rectifying this
issue by collecting additional human annotations would be complicated
(not every class lends itself to identifying a natural and explicit
subpopulation structure) and costly (due to the scale of
state-of-the-art classification datasets).</p>

<p>In this post, we will outline an approach that circumvents some of the
aforementioned issues, allowing us to automatically construct a suite of
subpopulation shift benchmarks of varying difficulty, with minimal effort.</p>

<h2 id="the-breeds-methodology">The <span class="sc">Breeds</span> methodology</h2>

<p>Our approach is to <i>simulate</i> class subpopulations by grouping semantically
similar classes into <i>super</i>classes (e.g., aggregate the 100+ dog breed classes
in ImageNet into a “dog superclass”). Then, considering the classification task
over such superclasses enables us to repurpose the original dataset annotations
as explicit indicators of the subpopulation structure. Note that this new task
is entirely based on <em>existing</em> datasets, so we do not need to deal with,
gathering new data points or annotations, hence avoiding the additional biases
these might introduce (see our previous posts on
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias">dataset replication</a> and
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/benchmarks">annotation pipelines</a>).</p>

<p>After this task restructuring, we can train our model on the resulting
superclass classification task while having full control over  which
subpopulations are included in training and which subpopulations are encountered
during testing. For example, if our original dataset contains classes: Labrador,
Husky, Tabby cat, and Persian cat, which we group into “dog” and “cat”
superclasses as [Labrador, Husky] and [Tabby cat, Persian cat], we can train a
model on the Labrador vs. Tabby cat task and test how well it can distinguish
Huskies from Persian cats. (Note that this framework can also naturally
incorporate milder subpopulation shifts where test subpopulations are
underrepresented, but not entirely missing, in the training set—see
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02060">here</a>.) Pictorially:</p>

<p><img class="bigimg" id="pipeline" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/pipeline.png"/></p>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Overview of the <span class="sc">Breeds</span>
methodology.</strong> We group classes into superclasses and derive a
classification task over superclasses. Then we randomly assign each of the
original classes to be used for training (source) or evaluation (target) of the
model, thus inducing a subpopulation shift between training and testing
conditions. By controlling the granularity of the superclass grouping we can
construct shifts of varying severity.</div>

<p>The dog vs. cat breeds example served as the motivation for our
framework (as well as its name), but the underlying principle is quite
general. In fact, we can (and do) apply this methodology to group
together a wide variety of classes that share similar characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="obtaining-meaningful-superclasses">Obtaining meaningful superclasses</h3>

<p>In order for such a “breeds” benchmark be tractable from an image classification
viewpoint, we need to ensure that the classes we group together into
superclasses actually share visual characteristics. (After all, we cannot expect
a model to generalize across an arbitrary train-test partition of classes).
Ideally, we would group dataset classes based on a hierarchy that captures their
<i>visual</i> similarity—thus, allowing us to construct superclasses of varying
granularity (which would lead to benchmarks of varying difficulty).</p>

<div class="footnote">     
  <strong>Note:</strong> Having access to a class
hierarchy is a relatively mild requirement. Most of the popular vision datasets
are already equipped with such a hierarchy (e.g., CIFAR-100, ImageNet, PASCAL-
VOC and OpenImages). Even in cases where an explicit class hierarchy is missing,
it is more likely than not that the dataset classes obey some natural groupings
which could be recovered either manually, or with the assistance of proxies such
as word embeddings. 
</div>

<p>From this point of view, the ImageNet dataset is a natural candidate for
building our benchmarks—aside from its breadth and scale, it also comes
equipped with a class hierarchy, i.e., the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet hierarchy</a>. However,
taking a closer look at that hierarchy reveals a few important shortcomings: (a)
classes are grouped together based on abstract (as opposed to visual)
characteristics (e.g., “umbrella” and “roof” are both “coverings); (b) nodes at
the same level of the hierarchy can have vastly different granularity (e.g.,
“street sign” and “living thing”), not necessarily mirroring the specificity of
the class itself; and (c) the hierarchy is not a tree (e.g., “bread” is in both
“starches” and “baked goods”). Grouping ImageNet classes based on this hierarchy
would thus result in poorly calibrated tasks.</p>

<p>All these shortcomings stem from the fact that WordNet is a <em>semantic</em> rather
than <em>visual</em> hierarchy—words are grouped together based on their meaning
rather than the visual appearance of the objects they correspond to. To remedy
this, we performed extensive edits to the existing ImageNet class hierarchy to
better capture visual object similarity. Specifically, we removed all abstract
nodes (e.g., “covering”) and calibrated the depth to ensure that nodes at the
same level have comparable granularity (by adding/removing redundant
nodes)—the modified hierarchy can be explored 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/breeds_class_hierarchy">here</a> or through the
notebook we provide in the <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/BREEDS-Benchmarks">code repo</a>.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-breeds-benchmarks">Constructing <span class="sc">Breeds</span> benchmarks</h3>

<p>Equipped with such a modified class hierarchy, we can construct subpopulation
shift benchmarks of varying difficulty in an essentially automated manner: we
simply choose a level of the hierarchy and treat each node at that level as a
superclass. The original dataset classes that are descendants of this node then
become the subclasses or “breeds”. These subclasses are then split
<em>randomly</em> into two groups—one of these is used to sample
training data points (<em>source domain</em>), and the other to sample test data points
(<em>target domain</em>).</p>

<div class="footnote">     
  <strong>Note:</strong> Using our methodology, one can also precisely
  control the extent to which the source and target domain subpopulations 
  differ—i.e., instead of random splits one 
  could make the splits more/less 
  adversarial)—see our paper for details.
</div>
<p>By varying the level in the hierarchy of the superclasses we
select, we can create an entire suite of benchmarks. For our analysis below, we
will use the following benchmarks.

need to scroll to the right to see all the classes).
</div>

<h3 id="validating-the-benchmarks-using-human-annotation">Validating the benchmarks using human annotation</h3>

<p>As already discussed, to ensure that the benchmarks we create are actually
meaningful, we need to validate that the superclasses therein contain visually
coherent subpopulations, so that good cross-subpopulation generalization is
possible. To this end, we leverage human annotators to measure the robustness of
humans to the subpopulation shifts encapsulated by (simplified versions of)
<span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks. Specifically, we randomly pick pairs of superclasses and then show
annotators two groups of images corresponding to samples from the source domain
of the respective superclasses. Then, we present them with random images from
the target domain of <em>both</em> superclasses (mixed together) and ask them to assign
these images to one of the two groups (superclasses). Crucially, we do <em>not</em>
reveal to the annotators the name of either of the superclasses. Here is what
the task looks like:</p>

<div>
  <img class="bigimg" id="pipeline" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/task.png" width="80%"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Illustration of subpopulation shift task presented 
to annotators.</strong> Annotators are shown random images from the source
domains of two random superclasses. Then, they are presented with images from
the target domains of these superclasses and asked to assign them into the
correct superclass.</div>

<p>If our superclasses are indeed well-calibrated for the task, annotators should
be able to associate new images with the correct group. That is, images from the
target domain of a superclass should be more similar to the source domain of the
<em>same</em> superclass, rather than the other one. Also, to establish a baseline, we
repeat the same experiment while asking the annotators to classify unseen
samples from the source domain (i.e., when there is no subpopulation shift).</p>

<p>So how well do our annotators perform?</p>

<div id="anno"> 
<canvas height="35%" id="bar" width="100%"/>
</div>

<div id="anno_model"> 
<canvas height="35%" id="bar_models" width="100%"/>
</div>

<div class="footnote"> <strong>Annotator performance on <span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks.</strong> Annotators are quite robust to subpopulation shift.
Their ability to identify the correct superclass does not change significantly
between the source and the target domain, especially for the
<span class="sc">Living-17</span> and <span class="sc">Entity-30</span>
benchmarks. </div>

<p>As we can see, the difference in average annotator accuracy (in terms of
classifying unseen inputs into the correct group/superclass) between the source
and target domain is quite small. This suggests that the superclasses do indeed
correspond to visually meaningful object groupings, and, moreover, that humans
are quite robust to the distribution shifts captured within the <span class="sc">Breeds</span> tasks.
Let us now compare this drop to the one that our models incur.</p>

<h3 id="subpopulation-robustness-of-standard-models">Subpopulation robustness of standard models</h3>

<p>To assess whether standard models are sensitive to subpopulation shifts, we
will, for each <span class="sc">Breeds</span> task, train a number of standard architectures to
distinguish between the corresponding superclasses, using data from the source
domain and then measure model performance on data from the target domain.
Specifically, we will plot the <em>target accuracy</em> of each model as a function of
its <em>source accuracy</em>.</p>

    <strong>Performance of standard models on the <span class="sc">NonLiving-26</span> benchmark.</strong> Models are quite brittle to subpopulation shifts, their accuracy drops by more than 25 percentage points across architectures.
    Re-training the last layer of the model on the target distribution
    significantly improves performance but does not recover the original model
    accuracy.
    </div>

</div>

<p>Across the board, all models suffer a clear drop in performance under
subpopulation shifts—-accuracy drops by more than 30 percentage points between
the source and target domains. This indicates that the features models rely on
to perform well are somewhat specific to the subpopulations they encounter
during training, and thus tend to lose their predictive power even under
seemingly mild shifts in test-time subpopulations. 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/feed.xml#anno_model" id="reveal_model">[CLICK THIS to compare model
performance to that of human annotators.]</a></p>

<p>A natural question to ask then is: can these models be adapted to the target
domain by simply re-training their last layer with data from this domain? 
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/feed.xml#std_ft" id="reveal_retrain">[CLICK THIS to add the re-training 
line.]</a> The answer seems to be nuanced. On one hand,
re-training significantly increases model performance, indicating that the
representations learned in the earlier layers of these (source-domain trained)
models are useful also for the subpopulations in the target domain. On the other
hand, these representations still fall short of what one would hope for—the
target accuracy post retraining remains much lower than that of a model trained
directly on the target domain.</p>

<h3 id="robustness-interventions">Robustness interventions</h3>

<p>Given that standard models turned out to be very sensitive to subpopulation
shifts, one might hope that applying a number of existing robustness
interventions—designed to increase model robustness to specific synthetic
perturbations—might change this state of affairs. To assess this, we
evaluate the subpopulation shift robustness of classifiers that have been
trained: (a) via <a href="https://gradientscience.org/robust_opt_pt1">robust optimization</a> against L2 adversaries of
different epsilon; (b) on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">stylized version</a> of ImageNet (relying less on
texture and thus more on shape); and (c) with random noise (Gaussian or
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896">Erase</a>).</p>

<p>To control for the significant impact on the standard (source) accuracy that
these methods can have, we focus on  the <em>relative target accuracy</em> of the
resulting models—that is the fraction of accuracy that is preserved in the
target domain (target accuracy over source accuracy).</p>

<div>
  <img class="bigimg" id="intervene" src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/breeds/figures/intervene.png"/>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Effect of train-time interventions on subpopulation shift robustness.</strong>
We plot the ratio of the target accuracy to the source accuracy as a function of
the source accuracy. Train-time interventions have small, yet non-trivial,
impact on model robustness.
</div>

<p>We observe that these robustness interventions do have an impact on the target
accuracy of the model. Moreover, even when the resulting models have comparable
source accuracies, their target accuracies can be quite different. For instance,
erase noise improves robustness without particularly impacting source accuracy
(relative to standard models), while adversarially trained models improve
robustness at the expense of source accuracy. Overall, these results indicate
that while existing interventions make models slightly less sensitive to
subpopulation shifts, there is still significant room for improvement.</p>

<p>To obtain a more complete picture, we also measure the performance of the above
models after retraining the final layer with data from the target domain. Again,
our goal is to understand whether the employed training methods lead to
representations that are more general, and can be directly repurposed for the
target domain.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Adapting model trained with robustness interventions for subpopulation shift.</strong> We plot model accuracy on the target domain after re-training the last layer on that domain. We can see that adversarially-trained model have significantly better accuracy, in certain cases almost recovering the original source accuracy.
</div>

<p>Interestingly, we see that models trained with erase noise are not better than
standard models after we allow for such fine-tuning. This indicates that the
gain in robustness it provides may not stem from learning better
representations. In contrast, adversarially trained models are significantly
better than other models (including standard ones) after fine-tuning. This is in
line with recent results showing that adversarially trained models are more
suited for transfer learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05869">here</a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08489">here</a>). At
the same time, models trained on the stylized version of ImageNet are
consistently worse than other models, even relative to models with similar
source accuracy. This could indicate that texture is a particularly useful
feature for this classification task, especially in the presence of
subpopulation shift.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>In this post, we demonstrate how one can utilize a class
hierarchy to simulate a range of subpopulation shifts within existing
classification datasets. These shifts turn out to pose a challenge for standard
models (seemingly more so than for humans) and this challenge cannot really be
overcome using existing robustness interventions or re-training the last
layer. Thus, there is a need for designing new methods to address this core
robustness requirement. Overall, we believe that subpopulation shifts are an
important piece of the robustness puzzle and we hope that the benchmarks we
develop will serve as a guide for future progress on this front.</p></div>

    <title>TR20-120 |  A Parallel Repetition Theorem for the GHZ Game | 

	Justin Holmgren, 

	Ran Raz</title>
    <summary>We prove that parallel repetition of the (3-player) GHZ game reduces the value of the game polynomially fast to 0. That is, the value of the GHZ game repeated in parallel $t$ times is at most $t^{-\Omega(1)}$. Previously, only a bound of $\approx \frac{1}{\alpha(t)}$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann function, was known.

The GHZ game was recently identified by Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen as a multi-player game where all existing techniques for proving strong bounds on the value of the parallel repetition of the game fail. Indeed, to prove our result we use a completely new proof technique. Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen speculated that progress on bounding the value of the parallel repetition of the GHZ game may lead to further progress on the general question of parallel repetition of multi-player games. They suggested that the strong correlations present in the GHZ question distribution represent the ``hardest instance'' of the multi-player parallel repetition problem.

Another motivation for studying the parallel repetition of the GHZ game comes from the field of quantum information. The GHZ game, first introduced by Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, is a central game in the study of quantum entanglement and has been studied in numerous works. For example, it is used for testing quantum entanglement and for device-independent quantum cryptography. In such applications a game is typically repeated to reduce the probability of error, and hence bounds on the value of the parallel repetition of the game may be useful.</summary>

    <title>Random Thoughts on the Pandemic</title>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p> </p><p>1) Contrast the following two points and, if you have an intelligent way to fill-in-the-blank for the second one, please comment.</p><p>a) When Trump says `open the schools or I will cut of funding' I disagree, or at least he should talk more about how to do it carefully BUT there is an underlying important and serious issue: how to balance health and education. Similar for when he talks about opening up business's - how to balance heath and the economy.</p><p>b) When Trump says `hydroxychloroquine is a potential cure for covid' I (and most of the medical community) disagree, BUT FILL IN THE BLANK. Is there SOME serious issue involved here that I am just missing?</p><p>2) I have seen several approaches to large gathering, say Churchs, beach parties, motorcycle meeting etc. </p><p>a) DO IT ONLINE.  UMCP classes will be on-line in the fall. My church has been online since mid March and seems like it will do the same in the fall. (Note- Choir is much worse than normal talking for spreading it, so Choir might not resume for a much longer time than Church).</p><p>b) HAVE THEM but SOCIAL DISTANCE and MASKS and other precautions. And it works. I hope it works.</p><p>c) HAVE THEM, realize that there IS an issue, TRY to do some of the precautions, but fail. This may be what has happened at some high schools, see <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/9-people-test-positive-at-georgia-school-with-photo-of-crowded-hallway?ref=home">Here</a>.</p><p>d) HAVE THEM and ignore ALL precautions either because </p><p>i) God will protect you</p><p>ii) The Government is not my boss. Such people are usually pro-business so they should NOT mind if a business on its own requires masks and SHOULD mind if its the government. I have not seen them making that distinction. Such people are usually against Federalism and for localism. So they should be upset when a Prez or a Gov overides a Mayor's Mask Mandate. I have not seen this.</p><p>iii) The whole think is a Hoax. How can people still believe this?</p><p>These three may overlap.</p><p>3) The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota seems to believe ii and iii. Can someone give any rational reason why they want to have this rally and why its allowed to happen. Given how many people come (usually 250,000- less now?) from all across the country, this could make thinks far far worse. But see next point.</p><p>4) Libertarians think that there is too much Government in our lives. This is a fair point of view but it needs to be tested on a case by case basis. There are some things that REQUIRE a more national response. When this happens Libertarians have two choices:</p><p>a) Apply their thinking to figure out how Gov can help with the least damage. For example, Carbon tax for global warning. In the current pandemic they might have LOCAL govs pass mandatory mask laws.. Or they would at least set a good example by wearing masks themselves. Perhaps relax regulations on medical stuff so that companies can work together without worrying about anti-trust, and perhaps look more carefully at regulations that get in the way (might be a good idea anyway).</p><p>b) Deny its a problem. Man made Global Warming is a myth. Covid is a hoax. Hence its okay to have the Motorcycle Rally. But the problem is, this doesn't just harm the people showing up, it harms others as well.</p><p>5) Early on I was puzzled that Trump didn't care more since older people (his base!) are at more risk. Did he think it would only affect democrats (early on NY was hit badly). Why didn't his advisors tell him that it would kill his own base?I ASK NON-RHETORICALLY  Or did they and he didn't list. My point is, for purely selfish reasons Trump should have taken more action earlier, so I am surprised he did not. See next point.</p><p>6) Trump could have even taken action in a Trumpian way:</p><p>The Chinese and the Democrats are waging a bio-war on real Americans (white rural older) !!! We will STOP them in their tracks and show them they can't mess with us!!  I will LOCKDOWN some cities AND provide online stuff to schools, business's (my cronies)  and churchs (SCREW that stupid sep of church and state- that was only one passage in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote).  </p><p>He might have even got Democrats to complain that it will choke the economy and hurt the poor, and that giving stuff to churchs is against the constitution (it prob is). </p><p>7) If a vax for covid is found, will Trump urge his base (some of whom are anti-vax) to take it? Having said that, if it comes out in October it may be untested so I doubt I will take it. I'll wait until Dr Fauci says its okay to take it. (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUiDLcp_hIw">here</a> for a nice song about Dr. Fauci.)</p><p>8) Some people who thought it was a Hoax and then got a bad case of it are saying loudly `I WAS WRONG! Its Real!'  I wonder if Herman Cain realized it was real before he died of it? I wish he had said `I WAS WRONG! ITS REAL! Wear a MASK' (The Whitehouse denies that he got Covid from the Tulsa Rally, here is headline only since something is behind paywalls: <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/white-house-denies-herman-cain-contracted-covid-19-at-tulsa-trump-rally-prior-to-his/article_b0c83d3c-c3de-547e-9a5f-434b6a82ac61.html">here</a>)</p><p>9) At Tulsa the presidents people took DOWN signs about safe distancing. So again, why does the Prez want to kill his own base? I ask non rhetorically. I am serious- I want someone to defend his actions intelligently both this one and the hydro-whatever in the first point.</p><p>10) Authoritarian governments often claim that they bring order and can act fast to get things done. So they SHOULD have an advantage during the pandemic since they can more easily ORDER a lockdown. Yet they don't seem to be doing better.  </p><p>Russia: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/">See Here</a>, number of cases going up fast.</p><p>Iran: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iran/">See here</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53598965">Here</a>, number of cases going up fast.</p><p>These countries and others, and America, had their leaders LIE about the extend of the virus early on. What is the upside of doing this?  I ask non-rhetorically. </p><p><br/></p></div>

    <title>TR20-119 |  On parity decision trees for Fourier-sparse Boolean functions | 

	Nikhil Mande, 

	Swagato Sanyal</title>
    <summary>We study parity decision trees for Boolean functions. The motivation of our study is the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions and its connection to Fourier analysis and parity decision tree complexity. Our contributions are as follows. Let $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ be a Boolean function with Fourier support $\mathcal{S}$ and Fourier sparsity $k$.

1) We prove via the probabilistic method that there exists a parity decision tree of depth $O(\sqrt{k})$ that computes $f$. This matches the best known upper bound on the parity decision tree complexity of Boolean functions (Tsang, Wong, Xie, and Zhang, FOCS 2013). Moreover, while previous constructions (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013, Shpilka, Tal, and Volk, Comput. Complex. 2017) build the trees by carefully choosing the parities to be queried in each step, our proof shows that a naive sampling of the parities suffices.

2) We generalize the above result by showing that if the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions satisfy a natural "folding property", then the above proof can be adapted to establish existence of a tree of complexity polynomially smaller than $O(\sqrt k)$. More concretely, the folding property we consider is that for most distinct $\gamma, \delta$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there are at least a polynomial (in $k$) number of pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$ of parities in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\alpha+\beta=\gamma+\delta$. We make a conjecture in this regard which, if true, implies that the communication complexity of an XOR function is bounded above by the fourth root of the rank of its communication matrix, improving upon the previously known upper bound of square root of rank (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013, Lovett, J. ACM. 2016).

3) Motivated by the above, we present some structural results about the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions. It can be shown by elementary techniques that for any Boolean function $f$ and all $(\alpha, \beta)$ in ${\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$, there exists another pair $(\gamma, \delta)$ in ${\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ such that $\alpha + \beta = \gamma + \delta$. One can view this as a "trivial" folding property that all Boolean functions satisfy. Prior to our work, it was conceivable that for all $(\alpha, \beta) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$, there exists exactly one other pair $(\gamma, \delta) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ with $\alpha + \beta = \gamma + \delta$. We show, among other results, that there must exist several $\gamma \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ such that there are at least three pairs of parities $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ with $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=\gamma$. This, in particular, rules out the possibility stated earlier.</summary>

It did feel a bit surreal when my “interviewer” asked me to explain how I got into quantum computing research, and my answer was basically: “well, <em>as you know</em>, Andris, a lot of it started when I got hold of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002066">your seminal paper</a> back in 1999…”</li></ol>

Frances Allen was one of the leaders who helped create the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a> research. Fran was an elite researcher at IBM, and won a Turing Award for this pioneering work. Allen also collected other awards. </p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest award is one that Fran could never win: The <a href="https://www.ieee.org/about/awards/medals/frances-e-allen-medal.html">Frances E. Allen</a> award created this year by the IEEE: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>For innovative work in computing leading to lasting impact on other fields of engineering, technology, or science.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Today we will talk about Fran, who sadly just passed away.</p>
<p>
I consider Fran a friend, although we never worked together—our areas of interest were different. One fond memory of mine is being on panel a while ago with Fran. What a delightful presence.</p>
<p>
Fran always seemed to be smiling, always with that smile. The following images come in large part from interviews and lectures and award events-the fact that it is so easy to find them is a testament to her public engagement as well as scientific contributions.</p>

<p/><h2> Compliers were Key </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
There was a time when compliers were the most important program available on any new computer. Perhaps on any computer. Here is proof: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Computers are there to solve problems. <p/>
</li><li>
We must write programs to solve problems. <p/>
</li><li>
Details of the computer and instructions, are complicated, which make writing programs hard. <p/>
</li><li>
Thus, automating the writing of programs is important. <p/>
</li><li>
QED: we must have compliers.
</li></ol>
<p>
Okay this is not really a “proof”, but there is some truth to the argument. Fran was at IBM and worked on some of the early compliers, including FORTRAN and related languages. IBM wanted to sell computers, well actually in the early days rent them. One potential roadblock, IBM realized, was that new computers could be hard to program. Thus to ensure that companies rented new machines as fast as IBM could manufacture them was important. This created the need for compliers and even more for <i>optimizing compilers</i>.</p>
<p>
In order to ship more machines, the code that a complier created had to be efficient. Hence, a stress on Allen was to figure out how compliers could generate high quality code. This led Fran and others like John Cocke to discover many complier techniques that are still used today. A short list of the ideas is: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Branch prediction <p/>
</li><li>
Register allocation <p/>
</li><li>
Control flow graphs <p/>
</li><li>
Program dependence graphs <p/>
</li><li>
And many more.
</li></ul>
<p>
What is so important is that Allen’s work was not just applicable to this machine or that language. Rather the work was able to be used for almost any machine and for almost any language. This universal nature of the work on compliers reminds me of what we try to do in theory. Allen’s research was so important because it could be used for future hardware as well as future languages. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Register Allocation </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Guy Steele interviewed Allen for the ACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103191-an-interview-with-frances-e-allen/fulltext">here</a>. During the interview Fran talked about register allocation:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I have a story about register allocation. FORTRAN back in the 1950’s had the beginnings of a theory of register allocation, even though there were only three registers on the target machine. Quite a bit later, John Backus became interested in applying graph coloring to allocating registers; he worked for about 10 years on that problem and just couldn’t solve it. I considered it the biggest outstanding problem in optimizing compilers for a long time. Optimizing transformations would produce code with symbolic registers; the issue was then to map symbolic registers to real machine registers, of which there was a limited set. For high-performance computing, register allocation often conflicts with instruction scheduling. There wasn’t a good algorithm until the Chaitin algorithm. Chaitin was working on the PL compiler for the 801 system. Ashok Chandra, another student of Knuth’s, joined the department and told about how he had worked on the graph coloring problem, which Knuth had given out in class, and had solved it not by solving the coloring problem directly, but in terms of what is the minimal number of colors needed to color the graph. Greg immediately recognized that he could apply this solution to the register allocator issue. It was a wonderful kind of serendipity. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Compliers Create Theory </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
The early goal of creating compliers lead directly to some wonderful theory problems. One whole area that dominated early theory research was language theory. In particular understanding questions that arise in defining programming languages. Syntax came first—later semantics was formalized.</p>
<p>
Noam Chomsky created context-free grammars to help understand natural languages in the 1950s. His ideas were used by John Backus, also a Turing award winner from IBM, to describe the then new programming language IAL. This is known today as ALGOL 58, which became ALGOL 60. Peter Naur on the ALGOL 60 committee called Backus’s notation for ALGOL’s syntax: Backus normal form, but is now called BNF-Backus-Naur form. </p>

<p>
Theorists worked on, I confess I did, many questions about such languages. Existence problems, decidability problems, efficient algorithms, and closure properties were just some of the examples. Not clear how much of this theory effected compiler design, but I would like to think that some was useful. Theorist should thank the complier researchers. I do. </p>
<p>
For instance the 1970 STOC <a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/stoc/stoc70">program</a> had many papers on language related topics—here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A Result on the Relationship between Simple Precedence Languages and Reducing Transition Languages. 		Gary Lindstrom <p/>
</li><li>
The Design of Parsers for Incremental Language Processors: 		Ronald Book, Sheila Greibach, Ben Wegbreit <p/>
</li><li>
Tape- and Time-Bounded Turing Acceptors and AFLs. 		David Lewis <p/>
</li><li>
Closure of Families of Languages under Substitution Operators. 		William Rounds <p/>
</li><li>
Tree-Oriented Proofs of Some Theorems on Context-Free and Indexed Languages. 		Barry Rosen <p/>
</li><li>
On Syntax-Directed Transduction and Tree Transducers. 		Alfred Aho, Jeffrey Ullman <p/>
</li><li>
The Analysis of Two-Dimensional Patterns using Picture Processing Grammars. 		Jean-Francois Perrot <p/>
</li><li>
On Some Families of Languages Related to the Dyck Language. 		Joseph Ullian <p/>
</li><li>
Three Theorems on Abstract Families of Languages. 	Joseph Ullian
</li></ul>
<p>
By the way Abstract Families of Languages or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_family_of_languages">AFL</a>s was created by Seymour Ginsburg and Sheila Greibach in 1967 as a way to generalize context free languages. </p>
<p>
</p><p/><h2> Open Problems </h2><p/>
<p/><p>
Fran was asked by Steele in that <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103191-an-interview-with-frances-e-allen/fulltext">interview</a>: <i>Any advice for the future?</i></p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Yes, I do have one thing. Students aren’t joining our field, computer science, and I don’t know why. It’s just such an amazing field, and it’s changed the world, and we’re just at the beginning of the change. We have to find a way to get our excitement out to be more publicly visible. It is exciting, in the 50 years that I’ve been involved, the change has been astounding. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p/><p>
Thanks Fran. Much of that change is due to pioneers like you. Thanks for everything.</p>

    <title>Report from CCCG</title>
    <summary>I spent the last few days participating in the Canadian Conference in Computational Geometry, originally planned for Saskatoon but organized virtually instead.</summary>
    <content type="xhtml"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I spent the last few days participating in the <a href="http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/">Canadian Conference in Computational Geometry</a>, originally planned for Saskatoon but organized virtually instead.</p>

<p>The way the conference was organized was that (after the usual submission reviewing process) the accepted authors provided both a proceedings paper and a 10-15 minute talk video to the conference organizers. Participants were required to register, but with no registration fee, and were provided with links to the papers and talks (which are all still live on the conference program). Then, during the conference itself, live online Zoom sessions ran for only 2-3 hours daily, scheduled for 10AM-1PM Saskatoon time: very convenient for anywhere in North America or Europe, not so much for the participants in Iran, India, China, Japan, and Korea (all of which did have participants). The sessions included a daily 1-hour live invited talk, and question-and-answer sessions for the contributed works, in which we were shown a one-minute teaser for each video and then invited to ask questions of authors, at least one of whom was required to be present.</p>

<p>I think it all worked very well; so well, in fact, that during the business meeting there were calls for having at least some of the content similarly online so that people could participate remotely again. The ability to ask and answer questions either by live video on Zoom or through Zoom chat was useful, and used. Attendance was far above previous levels: 162 registrants, and over 120 unique participants at the most heavily attended of the two daily parallel sessions, compared to roughly 60 attendees each at the last two physical conferences. Despite the free registration, the conference organization was not without cost: they spent roughly $1500 (Canadian) in video production costs and video conferencing fees, but this was more than made up for by institutional support for the conference, so they ended up running a surplus which may (if it can be kept) end up providing some float for future conference organizers.</p>

<p>There are two changes I would suggest for future events of this type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The contributed sessions were for a short enough time that holding them in parallel seemed unnecessary, and made it impossible to participate in all discussions. So this format may work better with less parallelism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one-minute teaser videos were cut together by the conference organizers from the longer videos provided by the authors, but in some cases the pacing of the longer videos from which they were cut meant that these teaser videos could not clearly state the results of their papers. I think it would have been better to ask authors to provide these alongside the longer talk videos.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the highlights of the event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wednesday’s invited talk by Erik Demaine was a moving tribute to Godfried Toussaint and a survey of some of both Toussaint’s research, and Erik’s research on problems started by Toussaint, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Nagy_theorem">convexifying polygons by flips</a>, sona curves (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15784">the subject of one of my own contributions</a>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geometry_of_Musical_Rhythm">geometry of musical rhythms</a>, and perhaps most importantly “supercollaboration”, the model of shared research and shared authorship developed by Toussaint at the Barbados research workshops and also used by Erik within many of his MIT classes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exzxGODi2YU">Erik’s talk was recorded and is now on YouTube</a>; I hope the same will be true of the other two invited talks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wednesday’s contributed session on unfolding (in which I had two papers) I particularly liked Satyan Devadoss’s talk, “Nets of higher-dimensional cubes”. The main result is that if you unfold a hypercube, then no path of facets of the unfolded shape can contain a u-turn: if the path takes a step in one any coordinate direction, it cannot step in the opposite direction. This implies that all dual spanning trees unfold flat without self-intersection. The same property was known for all the Platonic solids, and Satyan can prove it for regular simplices in any dimension, but that still leaves several regular polytopes for which it is still open whether all unfoldings work: the cross-polytopes in all dimensions, and the three exceptional regular polytopes in four dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thursday’s invited talk was by Jeff Erickson, “Chasing puppies”. It was an entertaining presentation of an elegant topological proof of the following result: if you and a puppy can both move around a simple closed curve in the plane, with the puppy always moving along the curve to a local minimum of distance to you, then you can always find a path to follow that will bring you and the puppy to the same point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There wasn’t an official prize for best contributed presentation, but in the data structures session on Thursday, several comments nominated <a href="https://medium.com/photos-we-love/the-trinity-of-incongruity-or-why-i-still-love-this-tuxedo-sewing-machine-ups-truck-photograph-39712dd32fcb">Don Sheehy</a> as the unofficial winner, for a video artfully mixing live action with computer animations. His paper, “One-hop greedy permutations” concerned heuristics for improving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthest-first_traversal">farthest-first traversal</a> of a set of points by looking near each point as the sequence is constructed for a better point to use instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an official best student paper award, and it went to <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/afloresv">Alejandro Flores Velazco</a> for his paper “Social distancing is good for points too!” It concerns the problem of reducing the size of a data set while preserving the quality of nearest-neighbor classification using the reduced set. It proves that FCNN, which it calls the most popular heuristic for this problem, can produce significantly less-reduced outputs than some other proven heuristics, and shows how to modify FCNN to get a heuristic with guaranteed output quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third of the invited sessions was by Yusu Wang, newly moved from Ohio State to UC San Diego. She gave a nice introduction to combinatorial methods for reconstructing road networks (or other networks embedded into higher-dimensional geometry) from noisy samples of points on the network by combining discrete Morse theory to find the ridge lines of sample density with persistent homology to clean some of the noise from the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final technical component of the conference was an open problem session, also recorded and presumably to be uploaded at some point. Satyan posed his question on regular polytope unfolding there. Mike Paterson asked whether one can construct “Plato’s torus”, an embedded torus with six equilateral-triangle faces meeting at each vertex; <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/02/03/flat-equilateral-tori.html">in a blog post I made on this problem in 2009 I traced its history to Nick Halloway in 1997</a> but Mike says he discussed it already with Christopher Zeeman in the 1970s. Another problem that caught my attention asked for an algorithmic version of the polyhedral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_the_three_geodesics">theorem of the three geodesics</a>, the existence of a path across the surface of a convex polyhedron that stays straight across each edge or face of the polyhedron, and has at most \(\pi\) surface angle on each side of it when it passes through a vertex. Again there’s some history here: Joe O’Rourke says he once mentioned the problem to Gromov, who said it was easy but unfortunately didn’t elaborate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CCCG 2021 is planned for Halifax, colocated with WADS. One somewhat controversial issue is that the current plan is to have both conferences overlap for two days, with one overlap-free day for each conference at each end of the overlap period. But if both conferences are double-session, this means that participants can only choose one of four overlapping talks. At this point everyone is still hoping that events allow for a physical conference by then but that remains to be seen.</p>
