The time loop is closed and consistent and does not defy the principle of causality.<br />\nThis is as opposed to saying that descendants of blithe survivors on earth made the wormhole and sent it in the past. That is inconsistent and defies causality and is not allowed by physics. Essentially it means that the descendent of somebody on earth is going to make the wormhole. So the cause of somebody procreating will effect the building of the wormhole. But the wormhole is already there so the effect preceded the cause and thus physics does not allow it. Also it would mean that the blithe did take place, a fact recorded in history. The descendants cannot change something that happened. It would create multiple realities in the the same space time and thus violate Novikov&#8217;s theorem, or create a grandfather paradox, which our physics does not allow. Remember the scene where Cooper tries to get himself to stay. He can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s like 12 monkeys, Bruce Willis cannot change what happened and will live that loop ad infinitum.<br />\nThe way, I guess, to think about it is that the story, or the loop, is prewritten. What happens on the other side of the wormhole is not time sequentially related to what happens on this side. To think of time linearity between those systems is an incorrect assumption.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Garvit", "published": "2014-11-12 17:38:40+00:00", "title": "By: Garvit"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Greg Egan #46: </p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, a photon rocket can use the Penrose effect, but without an antimatter drive or similar it will not get enough extra thrust.</p>\n<p>Re tides, the square root of the Kretschmann scalar should be a good approximation of it.
