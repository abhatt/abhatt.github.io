In your update on 6/20, you changed the definition of a moral person to include both time and knowledge. I think that&#8217;s a strong improvement, but it also seems to make the problem much more difficult computationally. Your claim that &#8220;linear algebra is used to unravel the definition\u2019s apparent circularity&#8221; seems to gloss over some important problems.</p>\n<p>For one thing, we won&#8217;t have just a single matrix to describe each person&#8217;s interactions with every other person. Instead, we&#8217;ll have a separate matrix for every participant at every time step, describing what they know at that point in time about each of these interactions.</p>\n<p>Each participant can use linear algebra to compute their own belief at any given time about how moral each other person is. But is there really a simple way to compute the global solution describing how moral each person actually is? I haven&#8217;t tried working it out for myself on paper yet, but I don&#8217;t quite see it.</p>\n<p>The conditions for PageRank are that our matrix is connected and aperiodic. But it seems like we would need to have these conditions on each participant&#8217;s matrix as well. And then, what if they meet someone new and know absolutely nothing about them? It seems like any action could be justified by some prior belief.</p>\n<p>Or maybe we could add a new condition that you should always assume someone is moral until proven otherwise.
