Do not allow the enemy that victory. [&hellip; to that end] I have added, \u201cFirst, Do No Harm\u201d to our passwords of \u201cNo Better Friend, No Worse Enemy.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The foresight of Mattis&#8217; guidance was a very considerable comfort to the Marines under Mattis&#8217; command&nbsp;&hellip; and to their families.  </p>\n<p>During the subsequent decade, extending to the present time, the Coalition Forces (of many nations!) have embraced Mattis&#8217; doctrine to the utmost extent practicable, appreciating moreover that the doctrine applies equally to societal externalities (hospitals, schools, housing, transportation) and to human internalities (trust, respect, hope)&nbsp;&hellip; &#8220;If you break it, you own it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Essential to Mattis&#8217; doctrine is the fundamental principle that &#8220;There is only one color of Marine: green&#8221;.  Which is to say, considerations of race and religion do not enter into the qualifications that make a Marine.  </p>\n<p>All Marines appreciate&nbsp;&mdash; because they are universally and rigorously TRAINED to appreciate&nbsp;&mdash; the fragility of the doctrine of secular and racial equality, and the sustained commitment that is required to achieve an approximation of it (per the references <i>Matterhorn</i> and <i>First to Fight</i>, both appended).</p>\n<p>In this regard (as it seems to me) the IDF has adopted policies of exclusion&nbsp;&mdash; specifically, the <i>de facto</i> demographic exclusion of Israeli Muslims from IDF combat forces&nbsp;&mdash; that are politically expedient year-by-year, and militarily expedient battle-by-battle, yet have proved to be morally and socially corrosive generation-by-generation.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Muslim Israelis are untrusted and/or unwilling to participate in the ground assault against Gaza, perhaps Israel&#8217;s moral foundations for that assault <i>are</i> shaky. At the very least, a vital check-and-balance is missing&nbsp;&hellip; a check-and-balance that the USMC works diligently to respect scrupulously.</p>\n<p>Regrettably, there is (as far as I know) no public IDF syllabus that is comparable to the USMC&#8217;s Professional Reading program, in which all Marines are required to participate, and from which all US citizens are encouraged to learn.  For a nation whose millennia-old traditions honor learning, this lack is regrettable.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is why so many comments here on <i>Shtetl Optimized</i> amount to stale slogan-shouting.

Let me raise the possibility that behind your change of heart about Israel, there lies an extremely interesting misconception about <i>economics</i>.</p>\n<p>Your comment suggests to me that you think of the Palestine region as a fixed pie of resources.  There&#8217;s only so much land and water, so if Jewish settlers arrive en masse, they&#8217;ll have no choice but to take everything away from the Arabs.  Well, <i>sometimes</i> that&#8217;s how it works, but often not.</p>\n<p>Where do you think Israel&#8217;s current (relative) wealth came from?  From abundant natural resources?  Israel doesn&#8217;t have abundant natural resources.  It has some land for growing oranges and pomegranates and raising livestock, and Dead Sea salt that can be used to make specialty soap, and apparently some underseas oil (but that was only discovered a few years ago).  Some of the wealth came from overseas donations, and some from religious tourism.  But by far the greatest part was <i>created</i>.  It came from pharmaceuticals and microchips and car parts and other stuff that wasn&#8217;t there for anybody when the settlers arrived.  As for water, it&#8217;s still scarce, but Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Israel\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a> that &#8220;in an average year, Israel relies for about half of its water supply on unconventional water resources, including reclaimed water and desalination.&#8221;  And the same land now supports ~17 times the population that it did in 1920, including ~10 times as many Arabs.</p>\n<p>So put yourself in the shoes of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem around the 1920s.  What do you think about the waves of Jewish settlers arriving on your shores?  <i>If</i> you&#8217;re a rational opportunist, then you should think: &#8220;This could be the <i>best thing economically</i> that&#8217;s ever happened to my people.  Better yet, unlike with the whites settling the Americas, these people won&#8217;t kill us with smallpox, for the simple reason that we now have a modern understanding of disease.  And they <i>seem</i> much more interested in hiring us than in killing us.  If they do turn violent, we&#8217;ll raise a stink with the British, who are terrified of an Arab uprising for oil reasons.  But in the meantime, we&#8217;d better take advantage of this golden opportunity before it passes, by partnering with the settlers and diverting as much wealth as we can to ourselves.  Later, <i>after</i> we&#8217;ve done that, maybe we can have an anti-colonial uprising to kill the settlers or kick them out.  But that&#8217;s for later.  For now let&#8217;s focus on getting rich.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Of course, despite everything, there <i>were</i> Arabs in the area who adopted some variant of the above attitude and who did pretty well.  But suppose the Grand Mufti had encouraged this as the general policy, rather than genocide.  Would the Palestinians have then become as well-off as the Israelis?  Maybe or maybe not; I don&#8217;t know.  But just by being in the right place at the right time, the Palestinians could <i>certainly</i> have become richer than any other Muslim society in the Middle East, except the oil fiefdoms.</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m right, then the story of the Palestinians is, in part, a story of the triumph of religious fundamentalism and resentment over economic self-interest, with tragic results for everyone (not least for the Palestinians themselves).  And while this slow-motion tragedy had many different causes&#8212;one of which, yes, was criminal actions by Jewish extremists&#8212;I wonder whether a huge part of it boiled down to the all-too-common misconception that the pie is fixed.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2014-07-29 01:29:25+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>> there are millions (&#8230;) for whom Judaism is very important, and yet they are atheists.

The best characterization I&#8217;ve heard is that Jews are basically an extended family&#8212;one with certain beliefs and rituals that have accrued over the generations (but which not all family members care about, and which some vehemently reject), and with certain common genetic traits (but which aren&#8217;t universal, since many people came into this family by way of adoption or marriage).</p>\n<p>The Orthodox rule is that you&#8217;re a Jew if either your mother is Jewish or you underwent a formal process of conversion.

In particular, a non-Jews who get married to Jews (and in the US, the intermarriage rate is now above 50%) sometimes do a Conservative or Reform conversion.  Unfortunately, that conversion isn&#8217;t recognized by the Orthodox, which can cause serious contention in Israel, because the Orthodox alone get to decide who&#8217;s &#8220;Jewish&#8221; for purposes of Israeli law.  </p>\n<p>(Personally, I strongly believe that that aspect of Israeli law should be changed.

The difference is just that immigration isn&#8217;t automatic; you go through an immigration process similar to that of other Western countries.</p>\n<p>Second, while intermarriage (and other interbreeding with non-Jews) used to be much less common than they are now, we know they happened at a non-negligible rate throughout Jewish history.  How do we know that?  Well, take me for example.  Like a good number of Ashkenazim, I have blue eyes and blond hair (OK, at least when I was a kid; now it&#8217;s sort of brown).  I don&#8217;t look like a &#8220;Semite,&#8221; or for that matter, like Ethiopian or Mizrachi or other kinds of Jews.

You can of course argue they have implicity made this choice by choosing to remain living in Israel but then this applies to the whole jewish Israeli population as well.  Furthermore, if we start from the point of view that there is an ongoing war between Gaza and Israel and that both sides would like to &#8220;win&#8221;, there is no rational way that Gazans can do this by attacking solely Israeli military targets. There is no prospect of their being able to substantially degrade Israeli military might, for example, by firing some rockets over the border.  As a result, the only rational decision, if you accept that there should be war at all, is for the Israelis to attack the Gazan military (which is indistinguishable from what they would terrorists) and for Gazans to attack any Israeli they can reach.  </p>\n<p>This is not to say the whole sorry affair has any morally good actors.
