I&#8217;m not sure the line is all that sharp, and I&#8217;m also not sure we haven&#8217;t crossed it already. (The Phalanx automated cannon, which is meant to protect ships at sea from cruise missile attacks, can be set to engage targets without human intervention \u2014 and that&#8217;s a technology that goes back to the 1970s.) Still, there are classes of robotic weapons that we can now choose to develop, or not.
