But here I just want to share my thoughts as a student who was offered to study in a US university (among other countries) and based on the opportunities usually provided to such a student both during the study and after the graduation (of course some not guaranteed) by the government decided to move here to build his life and career, and is easily confronted with someone saying \u201cwhy you just don\u2019t go back to where you came from.\u201d, or a sugarcoated version it.</p>\n<p>. </p>\n<p>As any other society, Americans are divided on their \u201cAmerican dream\u201d which is understandable, but to me, the most disturbing is how big is the gap between ideals of the parties. At least morally, aren\u2019t people of a nation responsible for disclaiming the opportunities/promises as a whole nation? Aren\u2019t they responsible for the consequences of new decisions they make as a whole nation? Is it OK to have a semi-revolution (every 4 years with almost fifty percent chance)  and ignore the consequences it has to the life of minorities mostly affected by it? This time coin comes as a tail, and I should read all the news to see what is signed in the first week, what is specified in the draft of a document and what is left vague, and how my life is affected depending on the interpretation of some vague lines. Of course, even me myself should ignore all this when I see troubles coming for all the other people affected by these signatures, when you might have a friend who counting on her valid multiple entries US VISA is back to Iran to visit her mother who was treated with cancer, and now is denied from returning to continue her PhD, at least for now.</p>\n<p>These might be some fluctuations from the historical point of view (which I don&#8217;t think it is), or might be ignorable in statistics and percentages (which I don&#8217;t think it is), but in short time scales, it will affect individual lives in very extreme ways.

But, OK&#8230;</p>\n<p>For me, before 1948, Zionism meant the belief that the tiny population that had produced Einstein, Bohr, Born, von Neumann, Bethe, Ehrenfest, Jacobi, Noether, Hadamard, Minkowski, Hausdorff, Tarski, Erd&ouml;s, and Ulam, but which the rest of the world tended to murder at every possible opportunity, should probably have a place to protect it from being murdered; that it might as well be the tiny sliver of land that they were indigenous to, had maintained a continuous presence in for millennia despite multiple conquests and expulsions, and had prayed the whole time they&#8217;d eventually return to; that resettlement of that place would need to be via voluntary purchases of land and &#8220;win-win&#8221; economic cooperation with all its inhabitants and neighbors, with the aim being to build a democratic society that, while it existed to protect a particular population from being murdered, would be open to all religions and ethnicities as well.  In the wake of the Holocaust, the UN formally agreed, when it created two states in Palestine, one Jewish and one Arab&#8212;a proposal that decent people of all political persuasions and backgrounds still support today.  (Over the past two days, I&#8217;ve been delighted to find out how many of my Iranian friends and colleagues support it.)</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the local Arab leadership, much of which had enthusiastically allied itself with Hitler (and supported his Final Solution) during World War II, then launched multiple wars of extermination against the Jewish part of Palestine.  Facing absurd odds, Israel successfully repelled those attacks, while also absorbing 850,000 Jews expelled from Arab countries, expulsions that produced no outcry from anyone.  But the constant battle to survive changed Israel&#8217;s own character, eventually turning it into an occupying power itself, a situation that many of us who believe in the original Zionist vision abhor and want to see reversed.</p>\n<p>But regardless of where one stands on that question, today &#8220;Zionism&#8221; simply means the belief that a currently-existing country, which happens to be a scientific and technological powerhouse, should not be destroyed and its current inhabitants murdered or expelled, any more than the same should happen to the US, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, or the countless other countries whose creation displaced earlier inhabitants in orders-of-magnitude less morally defensible ways than was the case here.</p>\n<p>Or to put it differently, Zionism is a philosophy without which perhaps 30% of my theoretical computer science colleagues wouldn&#8217;t exist, their families having been murdered, and without which my wife&#8217;s family in particular wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<p>So, if you read the Jan. 27th update to this post&#8212;about how my interest is in the safety and welfare of the actual scientists and thinkers (of whatever backgrounds) who I actually meet, rather than in destroying the world&#8217;s current scientific talent pool in a cleansing fire, in order to recreate it along more utopian lines&#8212;you&#8217;ll see why Zionism is simply a logical consequence of my more fundamental commitments.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2017-01-27 14:05:08+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Huge amount of comments and the short time to read all of them:)<br />\nfirst point dear professor, you never live in IRAN so you never ever can taste your government policies in other countries.

Have you ever wondered why the Christian population of Bethlehem has plummeted since 1947? 85% of the population then; 54% in 1967; became a minority in the 1990s (Oslo Accords, anyone?); about 12% today.

The Iranian people have an ancient culture and intellectual tradition of which they are justly proud. It is thus to Obama&#8217;s ever-lasting shame that he didn&#8217;t support the Green Revoltion of 2009 to overthrow this tyrannical regime.</p>\n<p>BUT &#8212; and it is a critical &#8220;but&#8221; &#8212; it IS the Iranian regime that is in power, whether we like it or not, and that regime has been both brutal to its own citizens (God help you if you&#8217;re gay in Iran), and has been actively exporting, supporting, and promoting terrorism around the world. Iran-sponsored terrorist bombings leading to hundreds of deaths (an incomplete list): US Embassy in Beirut, 1983; Beirut barracks, 1983; Buenos Aires Israeli Embassy, 1992; Buenos Aires Jewish Center, 1994; Khobar Towers, Saudi Arabia, 1996. Iran&#8217;s long-standing and on-going support for the terrorist organizations Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad, which has led to the deaths of thousands of Israelis, not to mention terrorizing Palestinians and Lebanese as well. And Iran&#8217;s attempt to extend its hegemony, by force, in Iraq and Syria, completing its Shia path to the Mediterranean Sea.</p>\n<p>Shabnam, #14: your remark that &#8220;Israel influence on US policies make the situation worse&#8221; is at best ill-informed. You are not, I assume, on the potential receiving end of threats from an Iranian regime that has not only been shouting &#8220;Death to the Jews&#8221; and &#8220;Death to Israel&#8221; for the past 38 years, but has been actively advancing toward that heinous goal, both through conventional means (Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad) and through extensive, hidden, lied-about nuclear bomb-making efforts, now further aided and abetted, unfortunately, by Pres. Obama&#8217;s disasterous JCPOA &#8220;deal.&#8221; Add to that the active Holocaust denial promoted by Iran, and it is indeed a deadly threat that Israel and Jews world-wide take very, very seriously. What is it about &#8220;I intend to kill you&#8221; that&#8217;s hard to understand?</p>\n<p>I agree 100% with melanoga (#49): The comparison between Pres. Trump&#8217;s temporary halt and review of immigration from countries of concern, and Jews seeking to immigrate (mostly) from Germany in the 1930s is patently absurd. (Comparison of 1930s Jews with 2010s Syrian Christians is fair, albeit a comparison of entirely different magnitude.)</p>\n<p>Iman, #54: You remind me of Linda Sarsour (most recently a leader of the Women&#8217;s March on Washington) being an apologist for Sharia law and for the world&#8217;s worst oppressor of women: &#8220;I don&#8217;t drink alcohol, don&#8217;t eat pork, I follow Islamic way of living. That&#8217;s all Sharia law is.&#8221;  &#8220;You&#8217;ll know when you&#8217;re living under Sharia Law if suddenly all your loans & credit cards become interest free.

In particular, I suggest you study the large extent of and reasons for Arab immigration into Palestine in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (for where all these &#8220;Palestinian&#8221; Arabs are actually hail from, see here: <a href=\"http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2014/02/zionists-trying-to-hide-canaanite.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2014/02/zionists-trying-to-hide-canaanite.html</a>), as well what the word &#8220;indigenous&#8221; means (Jews are from&#8230;Judea?) [FYI: &#8220;Palestina&#8221; was a word co-opted in 135 CE by the Roman Empire in an attempt to erase the Jewish presence in the land called until that time &#8220;Judea&#8221;; the word derives from the no-longer-existent Philistines {Semitic for &#8220;invader&#8221;; they came from Crete}, who invaded Canaan around 1500 BCE.]<br />\n &#8211; Second, Israel built the wall specifically to stop suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian terrorists against Israeli citizens (Jews, Muslims, Christians, Bahais, and Druze, and probably others). It has proven effective.

It seemed like a genuine, non-rhetorical question.</p>\n<p>I should offer the caveat that I&#8217;m perfectly aware that the US immigration system, at least as it pertains to nice educated people like us (although Mohammed Atta was not exactly uneducated), who just have a small GPS-coordinates-of-birth problem, is a total disaster and nightmare that does inexplicable and cruel things all the time to all sorts of innocent people.  </p>\n<p>In fact, I know it so well that it&#8217;s hard to get any emotional shock from some new random bureaucratic mass f*cking-over.  DC is DC and does as DC does.  (This dark pattern of winking at the abusers, while abusing the legitimate customers, is what Sam Francis called &#8220;anarcho-tyranny.&#8221;)  </p>\n<p>The shock in your case is obviously genuine, since the f*cking-over is happening to someone close to you.  Hopefully you can admit, though, that there is a lot of narcissistic, motivated false political emotion going around these days.</p>\n<p>If you and the community actually want to solve the problem, rather than contribute to this wave of emotion, it is probably best to explain it in terms of the mentality of the people who made it.  After all, they are the people you&#8217;ll have to petition to fix it.  </p>\n<p>A good argument in this direction, for instance, might be: &#8220;take Iran off the list and put Saudi Arabia on it, because as of right now Iran is fighting ISIS and Saudi Arabia is funding the bastards.&#8221;  This is the kind of argument you could make to Steve Bannon.  </p>\n<p>Do you know anyone who knows Steve Bannon?  Anyone who knows anyone who knows him?  If so, and you want to actually solve the problem, surely it&#8217;s worth addressing your complaints in this direction, and formulating them in a form he&#8217;ll understand.  I think he&#8217;s probably heard _Imagine_ before.</p>\n<p>In order to do this or anything like it, you need exactly the intellectual context you were asking for (perhaps rhetorically).  Sharing one such perspective, or at least trying to share it, is completely different from &#8220;advocating&#8221; some kind of &#8220;preferred policies.&#8221; </p>\n<p>I just think smart people should have a good practical grasp of actual historical reality as it actually happened.  This (as I see it) is a little bit different from what you get in school these days, though less in concrete facts than interpretations. And it includes being able to solve a simple &#8220;ideological Turing Test&#8221; for any recent period.  As Cicero said, those who fail to understand history will always remain children.</p>\n<p>A good way to frame this test is to ask what the best minds of some other period would make of ours.  Once you can pass this test for a period, I&#8217;d argue, you can feel comfortable about applying the lessons of that period to our present reality.  </p>\n<p>Until you feel you can pass this test, I think, try another period.  Or try an argument that doesn&#8217;t need to use history as a weapon.</p>\n<p>Historically, it&#8217;s in turbulent periods like this that understanding our enemies is the most important possible thing.  I&#8217;m not trying to persuade anyone of anything.  I&#8217;m just trying to give people some tools which I think solve the problem in a neat way.</p>\n<p>And two, on &#8220;return to the past&#8221;: I would argue that what some historians call &#8220;presentism,&#8221; basically racism as applied to the past, is fundamentally a problem that can&#8217;t be worked around.  It has to be solved.  A presentist society is a suicidal society.  Feel free to disagree with me on this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Frame them&#8221; is just amazing.  Everyone in the modern world is so experienced in solving Keynesian beauty contests.  It&#8217;s a basic bureaucratic skill.

It is non trivial to manage land.  In fact it is quite difficult.  The typical serf was simply incapable of doing it.  It is even harder to manage even the simplest things collectively.  This led to a series of ever worsening crises, where the problems of socialism were solved with even more socialism, that ratchet of progress of which you are so fond, that eventually resulted in Alexander&#8217;s royal descendents being murdered, and then a very large proportion of the peasants also murdered, mostly those peasants that showed any competence in managing a farm.</p>\n<p>In America, the ratchet of progress has caused the collapse of the health care system &#8211; no matter how much money you have, you cannot actually buy health insurance that will insure you against a broken leg, and when you turn up at hospital with a broken leg that your insurance does not cover, you will find in front of you one hundred drug addicts trying to get free drugs and a hundred vagrants trying to get free bed and free food.</p>\n<p>Doubtless if Obama was still in charge, he would have fixes for this  crisis, applying the ratchet of progress, much as the Tsars had fixes for the emancipated serfs on collective farms, applying the ratchet of progress.  Trump is arguably letting it collapse, but it was already collapsing and collapsed before his inauguration.</p>\n<p>Doubtless you are confident those fixes would have worked, unlike the Tsar&#8217;s fixes for collective farms, but what I saw on the streets during Trump&#8217;s inauguration gives a very different impression.</p>\n<p>Yes, I think the people fixing our healthcare system are much the same people as were setting fire to cars in Washington, and their fixes, though more complex and expressed in vast piles of paperwork, are as well thought out and have similar consequences.  In the end, their fixes for the health system rest upon &#8220;You did not build that&#8221;, the same foundation as led to those cars being torched.</p>\n<p>You are in a bubble, and outside the bubble there is a whole raft of indicators, for example the collapse of the family, that the ratchet of human progress is having bad consequences that will shortly lead to far worse consequences.</p>\n]]>", "author": "jim", "published": "2017-01-28 09:28:44+00:00", "title": "By: jim"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>The alliance between the Populares and the Samnites much resembles the alliance between the Democratic party and the Muslim brotherhood, and the alliance between the State Department and Al Qaeda.</p>\n<p>The Populares wanted a better and fairer Roman Empire in which subject peoples like the Samnites were better treated.

This is not about science or excellence or competitive hiring or the capacity and willingness of certain people for high-level sustained mental work. This is about being human and overcoming the stranglehold of nation states that feel they have to talk about how great there values are or were or will be again and who feel the need to wave flags to reassure themselves of who they are (members of a rather arbitrarily chosen set of people). I see the tendencies to close borders and keep people out (not just in the US but in other parts of the world as well) as dangerous to the grand project of humanity as a whole to realize its full potential, not (just) in science or engineering, but in being what makes them unique: Human.

They are happy about this decision. Now they will start to say that, you see US is really your enemy. Many liberal students may start to hate US even more.<br />\n3. Managing an alliance with Russia, might help but US to control Iran by Russia`s help. But why US did not use its power to control Saudi Arabia in the first place? Because there are things that Saudi Arabia can`t or does n`t want to do. If you really want to stop terrorist from middle east, you must end this hatred.

This means that the Swiss that actually know foreigners personally want them to stay, whereas those that only hear about them in the media (probably some hate-propagator like Breitbart) want them to go.</p>\n<p>To blame foreigners for the actual problems happening now in the world (skyrocketing inequality, stagnant wages, job insecurity) is classical scapegoating. All of this is happening because of too few leftwing policies, not too much. Ditto for terrorism: the two most high-profile terrorist groups, Al-Qaeda and Daesh, were created as a direct consequence of the arming of the Mujahideen by the US, and the invasion of Iraq again by the US. Both policies were strenuously opposed by the left, if you remember.</p>\n<p>Look, if your goal is to fight terrorism and economic inequality I am on your side.

The Museum basically gathered dust for another half millennium and then was burned either by the Christians or the Muslims, or possibly both.  </p>\n<p>No one has come down to explain to us how, exactly, before Ptolemy VIII the Alexandrian intellectuals were shitting all over the Alexandrian non-intellectuals.  But I&#8217;m sure it was something.</p>\n<p>A more proximate case of this is the Russian Revolution, which arose from a situation in which all the world&#8217;s intellectuals, with very few exceptions even inside Russia, despised the old regime and equated &#8220;progress&#8221; with &#8220;democratic revolution.&#8221;  The Russian situation was a vicious cycle: the attitude of the intelligentsia drained all the brains out of the old regime, which led it to imitate the hostile stereotype put forward by its enemies.  </p>\n<p>The result, of course, was the death of not only hundreds of millions of innocent people, but pretty much all the Russian intelligentsia.

You still get mad props for actually having performed something like this exercise!  But I would not recommend _Slavery as a Positive Good_ (which I haven&#8217;t read) or in fact almost any work of period political rhetoric.</p>\n<p>Such a work is public propaganda that&#8217;s designed to impress the audience of its time.  If you want to read propaganda from 1860s, that&#8217;s an interesting exercise, but again, read both sides; and bear in mind that whether it&#8217;s coming from the North or the South, it will generally sound batsh*t as f*ck.

If you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s actually going on it&#8217;s hopeless.  The one thing you need to understand a period is a sensitive, informed and realistic voice you can actually trust.  You won&#8217;t find this in works of a basically rhetorical character.</p>\n<p>The most important corrective fact to the 21st-century understanding of the period is that in a sense, we&#8217;ve adopted the Confederate theory of the war.  That is: we think of the war as a great military crusade against slavery.</p>\n<p>If you espoused this theory in a bar in Atlanta in 1861, they&#8217;d buy you another beer.  If you did that in Chicago, you&#8217;d get punched in the mouth.  If this is not obvious to you, you had probably best refrain from weighing in on the argument between Atlanta and Chicago.  Why do you think the Emancipation Proclamation was controversial?</p>\n<p>The way I try to explain the war is like this: at the time, Boston (as is its wont) was convulsed by a number of moral crusades.  Slavery was not the only target &#8212; two others were polygamy and drink.  Maine, which was to Massachusetts as Afghanistan is to Pakistan, had already abolished the Demon Rum.  The US had also sent an army to Utah to intimidate the Saints into giving up polygamy.</p>\n<p>To understand the objective causal role of slavery in the conflict without overloading your emotional receptors, replace slavery with alcohol.  Shall the Territories be wet or dry?  Is drinking doomed with the progress of society, or will bourbon spring eternal in Kentucky?</p>\n<p>Before the beginning of the conflict, about 1830, the South had a general distaste for slavery and was moving toward abolition.  Virginia almost passed an abolition resolution.  </p>\n<p>But what moderns can&#8217;t understand, because we&#8217;ve lost almost all our political reflexes, is that the South found it intolerable to be *forced* to change its laws and customs by the alien North.  If the dispute had been over alcohol, you&#8217;d see easily that the specific question of drinking laws is secondary to the much more relevant political question of *who makes the laws*.  </p>\n<p>If Boston can ban multiple wives in Utah and the gin-and-tonic in Charleston, it can ban anything anywhere.  To the South, the question was simply whether Boston would rule Charleston, and impose its own prejudices and beliefs on Southern society.  The question was not symmetrical, because (contrary to the &#8220;Slave Power&#8221; conspiracy theory of the time) Charleston never had any idea of conquering Boston.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the abolitionists in Boston were a small minority in the overall population of the North.  Most of the North, and certainly the Northwest, fought not out of proto-humanitarianism, but out of nationalism.  It was explicitly about power for them.  </p>\n<p>And to the extent that it was about issues, an &#8220;antislavery man&#8221; as opposed to an &#8220;abolitionist&#8221; hated African-Americans about as much as he hated slavery.  This seems like a contradiction to us, but it&#8217;s really quite straightforward if you think about it.</p>\n<p>This is why Southern polemicists used to say that &#8220;slavery was the occasion of the war, not the cause of the war.&#8221;  Again, if we replace the devil slavery with the demon rum, we see clearly that Lewis Carroll is right as always.  &#8220;The question is who is to be master, no more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Also note that if you do take the Confederate theory and view the Civil War as a public-policy initiative whose goal was to improve the lives of African-Americans, how&#8217;d that actually work out for them?  By some estimates, about a quarter of black Americans died during or after the war, and de facto agricultural slavery had been reimposed by the 1870s.  No one from the slave narratives speaks well of the late 1860s or 1870s &#8212; to say the least.</p>\n<p>Similarly, WWII was neither a policy designed to help the Jews, nor a policy that was effective in helping the Jews.  When success as defined in hindsight is neither the intended goal of a policy, nor the actual outcome of a policy, it seems hard to describe that policy as prudent, no?  </p>\n<p>Actually, you will not find anyone before either war who is arguing for any such crusade &#8212; except for a few radicals like John Brown.  Yet it happened, and so had to be retconned into something that seems like it might have been a good idea.</p>\n<p>The best period history of the Civil War I know is that of George Lunt, actually a Massachusetts man who published this work in Boston in 1865.  Carlyle linked me to it.  I know nothing about Lunt, except that he had to have his pants specially altered so he could walk around with watermelons in his underwear:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/originoflatewart00luntge\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://archive.org/details/originoflatewart00luntge</a></p>\n<p>This is straight-up history in the style of Thucydides.  For a more personal memoir, I really like John Wise, the son of the Virginian governor Henry Wise who hanged that original American terrorist, John Brown.  He wrote this in 1901 and it still reads quite well:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=mgITAAAAYAAJ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://books.google.com/books?id=mgITAAAAYAAJ</a></p>\n<p>Finally, the great unknown classic of the period is Edgar Lee Masters&#8217; biography of Lincoln, written in the &#8217;30s, _Lincoln the Man_.  Masters was from Illinois and knew many people who&#8217;d known Lincoln.  Imagine if a country&#8217;s leading poet wrote a biography of its founding revolutionary hero, it wasn&#8217;t a positive biography, it was almost banned, and 80 years later basically no one has read the book.</p>\n<p>On slavery: I honestly do not think any 19th-century writer can speak to the 20th-century mind well enough to explain slavery.  The closest you might get could be George Fitzhugh, a wonderful writer who was basically the Confederate Hunter S. Thompson.  But it&#8217;s still hard.</p>\n<p>Instead I would recommend three sources: (1) Eugene Genovese&#8217;s _Roll, Jordan, Roll_ (from the 70s, Genovese was a Marxist at least when he started writing this), which is long and not online; (2) the FDR-era slave narratives, which are online and long (but unedited, so you can sample randomly and it&#8217;s actually random); and (3) Robert Nozick&#8217;s _Tale of the Slave_, which is short and online:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Roll-Jordan-World-Slaves-Made/dp/0394716523\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/Roll-Jordan-World-Slaves-Made/dp/0394716523</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/about-this-collection/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.loc.gov/collections/slave-narratives-from-the-federal-writers-project-1936-to-1938/about-this-collection/</a> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/nozick_slave.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/nozick_slave.html</a></p>\n<p>Nozick is a little coy about his conclusion, which is simply that if the word &#8220;slavery&#8221; means anything, it just means &#8220;government,&#8221; except on a small scale.

At home his leadership and massive popularity were unquestioned. Abroad he symbolised the struggle for independence of small nations in a world dominated by great powers. There are very few heads of state whose death will cause such sorrow in all continents. I feel this sorrow myself for I greatly admired him and felt him to be my friend.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Your whole worldview is based on the belief that there are two separate things, &#8220;Communism&#8221; and &#8220;liberalism.&#8221;  Or maybe three things, &#8220;Communism,&#8221; &#8220;socialism,&#8221; and &#8220;liberalism.&#8221;  Or maybe infinitely many shades of overlapping nuance, which prevents any label at all from being fair.  Are you familiar with Occam&#8217;s razor?</p>\n<p>For example, suppose I were to say: &#8220;it&#8217;s unfair to blame the Holocaust on fascism.  First of all, the Holocaust was committed by Nazis, and not every fascist is a Nazi.  Second, it was actually enacted as a wartime military secret by a small (less than 1000) group of radical, extremist SS-men.  Most Germans and most Nazis never heard about the Holocaust, or heard only rumors they would have had no reason to trust, and they never would have approved of the mass murder of Jews as a public policy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These facts are historically true.  But I would not make this argument.  In my mind, as in yours, the Holocaust is inextricably connected with the SS, the Nazis, the fascists, right-wing extremism in general, right-wing politics in general, and so down to Jeb Bush.  </p>\n<p>The connection to Jeb Bush is pretty weak, but it&#8217;s real.  So is the connection between Hillary and Stalin &#8212; and it&#8217;s a hell of a lot closer.  But we tend to not be very lenient toward, say, someone in Vichy France whose &#8220;opposition&#8221; to the Holocaust was that he didn&#8217;t believe the Jews should be killed, only deported to Madagascar.  This is roughly the position of Bertrand Russell, reflected in the left/right mirror.</p>\n<p>If someone told you that &#8220;real fascism has never been tried,&#8221; you&#8217;d laugh at them, because you&#8217;d recognize the use of No True Scotsman and the flouting of Occam&#8217;s Razor.  Fascism is being artificially divided into two categories, good and bad, in order for good-fascism (say, Salazar in Portugal) to be separated from Hitler.  So the problem isn&#8217;t rightism or fascism.  It&#8217;s Hitlerism.  This is the use of the word &#8220;Stalinism&#8221; in 20th-century liberal discourse.</p>\n<p>We just can&#8217;t get anywhere in discussing 20th-century history if we persist in little idiocies like this.

If it fails this approval, why convince anyone to believe it?</p>\n<p>Nows, there is no instance anywhere or anywhen of this drug being applied without significant acute morbidity.  Even in the fall of the Soviet Union, even in the American Revolution, there is serious social morbidity. Standards of civilization are lost that seem unlikely to be regained. The quality of government as administered by the new regime is visibly lower in many ways.  Did the American Revolution result in&#8230; lower taxes?  Uh huh.</p>\n<p>And these are the good outcomes!  More frequently, as in France in 1789 and Russia in 1914, we see enormous clinical disasters.  The patient is rushed to the ER and is lucky to only lose a leg.  Or dies a month later, of sepsis.  Sure, it&#8217;s the sepsis that killed him, not the drug.  Tell that to the FDA.</p>\n<p>The excuse given for these disasters is always as farcical as that.  Russia and France and Syria have two revolutions, not one.  The first revolution is the good one.  The second, which usurps it, is bad.  Sure, but you couldn&#8217;t have the second without the first.  It&#8217;s like saying that the cure for stage II melanoma is stage I melanoma.  And Occam&#8217;s razor is nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p>It certainly helps that the impact of democratic revolution on the Anglosphere has been weaker than its impact on the rest of the world.  Most diseases exhibit the strongest resistance in the area of their origin.  And a poison that makes you sick, but kills your enemy, is an excellent and devilish weapon.</p>\n<p>And yet, how can we dispute the acute impact?  Despite being stricken by all these revolutions and civil wars, Anglo-American civilization has gone to the moon, split the atom and conquered the world.  Somehow, the acute measurable impact of each of these revolutions is negative, but their unmeasurable net impact is positive.  Uh huh.</p>\n<p>I value accurate predictions about out-of-sample data &#8212; how about you?  If Dostoyevsky predicts that democracy in Russia will be a disaster, and Tolstoy predicts that it&#8217;ll be great, and it&#8217;s a disaster, Dostoyevsky is validated and Tolstoy is discredited.  </p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t this also the way the FDA thinks?  But does it seem to you as if our classically Enlightened liberalism actually worked that way?</p>\n<p>The trouble is basically that sovereignty is conserved.  If you try to design a political system that discards some element of sovereignty, like the right of the state to promote truth and suppress error, a parallel, informal state will rush into this gap and fill it.</p>\n<p>Since control over information is incredibly powerful in the age of broadcast media, this parallel state will become the strongest organ in the actual government.  It will be completely irresponsible and unaccountable, since it&#8217;s not even part of the official state.  But there is no political, economic, or intellectual check on its operations.  Once again, sovereignty is conserved.</p>\n<p>This sovereign information-delivery system naturally assumes the religious imperiousness we expect from an intellectual sovereign.  It is also disorganized, centerless and leaderless, which means there is no possible way for it to feel pity or shame.  Sound familiar?</p>\n<p>There is no way to disestablish religion.  It&#8217;s just an unsolvable engineering problem.  If the state disavows its religious authority, all it&#8217;s doing is disavowing control over that authority.  Which leaves said authority in a perfect position to control the state.  So the nominal objective of separating church and state leads naturally to the theocratic state.  This is not a new phenomenon in Anglo-American history.</p>\n<p>Even if you don&#8217;t care about quality of government, but just about quality of thought, putting the church in charge of the state &#8212; ie, the nerds in charge of the jocks &#8212; has a nasty effect on quality of thought.  Thought is distorted not by the repulsive force of a fascist jock state that discriminates against nerds, but rather by the attractive force that offers free power to power-craving nerds.</p>\n<p>The state which disavows religion is basically a flawed engineering structure that&#8217;s leaking power.  The power leak has a horrific evolutionary effect on the nerd population, basically favoring sniveling, student-government weasels over good sensible open-minded people.  Noticed anything like this around you?  Anyone?  Bueller?</p>\n<p>This is only one of many reasons why humanity flourishes under leaders who unite both nerd and jock qualities, ie, true aristocracies, and has serious difficulties when these qualities are opposed or even just divided.  </p>\n<p>The late Roman Empire had a bizarre system of separation between political and military bureaucracies, specifically designed to prevent the creation of any Scipios or Caesars.  The result was an empire operated by a coalition of fops and boneheads.  Not a good look &#8212; and we&#8217;re not that far from it.</p>\n<p>As for what you *believe in*, I believe these qualities are also fine and good and true.  But qualities of government don&#8217;t come from wishes and unicorns.  They are produced by political machines, which have to obey the laws of political engineering &#8212; as laid down not by Spinoza and Mill and Jefferson, but Aristotle and Machiavelli and Hobbes.</p>\n<p>Take free speech.  Free speech is much easier to implement under an &#8220;absolute&#8221; regime that doesn&#8217;t leak power &#8212; for one thing, if the state has no reason to care what you think, it has no reason to censor you.  And its official religion can just be science and truth; since you don&#8217;t vote, it has no motivation to delude you.  And aren&#8217;t you already pretty done with &#8220;populism&#8221;, anyway?</p>\n<p>(In my mind, the #1 resource for learning to think in this way is James Burnham&#8217;s _The Machiavellians_.  This is a summary of the Italian School of political science, whose leading figures are Vilfredo Pareto and Gaetano Mosca.

It is nice someone taking an honest look at those events.</p>\n<p>For those who are unfamiliar with it, the Rotherham scandal was when 1,400 lower-class British girls were molested by immigrants, mostly Pakistani. The police were getting reports, but they covered it up for years out of fear of being racially insensitive. Eventually it got blown open and was all over the British media, but barely reported in the US outside of Breitbart. The government commissioned investigations and discovered horrific torture of these girls, such as dousing them in gasoline to terrify them out of reporting their rape. And Rotherham isn&#8217;t alone: similar events are happening in other cities with large Muslim populations.</p>\n<p>Scott, you are taking a principled stance by opposing the coverup of Rotherham. It also makes a lot of sense that you advocate an immigration policy that favors industrious people who are compatible with Western liberal values. You are also correct to point out the irony of progressives and feminists railing against &#8220;rape apologists&#8221; among white men, and then turning a blind eye to some of the most terrifying examples of rape around, as long as the rapists are non-white and vote to the left. You predicted that backlash would come, a lot of other people did, too, and oh boy, were you correct on that one.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear about what the stakes are: If we continue to see episodes of mass sexual violence towards native women by Muslim immigrants, and terrorist attacks, then there will be an increasing likelihood of violent reprisals by the natives. This could spark a full-on sectarian war with Muslims, who have a reputation for retaliating globally for local insults (see the Free Palestine riots in France). This puts countries at the risk of a civil war. Take a look at the breakup of Yugoslavia to see how this could look. </p>\n<p>In the event of sectarian conflict, it would be a humanitarian disaster that quickly eclipses all supposed gains of immigration. Either the non-elite natives get ethnically cleansed, or the immigrants do. This needs to be accounted for when calculating the expected value of immigration: we need to include the bad scenarios, not just the rosy ones. Let&#8217;s try to avoid this future.</p>\n<p>Utilitarians are fine with accepting the negative externalities of mass immigration as collateral damage, but not everyone shares their view. Whenever the open borders crowd starts trivializing the rates of immigrant crime, whenever they present an increase in terrorism and rape as an acceptable cost of diversity, consider how this sounds to everyone else.</p>\n<p>I think you can agree that if we dropped the entire male population of Somalia into New York city, it would have negative expected value (and cause a ton of crime, collapse of social services, and rape). The difference between you and Bannon is that Bannon believes that we have already hit the point of negative marginal utility of mass immigration from certain Muslim countries and Mexico. </p>\n<p>You may think that he is wrong, but after looking at Rotherham, can anyone say that he is crazy? Obviously, the first priority of Trump&#8217;s team is to tighten the borders and stop the slide of the US towards the constant terror attacks, mass rape, and riots that are now occurring in Europe.

McMasters quotes Hans Morgenthau as follows: </p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that the most momentous issues a nation must face cannot be openly and critically discussed is really tantamount to saying that democratic debate and decision do not apply to  the questions of life and death. &#8230; Not only is this position at odds with the principles of democracy, but it removes a very important corrective for governmental misjudgement.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gen. McMasters goes on to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The disaster in Vietnam was not the result of impersonal forces but a uniquely human failure, the responsibility for which was shared by President Johnson and his principal military and civilian advisors. </p>\n<p>The failings were many and reinforcing: arrogance, weakness, lying in the pursuit of self-interest, and, above all, the abdication of responsibility to the American people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Alas, the Trump Administration is showing, in consequence of willful ignorance driven equally by ideology and self-interest,  all-too-many signs of the same fatally reinforcing failings that Gen.

It is nice someone taking an honest look at those events.</p>\n<p>For those who are unfamiliar with it, the Rotherham scandal was when 1,400 lower-class British girls were molested by immigrants, mostly Pakistani. The police were getting reports, but they covered it up for years out of fear of being racially insensitive. Eventually it got blown open and was all over the British media, but barely reported in the US outside of Breitbart. The government commissioned investigations and discovered horrific torture of these girls, such as dousing them in gasoline to terrify them out of reporting their rape. And Rotherham isn&#8217;t alone: similar events are happening in other cities with large Muslim populations.</p>\n<p>Scott, you are taking a principled stance by opposing the coverup of Rotherham. It also makes a lot of sense that you advocate an immigration policy that favors industrious people who are compatible with Western liberal values. You are also correct to point out the irony of progressives and feminists railing against &#8220;rape apologists&#8221; among white men, and then turning a blind eye to some of the most terrifying examples of rape around, as long as the rapists are non-white and vote to the left. You predicted that backlash would come, a lot of other people did, too, and oh boy, were you correct on that one.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s be clear about what the stakes are: If we continue to see episodes of mass sexual violence towards native women by Muslim immigrants, and terrorist attacks, then there will be an increasing likelihood of violent reprisals by the natives. This could spark a full-on sectarian war with Muslims, who have a reputation for retaliating globally for local insults (see the Free Palestine riots in France). This puts countries at the risk of a civil war. Take a look at the breakup of Yugoslavia to see how this could look. </p>\n<p>In the event of sectarian conflict, it would be a humanitarian disaster that quickly eclipses all supposed gains of immigration. Either the non-elite natives get ethnically cleansed, or the immigrants do. This needs to be accounted for when calculating the expected value of immigration: we need to include the bad scenarios, not just the rosy ones. Let&#8217;s try to avoid this future.</p>\n<p>Utilitarians are fine with accepting the negative externalities of mass immigration as collateral damage, but not everyone shares their view. Whenever the open borders crowd starts trivializing the rates of immigrant crime, whenever they present an increase in terrorism and rape as an acceptable cost of diversity, consider how this sounds to everyone else.</p>\n<p>I think you can agree that if we dropped the entire male population of Somalia into New York city, it would have negative expected value (and cause a ton of crime, collapse of social services, and rape). The difference between you and Bannon is that Bannon believes that we have already hit the point of negative marginal utility of mass immigration from Muslim countries and Mexico. </p>\n<p>You may think that he is wrong, but after looking at Rotherham, can anyone say that he is crazy? Obviously, the first priority of Trump&#8217;s team is to tighten the borders and stop the slide of the US towards the constant terror attacks, mass rape, and riots that are now occurring in Europe. That&#8217;s the big picture here.</p>\n<p>For a more quantitative picture of Muslim immigration, see <a href=\"http://thosewhocansee.blogspot.com/2015/12/why-we-culturally-profile.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> excellent article cataloguing their differences in values with the West, along with disproportionate crime rates, sexual assault rates, and welfare usage. Most of the data comes from news, government publications, and Pew surveys. </p>\n<p>Of course, PhDs and green-card holders get stiffed. I hope that the Trump administration fixes that soon (many observers believe that he is making an opening move and will relax his policy later). I understand why you object to the consequences for science and why you want an immigration policy that focuses on high human capital immigrants with compatible values. </p>\n<p>But keep in mind that your ideal immigration and assimilation policy is currently a fantasy, at least in relation to Muslim countries. No European country has figured out how to construct such a policy, which is why several of them are full of sexual assault, Sharia marches, and terrorism. If you look at the stats link I gave, the gulf between Muslim and Western opinions is gigantic.

McCain:</p>\n<p>As a Marine mom, I am writing to thank you for speaking out against the president&#8217;s recent executive order banning immigrants and refugees from various Muslim countries. As I read in the newspapers, some of the refugees who are banned became refugees simply because they were willing to step forward and act as interpreters for our Marines and for the other services. These people put their lives at risk to help fight radical Islam. They are enemies (not friends) of radical Islam, and as such are targets for assassination in their own countries. Yet here we are, barring them from entry to the USA.</p>\n<p>You are a combat veteran yourself. I believe you understand war as few members of Congress do and certainly better than the new president, who never served a day in the armed services. You know that his action will have the effect of radicalizing even more Islamists than before, both abroad and here at home. This action will, as you said in your joint statement, empower ISIS. I wish you could round up other people in Congress and in the new administration who have served in the military to speak out against this as well.</p>\n<p>Further, as a man who honors religious freedom, I believe you would never paint an entire religion with the broad, ugly brush that our president has used throughout his campaign and now in the first days in office.</p>\n<p>I am so disappointed in the small number of senatorial voices who have joined you in speaking out. I have looked at the websites of many senators just now and did not see many statements by them that they object to this action. </p>\n<p>I hope you can persuade your colleagues not to remain silent any longer. My family suffered from such a silence in Hungary under Hitler, when so-called &#8220;good&#8221; people did not stand up to the tyranny inflicted on a religious group. Every single one of my family who stayed in the Old Country, rather than fleeing, was killed. We have no records of where they are buried. I cannot travel to Hungary and put a pebble on any tombstone, as my tradition commands. </p>\n<p>Silence enables evil.

You are thinking in terms of the discourse.  This prevents you from thinking *about* the discourse.  </p>\n<p>If it didn&#8217;t seem inherently judgmental, I&#8217;d say that you&#8217;re thinking poetically, not scientifically.  I forget who said: politics is bad poetry.  Actually, most politics originates as good poetry.  But as it ages, it becomes a cliche and can&#8217;t help but be bad.</p>\n<p>One of the many privileges of any ruling class is to not be thought *about*.  If you think about the class as a single class, if you give it a single label, it almost seems to have one neck.  A dangerous direction for proles to think of.  Better not to be characterized at all &#8212; to contain all thoughts, to be above all labels.</p>\n<p>Obviously I can&#8217;t endorse this privilege.  Can you?</p>\n<p>So when I think *about* your ideas, or anyone&#8217;s, I have two questions.  One, have I heard these ideas before?  Did the thinker himself (a) invent them himself?  If not, was he (b) reasoned into them?  If not, did he (c) absorb them emotionally at a young age?  Surely you agree that (b) is a hundred times more common than (a), and (c) a thousand times more common than (b).</p>\n<p>Therefore, political beliefs, religions, and other deep traditions are transmitted *genetically* in the broad English sense of the word.  Much as languages are transmitted.  Like languages and like actual DNA, transmission is basically hereditary, though it involves syncretism and mutation.</p>\n<p>Phenotypic, pre-genetic study of phylogeny and linguistics was essentially wasted scholarship.  The 20th-century introduction of cladistic terminology (synapomorphies, and so on) further increased the gap between genetic and literary investigation.</p>\n<p>The power of a cladistic classification is so much greater than the power of a poetic classification that anyone who believes in precise thought and language has the responsibility to shun the latter.  I refuse to use a linguistic tool that classifies bats as birds.</p>\n<p>For example, the flag-wrapping tactic I referred to earlier was often used by 20th-century American leftists, in the day when the left was much weaker and the right much stronger, to confuse and disarm the intruder-detection system of the right.  The &#8220;Jefferson School of Social Science&#8221; and so on was an entirely Orwellian fiction.  Of course, a true leftist would say this was for the greater good &#8212; like punching Nazis.</p>\n<p>For a sympathetic close look at the intellectual tradition whose DNA fingerprint you seem to match, try George Packer&#8217;s _Blood of the Liberals_.  I&#8217;m especially confident about matching this &#8220;accent&#8221; because it&#8217;s my own native tongue.</p>\n<p>A simple, intuitive way to ask this question is: who are the people in 1917 whose beliefs and folkways are closest to 2017 American college students?  You will find these people in Greenwich Village, in London&#8230; in very small numbers.  The tradition that expands the most is the tradition that prevails.  Not coincidentally, this is also how language evolution is studied.</p>\n<p>If you want to learn the more general art of thinking about politics in terms of realities, rather than in terms of symbols, I again recommend Burnham&#8217;s _The Machiavellians_, or Mosca&#8217;s _Elements of Political Science_.  Pretty big upgrade from John Stuart Mill.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Boldmug", "published": "2017-01-31 01:16:50+00:00", "title": "By: Boldmug"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p><a href=\"#comment-1732152\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott</a>, sure, the proletariat was never communist, but neither was it ever liberal.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Douglas Knight", "published": "2017-01-31 01:19:07+00:00", "title": "By: Douglas Knight"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott, they would care because many of their friends and family oppose Trump.</p>\n<p>Protesting an immigration ban by temporarily leaving the country sounds right to me.</p>\n<p>And your argument also goes for participating in a rally: i&#8217;d much prefer to stay at work and help the cause in a way that has a more measurable, if negligible, impact.</p>\n<p>But my point is, if enough people merely threatened to do so, pending a reversal, what would they do?

But certainly just randomly f*cking with peoples&#8217; green cards does nothing to create any such competing fork of science.  </p>\n<p>It would actually take insane measures to fork global society so effectively that it forked science, though I&#8217;d probably be for those measures.  For example, on one side of the divide you might have a high-energy physics that wasn&#8217;t string theory?  But this is a very, very abstract and hypothetical argument on my part.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind, though, that when you stand up for not f*cking with peoples&#8217; green cards, let&#8217;s say at a protest, you are acting in the real world.  Your actions and their effects can and must be evaluated independently of your motivation.  </p>\n<p>You came to the protest because you &#8220;support the rights of science&#8221; or whatever.  But that is the reason you act.  It is not the action itself, which is purely physical in nature.</p>\n<p>As in all political action, unless you yourself are actually the leader, you are delegating your atom of power to a larger political force.  Always and everywhere the effect of any meaningful political action is to support some movement, machine, mafia, monarch, or other political player, in their desire to exercise power.  What else could political action possibly mean?</p>\n<p>In our case, the movement you&#8217;re supporting is the loosely organized (but amazingly well-funded) American left.  This narrative creates political energy in your mind.  You are actually just helping to propel the machine, not to direct it.  But you *feel* the emotional direction, the sense of personal ownership.</p>\n<p>You may have a small direct impact on your issue of choice.  And the victory of the machine (say, impeaching or constraining President Trump) may have a large indirect impact on the issue.  This still has no bearing on the objective activity you&#8217;re engaged in, which is: supporting a political machine.</p>\n<p>You may feel it&#8217;s a good machine, or better than any competitors, and it deserves your support.

Gnosticism by Voegelin&#8217;s definition is acting in the real world, while thinking in an imaginary world of dreams.  </p>\n<p>But since we can see and think only in the dream world, we stand in the hole and keep digging.

He and Hillary destabilized Libya and failed to protect our embassy leaders when every other country had the sense to remove theirs. Someone has already mentioned President Obama&#8217;s drone program. He has unleashed more bombs in more nations than ever, yet his policy tied the hands of military leaders and made many of the results ineffective. He decreased the overall number of forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, and yet he presided over the deaths of three American soldiers for every one of W&#8217;s. This is just a quick list of the failures I remember off the top of my head. Obama gave speeches encouraging people in the Middle East to rise up, and we see what has happened. Obama was not the savior of anyone, and Trump is not Hitler. We need to return to a focus on individualism, and work to try and figure out how to apply at least some of the same common-sense logic used in science to more complex emergent problems like politics. I know this is a big issue today, and largely unsolved, but something is wrong. I&#8217;ll try to explain my opinion.</p>\n<p>Modern liberalism has swept the West. Support for multiculturalism and political correctness is STILL the predominant error being made today (and exhibited in most of the comments in this thread). Obama&#8217;s style and deceptive language is preferred over substance by modern liberals. Here&#8217;s a bad argument in response to this criticism: saying something like &#8220;Hey, I never said I LIKED Iran&#8217;s government.&#8221; Americans are fed up with the double standard, and the moral and historical relativism. Instead of criticizing the change in immigration policy with a rational argument, like saying isolationism leads to *this* list of general negative outcomes, modern liberals are spreading ridiculous talking points we see being repeated in the media. These talking points are supplied by despicable leaders in the democratic party (and no, the republicans aren&#8217;t much better&#8230;but Rand Paul and Justin Amash are better). Another example of a bad argument: saying Saudi Arabia should be on the list of nations is clearly an argument in favor of EXPANDING the severity of this weekend&#8217;s suspension of immigration (not really a &#8220;ban&#8221;). Or pretending every individual sad story of inconvenience means this review of vetting is a mistake in general policy. In Europe, nations are being ruled for long periods of time under martial law, the UK has voted to leave the EU, and hijabs are possibly going to be banned. This is all a reaction to the same &#8220;multicultural/PC&#8221; phenomenon. Americans are witnessing it. Another example of a lame talking point: suggesting there&#8217;s no problem YET *in the United States* with jihadism. Pointing out how more people die statistically by falling out of bed, at the hands of white killers, or by jihadists who were born and raised in America, for instance, are all terrible arguments. We have a problem with jihadism which is already changing the social, economic, and political landscape in Europe.</p>\n<p>Instead of conceding the recent executive order is a campaign promise being fulfilled because of President Obama&#8217;s disastrous reign and expansion of the powers of the Presidency, not to mention part of an ongoing process which will be tweaked, some of the world&#8217;s best and brightest scientists and writers are already pulling the &#8220;Natzi card&#8221; just five days into Trump&#8217;s first term. They refuse to blame Obama. Never mind that Trump has shown a thousand times more action and transparency than Obama did. I&#8217;ll disagree with Trump, probably, about a quarter of the time. When I do, I won&#8217;t point to the color of his hair, parse every single word, or make arguments which support the other side while simply pretending I&#8217;m right. Meanwhile, Obama is already adding to the long list of problems being created by chiming in to further obstruct collective American progress. Americans are tired of being called names and having their nation torn down by intellectual cheerleaders. I can understand feeling like there&#8217;s no other option but to obstruct, but it&#8217;s a childish continuance of the same thing that got you here. </p>\n<p>There are only a handful of people in Congress who truly fight for individual liberty. Members of BOTH parties are misguided &#8211; republicans related to drug and moral issues, and democrats related to &#8230; everything (they&#8217;re batshit crazy). The next thing the democrats will do is try to obstruct republican efforts to reign in Trump&#8217;s power, even though he&#8217;s ASSISTING them in this case, by filibustering the nomination of an originalist on the Supreme Court. Modern liberals who care more about what someone says and the facade they present than what they do (style over substance) caused the Trump phenomenon. Caring only about what happens right now (immediate satisfaction by a bunch of rich people in DC) and bestowing power to federal leaders they don&#8217;t really have is a real problem we should be addressing. Stop overreacting. Stop redefining language. Stop using statistics divorced from good supporting explanations. Stop thinking laws are required to make people equal (as some kind of shortcut). Stop pretending we don&#8217;t have a federal budget. Stop using the &#8220;history repeats&#8221; relativist argument (it doesn&#8217;t repeat, because for one thing time doesn&#8217;t &#8220;flow&#8221;). Stop acting as if the oppressed groups we should be most concerned about are university students, actors, and intellectuals in the West. Stop trying to act as if America has to open up its borders *because* of how it makes terrorists and others FEEL about us. Stop focusing on the mistakes of one nation, and argue about something more fundamental. </p>\n<p>Start championing individual liberty instead of trying to be the gods of altruism for oppressed groups.

In 1930s Germany, a conservative was someone who wished to revive the Hohenzollern monarchy. Think of Paul von Hindenburg or Franz von Papen.<br />\nThe nazis, on the other hand, called traditional conservatives and monarchists&#8221; reactionaries&#8221; or &#8220;Bonzen&#8221; (rich bastards).

Redefining the power position of the White House over USG, to make it much weaker, would be hard.  Redefining it to make it exponentially harder (for instance, the power of a CEO) would be incredibly easy.  (I mean, of course, to contemplate mentally &#8212; not to actually accomplish.)</p>\n<p>There are only two possible impacts of a Trump presidency: some kind of insane auto-coup (see below), or a giant nothingburger like the Nixon and Reagan administrations.  You might notice that &#8220;populism&#8221; (or, to those of us less afflicted by No True Scotsman syndrome, &#8220;democracy&#8221;) elected Nixon and Reagan.</p>\n<p>What impact did these hostile &#8220;populist&#8221; administrations have on the actual USG?  Well.. some.  Not *none*.  I don&#8217;t know &#8211; what impact does a storm have on a coral reef?  There is certainly more sloshing around, way up at the surface.  </p>\n<p>You certainly didn&#8217;t need to *worry* about Nixon.  I think there were a few budget cuts under Reagan.  Being a Schedule C is hazardous, of course, as is being a Hill staffer in a weak / junior district.  But this is a very small number of people compared to the total size of DC.</p>\n<p>Otherwise&#8230; you are being shown the *exception* to the rule.  This illusion is just taking advantage of your instinctive innumeracy.  The USG is a huge, gigantic, immense thing.  It did 10,000 things on December 30 and another 10,000 on January 30.  9,999 of them are exactly the same as they would have been had Hillary won.  </p>\n<p>Control of the White House is relevant and has real consequences for real people, sure.  But&#8230; adjust your eyes, because the rule is always more important than the exception.  If the rule looked at all like it was actually changing, don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d let you know?</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one way to think about the state of democracy in America.  It&#8217;s undergoing a common political transition: moving from a functioning power center to a non-functioning one.  </p>\n<p>This has hilarious linguistic consequences, like a political language in which &#8220;democracy&#8221; is maximally positive, but &#8220;populism&#8221; and still worse &#8220;politics&#8221; carry a severely negative charge.  Uh, last time I checked, &#8220;democracy&#8221; is a property for which it is both necessary and sufficient to put the election winner in charge of the government.</p>\n<p>Historically, the transition from a functioning power center to a ceremonial one is common.  Think of the difference between Elizabeth I and Elizabeth II.</p>\n<p>A simple test is whether we can devise a substantively trivial transformation that removes the suspect institution.  If Elizabeth II had passed away at any point in her not-very-useful life, the impact on both Britain and its government would have been minimal.  The same cannot be said for Elizabeth I.  </p>\n<p>Therefore the Tudor Elizabeth is a functioning organ and the Windsor Elizabeth is a non-functioning organ.  This doesn&#8217;t mean the organ has no use or purpose &#8212; ceremonial monarchy is by far the best way to preclude a real monarch.  Elizabeth II&#8217;s ancestors have served this function since the glorious events of 1688.  It just means you don&#8217;t intervene substantially in actual governance.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a trivial way to show that Washington is already a non-democracy.  Can we construct a nearly-equivalent Washington, which operates under exactly the same rules, but with elected officials who are purely ceremonial?  Well, for one thing, Brussels already works this way.  So we know it&#8217;s possible.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s make a minimal change to Washington, while eliminating elections entirely.  We&#8217;ll just eliminate all elected officials.  Everything else will be the same.  </p>\n<p>No new &#8220;laws,&#8221; or rather, giant collections of vaguely-related patches like a Debian update gone terribly awry.  So we don&#8217;t need a Congress, or any of the army of lobbyists and activists that attends it.  The perfect labor force, they&#8217;ll build the best north wall.  The Supreme Court can appoint its own new members, like Israel&#8217;s.  I love Israel.  They&#8217;re the best.  They have the best wall.</p>\n<p>As for the Presidency, all the agencies can run perfectly well or even better without any sched Cs.  The White House is needed in some cases to resolve actual interagency conflicts.  These can be handled by a device readily available for $6.99, the Magic 8-Ball.</p>\n<p>All three branches eliminated, no enormous impact on reality or even on DC.  Ergo: elected officials are a fraud.  Ergo: democracy itself is a fraud.  And inherently in today&#8217;s real world can&#8217;t be anything else. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s true that the regime (like all regimes, regardless of &#8220;democracy&#8221;) still has to maintain its popularity; but only its popularity relative to any competitor.  It has no competitors.  The closest thing is Trump, but Trump is just the President.</p>\n<p>So this is a basically useless and nearly ceremonial office to which we&#8217;ve in our great wisdom elected Trump.  Of course, if he substantially changes the real-world nature of the office, that&#8217;s totally different. I don&#8217;t see much sign of that yet.  And it&#8217;s hard to even imagine.  Is it even possible?</p>\n<p>If Trump or any President can essentially change the quasi-legal form of government, perhaps acting in a Jacksonian way, that would be a true auto-coup in the Alberto Fujimori tradition.  He would have no choice but to continue across the Rubicon, and simply govern by EO indefinitely.  </p>\n<p>Perhaps this would come after some kind of enabling legislation.  Perhaps it would just mean ignoring Congress, which after all has a popularity of 10% and consists of a collection of crooks, flacks and hacks with the collective charisma of a senile banana slug.  It might even mean defying the much more attractively-dressed judicial branch.  Whose popularity is much higher, surpassing that of investment bankers and approaching the common raccoon.</p>\n<p>I just don&#8217;t think Trump would do it, though.  Also &#8212; I forget the source of the quote, but it is an actual quote from someone who was somehow connected to DC &#8212; &#8220;Trump has no people.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t have regime change without some kind of alternate government, and there is no such thing.  There&#8217;s nothing within three orders of magnitude of being ready to become the next regime.  I mean, is there?  If there is, I don&#8217;t know about it.  Not that I would, obviously.</p>\n<p>And again you&#8217;re just not looking at this kind of operator here, I think.  If it was Elon Musk&#8230; he&#8217;s not eligible, of course.  But perhaps, in the 21st century, that&#8217;s just a technicality.  </p>\n<p>Even Trump 20 years younger might be something different.  But really he&#8217;s this strange, amazing, wonderful creature from the &#8217;50s.  Honestly, I think you should just relax and enjoy the show.</p>\n<p>Actual participation in the governance process, should that become genuinely available to you, is one thing.  Political doomsaying is another.  </p>\n<p>You may not believe any of this other stuff, but I really don&#8217;t think you should be worrying about Donald Trump at all.  I would be super surprised to see any real change in Washington as a result of his administration, and my predictions are often accurate.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Boldmug", "published": "2017-02-01 03:30:19+00:00", "title": "By: Boldmug"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Again and again in his comments here, Boldmug has advanced a dark but interesting thesis.  Namely, that the philosophy of classical Enlightenment liberalism that I cast my lot with, the one that&#8217;s obsessed with science and free speech and error-correcting processes and democratic norms, is <i>always</i> just a Trojan horse, a prelude to a power-grab by violent radicals.  On this view, &#8220;Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9&#8221; is inevitably just a warmup act to the Reign of Terror, as the Russian Revolution is to Leninism, the Iranian student revolution to the takeover by the mullahs, the Arab Spring to violence and chaos and military dictatorships, etc.</p>\n<p>And the American Revolution?  Well, that one seems to have enjoyed a pretty good 240-year run, outlasting even communism and Nazism and a ruinous civil war.  And if, in 2017, the American experiment might finally be finished, then it certainly wasn&#8217;t the Enlightenment faction that killed it!  Our side was ready to keep the Republic alive for quite a while longer, and we could have, if not some for cruel and trivial accidents of electoral politics.</p>\n<p>But in Boldmug&#8217;s view, insofar I understand it, 240 years differ from two months by a mere unimportant constant factor.  The American revolution, too, has now finally succumbed to the same iron laws of history that did in the French and Russian revolutions, and every other attempt to apply the ideals of science and the Enlightenment to human affairs.</p>\n<p>I see the situation differently.  For me, building a robust liberal democracy is a hard and complicated engineering problem&#8212;not unlike building a transistor or a plane.  Even if you know what to aim for (which is already nontrivial), if you get a tiny detail wrong you could fail.  Your plane will stay aloft for a few seconds and then careen out of control; your material will either conduct electric current or not, but surely not conduct <i>only if</i> a smaller current is applied to its surface.  Likewise a violent overthrow of a despotic regime, without <i>extremely</i> careful thought about what comes next, will almost certainly lead to an equally bad or worse regime filling the power vacuum, which is indeed what we&#8217;ve seen again and again.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;d say we&#8217;re fortunate that these observations didn&#8217;t dissuade the Wright brothers, or Bardeen and Brattain and Shockley, or the American revolutionaries!  In each case, even if an engineering problem has the character of balancing a pencil on its tip, a solution might be <i>so self-evidently desirable</i> that it really does make sense just to work on it more and more and more until the pencil stands.  Even then the pencil probably won&#8217;t stand forever, but after it falls we can do a careful postmortem, and try again to rebalance the pencil for an even longer time.

Dutch elm disease originates in China.  Therefore, Chinese elms are resistant to Dutch elm disease.  But not immune! It&#8217;s still a crippling disease in China.

It would be a mistake to conclude from this that Dutch elm disease is good for elm trees, and the Chinese should export it to everyone.  Unless they&#8217;re just plain evil.</p>\n<p>All we have to observe, to show that this is the case, is to show that politics in the Anglo-American tradition (don&#8217;t forget, Marx wrote in the British Library, and his column appeared in the New York Tribune), (a) frequently causes serious damage to Anglo-American countries, and (b) always or almost always has two results in other countries: it either causes massive, traumatic disasters, or brings the country under effective Anglo-American supervision, and/or both.</p>\n<p>That makes exporting politics/democracy it look like a political weapon, which is basically what it is.

What&#8217;s the deal with Trump? Probably mostly ego and wanting BIG money. He probably has little use for the white power nuts and other wackos, other than that they delivered votes to get him elected.</p>\n<p>1.1. Trump might have started out running more or less as a lark, discovered he had traction, and jumped into going for it all. Now he is thinking of outrageous stunts that would be cool to pull off just for fun.</p>\n<p>1.2. Another theory is that Putin has more or less taken over Russia and appears to be amassing big money, maybe trillions. He may well have told Trump that together they could divide up a big pie, as in world size. There is a persistent rumor (part of the &#8220;yellow rain&#8221; leak) that Putin offered Trump 19% of the Russian Oil+Gas company as a gift if he won. Many report the transaction has already taken place. Crazy rumor, or fact? Who knows?</p>\n<p>1.3. Thus it is plausible that his primary motivation is amassing money on a scale that would make a Latin American dictator blush. In this scenario, putting crazies in his administration is just for cover, because it will keep everyone busy organizing protest marches instead of &#8220;following the money&#8221;. The entire &#8220;seven countries banned&#8221; might be just a strategic distraction.</p>\n<p>2. So, how will things play out? Well, there is congress and the courts to consider.</p>\n<p>2.1. Congress: It is likely that even most Republicans in Congress secretly hate Trump for being a buffoon, etc. Due to winning, most hitched their wagon to his train. But many Republicans have serious principles, and the &#8220;Trump Majority&#8221; will start to ablate as various thresholds are crossed. If it starts to look like the &#8220;Trump Revolution&#8221; is going down, the opportunists will bail like, you know, rats from a sinking ship.</p>\n<p>2.2. Courts: Probably all Judges have studied constitutional law, and most take it seriously. The checks and balances built into the constitution have worked pretty well, and most judges respect them. Given that the administration does dozens of things of questionable legality every day, a huge pileup of court challenges will soon develop. The Trump admin will no doubt say &#8220;Old Hat!, we can&#8217;t be bothered with that&#8221;. I doubt if many judges will buy this. This is likely to be the show stopper.</p>\n<p>3.

Usually, Kim Jong Un will win an election with 99% of the popular vote. However, most of us will mistrust these results. We do so because the data is not reliable in our view.<br />\nHowever, none of us has ever seen the North Korean government manipulate the election. Also, Kim Jong Un does not allow election observers to visit the country, so we cannot rely on eye witness testimony. Indeed, it wouldn&#8217;t be too surprising if there were actually not much empirical evidence of manipulated elections at all since the DPRK is so isolated from the rest of the world.<br />\nNevertheless, it is obvious that the election result is fake. We can deduce this from the general observation that even the most revered political leaders will never get that many votes in a free election and also from the fact that the DPRK is a dictatorship. Both of these observations are common sense principles and do not use statistical evidence, but they easily establish that the election statistics in the DPRK are unreliable.</p>\n<p>Obviously, neither Victorian England nor the United States are similar to the DPRK and there is no reason a priori to assume that crime data in either of them has been purposefully forged. Nevertheless, the issue of reliability again comes up.</p>\n<p>An obvious observation is that most statistics on crime rates deal with crime that was actually reported to the police. This means that if a crime is not reported,  it will not show up in the data. Thus, in order for the statistics to be reliable, you have to establish that most criminal acts are actually reported or, in this case, that unreported crime accounts for the same amount of total crime in the countries (or centuries) you want to compare.</p>\n<p>However, there is ample evidence that this is not so.<br />\n1) There were no crime syndicates like modern day Mexican drug cartels (or their European equivalents)  in Victorian Britain. Since most criminal acts by these groups are unreported and it is well established that they earn billions of dollars every year, it is not an unreasonable assumption that they alone are proof of a significant difference in unreported crime between then and now.<br />\n2) There were now no-go areas then, but they exist now. Since a) people in these areas lose faith in the police and tend not to report even violent acts against them and b) the police themselves tend to be present less often in these areas, it is likely that the percentage of criminal acts that are never reported there is non-trivial. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, I have seen no evidence so far that crime in Victorian Britain was underreported. Indeed, Victorians prioritised fighting crime in a way that modern day &#8220;Law-and-Order-Conservatives&#8221; can only dream of, society had zero tolerance for crime (modern day discussions about &#8220;criminal justice reform&#8221; would have lead to social exclusion even among liberals) and, as pointed out by Jim, there is no mention of unsafe areas in books from that time.<br />\nSince intellectuals were free to discuss social problems (unless related to sexuality), it would be surprising if there had been serious problems with crime back then, but no books about them.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Charlie Croker", "published": "2017-02-02 16:01:57+00:00", "title": "By: Charlie Croker"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Joshua #450: I like to think of it as &#8220;evidence that certainty is merely correlated with truth, not (always) caused by it &#8211; or, more confusingly, caus<i>ing</i> it&#8221;.<br />\nArguably it&#8217;s <i>less</i> correlated when politics or rumor are involved, which in turn points to avoiding social media as a matter of epistemic hygiene.</p>\n<p>Raoul Ohio #427, 2.1: Congress hasn&#8217;t had anything resembling popularity for a long time (citation needed), but I suspect some of that may change if Trump makes them look sane by comparison.

That&#8217;s an extremely unhelpful leap to make. </p>\n<p>As for the substance of your statement:</p>\n<p>The declining levels of violence have occurred by many different metrics, in many different societies, not just Victorian England.</p>\n<p>And it is true that there are some factors which would potentially make historical rates seem higher than they would, but some features do not. This is the primary reason that Pinker and others have tried to focus on murder rates- murders are hard to define away and aren&#8217;t going to have reporting issues the same way some other crimes will.  </p>\n<p>In fact, I find it interesting that both you and Jim haven&#8217;t brought up what has been widely acknowledged as the primary problem with this sort of metric- better emergency medical care can make turn violent acts that would be murders into non-murders. This first started getting recognized in the early 2000s (see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/research-finds-us-murder-rate-suppressed-improved-emergency-medical-response\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/research-finds-us-murder-rate-suppressed-improved-emergency-medical-response</a> ) and has become more accepted as an issue. However, at the same time, the differences that result do not look large enough to alter the overall trend.</p>\n<p>As for the idea of &#8220;no-go&#8221; areas- their existence in modern contexts is wildly exaggerated, and at the same time the idea that bad neighborhoods didn&#8217;t exist historically are simply not accurate. Indeed, restricting to Victorian England, substantial sections of East London were considered extremely dangerous.  This is the sort of thing that I&#8217;m referring to when I mention an anti-epistemology at work here: Jim&#8217;s claim that there were no such mentions or discussions simply isn&#8217;t true, but apparently he decided this would be convenient. </p>\n<p>As for the idea that organized crime didn&#8217;t exist, that&#8217;s simply not true.

The critics consider these points to be an absolute gotcha and game-ender. They are considered to be such a knockout punch that they slay the entire trustworthiness of the anti-modern side: they are to now be viewed as irresponsible miscreants, guilty of \u201canti-epistemology\u201d, who\u2019s arguments supposedly collapse when prodded, and can safely be dismissed.</p>\n<p>But before declaring victory over someone in a debate, it\u2019s a good practice to make sure that your supposed knockout punch actually landed, before you bounce around the ring and celebrate. </p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start with Better Angels, the supposed debate-ender on the subject of modern crime. It turns out that there are many criticisms of Better Angels. If these criticisms are correct, then the book is a piece of scientism that cannot be used to decide the debate over modernity.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with using homicide to measure violence is that it is <a href=\"//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1124155/\u201c\" rel=\"nofollow\">confounded</a> by advances in medical technology:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our lethality findings are strongly consistent with the hypothesis that progress in emergency medical care has converted an ever increasing proportion of homicides into non-lethal assaults and thus, by virtue of good intentions, ironically and unintentionally masked a continuing epidemic of violence in America</p></blockquote>\n<p>John Gray in the The Guardian also has a <a href=\"//www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/13/john-gray-steven-pinker-wrong-violence-war-declining\u201d\" rel=\"nofollow\">critical review</a> of Better Angels that is an excellent read. According to Gray, the first half of the 20th century causes big problems for Pinker\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Along with fatalities caused by state terror were unnumbered millions whose lives were irreparably broken and shortened. How these casualties fit into the scheme of declining violence is unclear. Pinker goes so far as\u00a0to suggest that the 20th-century Hemoclysm might have been a gigantic statistical fluke, and cautions that any history of the last century that represents it as having been especially violent may be \u201capt to <em>exaggerate</em> the narrative coherence of\u00a0this history\u201d (the italics are Pinker\u2019s). However, there is an\u00a0equal or greater risk in abandoning a coherent and truthful narrative of the violence of the last century for the sake of a\u00a0spurious quantitative precision.</p></blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAbandoning a truthful narrative of violence of the last century for the sake of a spurious quantitive precision.\u201d Ouch. In other words, Gray is accusing Pinker of scientism. </p>\n<p>Pinker is probably correct that violence has declined up-to the 20th century, but the 20th century itself causes big problems. Gray also points out that if a nuclear war with the Soviet Union had occurred, it would have blown away Pinker\u2019s angelic trends.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take stock. Better Angels was considered to be a knockout punch to anti-modern arguments, ever since Scott Alexander\u2019s Anti-reactionary FAQ. Yet I think we can see from these counterarguments to Pinker, that he is quite busy in his own ring fending off multiple opponents, and not available to deliver the knockout punch.</p>\n<p>So here\u2019s the question: would a neutral observer to this thread figure out the correct answer, that Better Angel\u2019s does not end the debate over modern crime? If someone didn\u2019t read Jim\u2019s links, and didn\u2019t read this post of mine, then it\u2019s quite likely that they wouldn\u2019t, and they would believe that Boldmug and Jim were debunked. And they would be wrong. The consensus of the pro-modern side in this thread would then lead a skimming, neutral observer <em>away</em> from the truth, unless they did their own research.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s going on here is simple. The pro-modern side is deeply uncomfortable with anti-modern arguments. They immediately latch onto any data or stock arguments that they think can shut down the debate, and then they declare victory. This is not the sort of debate tactics that will arrive at the truth.</p>\n<p>I understand why Boldmug and Jim rub some people the wrong way rhetorically, but I believe that superficial dislike of them is motivating knee-jerk, unfair responses to their arguments. It\u2019s an inverse halo-effect. To subtract that inverse halo-effect, let\u2019s take a quote from John Gray\u2019s Pinker review that I mentioned above:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The ancient world, along with all the major religions and pre-modern philosophies, had a different and truer view. Improvements in civilisation are real enough, but they come and go. While knowledge and invention may grow cumulatively and at an accelerating rate, advances in ethics and politics are erratic, discontinuous and easily lost. Amid the general drift, cycles can be discerned: peace and freedom alternate with war and tyranny, eras of increasing wealth with periods of economic collapse. Instead of becoming ever\u00a0stronger and more widely spread, civilisation remains inherently fragile and regularly succumbs to barbarism. This view, which was taken for granted until sometime in the mid-18th century, is so threatening to modern hopes that it is now practically incomprehensible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you can\u2019t hear it from them, maybe you can hear it from him.</p>\n<p>The anti-modern position is that history needs to be evaluated qualitatively using narrative and judgment, and that there is no particular dataset that\u2019s a debate-ender for some of the most interesting questions. </p>\n<p>My view is that plenty of things about the perspectives of Boldmug and Jim are counter-intuitive and debatable, but most of the debate with progressives involves occurs at a shallow and specious level, retracing the same set of arguments from 2013. The knee-jerk responses prevents the debate from moving on to the subjects that are actually interesting, like the details of the engineering project of fixing government, the proper role of the church, imperialism vs nationalism, absolutism, etc. </p>\n<p>Maybe someday we can move past the level of \u201cgotcha\u201d debate and have a real dialogue, because getting political philosophy right is going to be really important for the future of humanity. It\u2019s not as if what we\u2019ve got is working very well.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Bran", "published": "2017-02-02 20:16:55+00:00", "title": "By: Bran"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott #470</p>\n<blockquote><p> These are people who so thoroughly reject the idea of human betterment that they\u2019re eager to make their own lives miserable, just as long as the lives of the know-it-all intellectual snobs become miserable even faster.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Of course, the know-it-all intellectual snobs have given no cause whatsoever to be regarded as such, oh no!

(When it comes to murder, it just seems to me that this crime has been institutionalised in the 20th century as evidenced by the Nazis, the Soviets, the Khmer Rouge etc). </p>\n<p>Even in failed states, criminals won&#8217;t murder you just because they can or to steal your money since murder is the crime that most likely leads to the severest forms of retribution. It is no coincidence that the mafia was originally founded to punish criminals when the victim&#8217;s family thought the criminal&#8217;s sentence was too lenient or there was no punishment by the state at all.<br />\nThere is always a baseline number of murders that you can hardly prevent because they are committed by people with mental illnesses or someone in an extreme emotional state.  For murders to become so important that they meaningfully affect people&#8217;s general sense of safety, that baseline has to be exceeded in a way that was neither present in Victorian Britain nor modern day Britain nor the US or any Western country I can think of in the past years. This is in contrast to countries like Mexico in which murder is frequent and criminal gangs consider it a legitimate act to fight other gangs.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the prevalence of other crimes is evident. Unless you provide me with some source that says that people avoided many areas for fear of being mugged in the past, I will not believe it.<br />\nThis simply contradicts so many other facts; for example, did you know that it was quite common in many Western countries 50 years ago not to lock your door? Where do you see this phenomenon now? I have never seen it anywhere in my entire life.</p>\n<p>Also, no-go areas are not exagerated and are different from places that just have higher crime rates than others.<br />\nTake Berlin. You can watch German prosecutors say on state television that they lack the resources to prosecute drug dealers, even when those violently rob others in certain areas. They are indicted 1 or 2 years after the original crime (if they are ever indicted) and continue breaking the law in the mean time. There are even areas where DHL couriers refuse to deliver packages anymore because they were so often attacked in the past. What statistic could refute this?<br />\nIt is just a sign of a slow breakdown of public order and not comparable to temporary problems with crime in the past.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Charlie Croker", "published": "2017-02-03 00:38:19+00:00", "title": "By: Charlie Croker"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Bran #476, that&#8217;s an <i>incredible</i> ratio of &#8220;liberal tears can&#8217;t melt dank truths&#8221; to actual argumentation.

I do also feel a bit forced to chime in now, when I&#8217;d have rather read about those Victorian crime statistics before trying to wade in. They seem all the rage, and it&#8217;s a subject I have very little knowledge about so I can&#8217;t argue one way or another.</p>\n<p>BUT since I must get my 2p in. If we were to agree that Victorian England was the best society we&#8217;ve seen so far (Steampunk yay!), it&#8217;s worth mentioning that already at that time the English Monarchy was way past its days of absolute power and well within the days of constitutional monarchy. </p>\n<p>And if the power of a sovereign is to set exceptions (Henry the VIIIth made a new religion just to legally shag after divorce), by the late XIXth-earlyXXth century the British Monarchy didn&#8217;t have that power any more.

Anyone care to speculate what would have happened if Victoria had tried the marry-a-divorcee trick?</p>\n<p>Also, there was a moment in the thread when some absolutist regimes of today and the recent past were given an excuse for their problems. They&#8217;re fighting this liberal/progressive empire, and the injustices are simply emergency measures.

The current refugee crisis in Europe being a salient example.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all chaos under heaven, and everyone has problems, we agree. But if the argument is we should value the concentration of power because it results in better societies, well one of those example societies actually wasn&#8217;t that power-concentrated (and really neither is Japan today), and there are many examples to show concentrated power, unaccountable power, power &#8220;to set exceptions&#8221;, is rather shitty for almost everyone under it.

Certain long-winded, cranky intellectuals drop into this thread and take his question seriously, at which point we get into a debate about crime rates, the Enlightenment, and democracy. Some people start scoffing , at which point Boldmug becomes exceptionally long-winded. Snark escalates on both sides. Both sides start grandstanding and trying to reduce each other&#8217;s credibility. Eventually we get all the way to helicopter pilots, like any good discussion about politics.</p>\n<p>What have we learned here? It seems that normally intelligent, virtuous people cannot communicate across a political divide without the claws coming out.</p>\n<p>I hope it&#8217;s possible for the neutral observers to cut through the posturing to the actual arguments here. </p>\n<p>Coming from the anti-Enlightenment side of the debate, here is my question: what is a better approach?</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that you believe that you have a novel historical and political synthesis that opposes modern politics. And you believe that this synthesis is relevant to present questions, including questions that are contentious (like Trump). How do you go about explaining your perspective?</p>\n<p>Obviously, references to hypothetical helicopters seems to be a bad strategy, but what is a good strategy?</p>\n<p>If you give a summary of your perspective, then people start scoffing, and the conversation goes downhill. If you give the long-version, then people get exasperated with all of this detail about something they don&#8217;t want to hear. This reaction also comes from people who advertise how intellectually open-minded and fair they are.</p>\n<p>You could explain your perspective in a try and neutral way, but nobody is going to care. If you use a polemic approach, then you are viewed as a dangerous, irresponsible threat to society (though at least you will persuade some of the onlookers).</p>\n<p>When you engage, your perspective will naturally sound absurd to someone who doesn&#8217;t have the same historical and political background as you do. They think you are full of shit, they think you are deliberately being ridiculous, and there is no way for them to realize that you might possibly not be full of shit without them actually reading particular books, which they are never going to read at the suggestion of someone so incredibly evil as you. Why would someone ever read an old book or your meticulous 7,000 word post which threatens to overturn their sense of themselves as a good person and a member of the club of good people who have already figured out the best moral philosophy? Not going to happen.</p>\n<p>You may feel that their behavior is the rankest sort of Philistinism, but you cannot cure someone of Philistinism by telling them that they are being a Philistine. It&#8217;s never going to work. </p>\n<p>If you believe someone is committing scientism and over-relying on questionable quantitative data with low reliability and validity, then what can you do? The conversation is over. You may believe that their epistemology is dumb, but there is no getting over that. Any arguments you provide will only harden their existing perspective. Question someone&#8217;s epistemology, and they will hate you forever.</p>\n<p>So what can you do? You can try to patiently explain your view, or you can grandstand and try to play to the crowd, or you can do a bit of both. </p>\n<p>Hopefully, if you are in this position, you are in a world where you are just a crackpot, people rightly ignore you, and you should do something more productive with your life. But what if you are not? What if someone in this position actually does have valid arguments?</p>\n<p>If modern political thought hypothetically has gone wrong, how would someone be able to communicate that? Is it even possible? Or are they doomed to be a resented Cassandra-like figure?</p>\n<p>Are we just doomed to believe any political ideology that can take over and call itself the best thing since sliced bread, or, if this situation hypothetically occurred, could we figure out what has gone wrong?</p>\n<p>Is there any way to communicate to people from another political tribe? Or is it simply impossible to have a productive discussion about politics without interpersonal rapport and trust? If so, then we better hope that political communication between adjacent people is enough, and we never have to span any big gaps.</p>\n<p>Is it possible to explain things step-by-step in a cooperative way, between people with very different starting points? Or we just grandstand to the crowd and try to marginalize each other? If cooperative communication can work, is there a way to do this on a timescale that&#8217;s shorter than a matter of decades? We may not have that much time.</p>\n<p>In short, if we were fucked, could we ever unfuck ourselves, or are we just fucked? </p>\n<p>For those who are interested in a relatively less-inflammatory approach to contrarian political theory, check out <a href=\"http://thefutureprimaeval.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog</a>.
