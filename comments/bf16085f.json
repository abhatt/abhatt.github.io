Following Joe Roberts&#8217; text, Elementary Number Theory, a fraction which is closer to a real number x than every other fraction with equal or smaller denominator is called a best approximation of the first kind (BA1, for short) to x. Every convergent of the continued fraction for x is a BA1 to x. </p>\n<p>If a, b are relatively prime positive integers, and if \\(|bx-a|<|dx-c|\\) for all pairs c, d of relatively prime positive integers satisfying \\(d\\le b\\) and \\(c/d\\ne a/b\\), then a/b is called a best approximation of the 2nd kind (BA2) to x. Every BA2 to x is a BA1 to x, but not conversely. A fraction is a BA2 to x if and only if it is a convergent of the continued fraction for x. </p>\n<p>A theorem of Hurwitz states that for every real irrational x there are infinitely many rational approximations a/b with \\(|bx-a|<(\\sqrt5 b)^{-1}\\). So if you use \\(|bx-a|^{-1}\\) as a measure of the merit of the approximation a/b, you&#039;ll find that every real irrational has a sequence of approximations of unbounded merit. If you use \\((b|bx-a|)^{-1}\\), you&#039;ll find that each quadratic irrational has only approximations of bounded merit. The precise behavior of \\(\\log|b\\pi-a|/\\log b\\) as a/b runs through approximations to pi is not known.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Myerson:Gerry.html\">Gerry Myerson</a>", "published": "2017-07-25 03:45:05+00:00", "title": "By: Gerry Myerson"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much for explaining so clearly.<br />\nIn the statement of the Hurwitz theorem, should it be \\((\\sqrt{5}b^2)^{-1}\\)?</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hayes:Brian.html\">Brian Hayes</a>", "published": "2017-07-25 17:13:40+00:00", "title": "By: Brian Hayes"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>The Hurwitz theorem is often stated as \\(|x-(a/b)|<(\\sqrt5b^2)^{-1}\\), but I&#039;ve multiplied through by b.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Myerson:Gerry.html\">Gerry Myerson</a>", "published": "2017-07-26 09:42:58+00:00", "title": "By: Gerry Myerson"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Aha.
