Those \u201cfor sale\u201d domains have hardly content and hence no or only a few links. Other domains are only registered to defend a trademark and do nothing or forward to the main domain of the company. Then there are single-serving sites which typically don\u2019t have many links either.</p>\n<p>The high number of such sites could be surprising, because we don\u2019t encounter them very often. But that seems plausible actually. When browsing the web, you\u2019d expect that we click more often on links to sites that have many inbound links, because, well, there are more links to them. And search engines use the number of inbound links as an important ranking factor, so we are much more likely to be sent to highly connected sites by search engines, too.</p>\n<p>(Note: I\u2019ve not verified these thaughts by looking at collected data.

A crawl starts with an initial set of <em>seed</em> URLs, then follows links found at those sites to explore the rest of the Web. Thus if a site has no inbound links, it can appear in the crawl results only if it is one of the seed URLs. Which leads to the further question: Why would 6.7 million of the seed URLs be sites that no one ever bothers to link to?</p>\n<p>My best guess is that the answer lies in some form of web spam or search-rank manipulation.
