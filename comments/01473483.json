The practice of thinking of strategy as a special form of narrative came into vogue as the 1960s turned into the 1970s, and disillusion set in with the idea that large enterprises and even wars could be controlled by means of a central plan.  Developments in cognitive psychology and contemporary philosophy came together to stress the importance of the constructs through which events are interpreted.</p>\n<p><b>The limits of rational choice</b>&nbsp;[&hellip;] A particularly influential theory was one that stressed the benefits of treating all choices as if they were rational.  Adherents were confident that they, almost uniquely, could offer a theory [&hellip;] in which all propositions could both be deduced from a strong theory and then validated empirically.  Though rational choice theory consistently delivered far less than promised, and its underlying assumptions became vulnerable to a fundamental challenge from cognitive psychology, it was promoted effectively and in a highly strategic manner.  [Its proponents] were not deterred by the widespread apprehension that the theory depended upon an untenable view of human rationality.  The claim, they insisted, was no more than that the premise of rationality helped generate good theory.</p>\n<p><b>Beyond rational choice</b>&nbsp;[&hellip;] A complex theory of decision-making emerged [that] was at all times influenced by the social dimension and emphasized the importance of familiarity; the effort required to understand the distant and menacing; the inclination to frame issues in terms of past experiences, often quite narrowly and with a short-term perspective; and the use of shortcuts (heuristics) to make sense of what was going on.  None of this fit easily with descriptions in terms of the systematic evaluation of all options, a readiness to follow an algorithmic process to a correct answer, employing the best evidence and analysis, keeping long-term goals clearly in mind. [&hellip;] John Lehrer summed up the implications of the research:<br />\n<blockquote>&#8220;The conventional wisdom about decision-making has got it exactly backward.  It is the easy problems&nbsp;&mdash; the mundane math problems of daily life&nbsp;&mdash; that are best suited to the conscious brain. [&hellip;]  Complex problems, on the other hand, require the processing powers of the emotional brain, the supercomputer of the mind.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p> <b>Grand unifying conclusion</b>&nbsp; Feasible global warming strategies depend from twin anchors in quantum theory: the (mathematically rational) quantum radiation transport theory that governs CO2-driven global warming, and the (mathematically rational) quantum thermodynamic theories that govern both the technical feasibility of carbon-neutral production of energy and the efficient uses of that energy in fabrication, concentration, purification, and computation.  </p>\n<p>Concomitantly, the 21st century&#8217;s evolving social constructs (that bridge these two quantum anchors) are surveyed in the evolving, tightly coupled, post-rational strategic narratives of small-&#8220;p&#8221; philosophers (John Rawls, Martha Nussbaum), small-&#8220;h&#8221; historians (Jonathan Israel, Lawrence Freedman), small-&#8220;e&#8221; economists (Francis Spufford, Amartya Sen), and small-&#8220;n&#8221; novelists (Annie Proulx, Dominique Edde, Ted Chiang)&nbsp;&hellip; practitioners whose works, in aggregate, are showing us the opening ways by which &#8220;the supercomputing powers of our emotional brains&#8221; increasingly nourish our shared hopes for the great challenges and opportunities of our century.</p>\n]]>", "author": "John Sidles", "published": "2016-01-10 00:27:18+00:00", "title": "By: John Sidles"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>#Scott 53</p>\n<p>Good answer Scott!  I&#8217;m impressed that you&#8217;re not sucked in by the &#8216;Deep Learning&#8217; hype.  I also think that you were wise to doubt the hype surrounding Bayesianism!  </p>\n<p>Bayesianism is a &#8216;grand unified theory of reasoning&#8217; that all of science be should be based on assigning (and updating) probabilities for a list of possible outcomes; the probabilities are supposed to indicate your subjective degree of confidence that a given outcome will occur.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with an alternative conception of rationality as espoused by David Deutsch.</p>\n<p>David Deutsch in his superb books, &#8216;The Fabric Of Theory&#8217; and &#8216;The Beginning Of Infinity&#8217;, argued for a different theory of reasoning than Bayesianism. Deutsch (correctly in my view) pointed out that real science is not based on probabilistic predictions, but on explanations. So real science is better thought of as the growth or integration of knowledge, rather than probability calculations. </p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s wrong with Bayesianism?</p>\n<p>Probability theory was designed for reasoning about external observations &#8211; sensory data. (for example, &#8220;a coin has a 50% chance of coming up heads&#8221;). In terms of predicting things in the external world, it works very well.</p>\n<p>Where it breaks down is when you try to apply it to reasoning about your own internal thought processes. It was never intended to do this. As statistician Andrew Gelman correctly points out, it is simply invalid to try to assign probabilities to mathematical statements or theories, for instance.</p>\n<p>Can an alternative mathematical framework be developed, one more in keeping with the ideas of David Deutsch and the coherence theory of knowledge?  </p>\n<p>My own idea is to separate out levels of abstraction when reasoning (or equivalently, levels of recursion).  In my proposed framework, there are 3 levels, and each level gets its own measure of &#8216;truth-value&#8217;.   The idea is that different forms of reasoning correspond to different levels of abstraction. </p>\n<p>Known popular types of truth-measure are Boolean (True/False) and probability (0-1).  I&#8217;m proposing we should be using a different measure, called conceptual coherence (categorization measure). </p>\n<p>As a rough working definition of *conceptual coherence*, I would define it thusly;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The degree to which a concept coheres with (integrates with) the overall world-model.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s wrong with Bayesianism:  There is not just uncertainty about our own knowledge of the world (probability), there is another meta-level of uncertainly; uncertainty about our own reasoning processes, or logical uncertainty.  Bayesianism can&#8217;t help us here.  Conceptual coherence can.  Lets see how:</p>\n<p>All statements of the form:</p>\n<p>\u2018outcome x has probability y\u2019 </p>\n<p>can be converted into statements about conceptual coherence, simply by redefining \u2018x\u2019 as a concept in a world-model. Then the correct form of logical expression is: </p>\n<p>\u2018concept x has coherence value y\u2019. </p>\n<p>The idea is that probability values are just special cases of coherence (the notion of coherence is more general than the notion of probabilities).</p>\n<p>To conclude, conceptual coherence is the degree with which a concept is integrated with the rest of your world-model, and I think it accurately captures in mathematical terms the ideas that Deutsch was trying express, and is a more powerful method of reasoning than Bayesianism.</p>\n]]>", "author": "mjgeddes", "published": "2016-01-10 05:49:05+00:00", "title": "By: mjgeddes"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>mjgeddes #73: Well, I try to avoid <i>every</i> kind of hype.
