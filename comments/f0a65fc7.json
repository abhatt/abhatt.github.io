Has anyone thought that much about the computational complexity of generating the advice itself for a given task?</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my very naive thoughts which can probably be improved (and probably already have been), but should make the question a little more clear and concrete:</p>\n<p>For example, the advice needed to put ZPP or BPP into P/Poly is can be computed in PSPACE. But we can also bound the time it takes. For BPP, if we simply run through every advice string and check that it gives the right result for that output then the time it takes to find a good string is about (2^O(A+n))M where A  is the length of working piece of advice, n is the length of our input to our BPP algorithim, and M is the amount of time it takes to actually compute with no advice or other tricks whether a given input for our problem is accept or reject. </p>\n<p>But for ZPP we can do slightly better because we can keep a string as part of our advice if it works for a really long sequence of inputs: BPP can&#8217;t do this immediately because a BPP machine taking the advice can&#8217;t tell when a string is giving bad advice where as the ZPP machine will when given bad advice simply return I-don&#8217;t-know and then move on to the next part of the advice string. This means that if we want to make advice for a problem in ZPP we can get away with<br />\n(2^(O(A)+o(n)))M. Note that although A is the length of a working piece of advice, we&#8217;ve actually ended up giving advice that is slightly longer than our minimum advice length. </p>\n<p>But we can actually with only a little overhead do the same for BPP by tagging our advice string so our advice essentially is of a slightly different form and reads:<br />\nFrom 0 to String A, use X<br />\nFrom String A+1 to String Y,<br />\netc. </p>\n<p>So in both cases we can do with time  (2^(O(A)+o(n)))M.

That is, it is part of my happiness to take pains that many others may understand as I understand, so that their intellect and desire agree entirely with my intellect and desire.</p>\n<p>To do this it is necessary, <i>first</i>, to understand as much of Nature as suffices for acquiring such a nature; <i>next</i>, to form a society of the kind that is desirable, so that as many as possible may attain it as easily and surely as possible. <i>Third</i>, attention must be paid to Moral Philosophy and to Instruction concerning the Education of children. Because Health is no small means to achieving this end, <i>fourth</i>, the whole of Medicine must be worked out. And because many difficult things are rendered easy by ingenuity, and by it we can gain much time and convenience in life, <i>fifth</i>, Mechanics is in no way to be despised.</p>\n<p>Before anything else we must devise a way of healing the intellect, and purifying it, as much as we can in the beginning, so that it understands things successfully, without error and as well as possible. </p>\n<p>Everyone will now be able to see that I wish to direct all the sciences toward one end and goal, namely, that we should achieve, as we have said, the highest human perfection&nbsp;&hellip; all our activities and thoughts are to be directed to this end.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Spinoza&#8217;s five Enlightened objectives are (of course) both technologically transformational and morally problematic.  </p>\n<p>Supposing that our global technological civilization does not revert to a pre-Enlightenment Dark Age, the next 50 years will witness more concrete progress toward a  Spinozist Enlightenment than the previous 350 years&nbsp;&mdash; without much regard for whether, as individuals, we desire this progress or&nbsp;not.  </p>\n<p>This prospect is exciting of course, and scary too.

For example, if you have difficulty interpreting social cues and are worried about getting it wrong, stay away from trying to find romantic connections in public or at work. Don&#8217;t ever ask anybody out who you met in a work context. Just don&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t even consider or think about it. Don&#8217;t ever approach anybody you see in public with this intention.

Ask friends to set you up on dates. Use dating apps or websites. Be explicit about consent at every step. Don&#8217;t just kiss them. Ask them beforehand. Sure, many partners would say it is a turn off, but some may like it and for most others it will not be the sole reason not to date you.

I don&#8217;t see any evidence of a widespread problem where these people have any significant impact on your life, if you simply ignore them.
