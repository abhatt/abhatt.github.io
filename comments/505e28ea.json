I am on record, in a different thread, saying that not only I believe Shockley was a racist, but in fact I believe he was &#8220;real Nazi&#8221;-like, the kind of Nazi I would be terrified of having running the government.  You see, the context of that discussion was how I differentiate between the losers that call themselves &#8220;neo-Nazi&#8221; that are not a cause of concern for me and &#8220;real Nazis&#8221; like Shockley who would use the political power at their disposal to implement Nazi Germany type of policies. I also said then, and I reaffirm now, that if you want to find real Nazis, you are more likely to find them in meetings of the National Academy of Sciences or high profile academic conferences than in violent demonstrations like Charlottesville&#8217;s. I also said then, and I repeat now, that I am not saying that all uber-smart people are Nazis, but only that that&#8217;s the group you should scrutinize if you really want to find the Nazis you should be afraid of.</p>\n<p>With all this said, the whole Terman experiment shows better than any empirical evidence I can provide, that the concept of IQ is baloney. Or, if you will, that IQ tests only measure how well you take IQ tests and little else. Here is another analysis of the Terman children&#8217;s achievements,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/200909/the-truth-about-the-termites\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/200909/the-truth-about-the-termites</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Let us give Terman the benefit of the doubt and post that all 2,000 scientific and technical publications were produced by the 70 who made it into American Men of Science. That implies that, on average, Terman&#8217;s notable scientists produced about 29 publications by the time they had reached their mid-40s. In contrast, American Nobel laureates in the sciences averaged about 38 publications by the time they were 39 years old, and claimed about 59 publications by their mid-40s. THat amounts to a twofold disparity in output. Hence, Terman&#8217;s intellectual elite was not of the same caliber as the true scientific elite of the same nation and era.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Or,</p>\n<p>&#8220;Another analysis shows that the accomplishments of the &#8220;Termites&#8221; could have been predicted on their socioeconomic status alone. These were mostly white, middle to upper middle class men with opportunities and resources for success. Some argue that it wasn&#8217;t even necessary for Terman to analyze the IQ dimension&#8211;he could have stopped with SES and call it a day.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I have several heuristic rules that I have &#8220;discovered&#8221; throughout my life. One of them, as I have mentioned, is that the most important decisions in society that affect us as individuals are made by the most stupid members of society. A closely related one, but different, is that most problems in society are caused by lack of mathematical literacy among the general population. Using IQ testing as a predictive tool is a clear example of confusing correlation with causation. In addition, the best correlations people have been able to come up with are around 0.5, a far cry of 0.99 which is what any serious correlative measure should have to be taken as a proxy of something. Imagine if medical testing of infectious disease or cancer were performed the same way: we have not detected you have HIV antibodies, but you know, only at most 50% of HIV positive people develop antibodies, so we cannot tell you much about whether you are infected with HIV. Or, gee, we detected anomalous cells in your pancreas, but you know, only up to 50% of people with pancreatic cancer develop those cells and there are other reasons those cells might have been developed so we cannot tell you whether you have pancreatic cancer. I hope people get an idea. Society as a whole gives a pass to IQ tests that does not give to other measurements.  </p>\n<p>As I said, psychology must be the biggest scam the losers of the academic game perpetrate in society at large.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The Problem With Gatekeepers", "published": "2017-10-03 15:30:29+00:00", "title": "By: The Problem With Gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d like to share my experience with IQ testing in elementary school and some thoughts.<br />\nI was about 15 and it was part of a more general voluntary psychological examination, so they could provide you with a ,,professional orientation&#8221; ( career choice etc ) . The IQ or ,,aptitude&#8221; test had three parts (perceptive, verbal and spatial),<br />\non the first one you had pairs of pictures and had to tell if they were the same or not or something like that,<br />\non the second one there were words and you had to write the words opposite in meaning next to them,<br />\nand on the third one, you&#8217;re given a 3D arrangement and have to reconstruct it from a different angle.<br />\nI got an average, maybe a bit above average score, I did terribly on either one of the first two ( verbal part I think),<br />\nbut exceptionally on the third one. On the verbal part I didn&#8217;t even know many of the words, and of the ones I did know I either didn&#8217;t know their opposite or took a long time to retrieve it from memory. On the perception part I was overly cautious and paranoid, mind started playing tricks on me, started seeing things, I don\u2019t think it affected my ,,performance,, but I bet it could have.<br />\nI believe these kinds of tests are mostly beyond ridiculous for obvious reasons. There are others like Raven\u2019s matrices that can be taken a lot more seriously. Some tests emphasize ,,the raw working memory\u2019\u2019 ,,processing speed\u2019\u2019 aspects; others have more to do with ,inductive leaps, etc. The problem with the first ones is these things don\u2019t seem that important when it comes to human intellectual achievements, certain animals seem to have better ,,raw,, capacities of that sort. When Archimedes (and probably many before and after him) sat in his bathtub and came to his realization, it was not a feat of working memory ,processing speed, some combo or whatever. The problem with the second ones is, well for a given problem there are many routes the mind checks, which routes it checks is a result of many factors, everyone\u2019s inner wiring and experience is a bit different, some routes are quicker, and you\u2019re just lucky if you stumble upon them, or you&#8217;re lucky that the problem suits your wiring and experience, ( sometimes we instantly give elegant solutions to problems, other times we are clueless ) it doesn\u2019t really matter if there are more solutions or just one. These things I mention don\u2019t really matter that much because psychometrics relies on statistics. But at this stage all the research done is weak from a ,,hard science\u2019\u2019 point of view, and it doesn\u2019t say much things that we in fact did not already know in one way or another. The specifics are nowhere near where they should be. People are silly to even bother themselves with it. If a time comes when intelligence is truly understood, and if certain individuals happen to be a lot more disadvantaged than they would like, there will probably be treatments/augmentations of some sort. This probably assumes more rigorous definitions and an understanding of the processes and mechanisms, or equations that describe the phenomenon.</p>\n]]>", "author": "arc", "published": "2017-10-03 15:42:43+00:00", "title": "By: arc"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>My 4 kids were given IQ tests when they were young.
