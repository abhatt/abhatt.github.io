Nuclear demagnatization refrigerators have reached 10s of microkelvin in thermal equilibrium, but in single shot mode.  Below that temperature, the idea of &#8216;temperature of a block of metal&#8217; breaks down: the lattice vibrations, electrion motion, and nuclear spins decouple.  Nuclear demagnatization can reduce the nuclear spin temperature to below a nanokelvin, but that isn&#8217;t thermalized to the phonons and electrons.  Of course atom traps reach comparable temperatures, and are likewise out of equilibrium.</p>\n<p>The reason commercially available fridges weren&#8217;t suitable for D-wave is probably a number of factors:  The fridges large enough to handle their wiring load didn&#8217;t used to get cold enough &#8212; 20-30 mK was more common, and it could be worse once you add the hundreds of wires needed to operate a complex circuit like their devices.  Also, commercial fridges have usually come with zero or minimal magnetic and RF shielding, leaving that up to individual researchers to add in to their taste.  The d-wave machine, like all squid circuits, is *extremely* sensitive to stray magentic flux, and I believe they use multiple layers of magnetic shielding and also active field cancellation.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Evan", "published": "2014-02-07 17:39:24+00:00", "title": "By: Evan"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Evan #19: Thanks so much for clarifying!</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2014-02-08 01:42:03+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott, just a question in general, and I&#8217;m curious where you stand on this; let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a company (not Dwave) that succeeded in creating a quantum computer &#8211; for real, but this will result in some groups losing their funding in quantum research including yours.

I mean, it&#8217;s not like classical CS research dried up once the first digital computers were built.  Instead it <i>exploded</i>, from Alan Turing and a few friends to tens of thousands of people.  After all, we still needed to figure out what classical computers were <i>good for</i>, and how to program them.
