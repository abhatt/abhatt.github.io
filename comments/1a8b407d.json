[{"content": "<br />I agree that the job situation is inherently stressful because there are &quot;too many&quot; PhD&#39;s chasing &quot;too few&quot; positions.<br /><br />There&#39;s not really a good argument that there should be (many) more positions, especially at universities. In any case, it would take an increase of 10x to change the hiring situation.  It&#39;s also hard to see a winning argument for 10x more government funding to support their research.  And what would we do with the 10x more PhD students they would produce...So there&#39;s not much to be done.  <br /><br />One point I will argue is that universities should make tenure-track hires with the expectation that the candidate will get tenure.  <br /><br />Obviously, tenure shouldn&#39;t be given to someone who doesn&#39;t deserve it.  But it should not be acceptable to hire in N tenure-track candidates with the expectation of only retaining n &lt; N.  <br /><br />Just like graduation rate, departments should be partly judged on their ability to bring professors to tenure.
