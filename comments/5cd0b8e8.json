[{"content": "The combined proofs are not longer.  You do not need the full constant-locality result to simplify the proof of the ACC^0 lower bound.  Also, locality considerations aside, the reduction presented in the paper is arguably simpler than the one used as a black-box in the ACC^0 lower bound.  This is discussed in the paper.", "author": "Emanuele", "published": "2013-11-14 14:22:34.662000-06:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "In terms of simplifying William&#39;s proof, Igor Oliveira&#39;s survey (ECCC TR13-177 http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/117/) contains a fairly simple and clean (and as far as I can tell, new) proof of the SAT-algorithms vs lbs connection, that in particular scales well with circuit depth as the Jahanjou-Miles-Viola result does.", "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2013-11-14 19:48:03.285000-06:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "FYI: http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/099/", "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2013-11-15 04:51:25.727000-06:00", "title": "FYI: http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/099/"}]
