Antisemitism, and in particular murderous Antisemitism, has no place in my worldview and has no place in a civilized society. I must note that the killer in the Pittsburgh massacre was a Trump hater and that Trump has a daughter who converted to Judaism because of her husband and gave Trump three Jewish grandchildren. Trump has also been the best friend Israel has had in the White House in decades, finally having the courage to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I am not sure why the massacre should be blamed on Cruz or Republican politicians when you have the Democratic establishment that has not fully distanced itself from avowed Jewish hater Louis Farrakhan.</p>\n<p>On #1, I think that Democrats overplayed their hand with Kavanaugh. Until then, the midterms of 2018 were headed to being classic &#8220;the party not holding the White House mobilizing its base to show their opposition at the polls&#8221;. The treatment Kavanaugh received -that we now know included two women who are on record acknowledging that they made up the charges- prompted many Republicans who were not particularly excited about the midterms to vote. The result is the midterm election with the highest voter turnout since 1966: a mixture of pissed off base Democrats (that was expected) and pissed off base Republicans (many of whom, including yours truly, would not have come out to vote had it not been because of the vicious treatment Kavanaugh received).  I also find very ironic that many Democrats were celebrating the historic expected turnout in 2018 before the night of the election expecting that the high participation was going to be a &#8220;blue wave&#8221; and instead got pissed off Republicans who got out to vote to show their displeasure with &#8220;the Resistance&#8221;. These Democrats would be well served by watching outlets different than CNN. Even MSNBC is fairer these days than the CNN echo chamber.</p>\n]]>", "author": "the problem of the gatkeepers", "published": "2018-11-10 20:12:09+00:00", "title": "By: the problem of the gatkeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p><a href=\"#comment-1792688\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sniffnoy 51</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the key point about the South wasn\u2019t so much that it was low in population, so much as that it was low in <em>free</em> population</p></blockquote>\n<p>You seem to have retracted your comments based on this factual claim in response to evidence that doesn&#8217;t actually contradict it (although some that renders it moot).
