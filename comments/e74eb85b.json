Trump is great at commanding a mob, and has no compunctions about encouraging them to use violence. He promised to use his money to  legally defend his supporters who engaged in it. The notion of him having the power of a Presidential pardon is terrifying. I could easily see him wanting to pass legislation that would greatly expand executive power, and when Congress pushes back, he encourages his supporters to show up outside congress to &#8220;show support,&#8221; and if they get a little carried away, don&#8217;t worry, he can pardon them.
