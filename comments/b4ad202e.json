[{"content": "Does this prevent the sort of unfairness known as &quot;reverse tokenism,&quot; whereby an intentional decision is made to deny a loan to a qualified individual, with the intent of using that (token) to justify denying loans to qualified members of a minority group?", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kun:Jeremy.html\">Jeremy Kun</a>", "published": "2016-05-24 20:55:18.242000-04:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "Hi Jeremy,<br /><br />Yes. If there are two individuals i and j, such that i is at least as qualified as j, then the algorithm is not permitted to give a loan to j with higher probability than it gives a loan to i. In particular, if i and j are equally qualified, the algorithm must treat them identically. (Of course a fair algorithm is permitted to deny loans to everybody -- but having denied a loan to a single &quot;token&quot; highly qualified individual does not allow it to selectively deny loans to other high qualified individuals. And of course it is possible for an algorithm that is terrible from the point of view of its regret bound to be fair -- like the algorithm which simply denies loans to all applicants -- which is why it is important to study the two desiderata together.)", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Roth:Aaron.html\">Aaron Roth</a>", "published": "2016-05-24 22:37:40.644000-04:00", "title": ""}]
