In another <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0502072\" rel=\"nofollow\">essay</a> you explore limits to computation in the physical world. I wonder, have you ever considered the reversal of relations between available computational power and physical laws? </p>\n<p>More specifically, how access to powerful oracle would change the limits of what could be done in a physical world?</p>\n<p>When I think about it, the clue that there is some real-world power behind computational complexity comes from black holes firewall paradox. If I understand it correctly, the answer to what is just above event horizon depends on whether we&#8217;ve performed some immensely complex computations on the outgoing Hawking radiation. So if by any chance one gets an access to oracle for corresponding computational class, it would be possible to toggle firewall on and off.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m also thinking about NP problems, which have resemblance to the problems of finding the specific low entropy state of a physical system. The whole process looks very much like reversing the second law of thermodynamics to me. But my knowledge of the field is insufficient to go anywhere beyond handwaving arguments.</p>\n<p>And finally, there is quantum mechanics, which allows to win certain games with probability higher than it&#8217;s possible in a purely classical world, although I&#8217;m not sure if this has anything to do with BQP != BPP.</p>\n<p>So, I wonder if you have have some thoughts about this? If anything, I guess explaining faster-than-light travel by access to oracle would give superhuman aliens more credibility \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>P.S.
