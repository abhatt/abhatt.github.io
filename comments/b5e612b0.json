I give her major honesty points for this comment, actually. Everyone acts slightly different in public and private, and she was just admitting to that. She doesn&#8217;t seem less honest than other politicians (or non-politicians) in general &#8211; the reverse, actually, if you look at her positions and actions.<br />\n2. Her &#8220;mistakes&#8221; are departing from theoretical protocol in the same way everyone else does, but then getting attacked over it by Fox News until it starts looking abnormal.<br />\n3. Harder to speak on this one &#8211; she seemed tactically competent and on the ball in the state department, but you may very reasonably disagree with her strategic decisions.<br />\n4. She was offering to continue the progress we&#8217;ve been making, which is pretty damn good &#8211; for example, 2015 had an unprecedented growth in income for the lower income percentiles.<br />\n5. She did not &#8220;cheat&#8221;. She won three million votes more than her opponent. That people who had personally worked with them both almost unanimously preferred her is a point in her favour, not the opposite.<br />\n6. Don&#8217;t know as much about the details of this, but considering how many accusations at her (e.g. Benghazi, the emails, the Clinton foundation&#8230;) turned out to be unfounded on investigation, I&#8217;m inclined not too take this too seriously.<br />\n7. etc&#8230; most of the things you don&#8217;t mention are points in her favour.
