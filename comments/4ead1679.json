In fact, one of <i>Atlas</i> villains has a rise that&#8217;s suspiciously similar to that of Hitler-  he&#8217;s such a nonentity that people kept supporting him, thinking he&#8217;s so incompetent, he&#8217;d be easy to control.  Until one day&#8230;  </p>\n<p>The point is that the Nazis were such rabble that there is no way they could have taken over the most civilised nation in Europe had intellectuals not paved the way.

The phenomenal/noumenal thing, with its corollary on mystical insight (&#8216;categorical imperative&#8217;) isn&#8217;t something incidental to Kant&#8217;s philosophy, it is literally the big thing right at the centre.  And it is precisely because Kant was such a major figure that he was able to do such major damage.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Yet somehow science and technology, and the general arc of human moral progress (e.g., the abolition of slavery), soldiered on despite \u201csomeone being wrong in a philosophy book.\u201d I think those processes are more robust than Rand and Peikoff give them credit for.</p></blockquote>\n<p>  Well, they did &#8211; and they didn&#8217;t.  Yes, these ideas have (had?) a huge head of steam, and did soldier on, but Kant&#8217;s intellectual progeny were working away, undermining the foundations until &#8211; well, until the twentieth century.  Then they break into hideous life.  Here&#8217;s Orwell, writing during that time:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Human types supposedly extinct for centuries, the dancing dervish, the robber chieftain, the Grand Inquisitor, have suddenly reappeared, not as inmates of lunatic asylums, but as the masters of the world. </p></blockquote>\n<p> Bear in mind that within both of our lifetimes, Communism succeeded in enslaving a third of the planet.  My parents survived Hitler and Stalin both.  Hideous reversals are possible.</p>\n<p>I think where we disagree is your optimism.  You think that these things are process that will continue regardless.  I think they are human achievements rooted in human thought.  If those thoughts go away, the process stops or worse.  </p>\n<p>You might think Rand&#8217;s extreme in her emphasis on intellectuals and philosophers.  After all, she wrote the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If given supreme power over the country, I would pardon all the people and even most of the leaders, but I would hang every intellectual in the country and the professors three feet higher than the rest, to be left up as long as public hygiene allows.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Except she didn&#8217;t.  That line comes from the diaries of Viktor Klemperer, a German Jew writing in Dresden in 1943.

It is only reason that I &#8211; or anyone -has as a defense to that. </p>\n<p>To put it yet another way, that you may find more compelling, I&#8217;ve heard it argued that the term &#8220;post-truth&#8221; was original coined as a compliment by post modernist intellectuals and philosophers.  Regardless of whether the exact word was used, the idea certainly goes back to there (Foucault and &#8220;regimes of truth&#8221; etc.)  But in practice, in reality, post-truth means Trump.  When you decide there is no objective reality, only competing narratives, you are inviting the biggest loudmouth to define the narrative. </p>\n<p>Now to the subject of the <b>phenomenal/noumenal</b> thing:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like, there\u2019s one sense in which it\u2019s clearly true that \u201cI only see the computer as filtered through my eyes\u201d; there\u2019s another sense in which even my flawed eyes clearly do give me data about a real computer that exists in external reality; both senses seem reasonably obvious to a narrow, scientistic philistine like me \ud83d\ude42 </p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t recommend you plow through Kant &#8211; he has some of the worst German I have ever read, and I doubt it gets any better in translation.  Let me phrase what&#8217;s wrong with it like this: my background is in biology.  If I use a microscope to look at a cell, by Kant&#8217;s standards, I am not looking at the real cell, but only at a magnified image of the cell.  Literally all perception of reality is discredited precisely for being perception.  This line would apply just as well to an alien, or even to God Almighty, since He would have to have perception to perceive anything.  It&#8217;s completely nuts. </p>\n<p>  Yes, our senses have limits; that&#8217;s the same thing as saying that they exist.  They have an objective nature and behave as such.  They still give us objective knowledge of the world, we just need to learn to understand it.

We&#8217;re in agreement that it is universal. Where we are apparently in disagreement in part, and this is important, is how common it is in different groups. Something can be a common problem and still be more of a problem in one than the other. Multiple studies back up that the central problem is much more severe on the right now then it is on the left. That&#8217;s not to say that has always been the case: During much of the Cold War, a large part of the left believed all sorts of nonsense essentially fed to it by Soviet propaganda. And there are clear warning signs that fake news on the left is growing (which some of the better center-left publications have been trying to point out <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/liberal-fever-swamps/530736/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/07/liberal-fever-swamps/530736/</a>  <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/viva-la-resistance-content/515532/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/viva-la-resistance-content/515532/</a> )</p>\n<p>&#8220;With respect to Breitbart\u2019s credibility. The video of #173 was about Marc Andressen\u2019s opinion on whether it or outlets like the NY Times or WaPo more accurately reflected the mood of the country &#8221;</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t interpret him as talking about mood by itself, but if it really is about a distinction in mood among different parts of the country, that&#8217;s plausible.

You might argue that the moral difference here is small. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The kind of \u201csplitting hairs\u201d discussion in which politifact engaged is the very reason many of us decided that voting for Trump was the only rational choice in 2016.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So, this is where I think we start really disagreeing: Splitting hairs matter. Whether things are the same or not matters. You can argue about how much any one of them matters, but arguing that there&#8217;s no difference is a problem. Moreover, voting for Trump due to something like this essentially is saying &#8220;This fact-checker has what may arguably be a bias in how they evaluate things so instead I&#8217;m going to vote for someone who has no relationship to the truth at all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>(You&#8217;ve made a few other parts of your comment which I&#8217;m not directly responding to other than to note general, approximate agreement.)</p>\n]]>", "author": "Joshua Zelinsky", "published": "2018-04-05 01:29:35+00:00", "title": "By: Joshua Zelinsky"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>adoawix3 #197:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Western/Christian-backed state actors are responsible for the majority of civilian deaths.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They might call themselves &#8220;Christian&#8221;, but people who support killing civilians \u2014 or even militants \u2014 are disobeying Christ himself, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206&version=NLT\" rel=\"nofollow\">who said</a> &#8220;But to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies!

The way I interpret this is that those studies have a spin made to make the losers of the 2016 election feel good with themselves. The way I see things is different. The United States, unlike the European countries that I know, is a very fluid and dynamic society. Nothing here seems permanent and that include political allegiances of a significant portion of American voters. I believe this to be true even as I acknowledge that we live in increasingly polarizing times.  For example, there were counties with a total of 7.5 million voters that voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012, and then for Trump in 2016 <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Pivot_Counties:_The_counties_that_voted_Obama-Obama-Trump_from_2008-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ballotpedia.org/Pivot_Counties:_The_counties_that_voted_Obama-Obama-Trump_from_2008-2016</a> . This speaks of a healthy dynamism in which the studies you mention -just as the right sought solace in the aforementioned poll of 2008 that showed Obama voters as &#8220;uninformed&#8221;- only serve to insult the voters who, for their own reasons, decided to vote for Obama in 2008/2012 and then for Trump in 2016.</p>\n<p>People are not &#8220;robots&#8221;. The effect of the Russian trolls was irrelevant when it came to make people like me vote in 2016 for Trump -I insist I would not have voted for Bush or any other of the clowns who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination- even though I had not voted in 2012 and 2014. Speaking of, this is the poll I was referring to <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/330170543/9amET-NBCWSJ-release\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.scribd.com/document/330170543/9amET-NBCWSJ-release</a> . People in my demographic group were not captured by a poll like this that looked at people who had voted in 2012 and 2014 and young people with a high interest in the election. </p>\n<p>This takes me to your final point,</p>\n<p>&#8220;Splitting hairs matter.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Actually, when it comes to politics -and I would say also areas like religion or picking our spouses- I believe it doesn&#8217;t. Most people choose their politics not making painstakingly detailed analyses of policy proposals but on impressions. That&#8217;s true even among our intellectual elite. The term &#8220;Obamagasm&#8221; was coined to describe the irrational pleasant experience many Obama supporters felt about anything Obama uttered, no matter how absurd the utterance was. Obamagasms were as common among the low educated Obama voters as among the highly educated Obama voters. I for one don&#8217;t believe that the result of the 2008 election would have been different had most Obama voters known that it was the Democrats who controlled congress on election in 2008. I don&#8217;t believe either that Romney stood a chance against Obama in 2012 because he -Romney- just wasn&#8217;t likable enough even among people who agreed with him on policy matters. Nor do I believe that in a Trump v Clinton election and given the dynamics of what was going on in the middle of the country -that Breitbart conveyed better than the NY Times- Hillary Clinton would have won the election without the influence of the Russian trolls. Remove uber-blue California from the popular vote count and Trump got an overwhelming win among those voters too (even including very blue states like Washington, Oregon and those in New England). </p>\n<p>In short. There is a reason why academia is also known as &#8220;the ivory tower&#8221;. The real world is not an academic exercise. It is messy and chaotic and there are many reasons why people vote the way they do that cannot be measured via studies that assume voters are robots.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2018-04-05 05:22:29+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Prussian #198/199: Thanks; your comments provide much food for thought!

It&#8217;s this:</p>\n<ul>the track record of Enlightenment ideas applied to moral and political questions is woeful. Applied to politics, Enlightenment ideas have given us the idea of the perfectibility of society via reason, and through that, the \u2018Utopias\u2019 of Nazism and Communism.  The ghastly efficiency of the Nazis &#8230; was the result of a technologically and organisationally sophisticated nation applying its skills to mass murder.</ul>\n<p>So, must we count everyone who&#8217;s tried to usurp the prestige of science for their own ends as part of the Enlightenment project?  Or everyone who&#8217;s exploited modern technological skills to advance their ends?</p>\n<p>If so, then it&#8217;s not just Nazism and Communism that we&#8217;re talking about.  Homeopathy, Christian Science, Scientology, and New-Age healing based on quantum vibrations would all be part of the Enlightenment.  Televangelists would be great Enlightenment figures, since they skillfully exploit modern broadcasting technology to reach far larger audiences than was possible otherwise.  Trump would be too, because of his use of Twitter and data harvested from Facebook.</p>\n<p>But these strike me as absurd conclusions.  <i>Of course</i> almost every cult and regressive ideology will claim for itself the backing of science: why wouldn&#8217;t it?  And <i>of course</i> technology has magnified the power of evil and irrational actors, along with good actors.  If &#8220;the Enlightenment&#8221; encompasses every movement that <i>falsely claims</i> the support of science, or <i>skillfully uses</i> the outputs of science, then it encompasses pretty much anything you&#8217;ve ever heard of, so means nothing.</p>\n<p>In this analysis, Nazism and Communism differ from Scientology and quantum energy crystals mostly just in having done orders of magnitude more damage.  All these things bear roughly the same relationship to the original ideals of the Enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The Enlightenment, it seems to me, <i>can</i> coherently be criticized for having put so many machine guns into the hands of toddlers &#8230; even though the only alternative might have been no technological civilization at all.

But to be called to account publicly for what others have said in one&#8217;s name, when one cannot defend oneself, is indeed a sad predicament. &#8220;But to whom does such a thing  happen?&#8221; you will ask. Well, everyone who is of sufficient interest to the public to be pursued by interviewers. You smile incredulously, but I have had plenty of direct experience and will tell you about it.<br />\nImagine the following situation. One morning a reporter comes to you and asks you in a friendly way to tell him something about your friend N. At first you no doubt feel something approaching indignation at such a proposal. But you soon discover that there is no escape. If you refuse to say anything, the man writes: &#8220;I asked one of N&#8217;s supposedly best friends about him. But he prudently avoided my questions. This in itself enables the reader to draw the inevitable conclusions.&#8221; There is, therefore, no escape, and you give the following information: &#8220;Mr. N is a cheerful, straightforward man, much liked by all his friends. He can find a bright side to any situation. His enterprise and industry know no bounds; his job takes up his entire energies. He is devoted to his family and lays everything he possesses at his wife&#8217;s feet. &#8230;&#8221;<br />\nNow for the reporter&#8217;s version: &#8220;Mr. N takes nothing very seriously and has a gift for making himself liked, particularly as he carefully cultivates a hearty and ingratiating manner. He is so completely a slave to his job that he has no time for the considerations of any non-personal subject or for any extracurricular mental activity. He spoils his wife unbelievably and is utterly under her thumb. &#8230;&#8221;<br />\nA real reporter would make it much more spicy, but I expect this will be enough for you and your friend N. He reads the above, and some more like it, in the paper next morning, and his rage against you knows no bounds, however cheerful and benevolent his natural disposition may be. The injury done to him gives you untold pain, especially as you are really fond of him.<br />\nWhat&#8217;s your next step, my friend?

Just like I don&#8217;t cede to the SJWs that the word &#8220;racism&#8221; can only mean &#8220;prejudice + power,&#8221; so that members of oppressed races can never be racist by definition, even if (let&#8217;s say) they commit a murder out of racial animus.</p>\n<p>Another thing: it&#8217;s always seemed to me that strong action on climate change could be defended on the strictest libertarian grounds.  One would simply say: property rights include the right not to have other people cause your property to be flooded, or subject to intense droughts and heatwaves, insofar as those things are influenced even probabilistically by human actions (as science tells us they are).  Of course, when someone drives a car, the property damage they cause to you is infinitesimal&#8212;but summed over <i>all</i> the people on earth whose property is now infinitesimally likelier to be damaged, it&#8217;s more than enough to justify a carbon tax, again purely on property rights grounds rather than redistributive ones.</p>\n<p>If libertarians won&#8217;t accept this, I see two explanations.  Either they don&#8217;t take their own principles to their logical conclusion, or they simply don&#8217;t accept the scientific evidence for anthropogenic climate change and its likely catastrophic effects.  In the latter case, though, the disagreement has nothing to do with differing philosophical views about the role of government.
