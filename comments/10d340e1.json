If it were indeed true that BQP was the most computational power we can extract from the Universe, imagine what that would mean: We would have a <i>computational</i> characterization of the fundamental structure of the Universe. How awesome is it that Universe fundamentally restricts, via computational hardness, what any agent that might possibly come into existence in the Universe can do. Anybody who says they&#8217;re not excited about this needs also  to claim that the 2nd law of thermodynamics is not exciting.</p>\n<p>2. Indeed, we&#8217;re already very aware of the power of quantum mechanics: lasers, transistors, nuclear bombs, high-density hard drives, atomic clocks (which feed into GPS) to name a few. If we have working large-scale QCs, how awesome would it be that we use this theory to redefine the very way we think about what information and computation is and it has real-world consequences! In other words, <i>the fundamental mathematical structure</i> of the Universe will have been <i>tamed</i> by humans! Not <i>verified</i>, but <i>tamed</i>. </p>\n<p>3. IMHO, QC/QI has been the freshest breath to quantum foundations since John Bell and Kochen-Specker. Quantum mechanics sets the <i>fundamental ontology</i> of our Universe. Insistent denials notwithstanding, I think it is safe to say we&#8217;re still confused about what picture about the Universe QM provides us. Building a QC makes this issue more pressing. When we achieve macroscopically coherent controllable quantum phenomena, it forces all of us to confront these philosophical confusions: much like modern high-energy theory and cosmology have forced us to confront the possibility of the multiverse and think more deeply about the problem of why there is something rather than nothing. </p>\n<p>4. Building on the previous point, no one would deny that attempts to think about and build AIs has forced us to clarify concepts related to the problem of induction and the philosophy of mind. IMHO, thinking clearly about QM/QC/QI and attempting to build QCs will force us to clarify concepts about ontology, epistemology, locality, reality, causality.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/K:Sid.html\">Sid K</a>", "published": "2014-04-03 06:31:12+00:00", "title": "By: Sid K"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>fred #54: Oh, let&#8217;s make exaggerated claims!  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Even a short journal article with 100 words can have 10^100 configurations.
