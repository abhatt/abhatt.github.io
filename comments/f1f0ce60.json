[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Aharon #190</p>\n<p>Here are several things to address here, but let me do one straight off. It is the observation that although the quantum state affects the particles (by guiding their motion), the particles in return do not affect the quantum state. That is perfectly true. Sometimes people say that that alone violates a &#8220;generalized Action-Reaction principle&#8221; or a &#8220;generalized Newton&#8217;s Third Law&#8221;, and is automatically a strike against the theory.</p>\n<p>The first thing to note is that the objection put this way (which I know is not how you put it) is just silly. Newton would certainly have rejected this generalization of his Third Law, as should  everyone else. For example, Newton&#8217;s law of universal gravitation obviously has an effect on the motion of particles, but the motion of the particles has no reciprocal back-action on the law of gravitation! (Maybe Lee Smolin will think this is a problem too!) As Shelly Goldstein says, the quantum state has something of a nomological flavor: if you want to analogize it to something familiar, it is more like a law than a classical field. Personally, I try to lay off the analogies. Quantum states are quantum states. They aren&#8217;t like anything in classical physics. Or, as David Albert once put it, &#8220;we&#8217;re here, we&#8217;re queer, get used to it&#8221;.</p>\n<p>But granting the no-back-reaction fact, what has that to do with consciousness or the &#8220;reality&#8221; of &#8220;worlds&#8221; associated with the &#8220;empty branches&#8221;? Well, nothing at all! To see this, just put a little bit of back-reaction into the theory: the actual particle configuration deforms the quantum state at least a little exactly &#8220;where&#8221; that configuration is in the quantum state. Does that suddenly change the interpretive situation significantly? How could it?</p>\n<p>Is the &#8220;existence of a universal state is falsified by every quantum experiment to ever involve macroscopic equipment&#8221; if there is no back-reaction? Why should it be? In Bohmian mechanics, the actual shape, location and behavior of the macroscopic equipment is determined by the location and motion of its particles, and the motion of the particles (given their locations) is determined by the quantum state. Without the quantum state the theory falls to pieces. So how can such an experiment falsify the theory?</p>\n<p>Scott # 192: Note that the particle locations and motions are *not* epiphenomenal in the usual sense of that term. It is not merely that epiphenomena do not have any reciprocal back-effect on their cause or base, but they *supervene* on the base. The Bohmian particle locations and motions do not at all supervene on the quantum state. If I give you the quantum state alone, you can never analyze it to figure out what the particles were actually doing. The particle locations are independent degrees of physical freedom from the physical degrees of freedom of the quantum state.</p>\n<p>That is why the &#8220;Bohm is Many Worlds in a constant state of denial&#8221; meme that Deutsch created is so completely off base. A collection of particles plus a quantum state has much more physical structure to it\u2014more physical degrees of freedom\u2014than a quantum state alone. Further, those extra degrees of freedom\u2014the particle locations in space-time\u2014are of a completely different physical character than any in the quantum state. So it is not surprise that you can make lots of stuff out of particles +quantum state that you can&#8217;t make out of quantum state alone. In particular, you can make all sorts of complex localized objects in the second case and none in the first. These objects include trees and rocks and cats and brains with the right sort of structure to support consciousness. The &#8220;empty branches&#8221; are devoid of all these things, because they don&#8217;t have the particles to work with. And of course, since the particles never &#8220;split&#8221; or &#8220;multiply&#8221; the concrete Bohmian objects never &#8220;split&#8221; or &#8220;multiply&#8221; either, so we have none of the conceptual headaches that come with that in Many Worlds.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Tim Maudlin", "published": "2018-02-08 00:12:58+00:00", "title": "By: Tim Maudlin"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Tim #195</p>\n<p>That is extremely interesting.

I just have two comments. First, about Scott&#8217;s cartoon: maybe I&#8217;m a prude, but to me it seems complex numbers belong in one&#8217;s ontology iff one is a Platonist. Furthermore, whether or not they exist, under most accounts complex numbers are abstract objects (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abstract-objects/</a>). The same holds, e.g., for wavefunctions, which are elements of some projectivized Hilbert space. My question for those who like to put such objects in their ontology: do you really mean that mathematical objects are instantiated physically? (Tegmark would say &#8220;yes&#8221; but I&#8217;m not sure how widely his views are shared.) Or do you mean there&#8217;s some physical object, different than but mathematically described by an abstract wavefunction in a Platonic Hilbert space?</p>\n<p>My second comment is that to me, it seems that asking for an interpretation of quantum mechanics is a bit less demanding than asking for a metaphysical theory in which quantum mechanics naturally resides. To interpret quantum mechanics, isn&#8217;t it enough to assign meanings to the various things arising in quantum mechanics, such that the theorems of quantum mechanics are true statements about these meanings? It seems that the standard Copenhagen / psi-epistemic interpretation does at least this, whether or not you want to say this is enough to qualify as an interpretation. (Of course, interpretations in this sense are probably very far from unique.) I do view metaphysical questions as very interesting, and I find the phrase &#8220;shut up and calculate&#8221; to be overly dismissive of them. But metaphysics seems to be very difficult, and for now I&#8217;m happy enough with being able to make sense of quantum mechanics without worrying about paradoxes. </p>\n<p>For example, I can view the wavefunction of a system (even in cosmology) as representing the beliefs of a hypothetical perfectly-rational conscious experiencer about (certain aspects of) its future conscious experiences, given whatever its past experiences were. Then the Schrodinger equation expresses a true statement: if time dt has passed and the observer&#8217;s conscious experience during that time contained no new information pertaining to the relevant aspects of future experiences, then the (perfectly rational) observer will update its beliefs by multiplication by e^{iHdt}. If, however, after time dt the observer has learned information restricting the relevant aspects of future experience in some way (e.g. if the relevant aspects are the readouts of some experimental machine, and after time dt the readout appears), then the perfectly rational observer will update its beliefs with a projection operator rather than a unitary operator. If you like, you can equivalently view these true declarative statements as imperative statements instead: &#8220;after dt, thou shalt do this,&#8221; removing the need to invoke hypothetical perfectly rational observers (but removing the declarative content of the theory); I think this is more or less what&#8217;s intended by Fuchs&#8217; &#8220;Ten Commandments&#8221; figure (page 8 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5209.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.5209.pdf</a>), although I agree that no good reasons exist for praying at Fuchs&#8217; altar.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Andy", "published": "2018-02-08 03:24:37+00:00", "title": "By: Andy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Hi Scott,</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not an expert but saw a lecture called Copenhagen vs Everett by Leonard Susskind and since it&#8217;s related to the topic of this post was wondering what are your views on the connections he (Susskind) states between quantum mechanical interpretations and gravity, and things like GHZ branes etc. ?

It&#8217;s probably not precisely stated enough for one side to be right or wrong: what is a mathematical object, and what is a physical object? Already the ontological division of (abstract or (concrete = (physical or mental))) is highly debated, and there are lots of competing definitions / rejections of the whole scheme. Still, one can try to argue that the definitions *should* be set up in one way or another, to avoid consequences that violate the intuitions we&#8217;re trying to capture in the definitions.</p>\n<p>For example, here is one such argument: If wavefunctions exist physically, and wavefunction is literally taken to mean equivalence class of vectors in an appropriate Hilbert space, then presumably they don&#8217;t also exist as abstract objects (otherwise, confusing the physical wavefunction with the abstract one is like confusing the idea of the Parthenon with the physical Parthenon, using Quine&#8217;s example). Then it also seems plausible that no other mathematical objects exist as abstract objects (otherwise, why don&#8217;t the vectors in physical Hilbert spaces exist as abstract objects?), and since they don&#8217;t exist physically (or mentally) either, they don&#8217;t exist at all. But part of the usual intuition about mathematical objects is that they either all exist or they all don&#8217;t exist (e.g. there&#8217;s no largest number). So if one defines abstract objects, physical objects, mathematical objects, etc. precisely, it seems desirable to do so in such a way that mathematical objects (if they exist) are abstract and not physical. One could reasonably take issue with any point in the argument (it&#8217;s not rigorous), or reject the &#8220;all-or-nothing&#8221; intuition about mathematical objects.
