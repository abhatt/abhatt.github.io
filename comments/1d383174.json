Certainly what you wrote and also\u00a0a lovely email exchange yesterday with Daniel Lidar helped me understand some of the technical and conceptual issues. I think we can consider five questions about DWave system or any other:</p>\n<p>1) Is the system genually quantum</p>\n<p>2) Does the system demonstrate large scale/ long range entanglement</p>\n<p>3) Is the system classically simulable</p>\n<p>4) Does the system involve quantum error correction/fault tolerance</p>\n<p>5) Does the system demonstrate computational speed up</p>\n<p>All of these five points are somewhat vague and we can try to make them clearer.</p>\n<p>The way I see it:</p>\n<p>1) As you mentioned question 1 is \u00a0vague but \u00a0I don&#8217;t see a good reason not to regard DWave machines as genuinely quantum.</p>\n<p>2) I dont see any evidence or claim for a long-range/large scale \u00a0entanglement of the kind needed for quantum computing. Daniel claims  <b> nothing </b> about entanglement beyond the 8 qubits entanglement that they report in some other paper. (Of course, this should also be checked critically).\u00a0It is neither clear to me why\u00a0Umesh regards Bixio et als as a serious evidence for large-scale (=?long-range) entanglement nor why Umesh claims that this have now been refuted by your paper.</p>\n<p>3) For me not having the possibility of quantum speed up is a very strong reason to think that what the system does is classically simulable<del>.</del> I don&#8217;t see the great difference in this respect between the quantum evolutions Bixio et als consider (and classically simulate) and the ones consider by \u00a0you guys. (But maybe I miss something here.)</p>\n<p>4) and 5). Both Daniel Lidar and I agree that DWave machines cannot lead to speed up without fault tolerance. (Daniel is working in this direction; my opinion is that quantum fault tolerance is always necessary for speed up.)</p>\n<p>I must admit,\u00a0Seung Woo, that when you get into it the specifics, this \u00a0debate on statistical tests for\u00a0quantumness\u00a0of D-wave machines is more interesting than I initially thought, but overall the statistical claims and tests do not look so convincing.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kalai:Gil.html\">Gil Kalai</a>", "published": "2014-02-12 06:32:49+00:00", "title": "By: Gil Kalai"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Mike/Rahul #177/178 Thanks for your entrepreneurial inspiration!

Here are specific quotes from the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.4595v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boixo et al. paper</a>. They begin the paper by asking the following question in the introduction,</p>\n<blockquote><p>In this work we report on computer simulations and experimental tests on a D-Wave One device in order to address central open questions about quantum annealers: is the device actually a quantum annealer, i.e. do the quantum effects observed on 8 and 16 qubits persist when scaling problems up to more than 100 qubits, or do short coherence times turn the device into a classical, thermal annealer?</p></blockquote>\n<p>and end the paper with the following conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our experiments have demonstrated that quantum annealing with more than one hundred qubits takes place in the D-Wave One device, despite limited qubit coherence times.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It is quite clear that they are claiming the existence of large scale quantum effects in D-Wave One.</p>\n<p>I very recently learned from personal communications with Daniel Lidar that following our results they withdrew these claims in the final version of their paper, which is currently in press. However, in 2) you are making it sound like they never made such a claim and we refuted a claim that never existed. I hope you can see that you were misinformed.</p>\n<p>One aspect of our paper that has not been discussed here is that it leads to insights into the nature of the native problem of the D-Wave machine. Our results indicate that in the native problem the 8-qubit clusters tend to act like supernodes, and in a sense the effective problem size is the number of clusters, which is 16. This means that the 108-qubit native problem is relatively easy. As the number of qubits is scaled up to 512 and beyond (while leaving the cluster sizes at 8), the effective problem size will increase to 64 and beyond, and that is when we would expect the exponential search space to kick in, and our algorithm and the D-Wave machine to both perform poorly. Indeed, Matthias Troyer told us that the machine struggles to find the solution when the problem size scales up to 512 qubits.</p>\n<p>Scott, actually Gil\u2019s mention of the small scale entanglement results by Daniel Lidar\u2019s group makes me curious how closely you have examined these results. I saw you say in #54 that you think D-Wave probably exhibits small scale quantum entanglement. Do you understand the precise nature of the evidence that they provide?</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Shin:Seung_Woo.html\">Seung Woo Shin</a>", "published": "2014-02-13 00:05:52+00:00", "title": "By: Seung Woo Shin"}]
