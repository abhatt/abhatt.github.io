[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Shozab #116: My to-watch list includes all the lectures of the IQC &#8211; Quantum Error Correction class taught by Daniel Gottesman and Beni Yoshida (<a href=\"http://pirsa.org/C17045\" rel=\"nofollow\">pirsa</a>).</p>\n<p>A few months earlier, I would&#8217;ve said algebra for life. But recently, I am beginning to appreciate the power of analysis. In quantum information, for instance, we talk about Haar random matrices all the time. And in complexity theory, we talk about random oracles and randomness. I think one is alienating oneself from a lot of questions and answers if one swears allegiance to a single camp.</p>\n<p>I think you are in the right field if you want to do TCS, Math and Physics. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know much functional analysis or operator theory (or any analysis really) so I cannot comment on that. The tiny bit I know comes from Vern Paulsen&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~vpaulsen/FAQIdraft.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>A Survey of Functional Analysis Methods for QIT</em></a> and the first few chapters of his book <em>Completely Bounded Maps and Operator Algebras</em>. If you like analysis and TCS, you might also appreciate Ryan O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s <em><a href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ryanod/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Analysis of Boolean Functions</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Like any other (amateur) computer scientist, I struggle with the continuum. If you read QCSD you know the argument. Also, it is not just mathematicians who struggle with it but also physicists.

Having said that, I definitely think everyone should at least master a few methods to a high degree of proficiency. For instance, Norbert Weiner was a master at Fourier Transforms, John von Neumann (well, a number of methods) had an intuitive &#8220;feel&#8221; for mathematical theories (Stainslaw Ulam pointed out other proficiencies). </p>\n<p>Be a bit weary to study functional analysis :p at least as a physicist, I found it to be very pedantic. Though I feel like analysis gets easier as you go deeper. And it does give explanations to certain questions that one encounters with quantum mechanics (most of which can be condensed up though!). I found real analysis to be a bit tricky but complex analysis easier. </p>\n<p>The continuum can be very murky ground indeed! Interestingly, most of my friends from Physics are people who don&#8217;t really care about differential geometry and the like (hard-core experimentalists or people whose research interests just don&#8217;t involve curved spacetime) In my experience, people who are into GR and the like tend to be more on the mathematical side of things.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Shozab", "published": "2018-04-04 09:23:22+00:00", "title": "By: Shozab"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Hi Scott.
