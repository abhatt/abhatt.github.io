Grothendieck&#8217;s celebrated question &#8220;What is a metre?&#8221; inspires us to conceive interferometers; the quest for stable wavelengths inspires us to conceive lasers; stable lasers (and masers) answer the question &#8220;What is a second?&#8221;; with metres and seconds in-hand we observe the trajectories of (conserved) masses and (conserved) charges, so that the questions &#8220;What is a kilogram?&#8221; and &#8220;What is a coulomb?&#8221; receive answers, the coupling of magnetic fields yields answers to &#8220;What is a tesla?&#8221;; with Josephson junctions and the integer quantum Hall effect we close metrology triangles by answering questions like &#8220;What is a volt?&#8221; and &#8220;What is an ohm?&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Finally (and most mysteriously) the practical need to conduct experiments deep in a gravity well in an accelerated frame-of-reference forces us to scrupulously account for general relativistic effects (at the classical level).</p>\n<p>The ability to efficiently <i>simulate</i> these experiments is (at it seems to me) equally miraculous to the ability to accurately <i>conduct</i>, and here Scott&#8217;s question &#8216;What could we have changed in order to make <i>X</i> false?&#8217; receives a natural answer, namely: &#8220;The (strictly restricted) set of Hamiltonian functions that nature provides is naturally matched to the (strictly algebraic) state-spaces that geometric mechanics requires for efficient simulation, such that neither can be altered without falsifying &#8216;Postulate X&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp; The rising tide of textbooks on this topic&nbsp;&mdash; <i>e.g.</i> Doran and Lasenby&#8217;s  <i>Geometric Algebra for Physicists</i> (2003), and Holm, Schmah and Stoica&#8217;s <i>Geometric Mechanics and Symmetry: from Finite to Infinite Dimensions</i> (2009)&nbsp;&hellip; and there are many more&nbsp;&mdash; helps us to perceive an abundance of practical 21st century STEAM-implications that flower naturally from Grothendieck&#8217;s quasi-philosophical question &#8220;What is a metre?&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Open questions</b>&nbsp; Is Nature mindful of the Postulate X&#8217;s link of privileged Hamiltonian functions to privileged algebraic geometries?
