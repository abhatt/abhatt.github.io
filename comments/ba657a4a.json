[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Great post. I too find these technological disaster analyses fascinating. I am a big fan of those airplane disaster tv shows. My wife doesn&#8217;t get it and can&#8217;t watch as it reminds her of vulnerabilities while flying. Instead, I find them mildly reassuring in that they end with a mention of how they&#8217;ve fixed things so the particular accident won&#8217;t happen again.  However, the real attraction of these shows is the real-life detective stories. Perhaps they should start another series to expand beyond just airplane crashes. There have been a few special shows to treat one-off disasters but I&#8217;m sure there are more accidents they could cover, such as the recent one you mention here.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Paul Topping", "published": "2018-10-20 16:47:56+00:00", "title": "By: Paul Topping"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Fantastic post\u2026 when that story originally broke I couldn\u2019t understand why it wasn\u2019t getting more widespread coverage, and went days with only vague explanation.

One reason for those differences is that the electrical grid operates on a millisecond time scale; when there&#8217;s a fault, there&#8217;s just no time to call a supervisor.

If automated cars will kill LESS people than human driven ones, it will already regarded as a success, even if some mayhem surely is bound to happen with automated cars, too.

It is a Pressurized Water Reactor, meaning the core is always supposed to be covered with water. There is a device called the pressurizer which has a steam bubble in it that maintains the pressure in the system. (Upwards of 2000psi). The problem was the level transmitter in the pressurizer, operators turned off the safety injection system as they thought the pressurizer was going to become full which could result in over pressurizing the reactor coolant system. The opposite happened&#8230;pressurizer emptied, transferring the steam bubble to the reactor. Operators then realized the pressurizer went low and turned on the safety injection system. Unfortunately as the reactor got uncovered due to steam decay heat created more steam forcing more water out of the reactor. Pressurizer level rose (due to water displaced from reactor being forced into it) operators turned off safety injection again thinking they had recovered not realizing the reactor core was uncovered.</p>\n]]>", "author": "born01930", "published": "2018-10-23 12:51:46+00:00", "title": "By: born01930"}]
