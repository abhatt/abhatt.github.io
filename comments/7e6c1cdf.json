You&#8217;re wrong.  You don&#8217;t have the ability to find the information that would help you determine the truth.</p>\n<p>This started in 1995, and has been getting worse since.  It will probably culminate in 2022 (And as a result, people will be forced to adapt).  The sheer volume of available information makes it difficult to find relevant information.  You failed to research everything properly, because you don&#8217;t know how to do research in the current environment.  You&#8217;re probably so used to specialized scientific research that you haven&#8217;t adapted to the changes.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re wrong about everything in relation to Trump and Hillary.

Anything based on an internal inconsistency is inherently wrong (example: feminism)<br />\n2) look for instances where complexity is added to make the observations fit together (example: quantum color physics).  All added complexity is inherently false, but the observations are usually true, which makes the interpretation of the observations false.<br />\n3) look for the components that lack this inconsistency or complexity.  Then, check the exact opposite viewpoint in the same way.<br />\n3a) If the inconsistencies and complexities are the same as their opposite, the observations involved are true, and the interpretation has some merit.  The truth is a combination of both and neither.<br />\n3b) If opposing views have different types and levels of inconsistencies and complexities, then the chance of one interpretation being true is a direct ratio of the inverse of their scaled and weighted inconsistencies.  The least inconcistent is more likely to be true.  (eg: 20% inconsistency vs 60% inconsistency = 80:40 ratio chance of being true about any single detail)<br />\n3c) if both opposing views are inconsistent in different ways, both are equally wrong. The truth is something both different and unrelated, and requires both making a new observation and thinking from a different paradigm.<br />\n4) If everyone thinks it&#8217;s true, nobody did any fact-checking or source-checking (example: wikipedia&#8217;s sources about commonly held beliefs (like &#8220;comets are dirty ice balls&#8221;).  It&#8217;s probably based on a false premise, and merely approximates the truth periodically.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect you to know about this, because only 20% of the first-world population has an ability to do research right now.  And only 20% of that has an understanding of how to do research.  And only 20% of that can explain it to some extent.  To do research in the current environment requires an intuition honed to find inconsistency and complexity.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: You&#8217;re wrong.  The reason you&#8217;re wrong is because you lack the sentience required to understand how the world is different now, and how the world has been changing since 1995.

The situation is serious. Its important to focus on the big-picture stuff and not get distracted. Below are my thoughts on what Trump&#8217;s presidency could result in.</p>\n<p>Category I: apocalyptic (my estimate of the probability of at least one of these occurring is 5%)</p>\n<p>1) Trump&#8217;s comments embolden Putin to invade the Baltic states. Europe responds. WWWIII ensues. ICBMs are launched. All major cities are vaporized. Nuclear winter follows. Human civilization ends.</p>\n<p>2) Tensions in the South China sea escalate due to Trump&#8217;s mishandling. War with China ensues. ICBMs are launched. All major cities are vaporized. Nuclear winter follows. Human civilization ends.</p>\n<p>Category II: disastrous (my estimate of the probability of at least one of these occurring is 50%)</p>\n<p>1) Trump triggers a trade war with China. Global trade grinds to a halt due to tit-for-tat escalation of tarriffs and other trade restrictions. The world plunges into Great Depression II.</p>\n<p>2) Trump carries out his proposal to &#8220;renegotiate&#8221; the US national debt, thereby shaking investor confidence. Ratings of US bonds are downgraded. Interest rates on US government debt rise. This strains the US federal budget, calling into question the US government&#8217;s ability to honor its debts, further eroding investor confidence and driving rates even higher. This runaway feedback loop continues until the US finally defaults, thus triggering Great Depression II.</p>\n<p>3) Trump&#8217;s comments embolden Putin to invade the Baltic states. Europe doesn&#8217;t respond. 6 million people lose sovereignty and come under the control of an autocratic and corrupt regime.</p>\n<p>4) Trump kicks Islamophobia into overdrive. Muslims have their visas revoked and are deported. McCarthy-style witch hunts are initiated. Federal employees are forced to take loyalty tests and can be fired merely for associating with Muslims. An inflamed populace sporadically explodes into outbreaks of mob violence against Muslims. Possibly internment camps are built.</p>\n<p>5) Trump attempts to implement his plan for deporting Mexican illegal immigrants. Great human suffering ensues. Families are torn apart. $400 billion is spent.</p>\n<p>6) Haphazardly improvised foreign policy leads to war with a large secondary power, such as North Korea or Iran. Several tens of millions of people are killed.</p>\n<p>Category III: standard republican platform stuff (my estimate of at least one of these happening 95%)</p>\n<p>1) Re-instating torture camps for suspected terrorists.</p>\n<p>2) Trump, in collaboration with republican-controlled congress, instates substantial tax breaks on the rich combined with increased spending, which lead to ballooning deficits.</p>\n<p>3) US pulls out of climate agreements and abandons clean energy efforts. No immediate effects are seen. Decades later, when effects of climate change are costing tens or hundreds of millions of lives and doing trillions of dollars of damage, scientists estimate that a nontrivial fraction of the damage was caused by Trump&#8217;s policies. They are almost certainly correct but about half of Americans don&#8217;t believe them.</p>\n<p>Category IV: miscellaneous</p>\n<p>1) Policy changes on vaccination lead to proliferation of non-vaccinated kids. Thousands of American children unnecessarily die of gruesome diseases.</p>\n<p>I guess the rational thing to focus on is how to prepare for these scenarios. The category I disasters can&#8217;t be prepared for. If they happen we&#8217;re hosed. To prepare for category II, I guess make sure you and your loved ones have up to date passports, maybe buy some gold and stash it in a hiding place, keep your CV up to date, and help your Muslim friends set up plans for employment abroad in case things turn bad in the US?

A moral sense? If it&#8217;s simply a question of morality I believe that&#8217;s something we can live with. I can think of situations where a democracy would be worse and not just in a moral sense. Suppose you have 100 people, 5 of which are educated and understand the severity of climate change, whereas the remaining 95 are not. And suppose they&#8217;re asked to vote on whether to take measures to prevent man-made climate change. This would be a very costly process so ultimately each voter would have to consider whether it is worth it. The 95 who are not well informed about the issue could simply say &#8220;well, we&#8217;ve been told about climate change, but we don&#8217;t really see this happening, maybe the science is wrong, scientists have been wrong before&#8221; or &#8220;so it gets a little warmer, so what?&#8221;. So the majority will decide to not take preventive measures and everyone is screwed in the long term. You could say that those 5 people should do everything they can to educate the 95 on the dangers of climate change, but if this is unsuccessful or takes too long everyone is still screwed in the long term.</p>\n<p>I agree that it is a slippery slope, but I think that one should consider other options and keep an open mind. I also think that if the appropriate safeguards are put in place it would prevent situations like the one you described (discarding the people who don&#8217;t think).<br />\nWe shouldn&#8217;t become religious about democracy and say that we should keep it because it has always pretty much worked and the alternatives could take us down very dark paths.

Why might some otherwise reasonable people want to entertain this idea? for what <em>structural</em> reasons? &#8230; In this comment, let me explore this matter, in my own way, a lengthy, meandering, even a very boring way&#8230;</p>\n<p>Thinking of this thing&#8212;what are the structural reasons that might lead to entertaining the very idea of the weighted votes&#8212;I think that the following fact gives the necessary clue.</p>\n<p>The USA today is a <em>mixed</em> economy. It does not have a full Laissez-Faire Capitalistic system, i.e. a system where there is a complete separation of government and economic (or productive) activities. The domain of the government in the USA today far exceeds the limited mandate it should be given in conducting its activities. In the system as it exists by now, by controlling the economic life of a man (even if only partially), the modern American system also goes on to control <em>all</em> other aspects of a man&#8217;s life, coloring all his decisions, whether to small or great degrees (even if rather indirectly in spheres other than economic).</p>\n<p>It is due to the improper existence of the government control in the life of the citizen that elections can at all assume such a  huge, unduly high, importance. </p>\n<p>To Americans: If you have ever wondered why many otherwise active non-American bloggers didn&#8217;t post a lot on their own blogs or didn&#8217;t participate in your elections-related discussions a lot, the reason is: they are not under your <em>government</em>. Whatever actions your government undertakes, it affects them only indirectly, via international relations and trade, and sometimes not at all&#8212;whether positively or negatively. For example, during the times of the enormously overwhelming license-quota raj in India, Indian entrepreneurs did <em>not</em> benefit much from the relatively greater freedom you enjoyed under your the then governments&#8212;and <em>you</em>, understandably (and properly), didn&#8217;t even care for the most part. </p>\n<p>In other words, (i) the government controls <em>do</em> matter, (ii) the <em>improper</em> ones among the government controls matter most crucially, and (iii) <em>all </em>government controls&#8212;whether proper or improper&#8212;matter in a most direct manner <em>only</em> to those who are being governed under that government.</p>\n<p>To return to the main theme: elections have become so (god)damn important only because the system is not free: your system is part-statism, and therefore, only in part free. </p>\n<p>It is only because of the intrusions of a government in the areas of the life of a citizen where it should not be intruding, that elections assume so hugely undue an importance. </p>\n<p>The undue importance of elections is a <em>structural</em> feature of the present-day American political system; it is not a passing social trend. You get so excited about your elections, only due to this fundamental reason. In a complete Laissez Faire Capitalistic system, you would <em>not</em> have got so excited (and much more!)</p>\n<p>The election of (any) one party, under such a structure (of being at least in part conforming to statism), has the immediate effect that decisions regarding <em>all</em> aspects of an ordinary citizen&#8217;s life are taken in accordance with (or at least in preference to) that party&#8217;s agenda which &#8220;wins&#8221; the election. It does not matter whether the party in power is R or D. There is no scope for R&D here; the matter is straight-forward, regardless of whether it is R or D which comes to power. Whatever be the party in power, it is not only allowed but even encouraged, by the structural features of the system itself, to act as if each vote for it had got had carried a weighting factor that is greater than unity.</p>\n<p>In principle, even just a single vote that gives a &#8220;victory&#8221; to an internal party of a single nation acquires undue importance only because it assumes an <em>improperly</em> high strength of the structural leverage to coerce the lives of all: including the lives of the &#8220;loosers.&#8221; The structure of the polity itself is such that it in principle paves a way for the majority to control the manner in which the individuals constituting the minority might not otherwise have conducted their own, individual lives. (It also affects those in the majority in a decidedly bad manner, but this bad occurs over a rather long run, and so let me not get into it here; otherwise, this comment would become <em>even</em> longer, and you don&#8217;t want me to do that, do you?)</p>\n<p>Thus, it is the structural feature of the present-day American government system which is such that, due to the improper presence of government in the areas of life in which it has no business of being in, the unavoidable <em>effect</em> it produces is as if the democratic electoral process were to add a high weightage to the individual votes on the &#8220;winning&#8221; side.</p>\n<p>The party that loses the election may now think of not having this (objectively undue, coerced) burden on them, and in order to counter-act the same, it may wonder if each of <em>their own</em> votes could not have carried a weight such that it would have numerically exceeded the &#8220;victor&#8221;&#8212;even if only by a $latex \\epsilon \\in \\mathcal{Re}$, not $latex \\mathcal{N}$. </p>\n<p>The point to realize is that none would have to direct his thoughts towards <em>any</em> weighting schemes if the government itself were always to be kept limited to its proper sphere. [As to what constitutes the proper functions of government, I suggest, see Ayn Rand.]</p>\n<p>Your present system <em>is</em> bad, but there <em>are</em> things which are even worse than your present system. An introduction of a weighting scheme at the electoral stage is one of them.</p>\n<p>First of all, since the statism-related parts in the governmental system have not been addressed and therefore even possibly touched at all, the objective grievances due to an improperly large, increasingly statist, government would still continue to exist regardless of which party comes to power through whatever weighting scheme.</p>\n<p>Second, the weighting scheme, right in the medium run, would seamlessly integrate a new&#8212;and bad&#8211;structural tendency into the polity: that of permanently producing a higher and higher weightage to whichever party that then happens to be in power. Observe that the particulars of a weighting scheme would be under the authority of those who already are in power, and the details therefore would be tweaked so as to benefit them.</p>\n<p>This being a <em>structural</em> feature, it would fast accelerate, in a nonlinearly fast manner, the transition from a &#8220;mere&#8221; mixed economy to an establishment of a total dictatorship. </p>\n<p>(May be Raoul Ohio is a closet dictator himself! &#8230; Are you, Raoul?&#8230; Just want to check before actually accusing you, that&#8217;s all.) </p>\n<p>The solution, therefore, is in understanding the place where the source for the existing (implicit) weighting system is located, and then removing it. </p>\n<p>The solution is not seeking to add yet another weighting scheme, now also to the electoral process, thereby also maundering this, relatively cleaner, part of the political system. </p>\n<p>The solution, to repeat, is to remove <em>all</em> weightings&#8212;explicit and implicit, whether at the electoral stage or at the governance stage.</p>\n<p>The solution, I do realize, does not seem to be a very smart way of thinking. At least, it does not tease the creative juices of the Shtetl-Optimized blog-readers into thinking which of the electoral-process weighting schemes would be better and why. The proposed solution therefore may look staid and boring&#8230; Perhaps the only thing more boring might be having to have read this much through this shitty comment. &#8230; Don&#8217;t worry, one or two <em>more</em> paragraphs are coming up!</p>\n<p>No matter how &#8220;old&#8221; and &#8220;boring&#8221; the proposed solution may look, as to its being &#8220;old,&#8221; well, it has never existed <em>in toto</em> anywhere&#8212;not even in the history of the USA. </p>\n<p>As to its being &#8220;boring,&#8221; well, boring it may be, to some, but it will work, always, and for all, because it is the one which is in harmony with the metaphysical nature of man&#8212;with a view of man as an autonomous living being, as one who has free will and can shape his life according to his own individual choices. To bring this view of man into politics <em>is</em> to have a system that is free of any improper coercion by a government. The original American system was <em>close</em> to this ideal. </p>\n<p>Sure, cleansing a polity at the systemic level <em>is</em> harder, in that it takes sustained efforts over the long term. But effecting the cleansing at the systemic level also are strong, very strong. </p>\n<p>To see how strong and large effects are produced due to changes at the systemic level, consider the fact that America could prosper to such a great extent in the 19th century&#8212;even during the times that slavery had not yet been abolished, and later on, even when women (of any race) were not allowed to vote. Keeping women out of the voting <em>was</em>, effectively, a weighting scheme&#8212;with a weight of zero. Removing this part, which occurred only in the 20th century, must have been great, but they are not very clear for us to see or isolate. The trouble was: the 20th century also was the time when, structurally, America began embracing statism. (Taxes were introduced only in the 20th century.) And, as I told you, the systemic changes are far stronger than the electoral process reforms, and so, even effecting the universal suffrage, thereby expanding the voter population by a factor of two, still could not compensate the bad effects due to the tilt towards statism. </p>\n<p>Today, USA grows only at about 2%, and despite being one of the wealthiest nation (owing to its better past), there is an increasing discontent, even rage in the American society&#8212;even if American women now can not only vote but one of them in fact came so close to becoming a President! The cause, once again I suggest, is to be located in the <em>structural</em> features of the polity&#8212;there is a hidden weighting scheme residing in the mixed nature of the polity itself, and you have to get rid of it.</p>\n<p>[Don&#8217;t worry, I will not post any more replies on this thread.

Why is this?</ul>\n<p>There have been too many threads for me to answer all of them, but I at least wanted to answer this.</p>\n<p>Yes, the left has been &#8220;tormenting me all my life,&#8221; but <i>they&#8217;ve only been able to torment me because I&#8217;ve actually cared what they think.</i>  After all, whatever excesses the left has been guilty of, <i>they&#8217;re</i> the ones who have historically been associated with reason and Enlightenment and democracy and tolerance and environmentalism and almost everything else I&#8217;ve ever considered to be good.  They&#8217;ve been on the right side of history about slavery and women&#8217;s suffrage and Nazism and civil rights and gay rights and climate change, which is a pretty impressive track record (on the other side of the ledger, we have Marxism and its cultural offshoots, but those were never part of <i>my</i> leftism anyway).</p>\n<p>So sure, my respect for liberal ideals gave my fellow liberals the power of shame over me, and maybe it&#8217;s not surprising in retrospect that some of them tried to abuse that power.</p>\n<p>I confess: these past few days, I&#8217;ve reflected on the irony that, in my uncompromising rejection of Trumpism, one of my closest <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-misogyny-apocalypse-turns-out-being-white-and-male-counts-for-more-than-intelligence-grace-or-decency/?utm_source=facebook&#038;utm_medium=socialflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;allies&#8221;</a> is now Amanda Marcotte.  And, in desperately searching for the tiniest silver lining from this week&#8217;s catastrophe, I&#8217;ve wondered whether I should be happy that at least <i>Marcotte&#8217;s</i> upset, and it serves her right for cruelly bullying me? But then I find that, no, I can&#8217;t work up any schadenfreude about it.</p>\n<p>(For one thing, as <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/09/28/ssc-endorses-clinton-johnson-or-stein/\" rel=\"nofollow\">others have pointed out</a>, Trump&#8217;s rise to power will probably just make the social-justice people even more self-certain about the urgency of their cause, and hence more merciless in cracking down on shy male nerds like me.)</p>\n<p>The power that Trump supporters have over me is purely temporal: even if, let&#8217;s say, a bunch of right-wing goons threw me into prison and beat me savagely while calling me a kike, there&#8217;s a sense in which it wouldn&#8217;t get to me, because <i>I don&#8217;t care what they think.</i>  Whereas a single negative word from a really intelligent feminist would bother me a thousand times more.</p>\n<p>You might ask: will my standing side-by-side with the social-justice feminists, in our shared urge to deny the slightest legitimacy to Trump&#8217;s rule, cause any of those feminists to change their view of me?  Judging from the above thread, my guess is no: you can already see several SJWs attacking me as an even bigger white male cishet douchecanoe than they imagined, because I cry about the destruction that Trump will wreak, yet I fail to acknowledge that the United States is <i>already</i> a racist, sexist dystopia that Trump couldn&#8217;t possibly make any worse.</p>\n<p>So, let&#8217;s suppose for the sake of argument that the more vociferously I agree with the SJWs in their anti-Trumpism, the more they just invent new reasons to hate me.  Should that cause me to rethink my anti-Trumpism itself?  If it does, then I&#8217;m a moral weakling and coward.  Here&#8217;s my prayer for tonight: God, though you sit inertly while our world goes to hell, still, grant me the strength to choose my allies because of my principles, rather than my principles because of my allies.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2016-11-12 07:05:31+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Michael P #204, Random Oracle #208, Scott #216: Thanks for the thoughtful responses.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Dan J.", "published": "2016-11-12 06:51:59+00:00", "title": "By: Dan J."}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Out of curiosity: on the topic of pro-life voters on-average having sided more with Trump than Hillary, I could believe that this was the right choice given their values.
