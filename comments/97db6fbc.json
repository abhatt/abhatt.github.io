Always. Because polities are about accommodations and compromises, not logically coherent anythings. Which is why cleaving to any absolutism, includent speech freedoms, will land you in serious trouble. The same is true when looking at ghastly beliefs: going to the logical endpoint is a mistake. I don&#8217;t, for instance, believe that my near neighbors think I&#8217;d make a nice lampshade. They&#8217;d be appalled by the idea and hurt that I&#8217;d think such a thing of them. But I do believe that there&#8217;s enough baked-in and rather old antisemitism, and nativism, that they&#8217;d be readily convinced that everyone would probably be better off if I was sent to live among my own kind, and that this would allow them to sit by while people who did like the lampshade idea came and collected me. The goal then is to prevent things from aligning such that this scenario becomes a realistic possibility: primarily by making it unlikely that they&#8217;d listen to a word the Nazis said, or that the Nazis would be on the stage in the first place.</p>\n<p>In other words: everything is ad hoc.

There would probably then be some conversation about whether to make a general &#8220;do not say under pain of censure&#8221; rule, and then you&#8217;d have the usual arguments about the line between broad and meaningless.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll preface this for benefit of others with IANAL, but have worked for national-level legislators and helped write state legislation, also helped block state legislation.</p>\n<p>Laws are either administrative &#8212; you have to have schools, roads, dental clinics, etc., and there have to be rules for how these things operate &#8212; or they&#8217;re about something bad that happened, when the absence of a law to handle it made things worse. (Or they&#8217;re about reshaping rules to your own advantage, as lobbyists do, but that&#8217;s a different class of laws and not what I&#8217;m talking about here.) In general if nothing bad has happened nobody has a reason to make a law. Sometimes the administrative laws are also because of bad things but often it&#8217;s just that common agreement on the rules is necessary and maybe they&#8217;re simply lifted from elsewhere after some study and a decision that yeah, that should work, and we&#8217;ll change it if it doesn&#8217;t. </p>\n<p>It seems to me that when legislators make a law, assuming they&#8217;re serious about it, the main concern is whether the law will work. Not whether it&#8217;s good and complete and just, but whether it&#8217;s good enough, complete enough, and just enough to work, meaning that it settles the kinds of arguments that arise often and doesn&#8217;t sow confusion in the courts and does not make a proliferation of new cases. Or constitutional challenges. And in the end the arbiters of these things will usually be judges who interpret them with the aid of custom. Not justice, not goodness, but custom, because if they cut very much against the grain of what the society views as acceptable, if they&#8217;re a reasonable novelty, you get an uproar. The society has to be ready for that uproar before you get the ruling. (I believe all three state supreme-court justices in Iowa who ruled for the legality of gay marriage and were up for reelection in the following cycle lost their jobs.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes the politics land you with laws that fail spectacularly to work, like the three-strikes laws. But I think this is the exception and that usually the failures are slow-burn failures of imagination or come from simple ignorance on the part of the lawmakers. I&#8217;ll give you a boring example: </p>\n<p>My state is fairly progressive on the garnishing of wages for child support; it doesn&#8217;t matter whether the parent is a statutory employee or a contractor, if you pay the parent regularly, you can be told to garnish the wages. If the parent owns a company, the parent him or herself can receive the court order to garnish: pay yourself a salary, pay the support. There&#8217;s a hole in the law, though, where single-member limited liability corporations come in. The IRS treats them as legal fictions, which they are. It&#8217;s basically a sole proprietorship. LLC owners don&#8217;t have to pay themselves a salary; they can just treat revenues as their own personal income, so there&#8217;s no step at which to garnish a wage, even though the money is there. But the state treats them as corporations, expecting them to keep normal corporate books, pay salaries, etc. And yes, people do try to use LLCs to evade support obligations.</p>\n<p>I ran into this about a year ago, when my ex stopped paying support for a while and formed an LLC. So I got in touch with my state rep and said hey, there&#8217;s a problem with the code, even your assistant AG doesn&#8217;t know what to do with it, and the code needs amending to cover the issue. And she was quite helpful about it, got herself up to speed on the issue, was ready to write language when I solved the problem another way, at which point it became hypothetical. That rep and I had worked on related problems several years ago, when the state issued debit cards to receive state payments including child support; the bank handling the transactions took the opportunity to profiteer by attaching all sorts of fees and nickel-and-diming the poor, single parents, the disabled, etc. And I believe that problem got fixed. </p>\n<p>Even a hate-speech law is a response to a pressing, existing problem, written in the knowledge that amendment or overturn will someday likely happen. A similar thing: extremely severe punishment for knowingly transmitting AIDS. A lot of states have these laws, and they were written in the 80s and early 90s not only out of homophobia but because AIDS meant you&#8217;d die. These days AIDS probably doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll die, but the cases are rare anyway. As they come to court, though, the issue arises, there&#8217;s an activist outcry, and maybe the law changes or is rescinded altogether. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to recognize that most of the people writing the laws &#8212; assuming it&#8217;s legislators and not some sharpie &#8212; aren&#8217;t terrifically bright, and they&#8217;re trying to solve existing problems by fashioning a new blunt instrument in the law. And the question is whether the problem is bad enough that you&#8217;ll take a blunt instrument over nothing at all. </p>\n<p>When I see large numbers of neo-nazis aggregating, organizing, ginning each other up, and making new myth for themselves on large social-media platforms, and see their language and baloney stories leaking out into more general conversations, I say yeah, let&#8217;s have that blunt instrument. Push that stuff back into the corners. And if we&#8217;re lucky, we fix what there is to fix in the law later.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2016-11-27 07:05:46+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>It looks as though the Stein fundraising campaing has ground to a halt (after covering a lot of ground).

Rapes, murders, you name it. Oh, and a lot of showing off about prizes and whatnot.</p>\n<p>I think I see what happened, though, why the online social world turned into that. The medium\u2019s actually being used as it was meant to be used: it\u2019s a freely available press. The problem is that most people have nothing much to say. The people who do have something to say are generally either propagandists or eyeball-seekers \u2014 they\u2019ve got a cause, or they\u2019re promoting something, or they\u2019re trying to package and sell an audience. So of course they overwhelmed the place almost as soon as it opened up, and things get worse and worse, because they have to outshout each other, and recruit other people to shout on their behalf, preferably for free. And now and then a volunteer shouter can\u2019t handle the shouting anymore and gets so mad that he actually leaves his house and tries to attack the other-side people for real.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s almost impossible not to get into polemical arguments as soon as you show up there, and why you have this ridiculous situation where polite, friendly conversation\u2019s squeezed in and among a lot of yelling about blood and sales. It\u2019s not a conversational medium anymore and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. Back in USENET days, yes, it was conversational \u2014 polemical, sure, but because it was mostly academics talking, they were already bound by codes of collegiality and fear of professional repercussions. No such things exist in online argument now&#8230;.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible to have ordinary conversation again online.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2016-11-28 06:48:09+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>amy, astute observation. The fact that monetization rewards clicks is not helping either. But the fact that  academics manage to have more civil online chats lends me to believe that teaching how to use this media may make a difference.  Maybe if this was started early on it could lead to a generation that is less emotionally crippled when it comes to online speech.</p>\n<p>As it is, I find that these days only platforms that are moderated in some form facilitate meaningful online conversations  (occasional exception non-withstanding).</p>\n<p>That is why I&#8217;ve came around with regards to European style hate speech laws (which for a while I considered relics), since it would make such moderation mandatory.</p>\n]]>", "author": "quax", "published": "2016-11-28 18:33:51+00:00", "title": "By: quax"}]
