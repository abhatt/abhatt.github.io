Here are three.</p>\n<p><b>Theme One</b>&nbsp; Susan Wloszczyna&#8217;s review (cited in #32) suggests:<br />\n<blockquote>&#8220;The lives of many of these ladies [who are spouses of mathematicians] often would provide enough material for a potentially fascinating film all on their own.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Recommended as a concrete example is Yannick Grannec&#8217;s scrupulously detailed (and best-selling, prize-winning, etc.) novelization of the marriage of and Adele and Adele Porkert and Kurt G\u00f6del: <i>The Goddess of Small Victories</i> (2014).  Adele and Kurt&#8217;s rich story would make a &#8220;must see&#8221; movie for plenty of folks (well, me anyway).</p>\n<p><b>Theme Two</b>&nbsp; As Scott&#8217;s review mentions, the medical knowledge of Ramanujan&#8217;s generation plausibly would have sufficed to prevent Ramanujan&#8217;s death (in 1920) from hepatic amoebiasis.  So it is natural to wonder, whether the knowledge of Arlene (Greenbaum) Feynman&#8217;s generation similarly would have sufficed to prevent Arlene&#8217;s death (in 1945) from tuberculosis&nbsp;&mdash; Arlene being Richard Feynman&#8217;s young wife.</p>\n<p>Let us assume, for the sake of Hollywood melodrama, that a small team of ambitious young scientists, familiar with Arlene&#8217;s desperate case, and familiar too with the medical literature of the era, were willing to build upon top-secret Army-sponsored biomedical research, with the help of state-of-the-art chemical separation techniques, and bend the rules to attempt a miracle cure&nbsp;mdash; a cure that succeeded against all odds? </p>\n<p>What&#8217;s remarkable is that this high-drama story is historically <i>true</i>&nbsp;&hellip; and it happened in November of 1944&nbsp;&hellip; seven months <i>before</i> Arlene Feynman&#8217;s death in June of 1945. For the well-documented details of the then-miraculous cure of tuberculosis patient &#8220;Patricia T&#8221; as history knows her, see for example Carol Dyer&#8217;s (scholarly) <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=YA2Mupc2aM0C&pg=PA64\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Tuberculosis</i></a> and/or Peter Pringle&#8217;s (more sensational) <i>Experiment Eleven: Dark Secrets Behind the Discovery of a Wonder Drug</i> (2012).</p>\n<p>Might Feynman plausibly have learned of this Army-sponsored, high-risk/high-payoff tuberculosis research, and with the help of Groves&#8217; and Oppenheimer&#8217;s unlimited clout, heroically arranged for &#8220;Arlene F&#8221; to be a second &#8220;Patricia T&#8221;?  </p>\n<p>If there&#8217;s anything to Many Worlds quantum theory, the remarkable (even sobering) answer is &#8220;yes, definitely&#8221;.</p>\n<p><b>Theme Three</b>&nbsp; Scott&#8217; vivid memories (in the o.p.) of a &#8220;childhood self&#8221; who was enduringly inspired by the Ramanujan/Hardy story, finds a beautiful (for me) echo in mathematician Robert Langland&#8217;s much-cited essay &#8220;Is&nbsp;there beauty in mathematical theories?&#8221; (2013, this essay is collected in editor Vittorio H\u00f6sle&#8217;s <i>The Many Faces of Beauty</i>; note that Google finds Langland&#8217;s essay on-line); </p>\n<p>Langland&#8217;s Scott-themed passages include:<br />\n<blockquote>Both G.W.Dunnington, the author of <i>Gauss, Titan of Science</i> (1954) and W.K. B\u00fchler, the author of <i>Gauss, A Biographical Study</i> (1981), perhaps the two best-known Gauss biographies, seem to me singularly insensitive to the value to an adolescent of even a very brief introduction to intellectual possibilities [&hellip;] </p>\n<p>My purpose here [in this essay] is to make the case for a mathematical beauty that transcends neither the simple mathematical pleasures of arithmetic and geometry nor the fascination of difficult problems but that integrates them with the quite different intellectual pleasure of creating order from seeming chaos, even in an inconsequential&nbsp;&mdash; but not for me&nbsp;&mdash; realm.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In particular, Langland&#8217;s &#8220;Section 5: From algebraic number theory to spectroscopy&#8221;, provides a multigenerational algebraic perspective on the research of quantum luminaries that include (in alphabetical order) Balmer, Bohr, Dirac, Lyman, Pauli, Schr\u00f6dinger, and Wigner.  </p>\n<p>Langland&#8217;s observations provide <i>plenty</i> of algebraic meat for quantum researchers to digest (however this comment has grown sufficiently long that I had best refrain from listing further references) \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp; <i>Shtetl Optimized</i> readers who enjoy films like <i>The Man Who Knew Infinity</i>, and who have enjoyed too Scott&#8217;s fine review of it, are likely to enjoy the above-cited works by Yannick Grannec, Carol Dyer, Peter Pringle and (especially) Robert Langlands.  </p>\n<p>In&nbsp;aggregate, these works illuminate with a rainbow of light the diverse potentialities of mathematics to enrich lives, speed healing, and in general (in Langland&#8217;s phrase) &#8220;create order from seeming chaos.&#8221;   And as these works variously show, the &#8220;order created&#8221; can be variously personal, domestic, medical, scientific, and even universal.
