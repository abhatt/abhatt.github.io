[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Amy #139: Welcome back.</p>\n<p>I <i>hope</i> everyone here agrees that sending someone rape or murder threats is not only disgusting but criminal.  And in the cases you write about, it sounds like law enforcement is involved, as it should be.  Maybe they could be doing a better job, or maybe it&#8217;s just hard as a practical matter to track down the sources of the threats&#8212;I don&#8217;t know, and would be grateful if anyone wanted to give details.  As someone who&#8217;s received death threats himself, I can testify to how frightening it is, and speak from experience when I condemn such behavior in the strongest imaginable terms (as everyone should).  But it&#8217;s not obvious what moral debate we need to have: is there <i>anyone</i> within the &#8220;community of the reasonable&#8221; who isn&#8217;t already on our side?</p>\n<p>The reason I wrote this post is that, when it comes to online shaming&#8212;the &#8220;nonviolent&#8221; kind, which &#8220;only&#8221; tries to destroy jobs and reputations over minor verbal offenses&#8212;there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any similar consensus within the community of the reasonable, and I&#8217;d like create one.  Ironically, it seems like some of the activists who eloquently speak out against online rape threats and death threats, <i>themselves</i> gleefully participate in life-crushing public shaming campaigns, against victims who never threatened anyone but merely used the wrong word or told the wrong joke.</p>\n<p>If pressed to explain the tension, the activists might fall back on some variant of the famous formula you alluded to: &#8220;Men are afraid women will laugh at them.  Women are afraid men will kill them.&#8221;  (Or taking inspiration from Arthur Chu: &#8220;I&#8217;m concerned about crimes that could happen in the external world.  You&#8217;re only concerned about people getting called nasty names, which is purely a mental issue.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>If so, then this is a central point where I&#8217;d part ways from the activists.  Throughout recorded history, human beings often defended their reputations with their lives, <i>and it&#8217;s perfectly understandable why they did.</i>  A death threat can create immense fear (I know this!), but in the cases we&#8217;re talking about, at least you know that the whole moral and legal might of your community stands behind your physical safety.  A public shaming, by contrast, inevitably raises the question of suicide, because it purposefully creates the impression (whether true or not) that your entire community is <i>against</i> you, and will be forever.  I don&#8217;t know which of the two carries the greater risk of actual death.</p>\n<p>One other point where I disagree with you: in certain circumstances, I&#8217;d say that people <i>absolutely</i> have the right to complain if they&#8217;re singled out for punishment for crimes lots of other people are committing.  (And if we changed the example, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d agree: e.g., a poor black kid thrown in jail for marijuana possession while a rich white kid goes free.)  Indeed, one of the main tactics of despotic regimes is to make some nearly-universal behavior illegal, then selectively enforce the law against the regime&#8217;s enemies.</p>\n<p>In such cases, it seems to me like we should be asking the following two questions:<br />\n(1) <i>Is</i> the behavior actually that widespread?<br />\n(2) If it is, then should its widespread nature cause us to question whether <i>anyone</i> deserves to be punished for it?</p>\n<p>In the case of marijuana, I&#8217;d say the answers are (1) yes and (2) yes.  Marijuana laws shouldn&#8217;t be selectively enforced, they shouldn&#8217;t be enforced against <i>anyone</i>.</p>\n<p>In the case of serious financial crimes by CEOs, I&#8217;d say the answer to (1) is already no.  If the only people you can point to, who committed the same crime and got away with it, are a few other corrupt CEOs&#8212;well, sorry you got caught, dude.  Get in the back of the squad car.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Holocaust, I&#8217;d say the answers are (1) yes and (2) no.  Yes, almost everyone around you was doing the same thing.  And yes, <i>all</i> of you deserve to be punished.  And if we caught you, and failed to catch 10 other perpetrators&#8212;well, you should still be punished.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the case of puns about genitalia, made to amused listeners and accidentally overheard by non-amused ones, I&#8217;d say that just like for marijuana, the answers are (1) yes and (2) yes.  <i>No one</i>, male or female, is consistently above ribald humor: incredibly, <a href=\"http://uberfeminist.blogspot.com/2013/03/what-you-should-know-about-dongle-joke.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adria Richards herself tweeted penis jokes</a> (!) prior to this affair.  And yes, the ubiquity of the behavior, the lack of any intention to harm or offend, and the lack of any <i>actual</i> harm (to anyone except a few hardened privilege warriors), should together make it clear that destroying someone over this alleged &#8220;crime&#8221; is a much greater crime than the crime itself.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2015-03-01 22:24:30+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Rahul #140 &#8211; you&#8217;re assuming that women haven&#8217;t tried complaining to organizers and bosses about these kinds of things?

Of course women complain about these things &#8212; until it becomes apparent that by complaining they not only mark themselves as troublemakers, but nothing happens. There are actual studies. The vast majority of the time, when a woman brings up a harassment issue with a supervisor, she&#8217;s been fired or moved along within a couple of years and there&#8217;s been no disciplinary action against the harasser.
