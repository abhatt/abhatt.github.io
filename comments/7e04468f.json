I didn&#8217;t know about qD, and just now rapidly browsed the Wiki article on it, that&#8217;s all.) </p>\n<p>I think that it is not the preferred basis which is primarily problematic with ppnl #66&#8217;s model. (Problematic, in the sense, what makes it unlike the actual QM.) </p>\n<p>I think there is a more basic problem here, and it is the fact that the automaton has &#8220;a set of rules of physics that is classically deterministic.&#8221; By those words, I take it that ppnl does not mean a deterministic but chaotic process underlying those rules, and imparting an apparent disorder to their outcomes. I think he means that the updating rules are the simplest deterministic here; it&#8217;s just that the number of cells and updates are great.</p>\n<p>In ppnl&#8217;s model, presumably, not just the updating rules but also the measurement rules which the observer cell uses in making its measurements, follow a classical, deterministic criterion. If the criterion is deterministic, it will impart a preferred basis. </p>\n<p>The preferred basis thus is an outcome, an not an essential feature of the model. The basic reason the preferred basis comes about is: the classical determinism.</p>\n<p>If ppnl makes either of those two&#8212;the updating rules or the measurement rules&#8212;probabilistic, then the problem would actually go away. </p>\n<p>For QM to turn probabilistic the way it is described in its axiomatic description, it is sufficient if only the measurement rule is made probabilistic. The system evolution, represented here via the updates, could very well be deterministic. In QM, the Schrodinger evolution <i>is</i> deterministic anyway.</p>\n<p>Even if both the categories of rules (updating and measurements) are kept deterministic, the machine would still show certain similarities to the quantum mechanical (i.e. the actually existing) world&#8212;viz., a reduction in the number of input states required to get to a given observed state.</p>\n<p>Yet, IMO (for whatever it is worth), speaking overall, the way this model is built is <i>not</i> how people should go about thinking about QM. The QM is about going (i) from one measured (definite) state (in whatever basis) (ii) through the deterministic Schrodinger evolution (iii) to another, probabilistically measured (but definite) state (in whatever basis). Starting a description in the middle&#8212;at (ii)&#8212;-is conceptually more difficult if not dangerous. The best way to approach QM is to start at (i), and also end at (iii).

I won&#8217;t keep quoting your passages, though the context should make the particular reference clear. My reply does follow the order of your points in #84.</p>\n<p>1. OK. There are two different flavors of deterministic theories. One is linear, another nonlinear. The nonlinear theory (viz. that at least for some regimes of the input data, the output does not scale linearly with the input) is a good candidate for producing randomness. (Oh, BTW, &#8220;randomness&#8221; is &#8220;random-ness&#8221;: it <i>is</i> a matter of degrees.) All pseudo-random number generators rely precisely on such a (deterministic) nonlinearity. They <i>do</i> have <i>some</i> relevance to <i>some</i> points &#8220;related to QM.&#8221; All software simulations of QM phenomena rely on the pseudo random number generators&#8212;i.e. on the nonlinear determinism. If they thus are practically useful, so is the linear vs. nonlinear distinction, esp. in the context of a <i>software</i> model like CA. You failed to make it. <i>I</i> therefore had trouble understanding what you had in mind. </p>\n<p>If you would still only emphasize: &#8220;but it <i>is</i> deterministic,&#8221; then, sorry, I would have nothing to add further w.r.t. this point.</p>\n<p>2. There was a typo in my #80. Instead of &#8220;For QM to turn probabilistic,&#8221; it should be: &#8220;For CA to turn probabilistic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But there was no typo when I wrote <i>this</i> here:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even if both the categories of rules (updating and measurements) are kept deterministic, the machine would still show certain similarities to the quantum mechanical (i.e. the actually existing) world\u2014viz., a reduction in the number of input states required to get to a given observed state.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In particular, notice the words: &#8220;if,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;certain,&#8221; &#8220;similarities&#8221; etc. (Is skipping such words the reason you have difficulty understanding what I write? Were you very rapidly browsing what I wrote?)</p>\n<p>3. Yes, quantum measurements are random&#8212;in the sense, quantum measurements do show randomness. </p>\n<p>That what <i>quantum</i> measurements show is a perfect randomness, is a <i>hypothesis</i> not a physically established fact. &#8230; Actually, it&#8217;s not even a hypothesis. It is just a conjecture because none has found a sensitive and accurate enough way to experimentally verify it. If you must refer to Popper&#8217;s falsifiability criterion (and I don&#8217;t care to), the matter has not yet experimentally come within the realm of falsifiability.</p>\n<p>As to me, I don&#8217;t accept the position that randomness exists in a metaphysical sense. This point of our difference is philosophical in nature; in fact even you yourself said &#8220;ontologicaly.&#8221; But QM is not a philosophical theory&#8212;it is not a branch of or theory in ontology (or metaphysics) any more than it is not a branch of theology. QM is a theory of physics. Don&#8217;t club the two together.</p>\n<p>That there is no mechanism (for what? I take it for randomness) is what Born <i>might</i> have said&#8212;and I am not sure if he really actually said <i>that</i>. Bohr could easily have said it, also Heisenberg. But Born? I am not sure. </p>\n<p>In case Born did say that: Born was not God&#8212;merely a Nobel laureate. This position (i.e., pre-emptying any possibility of there being any deeper mechanism) is not worthy of any serious attention&#8212;not in physics. May be (and just may be) Born shares a philosophic point with you, that&#8217;s all&#8212;at the most. </p>\n<p>4. The preferred basis concept is not very clear to many people, I now gather. It (and qD) certainly is not very clear to me. The concept is new; what I gathered about it could be easily wrong&#8212;because the simpler sources (Wiki, Quora, others) could also be (at least partly) wrong about it. In any case, that part of my above comment could very easily be wrong. (It was just a blog comment, and I did indicate my lack of knowledge of qD etc.) </p>\n<p>As to Scott, I am sure, he would be admiringly capable of stating what <i>he</i> did have in mind.</p>\n<p>5. If you think that I am wrong, feel free to say so too. It won&#8217;t be an <i>ad hominem</i> if you are careful to distinguish the idea from the ideator. </p>\n<p>Also, in future, if you don&#8217;t understand something I write, simple: feel free to ask me (by private email, if you wish.)</p>\n<p>But in no case would I allow you to simply observe&#8212;though publicly&#8212;that you find me difficult to understand, and let the matter explicitly stop just at that. There can be implicit bad effects out of this practice, and I am concerned about them. </p>\n<p>On my own part, I most certainly <i>don&#8217;t</i> wish to be sneering, by just putting an emphasis: &#8220;oh, <i>you</i> (possibly: you <i>all</i>) don&#8217;t understand me,&#8221; either.
