It is not just some journalists who consider it a very dangerous deal. Those opposing TPP include many reputable civil rights organizations, environmental organization, consumer protection organizations, relief organizations, unions, academics, lawyers, and winners of Nobel prize in economics, &#8230; All the tricks that they are pulling to ratify it despite its massive unpopularity shows that the supporters of it don&#8217;t think they can convince the voters it is a good deal, if it was HRC wouldn&#8217;t have come against it and would have defended it since she was involved with it. The fact that this was negotiated for over 5 years in secret from the public while corporate lobbyists had complete access to the text while even senators had extremely restricted access to it show what kind interests it is going to serve. Let me tell you what is the goal of the US in TPP: they view China as a strategic threat and fear that it will dominate the markets, so this is an attempt to set the global rules to benefit the American companies, particularly big media, big entertainment, and big pharma. It is going to enforce some of the stupidest laws in the US on the rest of the world. On the other hand, it is going to remove the ability of citizens to regulate, and if they do so they can be sued in ISDS courts. Just to give an example of how these things work, the tobacco company Philip Morris sued several countries because those countries passed regulations that would force tobacco companies to use plan packages with the goal of dropping the rate of smoking among their population. The laws that TPP will impose contains rules similar to PIPA and SOPA that MPAA and RIAA promoted, would restrict generic drugs that save the life of millions of people, threaten environmental regulations required to fight climate change, &#8230; This massive agreement is about imposing laws undemocraticly and irrevocably on people and has little to do with trade restriction between countries. The patent and copyright laws in the US are some of the stupids ones in the world and now they are going to be imposed globally. TPP is totally designed to benefit the big corporations at the expense of small business and consumers. The support for TPP is from big corporations, not people! This is going to increase inequality even further. If someone hates the corrupting influence of money and big corporate lobbyists TPP is the mother of all of them. This is what they couldn&#8217;t even pass in the US congress let alone other countries. Isn&#8217;t it again ironic that Obama fast tracked it despite the opposition from the democratic senators by the support of the republican senators while no one was paying attention?</p>\n<p>You still don&#8217;t get it and it doesn&#8217;t seem you are not going to get.

I caucused for Bernie, I don&#8217;t involve myself in campaigns anymore, and you&#8217;ve got to be kidding about the vagina vote. You can stop flailing now.</p>\n<p>EFF is interested in its bit of TPP. Other organizations are interested in their bits of TPP. None of it means they&#8217;ve bothered with any of the rest of it, and you can&#8217;t look at individual pieces of trade agreements out of context because trade agreements come from wide-ranging negotiations. It&#8217;s not a chess match where they line up 400 players on one side and 400 on the other and each set of players hashes out a single issue. The question is: is it a good deal overall. And for that you have to look at the whole thing.</p>\n<p>In other words, if you want to understand it, you actually have to go do the work yourself. If I wanted to get started, I&#8217;d probably see if C-SPAN had any long programs with the US trade rep talking about it, just to get a sense of outlines and sticking points from our POV. </p>\n<p>You&#8217;re also yelling about truisms, not TPP. Of course major corporations, which used to be multinationals, and before that were transnationals, and in the mists of time were corporations in trusts and syndicates, work hand-in-glove with governments and run negotiations for their own benefit and not the people&#8217;s. You&#8217;re not Paul Revere, here. You want labor at the trade table on the US team, you&#8217;d better start domestically, by changing the labor-govt structure in ways that I can tell you the downtrodden will not accept: making trades unions an institution in government, as they are in Europe. </p>\n<p>The problem is that outside a few areas of this country with strong union histories, the downtrodden generally despise unions. Don&#8217;t want &#8217;em. And you can&#8217;t reason with people on this score. Goes right against that rhetoric of machismo and bootstrappiness. I&#8217;ve had destitute students from destitute families tell me that the minimum wage is for lazy people. And in fairness, unions do with great regularly fuck over their rank and file. They&#8217;ve not been great friends of poor women, either, particularly working caregivers. </p>\n<p>So when you find you can&#8217;t do that, you have to start looking at redistribution inside your own country. Likewise: ability to regulate (see under pre-emption), standing to sue, ability to sue rather than arbitrate &#8212; these are domestic problems first. If we have no control over them domestically, they won&#8217;t matter at the negotiating table. </p>\n<p>All of your arguing, incidentally, is internet arguing. It&#8217;s really plain from the way you&#8217;re constructing your arguments and the things you&#8217;re concerned about that you do not know anything about how regional trade negotiations work and why. And the don&#8217;t work simply by throwing the internet at them and having a rally. The Leave voters are, unfortunately, finding this out now, and in their dismay are already building conspiracy theories about who duped them and why. It turns out that the structures that allow the negotiations to happen in the first place not only matter but constrain how negotiations can go. Also that there are reasons, often very good if not happy reasons, for why they are that way.</p>\n<p>And I think this, in the end, is the seed of the discontent. Large number of people who are angry, some justifiably so, some recreationally, and what angers them more than anything else is that *these things are in fact complex and have structures*. And that before you can do anything, you have to learn how the machine works, on its own terms. At which point you get millions of angry people resorting to &#8220;Hulk smash&#8221;, and it never does go well.

You admit that these reputable organization and people have read TPP, at least the parts that is their specialty and have express VERY STRONG OPPOSITION to TPP. You accept that this is written for the interest of corporations not citizen. You agree that the negotiations were conducted with large involvement of big corporate lobbyists but kept completely secret from people, organizations that work for the benefit of people, and even their representatives. You have not made a single reason why it is going to benefit ordinary Americans. All you have said is that you watched C-SPAN and a person who has been responsible for it say it is a good deal. What a relief. I rest my case there.</p>\n<p>On the issue of suing, it is not a domestic issue. ISDS is one of the major points of opposition to TPP. It allows corporations to sue countries if their actions would deprive them of their potential profits. Phillip Morris was able to sue and force governments to change their policy regarding smoking because those countries had signed trade agreements with ISDS provisions. Another area that TPP is criticized heavily is that it forces governments to privatize sectors and limits their ability to fund organizations like public broadcasters.

The middle class is hollowed out at the benefit of the capitalist 1% class. Upper middle class (professionals with university education, considered to make the next around 15% of the population) are OK, but the economic situation and political influence for lower middle class (making up the next around 30% of the population) and working class (making up the next 30% of the populations) have deteriorated. These two make 60% of the US population. You keep talking about working poor (13% ) and underclass (12%) which make the bottom 25%. Under democrats the situation of working poor have improved and it is nice, but when you are at the bottom it doesn&#8217;t need much to improve your situation, specially when they make a small group. This has come at the expense of 60% of the population which make the middle. And every time I have made this point so far you have gone back to say, well, they did some good things for the working poor. Nice for them. I am not one of them and I want politicians who represent MY interests as well. The American GDP has more than tripled since 1980, so has the wage of the capitalist 1% class. The wages of upper middle class have gone a little bit up. But for the rest of the people either their wages have stagnated or have gone down in real terms. This has happened both under Republicans and under Democrats like Bill Clinton. And we are supposed to believe this is as good as it can get?

Are you kidding?&#8217;  For most people, that is absurd and ridiculous.  </p>\n<p>And most historians just don&#8217;t know what to do about this. &#8216;What are you talking about?&#8217;  If you read [any] French revoutionary journals from 1789, on almost every page it will say &#8216;The world is being totally transformed and the main agent of change is philosophy.&#8217;</p>\n<p>And [nowadays] we don&#8217;t know what that means, we don&#8217;t understand that, and we&#8217;ve redefined philosophy: &#8216;We want to be neutral on important social questions.  We want to stay in our corner!  We&#8217;re <i>philosophers</i>&#8216; </p>\n<p>And so nowadays we think that&#8217;s what philosophy <i>is</i>.  Of course, this isn&#8217;t the Socratic idea of philosophy; it&#8217;s the <i>modern</i> idea of philosophy, that way philosophy was <i>made</i> to be neutral, by governments and states and universities.</p>\n<p>So we absolutely can&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re talking about, when they [the 18th century <i>philosophes</i>] say &#8216;A new world, modern democracy, basic human rights, comes from philosophy.&#8217;  </p>\n<p>I think this is a complete mystery to a culture like ours.

But ask yourself: what is its impact? How many people does it effect and how much does it improve access to healthcare for them? Who are the people who benefit from it? Ask yourself why America cannot have a decent universal healthcare coverage like every other developed nation? Why Americans spends way more than other countries and gets less than them in return on healthcare? Why is it that despite 80% of Americans supporting stricter background checks on gun purchases and so much publicity on the issue majority of members of congress can be against it? The political influence of average citizens is at historic lows that a single lobbying organization like NRA has more influence on the members of congress than 80% of Americans. This is not about this policy or that policy, this is about the feature of our democratic system. Do these policies address the underlying issues like increasing inequality, erosion of influence of ordinary citizens on policies, concentrations of power and wealth in the capitalist 1% class, &#8230;?

Your excerpt is saying in effect that rights were acquired by power struggles, which were put in a changing philosophical context.  It might be more pertinent to read Graeber&#8217;s &#8216;Debt, the first 5000 years&#8217;, despite its at times painful telling of human nature involving slavery and the like. (He&#8217;s an anthropologist.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid that a large part of the current problem is that Obama turned his back on Main Street, and fell into the arms of the TBTF banks right after taking power.  Almost no heads fell  (speaking figuratively!) among those who brought us the financial crisis, when some kind of reboot was needed.  Alot of this goes back to inflated expectations created during the galloping Dow Jones of the Clinton 90&#8217;s &#8211; (as extended by Bush/Greenspan) and the recovery is ultimately being held back by the difficulty of bringing  expectations, or habits, back into line with some kind of economic reality.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t see any honesty from either candidate along these lines, its not what gets short-term electoral advantage of course.  I suspect that Clinton&#8217;s failure to convince people that she wants to, or is able to, stand up to big money type interests is her weak point with the Sanders camp and with a big part of the middle class.  But the new economic reality cannot hold much promise for these groups if the &#8216;big money&#8217; isn&#8217;t held in check.</p>\n]]>", "author": "sf", "published": "2016-06-28 18:32:01+00:00", "title": "By: sf"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>sf #149: a few months starting from zero, yeah. Like I said, I don&#8217;t know anything about the issues driving TPP, or indeed what issues are driving TPP, and I&#8217;ve paid no attention to these things for years, so I&#8217;d be coming in cold. Presumably if you&#8217;re interested in trade deals and immigration you&#8217;d have been paying attention for a while and keeping up, and it wouldn&#8217;t take so long.</p>\n<p>But what you say about the regulation is true. It really freaks people out when you say this, but lots of the federal govt is  undersized for the job. 585 people can&#8217;t hope to legislate for 300 million; they don&#8217;t have time to read the bills, much less understand them, and they don&#8217;t have adequate staffs for the job, either. That&#8217;s why even somebody like me can walk in and write legislation and have it pass. Same on the regulatory side, except there the problem&#8217;s compounded by money and the government&#8217;s total inability to compete with the kind of money you can make in industry. </p>\n<p>I think that to a considerable extent we&#8217;re stuck with the problem, but also that the problem&#8217;s ameliorated by having a knowledgeable electorate. And when I say &#8220;knowledgeable&#8221;, I mean that they do have a working notion not just of the issue they&#8217;re interested in, but of how things in government actually work and why. That thing I was talking about upthread, or on the other thread, about leaving your house and finding out what else is up in the world &#8212; this is part of that. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you an example: back when I worked for a terrible congressman, we&#8217;d get little bands of demonstrators in the plaza below the office. (District office.) Not infrequently they demanded things not taken care of on the federal level. Every now and then a demonstrator or three would come upstairs and demand to see the congressman. We didn&#8217;t keep him in a closet, of course, so usually he wasn&#8217;t there, or even in the state, and the demonstrators (who sometimes insisted on sitting in the office waiting for him to come back) would go away triumphantly persuaded that he was trying to dodge them. This is not a helpful way of demonstrating and pressing an interest. Better: in the 1980s, when the Reagan admin was uninterested in funding AIDS research and pressing FDA to get trials running, a group of activists *knowledgeable about both media technique and regulatory processes* put on a big damn show and turned the plaza outside FDA into a circus. Which meant that when Anthony Fauci, who usually could be found there, finally came down to talk to them, they were not only in the right place talking to the right guy, but they spoke enough FDA language to begin to have a useful conversation. Was it rough on both sides, yes, but the AIDS activists were aggressively willing to learn and the FDA people were willing to work with people who were willing to work with them, even through recriminations. The result was, in unusually short order, effective drugs, also a large funded research community, despite continuing Republican administrations.</p>\n<p>As for TPP &#8212; wouldn&#8217;t it be safer to scrap it, you ask. Well, given that I don&#8217;t know what it is, and you probably don&#8217;t either, I don&#8217;t think either one of us can say. We have the narrow opinions of several organizations each interested in narrow aspects of TPP, but we cannot see whether TPP is, on balance, a good thing or not, because we haven&#8217;t spent the time. It could as easily be that saying &#8220;no&#8221; is more dangerous than saying &#8220;yes&#8221;. </p>\n<p>Doing the homework>trusting the knowledgeable rep>slicing blindly at things.</p>\n<p>(Europe&#8217;s had the same problem. The Common Agricultural Policy&#8217;s been a bugbear since the day it was born, and you&#8217;ll find plenty of people who look at CAP and that&#8217;s their only measure of the goodness or badness of the EU. Plenty were happy to scrap the EU on the basis of the CAP. Which is nuts &#8212; all you have to do to know that is listen to the anguish of the young people in Britain who look like they&#8217;ll be cut off from having lives as Europeans.) </p>\n<p>In the end, there aren&#8217;t all that many choices. You can have direct democracy and hope that everyone is responsible and educates themselves well enough to vote responsibly and has time to do all that work. You can have a representative democracy and fight knowledgeably and responsibly to preserve it from becoming corrupt to the point where it cannot do anything but enslave the nominal citizens. You can run around blowing things up, which is very exciting if you enjoy that kind of thing; it gives you a brief and bloody reprieve from whatever had existed, and it costs vulnerable people big even if they hadn&#8217;t wanted a revolution, but guarantees nothing. I think it&#8217;s obvious where my sympathies lie, and in the inevitable debate about whether a rep ought to act mechanically to represent the shifting will of his constituency, like a pass-through, or ought to act as a knowledgeable elite, I&#8217;ll lean readily toward knowledgeable elite &#8212; but an elite whose ears are open to his constituents, who themselves have some responsibility to self-education.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2016-06-28 21:49:19+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Nerd:</p>\n<p>1.
