The reason is the wave will not cause the atoms in my body to move through space and so will perform no work on it, that is to say will cause no damage to it. Instead the wave will cause the very space inside my body to expand, so the wave might cause me to look taller to you but I would feel just the same as I always did, although you would look squashed to me. The detected waves were many miles in length so I think they be of no danger no matter how strong they were. </p>\n<p>For the same reason I don&#8217;t think you could extract work out of the accelerating expansion of the universe even if you could build machines of cosmological size, although at one time I thought you could.  Suppose you had a spool of string on an axle and you extended the string to cosmological distances and tied a weight on the end of the string. I thought there would be torque on the spool, so the axle would rotate. The axle could then be connected to an electric generator and it seemed to me you&#8217;d get useful work out of it. Of course you&#8217;d have to constantly add more mass-energy in the form of more string to keep it operating, but the amount of mass per unit length of string would remain constant, but because the universe is accelerating the amount of energy per unit length of string you&#8217;d get out of it would not remain constant but would increase asymptotically to infinity. </p>\n<p>Then I realized my brainstorm wouldn&#8217;t work, there would be no torque on the spool because the weight on the end of the string was not moving through space with respect to the spool, instead space itself was moving. It&#8217;s as if I grabbed the string with my left hand 4 feet from the spool and I grabbed the string with my right hand 1 foot from the spool and pulled my hands in opposite directions I would create tension in the string between my hands but I&#8217;m doing no work and producing no torque on the spool, and the same would be true of the Dark Energy that&#8217;s accelerating the universe. If I pulled hard enough the string would break and if Dark Energy got strong enough every atom in the string would pull apart from every other atom in it, that&#8217;s what happens when space expands, but there would still be no torque on the spool and no useful work could be extracted from the spacial expansion.</p>\n]]>", "author": "John K Clark", "published": "2016-02-17 18:12:03+00:00", "title": "By: John K Clark"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<blockquote><p><b>Daniel</b> supposes&nbsp; &#8220;Contrary to photons, I suppose, gravitons do interact with each other.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Quantum electrodynamics (QED) theoretically predicts that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics\" rel=\"nofollow\">photons <i>do</i> interact with one another</a>.
