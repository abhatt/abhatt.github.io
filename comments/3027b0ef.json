I have two points to make regarding that. For one thing it rather implies that America is not great at the moment, or at least it wasn&#8217;t until Trump was elected. Some people seem to portray any left-wing criticism of America as unpatriotic but think it is totally fine for right-wingers to come with harsh criticism. (If you really hate abortion so much, should you not view Ireland, where abortion is almost totally illegal, as a greater country than the US?) </p>\n<p>The second point I wish to make is that &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; suggests America used to be great. No, I don&#8217;t know if Trump has said at exactly which date America was great but do you, TrumpSupporter, accept that a black person or gay person might wonder if the time Trump is nostalgically looking back to might not be perceived as less great by them?  Do you accept that America has never really been great for African-Americans and that for all we know Trump is pining for the 1950 or 60ies, which were great in some ways, but when black people were also actively oppressed?</p>\n]]>", "author": "Jr", "published": "2017-05-28 17:44:50+00:00", "title": "By: Jr"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Jr #51</p>\n<p>It would help to name the country you are talking about. It seems to me the only country in Europe that bans abortion entirely is Malta which at the same is regularly accused of being a tax haven.</p>\n<p>I know my share of Europeans, some of my closest friends are. Their very human tendency is to try to understand the politics of the United States under the prism of European politics. It is never a good idea to try to understand one complex society using the parameters that work to understand another.</p>\n<p>So you understand the difference. The United States was founded by people who were running away from political and religious prosecution in Europe. The US constitution was designed to be the &#8220;anti-Europe&#8221; of the XVIII&#8217;th century: Europe was totalitarian then, and each kingdom/principality had its own official religion imposed on its subjects. Thus, the US was founded of the idea that &#8220;all men are created equal&#8221; and the Constitution protected a set of individual freedoms early on -chief among them are freedom of religion and freedom of speech. Most Europeans I have talked to about these issues are amazed that the United States is such a hot bed for religious cults and by the vitriol they perceive in the political discourse. Both are as old as the American republic.  Throughout the years, there have been several waves of immigration to the United States. In each case, the people who came via these waves, and particularly their descendants, have made theirs the American ideal. so in continues to live on.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the people who live in Europe today have the DNA of the people that thought that putting up with a totalitarian ruler was a better proposition than risking leaving it behind to find who knows what in America. Thus, the political cultures of the United States and the different European countries could not be more different. In general Americans do not have the faith in rulers (ie, government) that the average European has. The average American doesn&#8217;t look up to government to solve his problems, rather, expects government to get out of the way and focus on the things it was setup up for: the military, administration of justice and protection of basic individual rights such as private property. </p>\n<p>This is not to say that the United States was born perfect. Clearly it wasn&#8217;t because of the issue of slavery first, and legalized racism later. The United States is a dynamic nation that has been adapting throughout the centuries with basically the same legal framework whereas take a country like France. Their revolution took place around the same time as the American Revolution. They had a series of kings and different political systems in the next 200 years. Now they have the V-th Republic and who knows what will happen in 2022 given that I have little hope that Macron will be able to change the old ways.</p>\n<p>All this to say that when Trump says he wants to &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; it is not understood in the terms you mention. I do not know any Trump supporter who would like to restore racist laws or to criminalize homosexuality. The issue of gay marriage is a totally different topic. I believe the European Court of Human Rights struck the right balance where the US Supreme Court didn&#8217;t: it recognized that criminalizing homosexuality was incompatible with individual freedom but it also said that gay marriage was a new thing and that it was up to each member state to figure out how to handle it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schalk_and_Kopf_v_Austria\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schalk_and_Kopf_v_Austria</a> .</p>\n<p>To me &#8220;Making America Great Again&#8221; meant:</p>\n<p>&#8211; Stop being the laughing stock in the world, as we were with Bush -because he didn&#8217;t have the guts to question the judgement of the deep state when he was asked to invade Iraq- and Obama -whom Europeans love because they see in him what Americans saw in Gorbachev: the best fifth columnist America has ever produced. You take a look at the video of Trump lecturing the ineffectual NATO leaders and you get an idea what being &#8220;great again&#8221; means.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Stop piling up debt. Seriously. Both Bush and Obama doubled the national debt in their respective presidencies. That is unsustainable.</p>\n<p>&#8211; Stop using the coercive force of government to impose secular ideology -such as abortion on demand or gay marriage- on individual states whose voters said explicitly in the their own elections that they don&#8217;t want. I am not going to defend slavery, but the way slavery was ended was via a constitutional amendment. Same thing with legalized racism: it was ended with a constitutional amendment -the XIV-th amendment- but the statist Democrats back then nullified it for almost 100 years with Plessy v Ferguson until Republicans helped overturn it with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In the case of gay marriage, the US congress passed in 1996 with veto proof majorities the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. By a 5-4 majority, liberal ideologues overturned the decision made by the representatives of the people. </p>\n<p>&#8211; Stop over-regulating the economy to the point that it grows at 2% due to lack of new business creation. Most Americans rather have plenty of opportunity than government paychecks (that&#8217;s something that divides the American and the European mindsets).

I am trying to understand your position better. So for example, do you believe that people in advanced stages of Alzheimer do not have human rights either and that therefore can be disposed of? If you believe that having had first a functioning nervous system that degenerates later into a non functional nervous system is different, then I ask you to explain. </p>\n<p>My position is the following: once sperm and egg meet, a new human life is created via a continuous process that only ends with the death of said new human life. Terminating that life at any stage of the process is morally wrong. I am on record saying that I agree with exceptions such as when the life of the mother is in danger or the usage of the day after pill in the case of rape. However, how we think about this is of utmost important: a new human life with rights vs a &#8220;thing&#8221; that can be disposed when it is an inconvenience. </p>\n<p>Note that the delineation of having a &#8220;functional nervous system&#8221; is totally arbitrary -as an aside, here I believe we have an example of somebody that doesn&#8217;t understand the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function</a> with the y coordinate being the status of development of a human life and the x coordinate being time.

Both &#8220;having a functional nervous system&#8221; and &#8220;autonomy&#8221; seem totally arbitrary criteria to me.

What unites us is a deep desire for the recognition that unborn children have constitutional rights and that we see as a great injustice to terminate a new human life who have committed no crimes for reasons of convenience to somebody else (be it the mother, the father who pressures the mother to have an abortion, social pressure, etc).</p>\n<p>My personal opinion on the other two issues is that I am in favor of the death penalty for extreme cases. For example, had Bin Laden been arrested in the US, I would see the death penalty as an appropriate punishment for having ordered 9/11. Which crimes are so outrageous as to deserve the death penalty as a punishment is a matter of ongoing debate, but on the principle I am in favor of the death penalty for serious crimes. Note that I don&#8217;t see any connection whatsoever with being prolife on the abortion debate. For a criminal to be convicted of the death penalty, said criminal has had to commit a horrendous crime. An aborted unborn children has committed no crime whatsoever other than being an inconvenience to somebody. It is hard for me to understand how &#8220;being an inconvenience&#8221; to a third party justifies terminating one&#8217;s life. Yet, Peter Singer thinks that way and Jr above too. I do not buy the &#8220;inconvenience&#8221; rationale but I am perfectly comfortable with &#8220;having been convicted of a heinous crime&#8221; as a reason to terminate another human being&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>On the issue of universal healthcare. I think this is more related to the issue of being prolife/prochoice. A common criticism I hear from the proabortion crowd, one that I consider it a legitimate one, is that many prolifers are really pro-birth. Meaning, that both during the pregnancy and after the pregnancy they don&#8217;t want to spend a dime on expecting mothers and their kids. Don&#8217;t count me among them. Although I do not believe that socialized medicine systems like those they have in Europe in Canada are good -mostly because they free-load the research necessary to develop new treatments on the US-, I do believe in using government funds in one way or another to help those that through not fault of their own are going through a rough time. My thinking is one of &#8220;safety net&#8221; vs &#8220;entitlement&#8221;. This is another reason I liked Donald Trump vs the other Republicans: he said several times in the debates that he wouldn&#8217;t let people die in the streets for lack of health insurance as a code word for this thinking.</p>\n<p>There is no unanimity about these issues among prolifers. For example, Roman Catholics are very active in prolife circles and organize a lot of the big prolife events. Devote Roman Catholics follow the Vatican doctrine against the death penalty and the Roman Catholic Church&#8217;s social teaching that kind of favors government funded universal healthcare as an entitlement. I am not a Roman Catholic, so I don&#8217;t feel bound by these positions. I have reached my own through my own thinking.</p>\n]]>", "author": "TrumpSupporter", "published": "2017-05-29 18:47:10+00:00", "title": "By: TrumpSupporter"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Just to illustrate my point for you, Scott: You complain right here in that comment section that people judge you just for what you blog here without knowing you personally; assuming things about you that &#8211; as you say &#8211; are just plainly wrong. That&#8217;s an excellent point. But you judge millions of people just by their decision in the last election. And Raoul Ohio did nothing else with his comment on cubic equations. So how is that justified? And yes, of course, people form an opinion about you by reading your blog. I guess that&#8217;s not surprising news. And students might make decisions based on that &#8211; for example not to attend your courses because they are afraid to be labeled as unfit or dumb. You talked about the importance of getting the best students (also from foreign countries) not that long ago. So why not promote open discussions on controversial topics like that instead of prejudging people with different opinions?

Some of them, like Peter Thiel, surely have high IQs.

That doesn&#8217;t mean they should be punished in the workplace, as I also said clearly in my post about Thiel (and took flak from the far left for saying&#8212;the usual, that I&#8217;m an entitled white male douchebro, etc etc.  I can&#8217;t win, can I?)</p>\n<p>Look, the student/adviser relationship can be personal and idiosyncratic.

During my own career as graduate student, there were professors with stellar research output who were known to be a-holes as research advisers but people were willing to put up with them for the prestige of having been a student of professor X. My own advisor is a great person and it was the honor of my life to work with him during my PhD. One of the reasons I do not regret having done the PhD and for which I would do it again is that it was the privilege of a lifetime to work with him. To this day I do not know what his politics are. It wasn&#8217;t possible for me or other students who had worked for or with him to discern them from his teaching or his way of talking to students. From some comments you might think he is a liberal from others that he is a conservative, but no official clue where he lies. If I had to make a bet, using maximum a posteriori estimation, given the prior distribution of party registration among academics, my money is that he is a liberal, but I do not know for a fact. </p>\n<p>At the same time, I know what is like to be among the few non liberals in an environment where everybody who is loud about his politics is a liberal, anti-Trump and thinks that voting for Trump is for dumb people -that would be my current work environment. After my former anti-Trump boss left, my new boss is totally shut about his politics. Again, using maximum a posteriori estimation and given the prior distribution that can be obtained from the political donations database in my field of work, I would assume he is a liberal, but I have no clue.</p>\n<p>I personally don&#8217;t care about people&#8217;s politics. My significant other is an anti-Trump liberal you see, so I know what a respectful relationship between two people who disagree on politics look like. My own experience in academic and professional environments is that whenever you have an outspoken majority on politics, the minority is shut out of the most important things. That doesn&#8217;t mean you are one of those who does these things, all I am saying is that based on my experience and your public pronouncements, I would try to avoid being your PhD student (or Terry Tao&#8217;s) if I were in the position of having to choose an advisor at UT Austin of UCLA. </p>\n<p>And with this said, I am saying good bye for good. It has been great to talk to you and to have this discussion. I thank you for publishing my comments and engaging me.</p>\n]]>", "author": "TrumpSupporter", "published": "2017-05-29 19:59:24+00:00", "title": "By: TrumpSupporter"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Please, Scott, I made it totally clear that I really appreciate and respect you for &#8216;discussing and defending your views openly on your blog&#8217;. And I&#8217;m happy for you that you think this never affected your work experience with anyone in a negative way. But you also cannot guarantee that there are indeed no students who feel threatened by what you say. And this is very much different from disliking your appearance or some charming habits. Maybe you did not literally called Trump voters dumb but you can hardly claim that you don&#8217;t prejudge them. And you let Julia write on your blog that<br />\n&#8220;People are fucking morons whose brains are not built to see through bullshit.\u201d in that very context. So yes, me as a student would be anxious to let you know about my political views because I would think that you would not consider me intelligent or fit enough only based on those. But not because of your own views (with which I actually mostly agree) but for all your insults of people not in line with you.  I think you are intelligent enough (by far) to explain and debate your views and arguments on a more civilized level. And I certainly share your passion for CS theory problems, and I advise PhD students of my own. I just don&#8217;t share your passion for blind judgment. And  regarding your &#8216; I can\u2019t win, can I?&#8217;: A dialogue normally is not about winning. It&#8217;s about understanding the other party better and maybe finding consensus in unexpected corners or inspiration to rethink the own position. But that requires some respect and a certain level of openness from both sides. It&#8217;s not about belittling the others or twist their words until they give up. It&#8217;s about learning from each other.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-05-29 19:59:25+00:00", "title": "By: Anonymous"}]
