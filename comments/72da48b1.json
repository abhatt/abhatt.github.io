One was the misogyny, which doesn&#8217;t play in English departments anymore. Another is the fact that they don&#8217;t play particularly well outside the northeastern US &#8212; they have a cultural specificity that doesn&#8217;t resonate well elsewhere. Salinger has the same problem. A third is that the publishing world blew open in the 80s and suddenly there were warehouses full of stories that were not about the travails of married middle-class white men waiting for the 5:35 to Bernardsville, or wherever, which nicely suited the new multiculturalism that had run all over English lit (and still left us plug-ignorant of non-USian literatures). And a fourth is that lit classes are not writing classes, and are not about the quality of the writing but about textual analysis: they really are there to study literature, not read it. Aesthetics went out most of a century ago and have only recently started tiptoeing back in, but in unrecognizable form. </p>\n<p>I recently taught a section from _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_, Agee&#8217;s discovery of the South, and I let the kids know what was coming in advance, because they&#8217;re not generally hit with this kind of thing anymore. It&#8217;s beautiful writing. It&#8217;s also bald about racism, from the perspective of a white man at a time when an open and virulent racism was so deeply normed that its language was used even by those who despaired at it. Most of the kids I was reading to &#8211; some white, some not &#8211; have no context, anymore, for such language. </p>\n<p>Most of the early 20th-c writers have similar problems, except perhaps Faulkner, the most sex-and-race-obsessed I can think of offhand. His stories are about almost nothing but race and destruction of women, the language is brutal, and yet he&#8217;s so ferociously human throughout, aware throughout of the humanity of every person in every story, that the horror and irony make him Vonnegut&#8217;s much more talented cousin. </p>\n<p>Anyway. No, Updike and the others get no pass. Houellebecq &#8212; oh, I imagine he gets assigned sometimes for drawing and quartering; I startled a writing prof by saying I admired the beginning of one his books. He&#8217;s kind of a jagoff, though &#8212; Houellebecq, not the&#8230;well, the prof, too. I wrote something once about admiring the quality of the literary nihilistic porn, but how H. kept insisting on having ideas, which he wasn&#8217;t very good at, and how I was damned if I wanted a half-assed white paper in the middle of my literary nihilistic porn. It&#8217;s childish stuff in the end though.</p>\n<p>As for defensiveness, enemies lists, etc: I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly healthy, Scott, I really don&#8217;t. The world will always have people who enjoy playing circular firing squad; always have stupid ideas that attract crowds. This country will always have bright, persecuted, undereducated kids escaping their rural/impoverished/suburban-anomie hellholes, pick one, and grabbing the first idea train out of town. The fraction willing and able to entertain complex ideas will always be small. And when it comes to new, alarming worlds that look entirely foreign: I regret to inform that this comes for all of us, and is called &#8220;getting old&#8221;.

The zeitgeist between the assassination of MLK and RFK through to the Iraqi insurgency outbreak was a mini dark age imo. Now that, as you point out, we&#8217;re on the verge of imminent planetary destruction &#8211; it seems even the &#8216;privileged&#8217; humans care on a significant scale&#8230; It&#8217;s like some kind of collective Gaian immune response.</p>\n<p>While I do agree it is somewhat disturbing to see people 10 or less years younger than I revert into a Lord of the Flies type self-enforced psychological fascism &#8211; it is promising. Promising in the sense that this is the first major step towards a new enlightenment. </p>\n<p>For a revolution to occur first the youth must care *at all*, and eventually life (exposure to new data, work, travel, family crises, psychedelic experiences, heartbreak/mending, child rearing, so forth) will dissolve the boundaries of their brittle world views. &#8212; I personally remember having incredibly strong, self-righteous opinions in my undergrad years (chiefly scientism and post-911 &#8216;West > East&#8217;), but life humbles all who claim to have an open mind.</p>\n<p>This is the first generation ever to be in a position to establish a healthy planetary civilization, and it begins with sometimes-legit-sometimes-hypocritical accusations of tone policing, mansplaining and privilege..
