On page 2 right after claim IV.1 how does the example of g(n):=n^2 get an example that must be tame? I see why the inequalities in (8) are close enough for that, but this doesn&#8217;t show it for other more complicated interactions. In particular, I don&#8217;t see how this rules out some more complicated product and sum involving elements from the A set constructed having unexpected cancellations which lead to non-tame number. I&#8217;m pretty sure that that doesn&#8217;t occur, but it doesn&#8217;t seem obvious to me.
