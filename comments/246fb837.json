The QM notion of time has never squared with the block universe picture of relativity, and of course, neither are consistent with the subjective notion of time as a flowing river of awareness.</p>\n<p>In a flurry of insights, some ideas of mine have connected in a way which could unify the different notions of time.</p>\n<p>I proposed that time is 2-dimensional.  This has been proposed in physics before, but until now, no one was able to supply a coherent interpretation of the extra time dimension.  </p>\n<p>My idea is to move the 2-d time idea to the &#8216;It from Bit&#8217; framework (reality as computation), and redefine the different notions of time entirely in terms of information theory.</p>\n<p>To recast time in terms of information theory, the natural idea is to equate time with entropy increase (thermodynamics).  We know that thermodynamics can be described in terms of information theory, by recasting entropy increase as the spread (or dissipation) of information (increasing correlations) &#8211; see the ideas of Seth Lloyd.</p>\n<p>Now introduce the 2nd time dimension.</p>\n<p>Draw a 2-d graph of time and let the x-axis represent ordinary &#8216;informational entropy&#8217;.   Now I&#8217;m suggesting that we need to define a *new* kind of entropy to represent the 2nd time-dimension (y-axis).  I leave open the question of what this new type of entropy could be.  </p>\n<p>With 2 different definitions of entropy (i.e 2 time dimensions), the concept of &#8216;time flow&#8217; actually makes sense: I&#8217;m defining it as the rate of change in the *ratio* of the 2 types of entropy.</p>\n<p>Note that if there is only a single time-dimension, the concept of &#8216;time flow&#8217; doesn&#8217;t make any sense, but with 2 time dimensions, suddenly it does, since we have a basis for relating two different timescales!</p>\n<p>And since the notion of &#8216;time flow&#8217; is so close to our notion of subjective awareness, the natural next conjecture is to suggest that they&#8217;re related.  Now suddenly we have a way to define consciousness!</p>\n<p>The puzzle of &#8216;It from Bit&#8217; was how to go from pure information to our apparent material world (matter) and then to consciousness (cognition).</p>\n<p>Time-flow seems the natural scale to explain this.</p>\n<p>Define &#8216;ground-state information&#8217; as a state of slow time-flow, matter as a state of medium time-flow, and consciousness as a state of high time-flow.</p>\n<p>Then consciousness would be defined as any region where information has a high time-flow.   </p>\n<p>Interestingly, around the time I was thinking of all this, a great new book on neuroscience has come out; &#8216;Your Brain Is A Time Machine&#8217; , by Dean Buonomano, where Dean investigates the  philosophy, physics and neuroscience of time.</p>\n<p> I feel a huge breakthrough is imminent!</p>\n]]>", "author": "mjgeddes", "published": "2017-04-26 04:16:23+00:00", "title": "By: mjgeddes"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott 49:</p>\n<p>I mostly agree with your comment. I think it&#8217;s important to avoid cynicism and an excessively critical spirit on these matters, and engage the public on science and other values we hold dear. I will even support and applaud your participation in the march on these grounds, though I would choose otherwise were I free to do so (I was occupied by a prior commitment at the time of the march, so did not face a genuine choice whether to participate myself).</p>\n<p>However, I think that this engagement must be done very carefully. While it&#8217;s great that many people are interested in science, and we can and should engage them even if their interest is driven (as you so aptly put it) by &#8220;identity politics or mindless fanboyism&#8221;, we must also recognize the danger posed by these, especially the first. </p>\n<p>The greatest risk is that the greater interest shown by some will be matched by decreased interest by others (i.e. those on the right), and that the support itself will be shallow and misdirected, since it is founded on political affiliation rather than genuine interest in science. </p>\n<p>Moreover, to the extent the interest is politically motivated, it will tend to redefine &#8220;science&#8221; and elevate politically correct scientists and conclusions, while denigrating politically incorrect views. This has, of course, been ongoing for a long time, but mostly with the opposition rather than the support of the scientific community. Politics is powerful stuff in human affairs, and politicization of science is a very dangerous business.</p>\n<p>I admit that my grumping about science fanboyism is mostly irrelevant to my main concerns (except insofar as the fanboyism arises from political affiliation).
