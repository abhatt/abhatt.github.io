[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Joshua #52: You ask some excellent questions.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how to prove that any unlikely complexity-theoretic consequence would follow, if BosonSampling were universal for BQP.  I agree that such a result would be great.</p>\n<p>My strongest evidence that BosonSampling is <i>not</i> universal for BQP, just comes from considering the sizes of the respective Lie groups: the group of unitary transformations acting on n qubits is ~2<sup>2n</sup>-dimensional, whereas the group of unitary transformations acting on n optical modes is merely ~n<sup>2</sup>-dimensional (it then gets lifted, via homomorphism, to a tiny subgroup of the group of unitary transformations on an exponentially-larger Hilbert space).  By the usual standards of complexity theory, this sort of argument doesn&#8217;t count for much.  But it does show that there can&#8217;t be any &#8220;faithful mapping&#8221; from the gates in a qubit-based quantum circuit to the linear-optical gates, and it seems pretty convincing intuitively.</p>\n<p>Ironically, I <i>do</i> know an unlikely-seeming complexity consequence that would follow if the converse held, and BosonSampling were reducible to BQP!  How is that possible, you ask, since clearly a BosonSampling machine can be efficiently simulated by a universal quantum computer?  Well, it simply has to do with the fact that BosonSampling is a sampling problem, whereas BQP is defined as a class of decision problems.  In my and Alex&#8217;s paper, we note the following strange corollary of our results: if exact BosonSampling could be performed by a probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm with an oracle for BQP decision problems, then P<sup>#P</sup> would be contained in BPP<sup>NP^PromiseBQP</sup>.  We added a remark like, &#8220;this seems unlikely, though we admit to lacking a strong intuition here.&#8221;</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2013-11-13 13:46:56+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>jim #53: Thanks for the link.
