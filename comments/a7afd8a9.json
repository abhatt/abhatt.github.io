I read Papadimitrious&#39;s Logicomix, and then watched other presentations by him, just because it is him, and he is great. But his presentation exactly spelled out my own doubts about the claim that we do understand evolution in practice:<br /><br />How do you find a 3-billion long string in 3 billion years?<br />L.

In addition, I am fully aware of the change in perspective provided by the multiplicative weights update algorithm. It doesn&#39;t care whether badly performing species get extinct or not. (Or whether individuals of badly performing species are more likely to die prematurely.) Instead, it focuses on proliferating well performing species in a balanced way. (It doesn&#39;t even try to specify a mechanism by which well performing species arise, it just focuses on balanced distribution of resources among the existing well performing species.)", "author": "Jakito", "published": "2018-11-08 01:57:52.478000-08:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "@Jakito - thanks! You are speaking to the point - which does indeed deserve to be better-known - that CS is interdisciplinary and has much to say about many other topics. (Also that it brings in insights that have been developed in the TCS community in particular.) I recall that I have occasionally been asked, when I tell someone I&#39;m in CS &quot;Hardware or software?&quot; which shows a misconception of what CS is about. (Fortunately that has not happened recently, so I think there is some improvement in public understanding of CS.)", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Goldberg:Paul.html\">Paul Goldberg</a>", "published": "2018-11-08 03:50:20.084000-08:00", "title": ""}]
