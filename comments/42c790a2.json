Speaking personally, it seems to me that the burgeoning growth of citizen-science offers one such path.   </p>\n<p>Here in Seattle, 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year for the local urban raptor population: Bald Eagles, Ospreys, Merlins, Perigrine Falcons, Kestrels, Coopers Hawks, Sharp-Shinned Hawks, Red-Tailed Hawks, etc.  Already in 2018 my wife and I have seen all of these species.</p>\n<p>Seattle wasn&#8217;t always so rich in raptors.</p>\n<blockquote><p><b><a href=\"http://mailman1.u.washington.edu/pipermail/tweeters/2018-April/242962.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">URBAN MERLINS</a></b><br />\nby <a href=\"https://www.falconresearch.org/about-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bud Anderson</a></p>\n<p>Lynn Oliphant was the first person to document Merlins moving into a North American city back in 1971 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The next year they found 2 pairs and by 1982, there were 16. Lynn estimates that there are now around 30-40 pairs in that city.  A similar Merlin expansion also took place about that time in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>\n<p>Here in Washington, nesting Merlins had always been very rare despite many experienced raptor people looking for them for decades. There is very little historic information about them for our state. That all started to change in the 1980&#8217;s thanks to people like Tom Gleason, Jim Fackler and others who started finding nesting pairs on the Olympic Peninsula and up the Skagit and Stillaguamish Rivers among other locations.</p>\n<p>The first known city pair that I am aware of was found in a neighborhood in Bellingham in 2000. The number increased to at least four pairs in Bellingham over the next few years. Then Merlins started a slow southward &#8220;colonization&#8221;, showing up over the next few years in Burlington, Mt. Vernon, Anacortes, Stanwood, Everett, Edmonds and finally Seattle. Fortunately, we have had Ben Vang-Johnson and Kim Mc Cormick documenting and studying this expansion in Seattle since 2013.</p>\n<p>This phenomenon of raptors moving into cities is, of course, not just limited to Merlins. We first saw it in Red-tailed Hawks after the I-5 freeway opening back in the mid-60&#8217;s, Bald Eagles showed up in Kirkland and Seward Park shortly afterwards, peregrines arrived in 1994, and who knows when the first Cooper&#8217;s Hawks started to breed in Seattle. Butch Olendorff had a pair on the hillside west of the Duwamish Slough in the late 1960&#8217;s. Ospreys are likely to have been nesting on Lake Washington even further back in time.</p>\n<p>This colonization involving raptors moving into urban habitats is happening all across our continent. It is also underway in Europe with goshawks and sparrowhawks also moving into cities. So Merlins are likely to keep increasing in numbers locally, and Seattle should be no exception. </p>\n<p>How wonderful is that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>For Seattle biophilians, the ongoing resurgence of raptor populations definitely IS pretty darn wonderful&nbsp;&hellip; and the strict regulation of persistent toxins has been vital to that success.  </p>\n<p>For the joy that attends returning raptors, the world&#8217;s citizen-scientists are grateful to you, Rachel Carlson!&nbsp;\ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>In contrast, it&#8217;s far from clear (to conservationists anyway) what sort of world Susan Wright/<i>RedState</i> is advocated&nbsp;&hellip; seemingly it is a world of few joys and fewer raptors. </p>\n<p>Now if we could only figure out why the Seattle&#8217;s pollinator population is crashing&nbsp;&hellip; with attendant disastrous fruiting-failure of our urban trees.

If you emotionally react to something before you think about it, that means that you&#8217;re wrong.<br />\nIt boils down to a simple phenomenon of how the brain works.</p>\n<p>The brain has within itself a model of reality which is used to make predictions of reality.  This model of reality is a simplification, so that the brain doesn&#8217;t have to do NP-harder math for every little thing.  The brain simplifies everything down into component parts and makes comparisons and groups with other components.  The brain uses this to approximate NP-harder calculations in a greatly simplified manner.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a problem with this, though.  You see, the brain uses this so much that if there&#8217;s a problem with the model, then that means that the brain has made more than just a small mistake.  If there&#8217;s a problem, that means the brain&#8217;s model is flawed in a deep way.  As a result, the brain has a defense mechanism in place in order to deal with small problems.  The defense mechanism is to: get angry at anyone who thinks otherwise, blame other people, and desire revenge against them.</p>\n<p>SotS plays into that behavior by enticing the brain to change it&#8217;s model to accommodate the shark attacks.  People like you buy into it because you think that the model in your brain is a good approximation of reality.  And it is, a lot of the time.  Except it&#8217;s not some of the time.</p>\n<p>Okay now for part 2:<br />\nThe internet has graced us with it&#8217;s ability to transmit information to us 24/7.  Problem is, the brain can handle only so much information going through it all at once.  So what happens when too much information finds it&#8217;s way into our brains?  We simplify the information.  Our brain does all of the work for us.  The brain uses the model of reality in our heads as a reference, and deliberately rejects information that contradicts our model of reality, because that information requires time and effort to process, and ain&#8217;t nobody got time for that.</p>\n<p>As a result, everyone is now wrong about everything.  There&#8217;s way too much information to process, and our brain&#8217;s reliance on our internal model of reality directly causes our interpretation of everything to be wrong.  Sometimes it&#8217;s only slightly wrong, and other times completely wrong.</p>\n<p>Okay now for part 3:<br />\nThe reason Trump won is because the left and the right are both completely submerged in their model of reality.  Trump supporters were annoyed at that.  The reason Trump haters hate Trump supporters is because of the defense mechanism that comes up when one&#8217;s model of reality is challenged by reality.  Trump haters&#8217; model of reality is wrong.  The reason Trump supporters get mad at Trump every time he does something they didn&#8217;t think he would do is because of the defense mechanism that comes up when [you get the idea].   Trump supporters&#8217; model of reality is wrong.</p>\n<p>Okay now for part 4:<br />\nThink of information as a fluid, with a viscosity.  Think of the brain as a series of tubes.  Because of the internet, the rate of information flow through our brains is increasing, and the rate of increase is accelerating.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a model of fluid dynamics that explains this.  Prior to 1995 (windows 95 and Internet Explorer), the information flow through our brains was in laminar flow.  Afterward, it entered the transitional stage.  We are currently in the transition stage.  I predict that in 2022, we will reach turbulent flow.  At that point, this trick of the brain which is increasingly becoming a problem will enter center stage whether you&#8217;re ready for it to or not.  I suggest you get ready.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m honestly kind of tired of waiting at this point.  It&#8217;s annoying seeing everyone react so much to their own imagination as if it were reality.  It&#8217;s boring, too.  The model of reality in your head isn&#8217;t nearly complex enough to be interesting.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Elliott Kelley", "published": "2018-04-25 15:14:29+00:00", "title": "By: Elliott Kelley"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s reports of someone demonstrating entanglement of two macroscopic-sized vibrating metal discs (paywall):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0038-x\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0038-x</a></p>\n<p>Scott, any comment?
