For his PhD, he did work on good ol&#8217; boring 19th Century physics &#8212; namely continuum mechanics.  But it wasn&#8217;t ho-hum work.  Born did it with such mathematical rigor and craft that he made good friends that&#8217;d greatly help his career, namely mathematicians of the epochal-making caliber of Hilbert, Klein, and Minkowski.   Through Minkowski, he quickly developed the nose for the new and was an early worker in Special Relativity.  Then, Born was indeed in his early 40s when he worked with Werner Heisenberg and brought his straight-form-the-source Hilbert Space skills to the creation of Matrix Mechanics.  And then, of course, once quantum mechanics was formulated, there was tons of low lying fruit, and Born did excellent work in its applications to solid state physics as well as doing magisterial work in the perhaps-boring-but-ever-more-technologically-useful 19th Century physics of his schoolboy youth (e.g., his famous _Principles of Optics_ textbook/reference with Wolf).</p>\n]]>", "author": "Bill Kaminsky", "published": "2016-02-01 21:52:24+00:00", "title": "By: Bill Kaminsky"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>fred #11: See my post <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=346\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Singularity Is Far</a>.
