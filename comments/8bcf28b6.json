I don&#8217;t know how I missed it before.  Thanks very much for linking to it.</p>\n<p>I think that article goes in precisely the right direction, for those who want to investigate further: namely, to take seriously that Oswald acted on his own initiative, but seek new information that would help to clarify his motives.</p>\n<p>In particular, I hadn&#8217;t heard about the theory that the idea of assassinating JFK was planted in Oswald&#8217;s head by the Cuban leftists who he met in Mexico (even if they didn&#8217;t &#8220;send&#8221; Oswald <i>per se</i>, and were as shocked as anyone else when he actually did it).  This theory has the advantage of being, on its face, rather plausible (e.g., we know that Oswald <i>did</i> go to Mexico a few weeks before the assassination, and he <i>did</i> meet Fidelistas there in a position to be outraged about JFK&#8217;s attempts to assassinate their leader).</p>\n<p>Given that (as I said in the post) one of the Warren Commission&#8217;s explicit concerns was to avoid precipitating war with Cuba, and given the embarrassment surrounding the failed Castro assassination attempts, we&#8217;d also have an explanation for why the WC didn&#8217;t pry very hard in this direction.  Ironically, while the WC wouldn&#8217;t have been trying to cover up the US government&#8217;s totally-nonexistent role in JFK&#8217;s murder, some of its members might indeed have been trying to cover up the US&#8217;s very real, continuing role in <i>Fidel Castro</i>&#8216;s attempted murder!</p>\n<p>Having said that, one obvious problem for the theory is that, by the time he visited Mexico, Oswald was <i>already</i> an attempted political assassin (as well as militant Communist and Castro sympathizer), having tried and failed to assassinate General Walker.  So one could easily believe that he could form the idea to assassinate JFK all by himself, without any additional encouragement from Cuban emigres.  Still, it sounds entirely possible that, at least in Oswald&#8217;s mind, the Cuban emigres who he met in Mexico <i>did</i> give him such additional encouragement.  I hope we learn more, before anyone in a position to clarify further is dead.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2013-12-05 02:25:18+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>George K&#8217;s your comment while interesting does have the problem of just being extremely unlikely.

Quoting xkcd as evidence for certain psychological states seems pretty unfair. Other points I agree with. Here are some points I don&#8217;t:</p>\n<p>(6) and (7) is clearly false. There are several major works that mention both. One that comes immediately to mind is Peter Dale Scott&#8217;s Deep Politics and the Death of JFK. Scott has unearthed the fact that General Walker was involved in a right-wing, anti-communist private intelligence organisation called the &#8220;International Committee for the Defence of Christian Culture&#8221; that was run by other military men (Major General Charles Willoughby, the head of US military intelligence in WW2) and oil tycoons (H.L. Hunt and his sons). General Walker was also forcibly retired by the Military for barraging his troops with John Birch Society propaganda (see his NYT obituary). Individuals that were associated with this organisation (Willoughby, among others) were named in the Warren Commission as spreading the idea that the CIA was behind the murder.</p>\n<p>If (14) is true, explain the size of the intelligence apparatus in governments worldwide. The US has several highly secretive intelligence organisations with thousands to tens of thousands of people working for them. The Snowden-NSA leaks is obviously a data point in favor of (14), but other organisations (like say, the NRO) still remain large, complex, and we don&#8217;t know much about their daily operations and actions. Add in another group like the various JSOC task forces, or the Intelligence Activity. These guys have military operations all over the planet (Afganistan, the Horn of Africa, the Phillipines), yet we don&#8217;t know much about their daily activities, their operations, nor their scope.</p>\n<p>Point (20) is a silly counter-argument and a species of category error. You are comparing gathering of scientific knowledge with a phenomenon that is prima facie secretive. Please outline for me how you would go about gathering knowledge in a scientific manner on a JSOC kill team, or any other organisation that might have counterintelligence, security, or deception capabilities. </p>\n<p>Of course, the problem with all this conspiracy talk isn&#8217;t conspiracists. It is nerds that are the problem, skeptical nerds to be more exact. Here you have some of the best minds on the planet that don&#8217;t actually really engage with a supposed conspiracy at all. Instead they engage the people doing the conspiracy theorizing, and go after the most wacky aspects of the conspiracy theory. That&#8217;s why you find the fedora-wearing skeptics of places like LessWrong, reddit, and xkcd go after easy-pickings like holographic planes, the illuminati, contrails, or bigfoot. But if you start talking about the death of David Kelly, Iran-Contra, the BCCI, Ali Mohamed, the Al Kifah Refugee Center, the various Saudi embassy associated people who funneled money to the 9/11 hijackers (Faha al Thumairy, Omar al-Bayoumi, and Haifa bint Faisal. That last one being a member of the House of Saud); then, suddenly they turn silent. Shit arguments that can be batted down with lists of fallacies from Wikipedia are ok, but investigating anything resembling an organisation that has security or counterintelligence capabilities is too much of a challenge. Better go back to watching anime.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like white, male, skeptic nerds have a pre-programmed bug in their head to take on the stupidest of shit, and expect a pat on the back for acting like little professors like their hero Neil Degrasse Tyson. Conspiracy theorists really deserve a better class of conspiracy theorizer closer to that of an investigative journalist (something like Marcy Wheeler&#8217;s Emptywheel blog). But given that nerd culture assigns high status to debunking, that&#8217;ll never happen. What we are left with is mainstream media ignoring certain aspects of stories, crazed loons latching onto bullshit, and skeptic nerds attacking the loons. It&#8217;s a real sad state of affairs, and this blog post certainly adds to it.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Name", "published": "2013-12-06 09:03:26+00:00", "title": "By: Name"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Keep believing!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thebackbencher.co.uk/3-things-you-didnt-want-to-know-about-nelson-mandela/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thebackbencher.co.uk/3-things-you-didnt-want-to-know-about-nelson-mandela/</a></p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Blind:Not.html\">Not Blind</a>", "published": "2013-12-06 14:21:07+00:00", "title": "By: Not Blind"}]
