I could probably dig up more examples &#8211; but (with all due respect, you seem like a pretty decent person!) I&#8217;m not sure how much effort I want to put into an internet debate.</p>\n<p>@Scott Aaronson</p>\n<p>> If there were even a few examples of campus murder sprees that were stopped by heroic students carrying concealed weapons, that would be evidence I\u2019d need to weigh, alongside any evidence in the other direction</p>\n<p>I think this is very reasonable. And I&#8217;ll admit there is very little hard evidence either way. In general (not just on campus), mass shootings are almost never stopped by civilian concealed carry permit holders.</p>\n<p>The pro-gun control side says this is because concealed carry permit holders aren&#8217;t helping. The anti-gun control side says this is because concealed carry permit holders stop the would-be mass shooter before the incident could become a mass shooting. Note that &#8220;stop&#8221; does not necessarily mean shooting the perpetrator &#8211; in many cases, when confronted by armed opposition, the perpetrator will commit suicide. I consider this moderate evidence in favor of the pro-CCW side.</p>\n<p>The people I know, personally, are excellent shots and cool under pressure, but I can see how there would be concern that the average CCW permit holder doesn&#8217;t have anything resembling the training of the average police officer. I have a few counterarguments: First, it amazes me how *little* firearms training the average police officer gets &#8211; I maintain that a lot of the CCW permit holders are better than you think, in comparison. Second, civilians who are carrying are *not* meant to do everything that a police officer is meant to, the analogy I&#8217;ve heard (I forget the source) is that they are &#8220;speed bumps&#8221; not &#8220;roadblocks&#8221;. Finally, during a shooting, it&#8217;s not *hard* to tell the difference between the &#8220;good guys&#8221; and the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; &#8211; the good guys are the ones who have control over their firearm and are carefully looking around; the bad guys are the ones indiscriminately shooting at their fellow human beings.</p>\n<p>But you asked for specific incidents. My memory isn&#8217;t great on this one, but the highest-profile incident that comes to mind is the University of Texas tower shooting. The short summary is that an ex-Marine sharpshooter grabbed several rifles and began shooting people on campus from a tower.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_tower_shooting\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_tower_shooting</a></p>\n<p>This happened before SWAT teams were a thing and the police were pretty caught off guard. A few notes of interest:</p>\n<p>&#8211; A student ended up providing the police a rifle, since the police were not equipped properly.</p>\n<p>&#8211; A retired veteran accompanied the police up the tower to cover them while they confronted (and ended up killing) the shooter</p>\n<p>&#8211; A combination of police officers and civilians provided cover fire from the ground while a small group &#8211; two police officers and the retired veteran &#8211; went up the tower.</p>\n<p>The biggest change after this was that SWAT teams were created. The police were (reasonably!) very uncomfortable with civilian shooters taking part in the conflict.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure that this is strong evidence for *concealed carry* &#8211; what was needed were rifles; pistols are basically useless against a shooter from a tower and you can&#8217;t concealed-carry a rifle. But I certainly think it&#8217;s *weak* evidence in favor of letting responsible civilians be armed.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Joshua Brule", "published": "2017-05-04 18:16:22+00:00", "title": "By: Joshua Brule"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>>isn\u2019t it overwhelmingly likelier that a gun-filled campus would lead to more such tragedies, and those on a larger scale?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d be more worried about a knife-filled campus leading to more such tragedies, since this attack happened with a knife.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Daniel", "published": "2017-05-04 23:45:55+00:00", "title": "By: Daniel"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Daniel #29: Well yes, <i>this</i> attack happened with a knife, but other campus attacks (including, infamously, at UT) have happened with guns, and been more deadly as a result.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2017-05-05 15:20:00+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}]
