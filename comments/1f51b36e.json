What little there is is decay radiation due to activation of the detector materials.  E.g. neutrons produced in a collision can be captured by atoms in the detector.  Most of the materials are chosen to be radiation-hard, but things like steel screws and copper wiring are hard to control and prone to activation.  And it&#8217;s just a harsh environment in there.</p>\n<p>Of course operation stopped two years ago and the detector has had time to &#8220;cool down&#8221;.  But regulation at CERN is strict; basically any room that has ever had a beam in it is considered a radiation area.
