(Really? No one else gets depressed about that?) It\u2019s kind of like: given that this integer has existed since before there was a universe, and will continue to exist after the universe has degenerated into a thin gruel of radiation, what\u2019s the point of even going through the motions? You know?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I am not entirely sure this picture, if it were true, would lead to depression.

I get the impression you think the same thing, although you&#8217;ve never explicitly said so.</p>\n<p>Some of my views of the &#8216;triple-aspect&#8217; theory of reality have crystallized, so I have to say a few things about that just to update what i said in the earlier thread.</p>\n<p>  Earlier I was still considering some weak forms of dualism.  My update is that I now fully reject all forms of dualism as wrong-headed.   I had said that there were 3 fundamental properties of reality<br />\n(information, matter (fields), consciousness).</p>\n<p>I now think there is *one* fundamental element of reality, which I call the &#8216;Info-Cognition Field&#8217;.   This manifests itself as 3 *apparent* properties (information, fields and consciousness), but there&#8217;s really only 1 thing there (neutral monism).  It&#8217;s analogous to the way that &#8216;electromagnetism&#8217; manifests as &#8216;electricity&#8217; and &#8216;magnetism&#8217;.</p>\n<p>I had earlier made the claim that consciousness was &#8216;the arrow of time&#8217;.  I think this was right on the money.  The secret is &#8216;time&#8217;!</p>\n<p>I now think that &#8216;qualia&#8217; is a basic fundamental unit of &#8216;time&#8217; or &#8216;causality&#8217;.  It&#8217;s a unit of &#8216;causal continuity&#8217; and this also defines an &#8216;identity&#8217;.</p>\n<p>You see, every object in the universe has an &#8216;identity&#8217;, which we can *define* as the degree of localization in space and time.  In other words, the &#8216;identity&#8217; of the object is only defined to the extent that we can &#8216;pin down&#8217; the location of the object in the multiverse.   </p>\n<p>So that then is &#8216;consciousness&#8217; (or &#8216;qualia&#8217;).  It&#8217;s the fundamental unit of &#8216;identity&#8217; or &#8216;causal continuity&#8217;, present to some degree in all things.</p>\n<p>More complex identities (or consciousness) are built up from simpler ones, exactly analogous to the way that more complex forms of matter are built from simpler ones.</p>\n<p>The &#8216;combination problem&#8217; for qualia is resolved by seeing that you &#8216;paste together&#8217; smaller units of &#8216;causal continuity&#8217; into larger ones&#8230;. a unit of &#8216;causal continuity&#8217; is simply a thermodynamic &#8216;propensity&#8217; for events to happen in one way rather than another way.   </p>\n<p>Decision theory can be interpreted as a theory of how to &#8216;paste together&#8217; different preferences or &#8216;qualia&#8217; into a coherent whole.  So &#8216;decision theory&#8217; is really a high-level theory of &#8216;qualia&#8217;!    Similarly, at an each higher level of abstraction, values or ethics would emerge as &#8216;qualia&#8217; get pasted together into ever more complex minds.  In this picture, axiology (theory of values) emerges as a higher-level form of decision theory.</p>\n<p>What is the relationship between information, matter and consciousness?</p>\n<p>Each &#8216;contains&#8217; the other 2, just as I thought.   Each property can be *approximately* defined as a combination of the other 2.  They&#8217;re not separate, but they&#8217;re not identical either.  Reductionism is an *approximation* , not an absolute principle.  So the 3 properties (information, matter and consciousness) are still ontologically distinct, even though they can be approximately defined in terms of each other.</p>\n<p>How does all this relate to your ideas as regards GIQTM? I think my ideas match up well with yours!</p>\n<p>If qualia (consciousness) is indeed the basic unit of &#8216;time&#8217; or &#8216;causal continuity&#8217;, and is a &#8216;thermodynamic propensity&#8217;, then indeed, consciousness directly participates in the thermodynamic arrow of time, just as you claim!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if consciousness is also the basic unit of &#8216;identity&#8217;, then again, the puzzle of free will would be directly linked to that of &#8216;identity&#8217;.</p>\n<p>On the basis of this, I regard GIQTM as a real candidate for a possible solution to these puzzles!</p>\n<p>However, although I like the general ideas in GIQTM, I&#8217;m still skeptical of the specific QM mechanism proposed (no-cloning).</p>\n<p>Something still isn&#8217;t quite right.  In particular, I still really can&#8217;t see why &#8216;identity&#8217; should be unique&#8230;the problem is that according to MWI of QM, we are being &#8216;forked off&#8217; all the time into multiple copies, so doesn&#8217;t this suggest that low-level quantum states aren&#8217;t really that important for personal identity?</p>\n<p>But Scott, I certainly think you are  on the right track overall.</p>\n]]>", "author": "mjgeddes", "published": "2016-09-23 05:47:09+00:00", "title": "By: mjgeddes"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Sniffnoy: the first page of the PDF has a link back to the abstract page on ArXiv.
