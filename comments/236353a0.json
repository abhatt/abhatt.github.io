After all, the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem says that if a first-order theory in a countable language has an infinite model, it has at least one model of each infinite cardinality. So, if we\u2019re trying to use this kind of theory to describe an infinitely big mathematical structure, the most we can hope for is that after we specify its cardinality, the axioms completely determine it.</p>\n<p>And this actually happens sometimes. It happens for the complex numbers! Zilber believes this has something to do with why the complex numbers show up so much in physics. This sounds very implausible at first, but there are some amazing results in logic that one needs to learn before dismissing the idea out of hand.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Dinesh", "published": "2017-01-08 13:32:54+00:00", "title": "By: Dinesh"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>On page 53, below Theorem 52, you say that a language L would not be in NLOGSPACE if L would require AC0-circuits of large size.
