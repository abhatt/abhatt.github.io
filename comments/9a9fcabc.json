[{"content": "So, basically, you&#39;re saying that if you pay your device four-fold, you can expect people smiling at you when you have a problem.

As part of that price, though, it&#39;s indeed useful to have people who will actually help you if you have a problem.  I&#39;d be curious is the experience is the same for non-Apple products (or the corresponding price for such service).  <br /><br /><br /><br />", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/m/Mitzenmacher:Michael.html\">Michael Mitzenmacher</a>", "published": "2015-04-20 19:29:07.063000-04:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "Agree with Micha above. Apple service/repair seems to be great, except Apple products don&#39;t seem to be worth the amount that one has to pay for them. They don&#39;t seem to last longer than a traditional PC purchased for far less money. The quality of the hardware isn&#39;t particularly great, either. Sure, their products *look* tasty, and work nice for a while, but that&#39;s about that. I&#39;d much prefer paying far less and working with a traditional PC. To give credit to Microsoft, they&#39;ve really worked on their UI issues, and I have no complaints to date with Windows 8.1 (I have been a happy user for the past 2 years).", "author": "AH", "published": "2015-04-21 11:15:46.546000-04:00", "title": ""}]
