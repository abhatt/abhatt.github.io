It gets worse only in Russian lit. On the other hand, it&#8217;s once again the difficulty you run into at a governmental/policy level when you&#8217;re trying to deal with extremely complex, personal, and urgent questions (particularly when almost everyone going through the process is a complete noob. I came to the conclusion that most of a divorce lawyer&#8217;s fee is for shepherding disoriented and substantially crazy people). If you look at the caseloads, they&#8217;re tremendous. You can&#8217;t say &#8220;screw it, this isn&#8217;t something for the state to deal with&#8221;, because then you wind up with property disputes, even worse mother/child poverty, and serious trouble over kids. We also make marriage a legal state, which means you have to be able to undo it legally. So divorce law is a morass of convention, precedent, politics, sociology, psychology, criminal justice, property law, home economics, and judges&#8217; individual lunacies, and it changes all the time in every state&#8230;the only blessing is that most divorces leave the courts for good when the children turn 22. Compounding the problem is that most statehouses are nuthouses, and they make divorce laws in each state, with the American Bar Assoc and judges&#8217; organizations shouting &#8220;whoa, nelly&#8221; all the time. (The state reps, some of whom have the IQs of carrots, like to make impracticable divorce laws.) Anyway &#8211; when you deal with law, you deal with a machine, and the more socially ordinary the kind of case, the bigger and less forgiving the machine. It takes people inside the machine a long time to understand they&#8217;re in one. </p>\n<p>Welcome to social sciences! <img src=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif\" alt=\":D\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> And look, there&#8217;s nothing physical sciences would recognize as a control.</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m not saying that broad social forces are more important than individual ones. They both exist and both matter. I&#8217;m saying it depends on the scale and context you&#8217;re looking at. If you want to understand those structural forces directing the high-stakes decisions of the individual, you&#8217;re going to come away from cris de coeur for a little bit. (If you want this in its original revolutionary horror, reread Hobbes, the father of modern government.) If you want to understand what those structures mean as part of lived experience, you want to be up close to the people&#8217;s voices and minds. They aren&#8217;t wholly independent, but some people build the structure and some have no influence on it at all, and this is why power and influence and position matter. Your young woman with the lovelorn older man, in the last thread, has influence in one relationship. The state legislator has influence in millions. A professor at MIT is not without influence, either. (I&#8217;m thinking of one guy in particular, an EE&#8230;what was his name? Bush, Vannevar. Not bad with the social-structure-building, Prof. Bush.) Which is part of what I&#8217;ve been saying throughout, though maybe not straightforwardly enough: your views on this matter (more) because of your position. That&#8217;s not a suggestion that you get out the hex paper, but a suggestion that you are not actually free, in that position, to regard yourself reasonably as an entirely private person. You will help shape important structures and your views, as you do so, will matter.

Schr\u00f6dinger&#8217;s rapist is a problem because of rapists.

This isn&#8217;t true. </p>\n<p>Take for instance walking someone to a destination. It&#8217;s true that if you did this in a way that seemed to put Samaritan-weight virtue on it, rather than &#8220;oh I&#8217;m headed that way anyway, I&#8217;ll walk you over if you like&#8221; (and the answer of course might be no) many people would wonder what you were up to. The usual kind thing to do in the circumstance is to give good directions, smile, and be off. That&#8217;s already a donation of time and people appreciate it. But the key there is to know what the usual well-regarded thing is to do. Note that giving directions, smiling, and being off is not a microaggression, and you don&#8217;t have to expiate sins you haven&#8217;t committed. </p>\n<p>You also say you worry that you might have done damage or that others might have seen you in a certain way.

I&#8217;m guessing that your friends will be shocked that you&#8217;ve been worrying about this, and that it&#8217;s not something they&#8217;d even thought of. </p>\n<p>If you need to be thorough about these things, you can catalogue what people who are at ease and seem kind do; it changes from place to place, but you can take a look then at that catalogue, ask, are these all things I really want to do or do some of them seem, on inspection, rather thoughtlessly sexist; and adjust.

I&#8217;m not an academic feminist (despite being a feminist with a job in academia) and in general have little patience for theory; I came to the subject simply by living. Had little interest in it for most of my life. </p>\n<p>What I&#8217;ve read of academic feminism that isn&#8217;t some form of ethnography is very, very heavy on the marxist noodling. Given that at the age of nine my kid was able to see, on her own,  that Marx had clear vision but terrible prescriptions, and given that feminism&#8217;s been, well, a thing for quite a long time now&#8230;well, why in God&#8217;s name, if you&#8217;re a guy who&#8217;s heard about this feminism thing and wants to understand it better, would you go for marxist noodling from happily tenured professors and expensively-educated bloggers rather than thinking, &#8220;I keep hearing about this feminism, and surely it has to be more interesting than this. Where are the interesting (yet sane) parts?&#8221; Because the interesting parts are always from people who have something serious at stake and talk plainly about it. You know this without knowing it, nobody wants to read a story about, I don&#8217;t know, dropped stitches in a sweater that&#8217;s going to sit in a drawer until Christmas and then be given away without incident. </p>\n<p>Women being raped at college (or anywhere else, for that matter) is serious. Women being robbed of big money over the course of a lifetime and being left in near-poverty in old age is serious. Women being expected to bear most or all of the labor of childrearing for free is serious. Obstacles to education, glass ceilings, nickel-and-diming, there&#8217;s a whole list of things just in the US, and this stuff isn&#8217;t a set of conference papers, it&#8217;s very real.  </p>\n<p>I can see going to the academics now and then for help with some kind of framework with the whole thing, interpretation. But I don&#8217;t think you need to be very old to mistrust the frameworks, particularly tidy ones meant to be of a piece with some larger and equally improbably tidy theory about how people do. I can also see going and listening to the young bloggy types to hear what they&#8217;re shouting about these days, what they&#8217;re trying to work out as they finish growing up, but if you have any ears and you&#8217;re over 30 yourself you ought to be able to hear that part of what&#8217;s going on is the process of self-definition; you&#8217;re just eavesdropping.</p>\n<p>That said, I&#8217;ll point out that sometimes the line isn&#8217;t that clear. Not all the bloggers are rich kids for whom this is all Lost-in-Translation games, not all the scholars are safe, many have been victims of physical attacks and discrimination, sometimes they&#8217;re operating without nets, and sometimes the things they&#8217;ve got on the line aren&#8217;t trivial.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also not without value, their yelling. I understand some of why less-well-off women don&#8217;t go around like that, and revolutions aren&#8217;t made by the vulnerable and those who expect nothing. But theory and yelling are still not where the story is. So for these guys who feel outraged and betrayed and upset by what they call malignant or toxic feminism &#8212; well, what the hell, guys. Think about why you hear their voices; think about why you aren&#8217;t hearing other women&#8217;s voices.

First of all, I&#8217;m blown away by the fact that in over 1000 comments between this post, and the Lewin post, no one has made mention of the feminist writer bell hooks, who offers some beautiful and highly empathetic insight in her book entitled &#8220;The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love&#8221; from which an excerpt can be found <a href=\"http://aia.berkeley.edu/strengthening_connections/handouts/1a/Bell%20Hook%20Men%20to%20Masculinity%20%20Tanji%20Donald.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.  In fact, I haven&#8217;t stumbled across a mention of ANY nonwhite noncis feminist in over 1000 comments, which is&#8230; well, worrisome if you&#8217;re interested in fully understanding the breadth, complexity, and diversity of the feminist movement.</p>\n<p>Another noticeably absent part of this ongoing discussion is anyone mentioning the difference between 1st and 2nd wave feminism and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-wave_feminism\" rel=\"nofollow\">3rd wave feminism</a>.  The 1st and 2nd waves excluded anyone who was nonwhite, nonmiddle/upper class, noncis-gendered, and/or nonwomen, something that feminism broadly acknowledges these days is a massive mistake.  The incorporation of queer (and other) theory into feminism, which formally happened in the early 90s, pushed 2nd wave feminists (like Dworkin) into obsolescence.  Are there still 2nd wave feminists around?  Yeah, totally; people like the radfems who don&#8217;t believe in transgendered rights.  But basing your take on the entirety of feminism on people like that is akin to assessing humanity based on YouTube comments.  </p>\n<p>(Both of those things leave you curled in the fetal position wishing for the zombie apocalypse.)</p>\n<p>Finally, I was very taken aback by Alexander&#8217;s excoriation of feminism and why this was what Scott (Aaronson) chose to share, instead of a more inclusive 3rd wave feminist perspective, one that embraces diversity, mutual consent, and autonomy of all involved parties and a dissolution of the gender binary (no patriarchy and also no matriarchy), among other things.  That&#8217;s my kind of feminism, where everyone should be able to explore themselves &#8211; all their wants and needs &#8211; in a shame-free manner, so I&#8217;m going to share a piece directed at all the shy nerd baby feminists in the crowd, all the folks who say, <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2014/07/ask-polly-i-want-to-get-laid-but-im-afraid-of-oppressing-women\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;I want to get laid, but I&#8217;m afraid of oppressing women.&#8221;</a>  We need to work through and fully process old traumas (and I strongly suggest therapy for that), so we can stop existing in the past, emotionally reliving them, and be present now.  We can sit here and constantly pick at all the things that were wrong, or we can find things that are right in the present, finding ways to move forward and create the love, inclusivity, and empathy for ourselves and others that we grew up lacking.  Loving the imperfect struggling weirdo we all were/are is the most radical thing anyone can do, and I really hope more of us find ways to make that happen.  It&#8217;s why bell hooks&#8217; take on love and masculinity should be a must-read and is so, so important to this thread, even if you &#8211; like me &#8211; don&#8217;t agree with every single thing she says.</p>\n]]>", "author": "M.", "published": "2015-01-05 17:30:32+00:00", "title": "By: M."}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@Dan #453</p>\n<p>Yes, of course you&#8217;re right.  Certainty is seldom justified.  Trying to be more precise, I suggest that where a woman is nowadays discouraged from studying or working in STEM, this rarely the result of institutional sexism, or patriarchal attitudes (except perhaps from her immediate family).  Any discouragement is likely to be of the same kind that might be experienced by a boy.</p>\n<p>As mentioned by myself (#394) and others there are outreach programmes to encourage girls into STEM.  Teachers have been on-message for decades.  In Britain, college advertising and news stories are nearly always skewed towards the portayal of successful girls &#8211; not just in STEM but in any area of academic achievement.  For years college advertisements would typically show girls and black boys, seldom white boys.  Not surprisingly, we now have a serious problem of underachievement by white boys.  Yet we still have a gender deficit in STEM.</p>\n<p>Yes, I do &#8220;honestly believe the most parsimonious explanation for (most of) the gender imbalance in STEM is nature&#8221;.

All I can say is, &#8220;encouragement&#8221; of girls into STEM has failed to make a significant difference, and at least one person who has plied that trade for many years privately agrees with me (#394).

My problems were &#8220;caused&#8221; by feminism, as well.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s two sides to this. They&#8217;re both strawpeople.</p>\n<p>0. Wow feminists did something bad therefore feminism is bad<br />\n1. Feminists are actually trying to fix things don&#8217;t criticize them it&#8217;s not their fault</p>\n<p>Okay, this is stereotypical. 0 can basically be incorporated into what you&#8217;d call &#8220;conservative&#8221; and 1 can be incorporated into what you&#8217;d call &#8220;liberal&#8221;. Same pattern, everywhere, anywhere.</p>\n<p>0 is a knee-jerk reaction to anything different and unfamiliar, because we have concrete proof that familiar things already work. And it&#8217;s prudent, after all new things can make things go horribly wrong, there&#8217;s plenty of examples in history to prove this, society is fragile and the things they suggest are new and untested. When we don&#8217;t like this thing we call it prejudice and discrimination.<br />\n1 is an attitude that holds feminists, revolutionaries above any wrong-doing, and a lot of it has to do with anticipating the 0 that is always there. And I believe we all believe changing society for the better is a good thing.</p>\n<p>The 1 attitude frustrates those who are sympathetic to the 1, but see some things wrong with the 1 that needs to be changed. And the obstinacy of the 1 skirts those people closer to the 0. But 1 exists because they fear 0 in the first place. And so on. Vast portions of history can be interpreted as this tension between 0 and 1. History repeats itself. The only losers in this are people who really wish for gender equality.</p>\n<p>How do we get out of this? What we can say is that if we knew the answer to this we wouldn&#8217;t be here.</p>\n<p>The question is this: am I going to accept this trial by fire as the price to pay for society to accept anything new, am I going to accept the fact that shy nerds are put on the sacrificial altar for its sake.</p>\n<p>[And perhaps you have said that being a shy nerd girl is easier. Considering I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to be a shy nerd boy I&#8217;m not going to commit myself to saying whether that&#8217;s true or not, but making an unsupported statement like that that&#8217;s not that obvious (especially in light of the lack of visibility of shy nerd girls, and that most people haven&#8217;t gone through the experience of being both a shy nerd boy and a shy nerd girl to compare, actually that&#8217;s probably even harder) is going to draw fire, yeah. But suppose I accepted for a moment that it is easier to be a shy nerd girl than a shy nerd boy. Even then, it still seems to me that shy nerd girls have the ability to change reality much less.]</p>\n<p>Feminist is an overly-broad term indicating anyone who believes in gender equality. That means that I am a feminist. That means that half the commenters up there criticizing feminism are feminist. That means that vast swathes of the MRA are probably feminist, although they definitely wouldn&#8217;t identify as such.<br />\nIt turned out this way as a side-effect of the fact that the very first women who spoke out for gender equality were appropriated the term \u201cfeminist\u201d, against their will, and is still derogatory today. (No one can make you feel inferior without your consent? Well, they can always engage in various degrees of trying.) It&#8217;s a way to reclaim that word.</p>\n<p>And well, on the flip side&#8230;there is patriarchy. Like feminism patriarchy also evolved into the kind of word that is broad, everything that encompasses how the genders are not equal. There is no feminism without patriarchy, and there is no patriarchy without feminism. It&#8217;s kinda like how if we lived in an alternate universe were everyone was a girl or where everyone was a boy we&#8217;re not going to have a word for boys and girls. Crazy, huh.</p>\n<p>Feminism is everything. Patriarchy is also everything. They&#8217;re terrible words. And being a feminist does not preclude one from being compromised by and being complicit in helping to propagate the patriarchy.</p>\n<p>So again, I ask: why were people scared when you said that your problems were caused by feminism? Because it&#8217;s a half-truth. When you say feminist, it&#8217;s a way to talk about the people who are trying to change the world without talking about the conditions of the world that motivated them to change it in the first place. Likewise, patriarchy is a way to talk about everything that is wrong as a force that is separate and that can be acted against by the people who are trying to change the world. What you really need is a word to describe the way this whole system interacts. Not just focus on the people who are trying to change things.<br />\nHalf-truths are a lot scarier than falsehoods, because people believe them.<br />\nLook at those commenters, people adulating you like you&#8217;re their messiah, yep, I&#8217;m scared because they&#8217;re probably my classmates.</p>\n<p>Seriously, people like us who really want absolute truth should stay out of the social sciences.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Student", "published": "2015-01-05 18:08:42+00:00", "title": "By: Student"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>there is no such things as reasonable or good feminists. those should rather label themselves humanists.<br />\npresent day mainstream feminists are harping endlessly on bogus statistics such as the gender pay gap or 1 in 5 college women being raped. many of the same mainstream feminists are advocating for a reversal of the burden of proof in rape trials or to lower the standards for conviction.<br />\nif the aforementioned reasonable/good feminists were really interested in the good reputation of their movement they would actively address and distantiate themselves from the constant stream of outlandish claims of modern feminists but so far their silence is quite deafening.<br />\nif you look for &#8220;good&#8221; feminists check out Christina Hoff Sommers or Cathy Young but they are labelled heretics by the rest of the movement.</p>\n]]>", "author": "alex", "published": "2015-01-05 18:43:38+00:00", "title": "By: alex"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Two things:</p>\n<p>1) I&#8217;ve never felt bad about wanting women to have sex with me, because I always knew I&#8217;d be good to them in lots of other ways if they did.</p>\n<p>2) If I&#8217;ve felt guilty at all, it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t want to sleep with ugly women.

But at the same time, fighting against oppression can&#8217;t be a moral blank check that justifies absolutely anything, either. For example, I would never think poorly of somebody who said, &#8220;You know, I can see where Malcolm X is coming from.&#8221; But I would be deeply worried by any leftist who couldn&#8217;t argue convincingly against Stalin. I get nervous when I hear things that sound like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Kerensky\" rel=\"nofollow\">&#8220;No enemies to the left&#8221;</a>.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve certainly seen online social justice communities\u2014interesting, well-intentioned ones\u2014which believed something like &#8220;No enemies among the oppressed.&#8221; This worked just fine until they ran into a charismatic sociopath who knew how use the language of oppression, and who proceeded to tear those communities to shreds in a brutal manner. Sometimes, it really is necessary to criticize people who are supposedly &#8220;on your side.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>Anyway, when I started writing this comment, I wanted to share another &#8220;geek coming-of-age&#8221; story.</p>\n<p>I went to high-school in the early 90s. I was a geek, subject to the usual abuse geeks received in those days: harassment, bullying, physical assault. I had been taught that fighting back was wrong, and that I should ignore people who made fun of me. But relative to some geeks, I had a decent amount of social privilege: I wasn&#8217;t &#8220;weird&#8221;, I had average looks, and I could defend myself physically against the bullies if I needed to.</p>\n<p>I certainly noticed a few weird things about romantic relationships. For example, there was a bully whose two favorite slurs were &#8220;f*g&#8221; and &#8220;c*nt,&#8221; and he was fond of physically assaulting guys with low social status. He never seemed to have much trouble with relationships. In fact, I once saw him followed around by a group of three(!) adoring students from out of town, and they were hanging on his every word. For maybe two minutes, I felt, &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s really weird.&#8221; But it didn&#8217;t take me long to decide, &#8220;You know, I actually wouldn&#8217;t want to date somebody who&#8217;s totally into a guy like that.&#8221; Just to make things even more confusing, I once briefly thought a different upper-class jock was hot, although he wasn&#8217;t a massive bully.</p>\n<p>I had no actual romantic relationships until college\u2014though I think I once accidentally turned down a good friend whom I adored (ouch), and I once got very publicly kissed by a student from out of town, which made me happy for about six months. So high school was bad, but not totally depressing.</p>\n<p>When I got to college in the early/mid 90s, Dworkin was still very much in the air, although mostly because anti-feminists were constantly using her as a stick to beat feminists with, and because feminists defended her, claiming she was being misinterpreted and taken out of context. I don&#8217;t think I ever heard anybody on the feminist side actually argue against her.</p>\n<p>But again, circumstances worked to my favor: I did feel shame at being attracted to women, but I also had female friends who were bi, or who liked porn, or who were happy to talk about BDSM and consent. And I was still occasionally attracted to a guy here or there. So I couldn&#8217;t stay very guilty for very long, because it was just sort of logically untenable to believe that &#8220;Male desire is inherently oppressive, but it&#8217;s totally cool that women can tie each other up and have fun with floggers as long as everybody&#8217;s really into it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So yeah. Looking back, I can easily imagine how high school and could have been worse. Reading both Scott&#8217;s story and Ampersand&#8217;s story, I find myself saying, &#8220;Well, if I never met X, or if I were a bit less Y, I could have wound up in a very similar place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>\u2026</p>\n<p>And finally, some romantic advice for young, straight(ish) geek guys.</p>\n<p>1. You can&#8217;t make people fall in love with you. If they adore you, or if they want to get into your pants, you don&#8217;t need amazing social skills or &#8220;game.&#8221; (Ugh.) You mostly just need to notice, and not drop the ball too badly. These are both social skills, but they&#8217;re learnable.</p>\n<p>2. People like all sorts of different things. If you use what you have to your best advantage, there&#8217;s probably at least a few people out there who could be into that, especially if you seem to be happy in your own skin. In fact, other people place a surprising amount of weight on your own self-assessment. I&#8217;ve seen guys who <i>rock</i> short, heavyset and hairy, but only because they own it.</p>\n<p>3. As Dan Savage occasionally suggests, don&#8217;t worry about about getting &#8220;15-year-old you&#8221; laid. Worry about making &#8220;19-year-old you&#8221; an interesting and attractive partner. If your body permits, lift some weights and get into cardiovascular shape. Dress with a bit of personal style. Try to see things from the other person&#8217;s perspective. If you&#8217;re not entirely straight, pay attention to what makes some likable guys hot. Practice having fun conversations without steamrollering your conversational partner.</p>\n<p>4. Get out, have fun, and meet a lot of people. Don&#8217;t spend all your time searching for a romantic partner. Rather, try to live the sort of life that would be fun to share.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s something really broken about the other dating model, the one which says, &#8220;My life is a horrible, pathetic mess, and I need a woman to fix it.&#8221; Basically, even people who would otherwise be into you usually won&#8217;t sign up to fix your life.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Guy:Anon_Geek.html\">Anon Geek Guy</a>", "published": "2015-01-05 19:40:14+00:00", "title": "By: Anon Geek Guy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>This is sort of a random thought, but I think it&#8217;s important.
