For me, the specific issue with wearing a MAGA cap to the office is that&#8212;unless the wearer were to disclaim this meaning&#8212;it basically amounts to a statement (or does it not?) that other participants in our group, for example those from Iran, ought to be deported from the US.  So it&#8217;s not just a political expression unrelated to science, but a rejection of one of the preconditions for our doing science.</p>\n<p>This, of course, is also the argument people made for firing James Damore, but in the case of MAGA, it strikes me as a hundred times truer.  Damore never said or insinuated that women as a class, or any specific woman, had no place at Google (indeed he said the opposite), but wearing a MAGA cap <i>does</i> say or insinuate that many current members of the American scientific community <i>who know exactly who they are</i> have no place in the US, because that&#8217;s what Trump has actually tried to implement, and continues to fight the courts to be able to implement.</p>\n<p>Even then, though, I wouldn&#8217;t just summarily expel a MAGA hat wearer from our group&#8212;<i>especially not</i> if they were doing great research!
