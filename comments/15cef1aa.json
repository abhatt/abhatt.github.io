Before they meet, they each think the word color is spelled differently.  What is the correct spelling of the word color or colour?  After they meet and discuss, they will leave, each still believing their previous spelling was correct, and will likely continue to use their spelling, yet they will now agree there is another acceptable way of spelling it _in_a_different_context_.  That is perfectly acceptable with Aumann\u2019s Theorem, and that is exactly what I would expect two rationalists &#8220;agreeing to disagree&#8221; would look like.  They did not converge on one correct way to spell the word color.  Yet they fully agree.

I.e., sure, woohoo, we&#8217;ve found a difference between people or cultures.  But it&#8217;s not one that corresponds to two rational agents holding different beliefs about the actual reality of their shared world.  So it doesn&#8217;t seem like something that even the most thoroughgoing rationalist could get uncomfortable about.

It makes more sense now.</p>\n<p>And I was indeed thinking ahead to moral questions, as I was feeling uncomfortably like Aumann&#8217;s theorem was claiming there needed to be a convergence. But your follow up helped resolve that as well.  I guess I&#8217;m not a moral realist, for I feel the best they could do is say statements like &#8220;if you take such and such as a premise for morality, then this and that will follow&#8221;, and one could never reason out the premise itself.</p>\n<p>I chose spelling so it wouldn&#8217;t get mired in side discussions.  I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d go so far as to say morality is as much a social convention as spelling, as the latter is more arbitrary in some sense I&#8217;m not sure I could quantify easily. But I always find it frustrating when people try to argue morality with logic.  It&#8217;s like the people who leave little booklets about their faith to encourage convertion&#8230; they point out real situations in the world or that people may have, then they always quote the bible, book of mormon, etc. as if we already agree that is a place to start from, and arrive at a conclusion.  That may seem silly, but when I hear vegan&#8217;s proselytizing it comes off the same way to me.  And any arguments I make in return, probably come off similarly.  (For similar reasons, even though I agree with many of your social stances, I cringe a bit when you word it as society progressing when there is a social shift in the premises we use to discuss morality. You even hope we can look &#8216;ahead&#8217; to the next shift.  This appears to presupposed there is a correct fitness function of morality that we are trying to optimize.)</p>\n<p>I usually come to your blog to hear about snippets from the edge of complexity theory.  But I am glad you feel open enough to share thoughts on other subjects.  I don&#8217;t find philosophy as interesting as Julia Galef does, but it is always neat to hear someone speak enthusiastically about a piece of a subject matter that excites them.
