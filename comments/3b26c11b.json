This leads to supermarkets always overstocking, and people`s behavior of buying only the section which is full. [Actually, that one is easily observable in your local supermarket, wherever you are, and I lifted that from some youtube documentary about food wastage].<br />\nAnother angle is food wasted in the farm. Think about third world countries: large percentage of food produced goes to waste before reaching the market due to poor infra. This is also exacerbated by lack of simple food processing industries. For example, at the moment I live in a first world country. I can get first rate fruits at an expensive price. But I know that in my country (third world), similar fruits are rotting in the farm for want of infra. People toiled to care for the plant, and they cannot get a return for want of selling.<br />\nI also second the idea given by Scott #28. That, different portions to cater for different needs. That idea of electronic pre-ordering is cool.\u3000Except that, who will deal with the chaos in the supply and demand satisfaction? I can see, there is a possibility to hike costs with this procedure. But maybe this is just my tired mind refusing to see the solution to this.<br />\nBy the way, this AMA is so cool.
