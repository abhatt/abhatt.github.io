We knew that that was true, at any rate, in the Haar-random case under probabilistic assumptions (because of rejection sampling), so that any counterexample would have to be really weird.

IOW, the complexity would be decreased to exclude a Boltzmann-brain like posit. In its place, we would have to posit an evolutionary mechanism, which we might call &#8220;multiversal evolution&#8221;. I liken that scenario to a Virtual Machine. Virtual Machines are likely to evolve in an open-ended physical system with rich dynamics, because they will have self-consistent rules that preserve their bubbles, it turns out that is not a hypothesis that assumes itself, the general hypothesis is called &#8220;self organization&#8221; by some authors, though there are many names for it in the literature across several fields. Note that there is no generally agreed theory of multiverse in physics, some physicists would point to MWI, some others would talk about each universe having its own set of laws, and some would say they exist in a different temporal direction, and/or distant region of cosmos. Interestingly, this theory was pondered in the great science fiction classic Star Maker (which had an unnecessary theological bent), but the basic idea was that our universe evolved from lower dimensional manifolds. A hypothesis to ponder? Surely, computability was inherent to the very first manifold whatever it was, but it is entirely plausible that there are regions of the cosmos with different physical regimes. What&#8217;s more important is that any such scenario is much more plausible than an intelligent designer, which is shaven by Occam&#8217;s razor. Could it still be true? Sure, but you&#8217;d have to show some strong evidence for it, such evidence doesn&#8217;t exist, though I&#8217;d say that we have almost strong evidence for a (quantum) computable universe. That would be computational physics, not theology.</p>\n<p>I have an answer to your question, though, I think that with enough data we would be able to ascertain the laws of the root manifold (the very first quantum vacuum, or whatever that is).  That question is equivalent to asking whether a theory of everything is possible. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see strings, can I still find the correct theory of strings, or disprove them?&#8221;. It&#8217;s the very same question. There is nothing fundamental in the science of epistemology (AI) that tells us we cannot infer the hardest and most complete theory in science. No foundational barrier.

It&#8217;s now published.</p>\n<ul>Do you think any continuous or infinite processes are observable in our universe? Do you think any continuous or infinite processes exist in our universe?</ul>\n<p>That depends entirely on what you mean by terms like &#8220;exist&#8221; and &#8220;are observable.&#8221;  My best guess is that the history of the observable universe is well-described by quantum mechanics in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space (specifically, about exp(10<sup>122</sup>) dimensions).  If so, then the outcome of any measurement would be discrete; you&#8217;d never directly observe any quantity that was fundamentally continuous.  But the amplitudes, which you&#8217;d need to calculate the probabilities of one measurement outcome versus another one, would be complex numbers with nothing to discretize them.</p>\n<ul>Do you think the amount of information needed to describe the history of our universe is finite?</ul>\n<p>Again, on the view above, the amount of information needed to describe <i>any given observer&#8217;s experience</i> is finite (at most ~10<sup>122</sup> bits).  And the amount of quantum information contained in the state of the universe (i.e., the number of qubits) is also finite.  But the amount of classical information needed to describe the quantum state of the universe (something that no one directly observes) could well be infinite.</p>\n<ul>Is it important to consider historical quantum entanglement if it has already \u201ccollapsed\u201d?</ul>\n<p>Is that question any different from just asking whether someone believes the Many-Worlds Interpretation?

Thoughts on a block universe?</ul>\n<p>A lot of my thoughts about such matters are in my <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/giqtm3.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine</a> essay.  I guess some people might call the freebit picture &#8220;retrocausal,&#8221; in a certain sense, although it denies the possibility of cycles in the causal graph of the world.</p>\n<p>In any case, the usual motivations for retrocausality&#8212;namely, to get rid of the need for quantum entanglement, and to restore the &#8220;time symmetry&#8221; that&#8217;s broken by the special initial state at the Big Bang&#8212;I regard as complete, total red herrings.  Retrocausality doesn&#8217;t help anyway in explaining quantum phenomena (what&#8217;s a &#8220;retrocausal explanation&#8221; for how Shor&#8217;s algorithm works, that adds the tiniest sliver of insight to the usual explanation, and that wouldn&#8217;t if true imply that quantum computers can do much <i>more</i> than they actually can?).  And I&#8217;ve never seen any reason why our universe <i>shouldn&#8217;t</i> have a special initial state but no special final state.
