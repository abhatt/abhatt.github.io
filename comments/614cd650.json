The reason why I read it was that I had read Heisenberg&#8217;s autobiography &#8220;Physics and Beyond&#8221; before, and then read Walter Moore&#8217;s biography of Schr\u00f6dinger. Moore described certain &#8220;private and political mistakes&#8221; of Schr\u00f6dinger, and I wondered whether Heisenberg had committed similar mistakes too, and just remained silent about them in his autobiography.

It got worse during Nazi time, when Heisenberg got accused for being a jew in spirit, for teaching Einstein&#8217;s theory of relativity.

What&#8217;s the rationale behind such an assertion? How is genetic diversity supposed to &#8220;undermine&#8221; the communist idea? If anything, it&#8217;s meritocratic capitalism that presupposes blank-slatism.</p>\n<p>To recap, the capitalist principle is that people should have access to resources in proportion to their abilities, as a reward for their application as market-desirable labor.  Capitalism believe this extrinsic reward system (the &#8220;profit motive&#8221;) is such a crucial incentive, that society would implode without it.  (There&#8217;s one complication in the form of inheritance laws, which surely undermine whatever principle of fairness that meritocratic rewards may have; but let&#8217;s leave that aside as something skirting too close to a contemporary unspeakable truth).  The communist project, by contrast, is that people should have access to resources based on their <i>needs</i>, not on their ability.</p>\n<p>If you believe that people are more genetically diverse than normally thought, surely the meritocratic system should be the one being undermined? The more someone&#8217;s abilities, disposition, personality etc. is determined by their genes, the more it&#8217;s beyond their control; the more it&#8217;s beyond their control, the less sense it makes to punish them for it.  Capitalism says, this guy doesn&#8217;t deserve housing and healthcare because he&#8217;s lazy and dumb; but that presupposes he could have been smart and hard-working as easily as your neighborhood surgeon or lawyer.  What if he&#8217;s <i>born</i> lazy and dumb, and nothing he can do will ever change it? Punishing him for it would be the same as allocating resources based on height or skin color.</p>\n<p>Please notice I&#8217;m not saying that intelligence and personality traits are determined genetically.  I&#8217;m saying that, the more they are, the <i>less</i> sense meritocratic capitalism makes, not the more.</p>\n<p>One simple litmus test is mental disability.  Imagine a severely impaired man with a congenital disease that renders all his cognitive abilities well below adult level.  Imagine this unfortunate man was born in a bustling capitalistic country where, despite abundance of resources and wealth, income inequality is high, real estate markets are severely overinflated, education and health have insane price barriers on them, healthy food costs a lot and crappy food is enough to create an obesity epidemic, there are very few employment opportunities for the uneducated, and so on.  In such a dystopic, horrifying country, our mentally impaired man would be, though no fault of his own, literally unable to secure sufficient income to cover his basic human needs (food, housing, medicine, clothing, a modicum of culture and dignity\u2026).  Do you think he should be provided with access to those resources, even if he can&#8217;t offer anything that the market values right now? Do you think, on the other hand, that it&#8217;s only fair that he should contribute to society in his own way, for example doing community service etc., even if right now no one in the market is interested in paying for, say, planting trees? Then you think he should be provided according to his needs, and provide according to his ability.

The baser side of the present Russian Government is most nearly paralleled by the Directory in France, but on its better side it is closely analogous to the rule of Cromwell. The sincere Communists (and all the older members of the party have proved their sincerity by years of persecution) are not unlike the Puritan soldiers in their stem politico-moral purpose. Cromwell&#8217;s dealings with Parliament are not unlike Lenin&#8217;s with the Constituent Assembly. Both, starting from a combination of democracy and religious faith, were driven to sacrifice democracy to religion enforced by military dictatorship. Both tried to compel their countries to live at a higher level of morality and effort than the population found tolerable. Life in modem Russia, as in Puritan England, is in many ways contrary to instinct. And if the Bolsheviki ultimately fall, it will be for the reason for which the Puritans fell\u2014because there comes a point at which men feel that amusement and ease are worth more than all other goods put together. &#8230;&#8221;</p>\n]]>", "author": "Nick Nolan", "published": "2017-08-10 15:09:25+00:00", "title": "By: Nick Nolan"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>A very nice and well thought out write-up, even though I probably disagree with you on current issues that shall not be named here :-).

(Also the information post seems great but I did not digest it yet.) Generally speaking, mathematicians have very small ingredient of moral dilemmas in their work and very rarely the coward-courageous scale is of any relevance to them. (As an aside, if it&#8217;s ok to express a little skepticism of a common view, in my opinion, regarding courage as necessary a virtue, should be carefully reexamined.)

The former wrote a letter to the boy Alexander urging him to get shot of his tutor who was having him grapple with difficult and abstract subjects like Pure Mathematics. It is better, Isocrates says, to concentrate on perfecting rhetorical style and the arete proper to pre-eminence. </p>\n<p>Isocrates is referred to in the Phaedrus where Socrates comes to the conclusion that the palinode (i.e. being able to change your mind) is paradigmatic of philosophy as something which gives birth to the new.

If you want to get a job with the Secret Police, you pretend to be a dissident till they pick you up for interrogation at which point you turn the tables on them and explain how you are an even better agent provocateur than those they set upon you. Of course, the thing works the other way as well. A true dissident who really wants to change the system will have disguised himself as a secret policeman straight off the bat.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this was the game everyone was playing. People like Luzin, by reason of their mystical leanings, were actually safer if denounced by their own. The real danger was Old Bolsheviks.</p>\n<p>The Soviets and the Americans develop O.R to a high standard at around the same time. Two very different systems begin to mirror each other in one respect- their Political Paideia can have a purely mathematical description. The Soviets had Nobel prize worthy mathematical economists just as the Americans did, but it was the latter which developed systematic schools attracting adherents across the globe. Ultimately, in the &#8217;90&#8217;s we had the ultimate &#8216;antidosis&#8217; competition. The Harvard Econ Dept was hired to give Russia an American type economy.
