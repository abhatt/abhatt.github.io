To me, this seems like an interesting illustration of the difference between the \u201coriginal\u201d leftism rooted in Enlightenment ideals, and the \u201cnew\u201d kind that\u2019s all about smashing class and gender and race enemies by any means possible\u2014a kind that owes less to Spinoza, Mill, or MLK than it does to Lenin, Stalin, and Mao (figures who a subset of the SneerClubbers explicitly endorse as heroes).

You write: </p>\n<p>&#8220;Really a cop in the USA can arrest and handcuff you out of the alleged accusation of stealing 4$ by a store manager in an airport??? This is ridiculous, and it is really scary that so many people find it \u201cnormal\u201d and even \u201cright\u201d.</p>\n<p>At the minimum, you should leave a review on tripadvisor, google et al. where you explain what happened, and that the store manager has the tendency to call the cops to arrest bona fide customers. The shop should be severely punished for doing so (instead of the normal and civil course of action, which is to insist with you politely to clear the misunderstanding and nothing else).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The alleged accusation? The cashier witnessed the money being taken and identified Scott, and there was in addition a video of Scott taking the money, being informed he took the money, indicating that he was aware that the cashier was talking to him, and not returning the money. That is hardly an &#8220;alleged accusation&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Look, I get that people on this blog like Scott. I am fond of Scott myself. But that is neither here nor there. Stop trying to make Scott the victim here. He wasn&#8217;t. A manager who calls the cops when someone takes money that does not belong to him and, when informed of that, does not give it back is not being unreasonable. And once the cops get involved, as I said, they follow SOP. Bunsen Burner chooses to ask what if it was a 5-year-old child or a disabled person. But what in the world is the point of such a question? The point of handcuffs is restraint: if the disabled person cannot flee or do any harm, then for all any of us knows they would not be handcuffed. Nor a 5-year-old. But that is entirely conjectural: Scott is neither 5-years-old nor disabled. He is perfectly physically capable or fleeing, fighting, pulling a weapon, etc. So what is the point of Bunsen Burner&#8217;s question except to play a plainly rhetorical trick? It would be nice if people could take serious questions seriously.</p>\n<p>Complaining about the manager on Trip Advisor is doubly or triply silly. Scott took money out of their tip jar! Scott\u2014quite appropriately\u2014offered the manager $40 for all the trouble he caused and the manager graciously declined. That is called polite and civilized behavior.

On the contrary, I think a critical part of the training of a police officer is being able to identify threats and respond accordingly. Judgement calls are simply unavoidable. We don&#8217;t want our police officers to be mindless thugs that simply apply overwhelming force to every situation. Think of a police officer that stopped a car in the street, and the driver leans forward and opens the glove box. Is the driver reaching for his documents, or pulling a gun on the officer? There are people who indeed shoot police officers that stop their cars, but barring some evidence that the driver is in fact a cannibalistic axe-murderer with a warrant out for his arrest, I don&#8217;t think the police officer should shoot people who reach for their glove box.</p>\n<p>In the case of Scott, I think any police officer, even in the US, would correctly conclude that a middle-aged man with wife and children carrying a lot of luggage in an airport poses no risk of fight or flight (well, the other kind of flight yes).</p>\n<p>About &#8220;force&#8221;, I think you are being sidetracked by semantics. Would you agree if I rephrased the sentence as &#8220;I hope everybody agrees that the police used excessive restraints in Scott\u2019s situation.&#8221;?</p>\n<p>The discussion is then about whether we can generalise from Scott, who we know poses a danger only to shoddily-proven theorems, to more general arrest situations. I think the answer is clearly yes, as the Austrian law shows. Moreover, I would bet that in Germany and the UK the police procedure is similar to the Austrian one, and that even in more dangerous countries like France or Belgium the generic Scott wouldn&#8217;t be handcuffed.</p>\n<p>A final point about escalation: I think it is obvious that there is an escalation from talking to someone to handcuffing them. Another story that might be relevant: several years ago, I was driving at night in middle-of-nowhere, Brazil. The police was looking for a thief that had just committed armed robbery and was fleeing in a car of the same model and colour than mine. They stopped my car, and ordered me to face the wall with the hands over my had, as they angrily shouted questions at me. I was so scared and confused that I didn&#8217;t really understand what was going on, and followed my instinct of looking at the person who is talking to me. Bad idea. The police officer had the gun in his hand already, but luckily made the correct judgement that I was not about to pull a gun on him, and did not shoot me. I think if this had happened in the US I wouldn&#8217;t be writing here tonight.</p>\n<p>Going back to the airport, I don&#8217;t doubt that in the shock of being handcuffed I would flail around, which would be interpreted as resisting arrest, and things would go downhill from there.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Mateus Arajo", "published": "2018-08-14 01:04:38+00:00", "title": "By: Mateus Ara\u00fajo"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<blockquote><p> To me, this seems like an interesting illustration of the difference between the \u201coriginal\u201d leftism rooted in Enlightenment ideals</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;d just call that liberalism, Scott.

Like &#8220;those policemen that handcuffed Scott were following standard operating procedures&#8221;. In addition I see you use left wing sources to confirm your beliefs. Not the best way to show your analysis is impartial.</p>\n<p>1) The IG is part of the government dear. It&#8217;s not like hiring some external party who has access to relevant information. It&#8217;s government investigating itself. It&#8217;s like you know, some corporation that commits securities fraud telling the SEC: don&#8217;t send your investigators here, our internal people will conduct an investigation and will send you their report. I can&#8217;t believe anyone, including committed liberals, buys any argument based on government investigating itself. Apparently you don&#8217;t understand how large bureaucracies protect themselves. In the case of the targeting of the Tea Party groups by the IRS, the Department of Justice agreed to a settlement. Giving a leftist outlet opinion that supports your own preconceived opinion might work when you talk to other liberals, but it doesn&#8217;t work here. So &#8220;why did the Trump administration (not the Obama administration) settle these lawsuits and give the right-wing groups piles of taxpayer money&#8221; because the Obama administration was corrupt to admit any of its own wrong doing. I am amazed that I have to explain this!</p>\n<p>2)  You are mixing apples and oranges here. The hacking of the DNC/Podesta files was done by a third party (who exactly we don&#8217;t know because Wikileaks -whom I give more credibility than any state actor including -actually particularly- the United States government- denies that their source is a state actor). Unless you live in a world where nefarious spy government agencies are run by angels (I don&#8217;t live in that world), it&#8217;s hard to conclude anything other than DNC/Podesta were hacked by the third party and that evil US spying agencies are trying to assign blame to Russia. And in the case of Podesta, his using a weak password had a lot to do with the hacking. I am talking about, on the other hand, the US government spying on a US political campaign. Very different. All information we have available at this point suggests an attempt at spying the Trump campaign through Carter Page. The FBI even went as far as leaking part of the fabricated dossier, generate news about it and use said news to give further ammunition to the FISA court. This is the kind of things the US government spy agencies have done for years (check operation MK Ultra for example or the dirty tricks employed by J. Edgar Hoover).</p>\n<p>3) and 4) they were fired by Trump sure, and he made the nation a big favor for getting rid of such corrupt individuals who had been making a living out of our tax dollars. </p>\n<p>5) Anyone of us commits, on average, 3 felonies a day. Nobody was ever sent to jail for what Dinesh did. If you want a technical explanation as to why what the Obama administration did was political corruption of the first order, here is somebody explaining it better than me <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/dinesh-dsouza-pardon-just/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/dinesh-dsouza-pardon-just/</a> . It comes from a Never Trumper, so hardly suspect of being blindly loyal to Trump. </p>\n<p>Finally,</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have no more interest in responding to you than to the Flat Earth Society, not because there are not powerful responses to all this nonsense but because rational people would never fall into such nonsense to begin with, and trying to argue rationally with irrational people is a fool\u2019s mission.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Treating disagreement with your dogmatic liberal views as membership in the Flat Earth Society just confirms what I have been saying all along: you live in a liberal bubble immune to reasoning when it comes to anyone who tries to challenge your political dogmas. One thing you don&#8217;t seem to understand clearly is the difference between personal beliefs, facts , the way prosecution decisions are made and the law. When it comes to actual guilt, most of us could potentially be prosecuted for a long list of dirt because we live in an over criminalized society. Proprietorial discretion is the idea pf the prerogative prosecutors have when it comes to using the resources at their disposal to prosecute those crimes. They can pick and choose as they see fit (this is the legal theory Obama used to justify DACA and other similar programs that benefit illegal immigrants). The notion that the decisions on who to prosecute are made in the vacuum, irrespective of political context and according to some predetermined impartial algorithm is very naive. Thus both the decision to prosecute Dinesh and the decision to give a pass to Hillary Clinton were politically motivated and on both cases there is evidence in the public domain that indeed politics played a role. If your personal beliefs are aligned with Obama&#8217;s you see these decisions as fair. If they are not -and mine certainly aren&#8217;t- it&#8217;s perfectly legitimate to see both decisions as politically motivated and corrupt.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2018-08-14 01:32:55+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Mateus,</p>\n<p>I am sort of bending over backward here to try to have a rational discussion of what are difficult issues, and I can&#8217;t understand why you are refusing.

I&#8217;m pretty sure that every procedure would have called for the Brazilian police to shoot me in that encounter a few years ago, and I&#8217;m happy they used their judgement instead.
