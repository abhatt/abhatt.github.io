He shared with the Communists a vision of a society without religion. As a Christian believer, I definitely don&#8217;t think such a world is a good idea. Surely, Russell was probably willing to give the Communists a pass initially despite the fact it is unquestionable that Karl Marx&#8217;s original vision included the use of political violence to reach the goal of an atheist society. Many contemporary people in the humanities had a better moral compass than him. I understand that Bertrand Russell is some sort of demigod among the atheistic intelligentsia but you have to understand too that outside that world, he doesn&#8217;t enjoy much respect beyond his work as logician. If you want a contemporary reference who had all figured out with respect to both Communism and Nazism, read the work of Tolkien in his capacity as public intellectual. He didn&#8217;t need to see empirical horrors to despise both Communism and Nazism. Even among today&#8217;s atheistic intelligentsia you have better guides than Russell. You don&#8217;t have to be a Christian to reach the conclusion -that escaped Russell- that Jurgen Habermas reached that the Western values of equality, love and justice do not come from Karl Marx but from the Judeo-Christian tradition.

There were both Communists and Nazis among them, and I do not respect the personal option of embracing either from these intellectuals.

I do not consider the labels &#8220;Nazi&#8221; and &#8220;neo Nazi&#8221; to be equivalent. With &#8220;neo Nazi&#8221; we are talking about a bunch of losers, like the Charlottesville&#8217;s killer, who perpetrate or threaten to perpetrate randoms act of violence which, sometimes as in Charlottesville, result in murder. As horrific as these acts of violence are, I have personally nothing to fear from neo-Nazis in 2017 America. I know where they are or where they threaten to be with one of their farcical demonstrations and they are easy to avoid. </p>\n<p>For a contemporary version of &#8220;Nazi&#8221; thinking, I would point to people like William Shockley or James Watson. These two go beyond white supremacy. If people like them every gained political power, they would enact Nazi policies like those we saw in Nazi Germany but perhaps using more sanitized ways, such as high bonuses for people to go voluntary sterilization, abortion -as Iceland is doing to eliminate Down Syndrome people <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2017/08/27/why-are-we-trying-to-eliminate-people-with-down-syndrome\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torontosun.com/2017/08/27/why-are-we-trying-to-eliminate-people-with-down-syndrome</a> &#8211; or euthanasia to ensure that only non-undesirables populate the Earth. Nazism is at its core social Darwinism, ie, the survival of the fittest. I definitely fear these &#8220;Nazi&#8221; thinkers way more. And if you want to find them, all you need to do is to attend a high profile academic conference or meeting that includes members of NAS or NAE and pay attention to what they say when they believe that they are talking among themselves and nobody else is listening.

As I mentioned above, my current thinking is that these two qualities are orthogonal (and I would say even continuous, not discrete). In the bivariate graph (intellect, ethics) you can find all sorts of people, and that&#8217;s OK because human beings are complicated. Even Einstein -who is generally portrayed as the best of both- was at the very minimum an avowed adulterer, and some would even say a bad father to his children, although the latter is still under contention. </p>\n<p>I see the reference you mention as an attempt to clean Heisenberg&#8217;s legacy. These are draft letters that Bohr never send describing his side of the story that your article refers to,</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200208/viewpoint-seitz.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200208/viewpoint-seitz.cfm</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;While we do not know full details about their discussions, the record makes it clear that Heisenberg brought up &#8211; in what appears to be a heavy-handed way &#8211; two issues that were guaranteed to raise Bohr&#8217;s ire. Since German victory in the war now seemed assured, Heisenberg suggested that Bohr takes steps to promote friendly relations between Denmark and Germany. Bohr could only have been incensed at the proposal. He was a very loyal Dane, a notable distinguished father-figure in his country, and he well knew that his fellow citizens were outraged by the German occupation. The notion that Bohr would support any official form of friendly relationship was simply beyond comprehension under the circumstances. On the more personal side, Bohr was partly Jewish and must have despised the German leadership for promoting the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws.</p>\n<p>In a similar manner, Heisenberg stated that he and a group of colleagues were in the process of developing a nuclear chain reaction based on the fission of uranium. If we can trust Bohr&#8217;s memory a decade and a half later, Heisenberg implied that he had a fairly complete understanding of the steps needed to achieve such a reaction, but would not go into details. He also stated that work of this kind would ultimately lead to the development of some form of nuclear bomb that would probably play a crucial role in bringing the war to an end if they succeeded. He could not at that time have realized how fully prescient he was, since the Pacific war was far away and the US was not yet engaged. Clearly such an admission would have angered Bohr at least as much as the proposal that he cooperate with the existing German government.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Who do you believe? Based on everything we know about how cozy not only many German scientists, but many prominent German intellectuals, had been with the Nazi government, I believe Niels Bohr. </p>\n<p>After World War II was over there was a great effort from many former Nazis to clean their past and I see what you bring up as part of that effort.</p>\n<p>I remember when I first learned about Nazi Germany in high school, I just saw it as part of something I had to know by heart to gain a good grade in my history class. Years later, like in my 20s, when I began to think deeper about these issues it seemed incomprehensible to me that anything of that sort could have happened. We are all &#8220;good people&#8221; after all. I never had a &#8220;negationism&#8221; phase, but I did have a skeptical phase with the official version of the events I was told because, after all, history is always written by the winners. Then, in my early 30s, I stumbled into this documentary <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nazis:_A_Warning_from_History\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nazis:_A_Warning_from_History</a> in Netflix (I watched all episodes of it). Everything that the official history tells about Nazi Germany is true, including that most Germans were completely oblivious to the suffering of the Jews and other undesirables. We should not fall for any attempts to minimize or sanitize what happened there. It was humanity at its worst and there is no other way to see that. Heisenberg was not the Oskar Schindler of Nazi Germany&#8217;s nuclear program.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2017-08-30 16:05:49+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Hi Scott,</p>\n<p>If you could you tolerate another &#8220;good naive commies&#8221; discussion, I&#8217;d like to challenge the assertion that they exist. If I understood you correctly, you distinguish Nazis from Marxists in that Nazi vision of ideal future is inherently abhorrent while Marxist vision is not, so one can imagine a nice person who is not familiar with the history of Marxist regime, never read Marx, but supports Marxism based solely on the proclaimed vision of the ideal future it promises.</p>\n<p>I think you completely misinterpret what drives modern Marxist: it&#8217;s not charity, it&#8217;s *envy*, an instinct as base as the hate that drives Nazis. Here&#8217;s a glimpse into that: &#8220;Millennials &#8230; Prefer Venezuela&#8217;s Food Lines Over America&#8217;s Income Inequality&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.dailywire.com/news/20027/watch-woke-millennials-say-theyd-prefer-venezuelas-james-barrett\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dailywire.com/news/20027/watch-woke-millennials-say-theyd-prefer-venezuelas-james-barrett</a><br />\nThey don&#8217;t want to improve the life of poor, they want to make sure that nobody is better off than them. </p>\n<p>There is a joke about the devil offering a person whatever he wanted under one condition: the person&#8217;s neighbor would get twice more. And the person asks for a semi-fatal heart attack. This is what Marxist envy is: you don&#8217;t want a society that&#8217;s better off on average or better off for the poor; you want to make sure that nobody sticks out, and that&#8217;s more important than anything yet.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s one of the jokes I&#8217;ve heard as a child back in USSR:<br />\nThe Devil inspects the Hell and sees that one of frying pans is not guarded. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t they escape?&#8221; &#8211; he asked. &#8220;These are Nazis, they were ordered to sit there and nobody dares to disobey.&#8221; &#8211; was the answer. The Devil proceeds and finds another unguarded frying pan, and here&#8217;s the explanation: &#8220;These are the communists; whenever somebody is trying to escape the others pull him back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got to add that IMO the root of the problem, although extreme in Marxist minds, is also present in mainstream American left: it&#8217;s prioritizing equality over prosperity. Democrats are hammering the idea that equality trumps everything for quite a while. Marxist took that a step further by asserting that equal misery is better than unequal prosperity. And that step further is in my eyes is inherently evil.</p>\n<p>You probably heard the horrible story about a former chimp owner who got brought a birthday cake to the place where chimps were kept. Alas, there wasn&#8217;t enough cake for *all* chimps there, so he got most viciously attacked:<br />\n<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/05/local/me-chimp5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/05/local/me-chimp5</a></p>\n<p>Why did the chimps attack somebody who brought some of them a cake? He didn&#8217;t take anything away from them. The answer is obvious: in the eyes of the chimps he did take something away from them: he decrease the amount of equality in the group. </p>\n<p>But these were just chimps; would people wouldn&#8217;t behave like that, even equality-prioritizing Marxists? Alas they would, and they did. Russian and Chinese revolution proved that. And here&#8217;s a quite hilarious case of chimp-like behavior from 2017: a baker in Russia decided to help poor by distributing bread for free in his home town. Alas, there wasn&#8217;t enough bread for everybody.
