Ever since &#8220;judicial supremacy&#8221; became the accepted view on judicial decisions, liberals have made sure that their nominees were reliable liberals. There hasn&#8217;t been any David Souters or Anthony Kennedys among the left&#8217;s nominees. Ginsburg, Kagan and Sotomayor are as hard left as they come. In the case of Ginsburg she is on the record bashing the nominee of the Republican Party during the 2016 election, something that was totally unprecedented in terms of protocol until she broke it.</p>\n<p>The right is now playing the same game, and understandably so, the political party who believes to have a God given right to political power at any cost is going to let it go without a fight.

There is already a procedural vote set for Friday that will force senators to vote. The word of Lindsey Graham is that the confirmation of Kavanaugh will be the issue used to excite Republican voters in November if he fails to be confirmed within a week, something that won&#8217;t play well in states like North Dakota or West Virginia that now have Democratic senators but whose voters support Trump in overwhelming margins.

There are a lot of people who know what it&#8217;s like. Everything she said rang true &#8212; including the details of 80s midatlantic rich-kid party culture. (Swetnick got too much wrong there and had other problems; I didn&#8217;t believe her.) Her little tiny girl voice made me sad, but I understand where that comes from, too. </p>\n<p>I think the midterms will be unremarkable, that the Republicans will view it as endorsement, and that we&#8217;ll go over some cliffs. My sense throughout this, though, is that it kind of doesn&#8217;t matter, because the fireworks I&#8217;m seeing in a generational sense are just spectacular, and the demographics are just not on the GOP&#8217;s side. (Even before you talk age, white right-wing Christian men make up a pretty small slice of the population, under 20%. You go looking for the millennial/Z slice of that and it&#8217;s a minority slice, and they tend not to marry as much as the X/Boomer men did, meaning they don&#8217;t have so many women there to back them up and stand by them.)  I think this process has catalyzed things that would&#8217;ve taken decades to get to otherwise, just because it&#8217;s been so concentrated and so very visible in front of the faces of young women and men &#8212; so many of whom seem to be much sharper about all this than I would have been at their ages. And the young men are not unimportant there. So I think that in 20, 25 years, this place is going to look radically different in terms of gender representation, discourse, and power distribution &#8212; and as gender goes, so goes race in this country. We&#8217;ve been heading strongly in that direction anyhow for the last, what, 50 years, but I think this week&#8217;s imparted a certain determination to young people who&#8217;re already pissed off about what&#8217;s being done with their futures. </p>\n<p>I have actually not felt this optimistic in a long time. I do believe we&#8217;re in for a bad time immediately, but I&#8217;ve not felt this good about the country in&#8230;maybe ever. I&#8217;m seeing a lot of democracy. It&#8217;s very interesting how the idea of the institutions is stronger than the view of the current state of the institutions. Rather like the way the idea of America is actually more important than the country itself is.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2018-10-04 20:17:32+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>The substance of Amy&#8217;s comment (<i>circa</i> <a href=\"#comment-1788762\" rel=\"nofollow\">#64</a>), in regard to sexual assault and the Kavanaugh nomination, holds true equally,  in regard to denial of alcoholic&nbsp;/ substance abuse and the Kavanaugh nomination.</p>\n<p>Such denial is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3183644\" rel=\"nofollow\">sadly common</a>, as&nbsp;all-too-many alcoholic families know.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, that Kavanaugh seriously abused alcohol has been factually established.
