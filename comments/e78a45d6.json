But I don&#8217;t remember the details.  If I remember to, I&#8217;ll ask again next time and get back to you.</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b> It&#8217;s worse than that.  As it turns out, Ed Farhi proved that the above-mentioned condition <i>implies</i> that the spectral gap will be exponentially small, basically because it triggers the BBBV lower bound for the Grover search problem.  So then you use this method to calculate the gap, and lo and behold, you find out that the gap is exponentially small.  It would be a bit like if you had a fast factoring algorithm, but it only worked for positive integers N satisfying certain conditions, and those conditions turned out to imply that N was prime.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2014-09-08 17:05:49+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott 38: Thanks for checking that out.
