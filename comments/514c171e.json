But more generally to thank the community for the support they gave Michael during his, all too short, career.  It was clear by the time that he went off to college that Michael, more than anything, wished to become part of that community and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant research in the field.   At the time he doubted that he had the talent to do so. (Those who knew him recognize that he had a tendency to undervalue his abilities).  The absolute joy he had in research is a consolation to Marie and me. </p>\n<p>Michael was in many ways unusual.  His over-the-top exuberance, way of doing calculations while walking around muttering, absolute intellectual honesty, loud and fast way of proceeding when he was talking about interesting things as well as various personal quirks involving food, sartorial style and grooming might have made dealing with him difficult.  Instead of being put off by this, the community really embraced him and he became completely part of a world that he longed to be part of.  In addition to the very large number of people with whom Michael interacted on science but did not actively collaborate on a project, Michael had nearly 30 distinct collaborators on publications at the time of his death;  in addition, there were several others with whom he was collaborating when he died that had not yet lead to publications (apparently, it was notoriously difficult to get Michael to finish writing papers).    This is extraordinary for a 25-year-old researcher in this field, and shows how deeply connected Michael was with the community. </p>\n<p>Scott writes that he was frankly mystified by Michael\u2019s death.  While the facts are not entirely known, there is no real mystery, just tragedy.  Michael died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d according to the Berkeley police, meaning not suicide or homicide. The exact medical cause remains officially unknown, pending the results of various tests by the coroner\u2019s office.  But the coroner\u2019s officer who investigated the case said that there are indications that his death may well have been due to an undiagnosed and untreated case of type-1 diabetes.  In any case, whatever the underlying cause, we know that he had severe vomiting and diarrhea and that he did not call for help, either from friends or 911.  Presumably, he thought he could just tough it out\u2014as young men are wont to do.   We will know more at a later date when the test results come in.  In truth his death was almost certainly due due to a number of random and unrelated things.  Principal among these was he was living alone and there was nobody to call for help when his condition become grave, but there were many others.   The random nature of the events leading to his death makes it all the more tragic. </p>\n<p>Scott also asked if there was any cause Michael cared about if people wish to make a donation in his memory.   If people wish to make a donation in Michael&#8217;s memory, a good choice is givedirectly.com .  Michael was very interested in the Effective Altruism movement and spoke about it with many people.  Givedirectly.org is a charity that he believed exemplified the spirit of that movement.  As its name suggests, It gives money directly to very poor people in Africa.  There is often reluctance on aid givers&#8217; part to do this, due to a fear that the money will be squandered.  Givedirectly rigorous monitors the use of the money it gives and the money is, in fact, being used wisely.   Recently, Marie and I communicated with Michael about charitable giving and he recommended Givedirectly.org to us.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Tom Cohen", "published": "2017-10-02 18:19:31+00:00", "title": "By: Tom Cohen"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Tom #16: Thank you so much for writing here.
