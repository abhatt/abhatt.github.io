The effort only scales linearly with the number of people, not exponentially or anything crazy like that.</p>\n<p>In practice, the difficulty is obvious: the more people you let in, the greater the chance that <i>one</i> of them will upload the secret to WikiLeaks.  Then, ironically, you&#8217;ll have overshot your target: while you &#8220;merely&#8221; wanted a thousand or a million people (all of whom you were keeping track of) in on your secret, now the <i>entire world</i> is in on it.</p>\n<p>In the same way, the more particles you entangle, the greater the chance that one of them will overshoot the target, entangling itself with the measuring apparatus, the air molecules and EM field in the room, etc.  In which case, your first response might be &#8220;great! even more entanglement than I&#8217;d bargained for!&#8221;  But once the entanglement has spread so far that you can&#8217;t keep track of it, it&#8217;s just as if a measurement has been made, and you no longer have any hope of doing an interference experiment that would <i>reveal</i> the entanglement.</p>\n<p>Now, the whole point of quantum fault-tolerance is to spread the entanglement &#8220;secret&#8221; more cleverly among the particles, so that even if (say) any 1% of the particles get entangled with the environment, the secret is still secure with the other 99%&#8212;and indeed, the secret can then be &#8220;fortified&#8221; so that it remains secure even if <i>another</i> 1% of the particles get entangled with the environment, etc.  If and when quantum fault-tolerance becomes a reality, there should no longer be any practical limit on the number of particles that can be shown in experiments to be entangled (the current limit, I think, is a few billion particles, e.g. in solid-state and superconducting experiments).</p>\n<p>If there <i>were</i> a limit (not coming from cosmology) on the number of particles you could entangle, then something would have to be wrong either with quantum mechanics itself, or with some other extremely basic assumption of modern physics.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2014-02-05 15:55:46+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Rahul #60:</p>\n<ul>Is it proven than a QC-based attack [on lattice-based crypto] is impossible / hard?
