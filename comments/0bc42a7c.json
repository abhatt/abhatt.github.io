Moreover, there are very strong connections between all three. I would also mention the Thurston program in low dimensional geometry which has been the most successful in terms of implementation, the related Schramm program as a major new insight in probability which is also strongly related to conformal field theory and has revolutionized the field and the work of Gromov, again  in geometry. Europeans and definitely Russians played a major role in all these developments.<br />\nAll these have up to now, essentially zero influence outside math and they are all really difficult, so few mathematicians, even in number theory, representation theory, geometry and probability actively work on them, much as most computer scientists dont try to prove lower bounds.</p>\n<p>I think what worries sowa and others is that even fewer people will want to work in these challenging areas in the future.<br />\nI dont support sowa otherwise, I think Gowers and Tao are awesome</p>\n]]>", "author": "eitan bachmat", "published": "2017-10-16 14:41:12+00:00", "title": "By: eitan bachmat"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Oh, and the rise of ergodic theory, Furstenberg, Margulis, Ratner, Eskin-Mirzakhani, Mcmullen&#8230; (closer to Gowers and Tao)</p>\n]]>", "author": "eitan bachmat", "published": "2017-10-16 14:45:12+00:00", "title": "By: eitan bachmat"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>To add to #142 there are several important research agenda relating topology and complexity and let me mention one.
