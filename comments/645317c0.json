[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Richard #73: No matter how much one loves the free market, the basic argument for nationalizing healthcare is that it&#8217;s inconsistent with medical ethics (or with human conscience as we understand it in the modern world) to refuse to treat a dying person who shows up at the emergency room because they can&#8217;t pay.  Which means: one way or another, society <i>is</i> going to end up subsidizing poor people&#8217;s healthcare.  But given that premise, we can actually <i>save</i> money over the long term if we can treat people before they get to the emergency room.  At least, that is what the experience of every industrialized country on earth besides the US has shown.</p>\n<p>Now, could one provide that healthcare more efficiently than through the Byzantine complexities of Obamacare?  Certainly.  Personally, I&#8217;d support single-payer&#8212;or simpler and more elegant still, just a Universal Basic Income that would let everyone afford healthcare and other life necessities for themselves, in a market that&#8217;s otherwise as free and unregulated as we can make it.</p>\n<p>But then we&#8217;re back to the parable of the guy who cuts open people&#8217;s skulls and tries to rewire their visual systems because he realizes evolution could&#8217;ve designed them more efficiently.

They would have gotten my support if for example, legislators would have chosen to decrease the amount given as &#8220;tuition waiver&#8221; from overhead costs, forcing universities to look at spending their endowments to pay for the things they now pay for with overhead costs. So punishing the students is as tone deaf as it comes. And to make it more specific, I would find a legislative way to ensure that only the wealthy universities (like Harvard or MIT) get punished, sparing the public ones from this. In turn, such a measure would probably increase the competitiveness of said public schools.</p>\n<p>Punishing the misuse of public funds to push for liberal intelligentsia is warranted.

Some of them are historic. The issue of religious freedom was one of the pillars on which our country was founded. So much so that it is included in the first amendment. To be clear, I am not making the argument that the US constitution guarantees (or supports) public subsidizing of churches, what I am saying is that the issue of freedom of religion and getting any government interference out of the way from the individual&#8217;s right to practice the religion of their choice or no religion at all is at the core of the American value system, ie, something anybody calling himself &#8220;American&#8221; agrees. Subsidizing universities or mass media to spread a particular ideology isn&#8217;t. You would be in better ground if you would be asking that all newspapers and media get the subsidies that NPR receives from the tax payer, for example.</p>\n<p>Second: the loudest voices opposing the end of government&#8217;s subsidies to the spread of liberal propaganda (at universities or via mass media) tend to be quite wealthy. So it begs the question as to why any money from the taxpayer at all should be spent subsidizing this when the aforementioned Silicon Valley and Seattle lords that share said liberal values would have the money to make up for any revenue losses. Churches on the other hand -and this is true of both left leaning and right leaning churches/synagogues/mosques/temples/etc) would generally be unable to survive without their tax exempt status. You can find me probably some megachurch here and there that might be able to but property tax alone would put out of business many churches, particularly those located in areas with expensive real estate.</p>\n<p>To me is really an apples to oranges comparison. We should subsidize -as a society- those activities that we agree are for the common good, not for the good of those who vote liberal. Subsidizing churches, as long as we believe that freedom of religion is a common good- makes sense. Subsidizing Harvard so it can intoxicate the minds of the next generation of sociology students doesn&#8217;t, from my point of view.

Furthermore, those truths have to be <i>political</i> in some way; at the very least those who want to suppress them will almost certainly have political motivations. Since you wisely neglected to mention exactly <i>what</i> truths you were thinking of, we are left with only guesswork. But I think we can deduce a few things.</p>\n<p><b>If these truths were only distasteful to the political Right, there should be no hesitation whatsoever on your part to come out and say it.</b> Why should you be afraid? All the institutions and people with any power to fire you (or me), or get you (or me) ostracized, are on the Left. Let Fox News rant, everybody knows that Hannity is a twit (and he is, for the record); in the end, in your circles, it will only win you friends for your willingness to <i>&#8216;speak truth to power&#8217;</i>.</p>\n<p>There are no views sufficiently Leftist to justify the Kolmogorov Option. Chomsky is a respected professor, after all; so is Billy Ayers, who was an actual terrorist back in the day and allegedly planned for mass murder when his revolution succeeded. Open Marxists are found everywhere in the &#8220;social sciences&#8221;. The only truths which could necessitate the Kolmogorov Option are those the <i>Left</i> might want to suppress. It seems hard to escape the conclusion that by writing <i>The Kolmogorov Option</i>, you conceded my basic premise.</p>\n<p><b>Indeed, it didn&#8217;t escape my notice that you never actually disputed my points about propaganda and censorship.</b> Instead, you decided to go all Dr. Freud on me.

My motivation has nothing to do with <i>&#8216;wanting suffering&#8217;</i> or <i>&#8216;resenting intellectuals&#8217;</i>, and it&#8217;s troubling that even someone as committed to reasoned debate as you could slip into this kind of ugly rhetoric.</p>\n<p><b>I want the Leftist censorship and intimidation to end</b>; indeed, to the extent that &#8220;suffering of intellectuals&#8221; factors into my thinking, I believe that this will greatly <i>reduce</i> it. For years I believed that academia could correct itself &#8211; that truth would win, the moderates would fend off the radicals, etc. You say I should <i>&#8220;work tirelessly to convince the intellectuals that [I&#8217;m] right&#8221;</i>, and that&#8217;s precisely what I was &#8211; and am &#8211; doing.</p>\n<p>I mean, what else could I be doing here? </p>\n<p><b>But the radicals keep gaining, and their trophy wall is replete with moderate heads, which they claimed not through debate but through intimidation and threats</b> &#8211; Nicholas and Erika Christakis, Bret Weinstein, and Larry Summers come to mind.

Scott: nanny-state UBI for those who throw their money away on drugs and hookers? We already do that sort of thing with welfare; Medicaid, WIC, SNAP, TANF, LIHEAP, and housing vouchers are all separate, as are Head Start and free-lunch programs. Heavy restrictions on all that money. (The separations are partly, but only partly, paternalistic.) You might argue it&#8217;s why we bother with Soc Sec &#8212; when countries go free-market on old-age pensions, you wind up with a lot of destitute old people. Not always because people failed to take good care of their money, either.

With a tuition remission, someone else (e.g. a grant) is paying the tuition for a student, and the university is still receiving the tuition revenue.  With a tuition waiver, the university isn&#8217;t receiving the tuition revenue and no one is making a payment.  </p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s clear that the intent is to tax students on the value of tuition remissions (where a grant pays the tuition to the university.)

It is not against intellectuals as people nor am I suggesting that anybody takes any form of coercive action against them.</p>\n<p>Once I got this out of the way, to me the debate of subsidizing certain forms of higher education, certainly the one targeted by this bill -although they have the wrong target when they seek to punish the students themselves- is the following: if you look at this graph <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/graduate/trendsphds-p-12.2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.aip.org/sites/default/files/statistics/graduate/trendsphds-p-12.2.pdf</a> you see that starting in the early 1970s there has been a sharp decrease of US citizens enrolled in PhD physics programs of the kind that are typically funded via federal government subsidies. Increasingly Americans have decided that being poor for the sake of science is not such a great idea after all and have been increasingly avoiding graduate school in the case of physics, that graph shows. That graph also shows that non Americans have been replacing them in increasing numbers since in the case of physics. These numbers <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/12/new-report-shows-dependence-us-graduate-programs-foreign-students\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/07/12/new-report-shows-dependence-us-graduate-programs-foreign-students</a> would seem to suggest that what happened in physics is probably also happening in other STEM fields. Therefore, the question is, why should the American taxpayer continue to subsidize the training of foreigners. I get why the aforementioned Seattle and Silicon Valley lords want this (a constant supply of highly qualified and cheap labor force slaved under the H1B visa and similar). I get why professors like this (professors need students to justify the university having them on the payroll). The question is why the taxpayer -instead of the companies that most directly benefit from the bargain or their owners- need to continue to subsidize this.</p>\n<p>This connection between the constant supply of foreigners supplied by American universities that favor mostly Big Tech has been noticed not only by Trump or Republicans, but by people who cannot be accused of being Republican nutjobs such as this guy <a href=\"http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html</a> , see this <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-h-1b_us_5890d86ce4b0522c7d3d84af\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-h-1b_us_5890d86ce4b0522c7d3d84af</a> . </p>\n<p>So that&#8217;s the point. If the different people who want to keep the current system are unhappy with those who seek to remove tax incentives to keep it alive, perhaps the solution is to beg for money to a different patron. As I said, it is not clear to me that the policies that served our nation well in the aftermath of WWII and during the cold war are now equally effective. Certainly, large numbers of American students think otherwise and refuse to enroll in PhD programs that don&#8217;t offer a clear path to a better life. Also it seems that certain Asian countries are now the biggest suppliers of students to the programs that in another time attracted mostly Americans. There is no obligation that the American tax payer subsidize their education, particularly when then companies like Apple/Google/Facebook/Microsoft -who benefit most from this system- then use every loophole in the book to avoid returning the favor to the American taxpayer.</p>\n<p>All this has nothing to do with the second coming of Lenin, Pol Pot or Mao.

Many others will ride the postdoc carousel till they can&#8217;t anymore, leaving them stranded in midlife. I know this comes as an amazement to many with PhDs, but outside academia and a very few hiring areas, a PhD is a *liability*. It says, &#8220;I am expensive, snooty, and have better things to do with my brain. If you hire me I&#8217;ll be difficult and wish I were somewhere else.&#8221; I used to watch PhDs get stiffarmed routinely in favor of recent BA grads in tough job markets.

(I understand these right are curtailed in the US in places of employment Are graduate students considered employees?).</p>\n<p>Next: if you&#8217;re going to draw analogies to the Canadian system, please ensure you provide salient facts around it. One big difference is that universities in Canada cannot charge government research grants overhead. We do not give tuition waivers in the same way that US universities do. At my instiution, for example, we award research assistantships; they pay tuition themselves. Students are taxed on this   assistantship. Tax deductions allow them to deduct some amount per year from their declared income. Crucially, apart from &#8216;professional&#8217; graduate degrees (MBA&#8217;s, data-science MS degrees), tuition for grad school is really inexpensive in Canada. So the deductions go a long way.</p>\n<p>And as far as squawking around the removal of tax credits etc &#8211; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve been closely following the mass outrage in Canada over the removal of the federal education and textbook tax credits? No? There was little; that&#8217;s because taxpayers in Canada more or less prefer their tax dollars to go directly to holding tuitions down. (Also, we have very few private universities). </p>\n<p>All-in-all, the parallels are only worth drawing if you also describe the difference $\\|1- \\(US,Canada)\\|$ in a norm and inner product of your choosing. But you at least need to let us know what norm, and what inner product. </p>\n<p>Perhaps it is different in the US, but there is a _routine_ amount of subversive recording in Canadian universities without the consent of people involved. Lectures are routinely recorded on phones without prior consent. And as for the incident you describe in Laurier (perhaps also highlight the Canadian mass of outrage over the university&#8217;s actions?) &#8211; is your intent to use the anecdote to establish evidence in support of your claim? And may I presume you are using the anecdote as a representative of a large sample?</p>\n<p>If so, for truth-seeking purposes perhaps you could also point us to such anecdotes where, say, left-leaning students or academics are surreptitiously recorded, and then a mess ensures? I ask this in sincerity. Perhaps no/very few such anecdotes exist. Me, I work at a university where a colleague has given evidence in court, under oath, that he believes homosexuals will go to hell. He&#8217;s still here, and last I checked, rather far up the food chain. He offers courses telling students that are about the primacy of religion. This is not intended as a representative anecdote, nor as evidence; I&#8217;m merely establishing that absent more information regarding the purported powerful liberal cabals (which I&#8217;d love to join), this stuff is mystifying to me.</p>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly: whether or not universities are left-leaning liberal institutions, you have not truly made the case that the proposed tax bill has any positive structural intent. If you are making this claim, it would be helpful to see the wording in the bill that establishes it.

I get why these companies want the rest of us to fund the existence of said talent pool, but it is less clear how the rest of the country benefits. If these companies didn&#8217;t have this talent pool, they would still employ large numbers of Americans, only they would have to pay higher wages. The existence of this underpaid talent pool is one of the reasons American students avoid STEM education altogether for more lucrative alternatives. These are not companies of yesteryear, like say Intel, that created jobs for both the highly educated and the less highly educated. These companies enrich a particular segment of the American population relying on the infrastructure that the rest of the taxpayers fund with their taxes.</p>\n<p>Which takes me to Apple&#8217;s case. Sorry, I am not sympathetic to them. Apple would not exist in its current form if it were a China headquartered corporation. It relies on the American law system -ask Samsung about that and how Apple has been less successful in other jurisdictions against Samsung- to protect its intellectual property. It relies on the political stability that exists in Silicon Valley, which would not exist without the most powerful army on Earth that is staffed, for the most part, with redneck Southerners. Finally, it relies on the American soft power to market itself to the outside world. The most pathetic vignette I have ever watched is that of a European attending an anti-American demonstration who takes a pic with an iPhone, proudly shares the pic of the demonstration on Twitter or Facebook and then goes to McDonald&#8217;s after the demonstration to discuss how evil America is, all that under the comfort of living in a country that was probably freed from Nazis by American rednecks and that is currently being kept safe by American tax dollars and the rednecks deployed in Germany. </p>\n<p>I hope you get the idea. I don&#8217;t think that there is a very good argument on the table by those of your side to support the existing system of incentives at large. At least Trump is trying to change the system so that companies like Apple have incentives to bring their dollars to the US to invest it here. If you think his efforts are not having any effect, think again <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/07/26/foxconns-10b-wisconsin-lcd-factory-to-supply-sharp-not-apple\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/07/26/foxconns-10b-wisconsin-lcd-factory-to-supply-sharp-not-apple</a> .</p>\n<p>The thing about Trump is that unlike his predecessors (the two Bushes, Clinton and Obama), he understand business and -as a billionaire himself-, he cannot be persuaded by fancy vacations in one of Richard Branson&#8217;s properties -as it was the case with Obama, for example. No wonder that the aforementioned Seattle and Silicon Valley lords hate him. But there is many of us who love the guy for that very reason.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2017-11-22 17:48:12+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>gatekeepers #147:<br />\na short question &#8211; which are these lucrative options that Americans are picking instead of &#8220;underpaid&#8221; IT sector?

Right now that same system serves a variety of interests (the universities themselves, the professors, the immigrants, some high tech companies, etc). It not clear how it serves the interests of the United States as whole, thus I see nothing wrong in opening discussions as to whether American society benefits, as a whole, from its continuous existence, particularly since the American taxpayer subsidizes it.</p>\n<p>Take for example the case of MBA graduates on F-1 visas. International students continue to be admitted to Harvard, MIT Sloan, Stanford, etc, but they have to cover the entirety of enrollment fees from personal funds, loans or other funds.

Tech salaries are miraculous compared to salaries just about anywhere else. If your actual beef is that the shareholders and owners are making hella more money than the workers do, then&#8230;er, yes. This is how capitalism goes when you don&#8217;t regulate the daylights out of it. </p>\n<p>2.

Good luck to you in finding a tech-salary job with your biochemistry or population-genetics PhD &#8212; you&#8217;ll have to be one of the best out there.</p>\n<p>3. Lucrativeness of other professions: law schools have suffered huge drops in enrollment because the jobs do not exist and the tuitions are large. The usual path for a law student who&#8217;s not off to go take over Dad&#8217;s smalltown practice is to go get eaten alive in the bowels of a giant corporate law firm. The ones who survive will, maybe, do okay, though &#8220;okay&#8221; will still entail round-the-clock work stints. The rest still have to pay off law school somehow.</p>\n<p>4. This is a program for getting non-USian suckers trained and on visas, and we know this because the American kids aren&#8217;t doing STEM so much: Most of the American kids who wander into undergrad biz programs are there (and have always been there) because they don&#8217;t have the intellectual chops for either science or humanities scholarship, and their K12 educations have left them miserably prepared for everything. They have trouble reading and can barely make themselves understood. They&#8217;re going to struggle. Lots will not only not get jobs, but not understand why they&#8217;re not getting jobs.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that universities generally have little idea what &#8220;job skills&#8221; actually are. Few American universities have strong ties to industry, and not for lack of trying; it&#8217;s just that universities are full of&#8230;academics. Even the biz people tend to be academics. Academics are terrific at teaching kids how to do school. But I&#8217;ve been in rooms where people are putting together new programs, and, hand on heart, the least influential people in those rooms are the ones with most clue about the actual jobs that go with those degrees. Those people themselves are, just by virtue of being in that room, drifting further and further from the world they say they&#8217;re preparing the kids for. And that pertains to the graduate programs, too. The professional programs seem to be slightly better about knowing what the profession actually is. </p>\n<p>In some areas that&#8217;s not a bad thing. University is not supposed to be vocational training. University is about learning to think well, or was before it turned into high school remediation. This is the entire mission of the liberal arts. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m careful to tell every crop of new students, and I go on telling them, because it&#8217;s a surprise to them. I just want them to recognize it when they finally see it for themselves.</p>\n<p>As for why more American students don&#8217;t do STEM PhDs:</p>\n<p>1. Beyond the undergrad numbers: yeah, there are plenty who don&#8217;t make the grade. Highly-motivated foreign students generally blow them out of the water. </p>\n<p>2. It&#8217;s not just the money. Becoming a scientist involves a tremendously long apprenticeship and delay of adulthood, 7-10 years v. 3 for law school &#8212; and then once you do get your degree, what do you do? It turns out there aren&#8217;t that many academic jobs. It also turns out that industry doesn&#8217;t need a giant number of PhD scientists, though they do need a lot of workaday BS/MSes. </p>\n<p>3. And then there&#8217;s the fact that in order to get through grad school, you really have to love this stuff and tolerate failure and disappointment exceptionally well, because it&#8217;s going to make your life miserable for at least the next five or six years even if you do love it. I&#8217;ve stopped counting the number of students who tell me they want industry or govt labs because they don&#8217;t want their bosses&#8217; lives, always on the chase for grants, always overwhelmed with work. Lots of kids MS out because they&#8217;re bright enough to see where this is going and they see that it&#8217;s not for them.

Today, Apple creates the latter type of jobs in China, not in the US. Apple, and the high tech lobby, convinced Trump&#8217;s predecessors that selling out American manufacturing to China was inevitable and those predecessors obliged giving China permanent normal trade relations -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_normal_trade_relations . As Trump said, China was only benefiting from having idiots running the US government back then. These globalist freaks were not as successful with their propaganda in the European Union, for example, and Germany remains a manufacturing nation. </p>\n<p>Increasing corporate tax rates will only cause Apple -and the like- to engage in even more aggressive financial engineering of this kind <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/apple-google-microsoft-hold-more-than-336b-overseas-via-legal-tax-loopholes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/apple-google-microsoft-hold-more-than-336b-overseas-via-legal-tax-loopholes/</a> .

If you want to build a building, and the mob demands you employ them to do it (shoddily, and at well above market price) or you&#8217;re not going to live to see it finished, they didn&#8217;t earn your money.

No, American companies should hire whoever does the best job for the lowest cost.  Threatening to sic the government on them if they don&#8217;t is no better than what the mob does.  It&#8217;s theft masquerading as trade &#8212; it&#8217;s corruption.</p>\n<p>I use the word &#8220;corruption&#8221; there because this sort of thing <i>corrupts</i>.  That&#8217;s what happens when you lie about something, you need to <i>maintain</i> the lie, and it distorts and corrupts everything around it.  (And obviously doing this sort of thing also distorts the economy, though I suppose that&#8217;s a different sense of the word.)  Everything becomes confused and tangled together out of a need to keep the fiction going.  Is this job a voluntary market exchange, or is it actually just a transfer of money?  Well, it&#8217;s kind of both bundled into one, trying to fufill two goals at once &#8212; which means it&#8217;s going to be suboptimal at both of them.  But we can&#8217;t admit that, so&#8230;</p>\n<p>Much better is to separate concerns.  Let jobs be jobs and transfers be transfers.  Do each separately, openly, and well.

Because too often I am accused of saying stuff I have never said.</p>\n<p>On the rest of what you say, I am partially in agreement, partially in disagreement. I am a big believer in free markets and in letting the best people earn their way up. At the same time, let&#8217;s not kid ourselves: the free market doesn&#8217;t solve every societal problem. For starters, no country that I am aware of will ever adopt &#8220;free market&#8221; approaches to areas like defense, food supply or energy supply. There is also the issue of people who are born with disabilities, for example. I do not think that the nanny state is a good idea, but I do believe that there is a role for government to provide a safety net for people who have no other sources of help. And yet, the very moment government steps in, it is distorting the proper functioning of the market and creating unworthy winners and undeserving losers. There are areas where this is justified, as much as it pains me to admit. In fact, you can see the current system funding STEM education -particularly at the graduate level- as a government intervention that started during WWII and that continued during the cold war. The problem it sought to address no longer exists -we won the cold war, despite Russian attempts at rewriting history- but the system exists pretty much intact. It is being exploited by the Seattle and Silicon Valley lords to ensure a constant supply of cheap labor towards their industries.</p>\n<p>I think that very few smart people I know are dogmatic about opposing the free market as a phenomenal wealth creation mechanism. Where it gets tricky is when discussing the areas that government should be stepping in. This is where reasonable people disagree and have passionate debates about. We all bring our biases to the discussion and nobody is free of them. Obviously Scott, admittedly, is biased because he has spent his entire professional life in the world of top notch academic research. So he wants it to continue to exist and he comes up with all sorts of rationales as to why it should continue to exist in its current form, subsidized by the American taxpayer. I have my own set of biases which include having seen both said world -during my years as graduate student and from friends who are still there- and having essentially made a living since graduation in the high tech industry. Decades back, the most prominent companies (like AT&T,  IBM or Xerox) believed that having a central research lab staffed by the smartest people they could find was essential to their competitiveness. The world benefited from the inventions produced by Bell Labs, IBM research and Xerox&#8217;s PARC, but said companies reached at some point the conclusion that these labs didn&#8217;t measure up to their promise and essentially dismantled them (Xerox&#8217;s PARC exists as an independent subsidiary but it no longer produces the breakthroughs it produced in the 1970s). The new high tech companies (Cisco, Oracle, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc) proved that it was possible to build unbelievably successful businesses without having to fund said research operations and the idea of having them is no longer popular in high tech. Whether that&#8217;s good or bad for the US as a society in the longer term is a different question. I am of the opinion that it isn&#8217;t and that these new companies should have central research labs if only to return the favor to the society that enabled their success.</p>\n<p>All this to say, that these debates are nuanced and it is never a good idea to impute motives or lack of gray matter to your dialectical opponent when you disagree with his/her arguments.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2017-11-23 15:22:06+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>To recap, you\u2019re saying that foreigners pushed out Americans out of STEM (though, you focus only on Silicon Valley) by lowering the salaries to the point where other careers are more attractive.

Hadn&#8217;t thought of that, but sure, that&#8217;s true. People are weird. No reason not to separate things and make those Rube Goldberg contraptions. That&#8217;s been the main lesson of biochemistry for me, incidentally: nature is a huge believer in the Rube Goldberg contraption, and is not at all interested in rectilinear efficiencies. Life is terribly inefficient. And alive.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll say this about the &#8220;need to feel they&#8217;re earning their money&#8221;, though &#8212; I think this is very narrowly constructed and highly gendered. If you take a look at the vast world of work that&#8217;s done for free (caregiving to the sick and elderly, childrearing, community volunteering, and most art, for instance) and carries no wage simply because it&#8217;s devalued in, again, a highly gendered way, I think a great many of those people would be very happy to accept a UBI, and would not feel parasitical at all. Similarly, if you look at the experience of WPA workers, much of their sense of whether or not they were doing makework was about whether or not it really was makework. WPA funded a lot of work that actually needed doing, and people were not only glad of the jobs but proud to do them at a wage that made some stab at respecting their humanity. </p>\n<p>I have never, incidentally, understood this ethic that says your job as a boss is to extort as much work as you can from your workers for as low a wage as possible. It seems stupid on its face. Work is part of life, and you spend a tremendous part of your life with the people you work with. Why would you set yourself up as their opponent, rather than trying to foster their wellbeing, the entire team&#8217;s wellbeing? Similarly, why would your aim be to murder your competition, rather than collectively, sociably looking to work yourselves into niches you enjoyed and were good at, so that you could all&#8230;live like human beings? I&#8217;ve been a working person now for&#8230;37 years, and I find that most of the people who insist at me that none of that is possible outside fantasy have just never seen it in operation. Every so often you get a true believer in rat races who actually sees it in front of his own eyes and still insists it can&#8217;t be so, but there&#8217;s nothing you can do with that. </p>\n<p>Gatekeepers:</p>\n<p>One, manufacturing in Germany is an altogether different animal than manufacturing in the US has been, and that&#8217;s been true for many decades now. I saw that one with my own eyes. The two are not comparable in terms of value, and the entry bar is far higher in Germany than it ever was in the US. We had illiterates wandering in and getting put on the lines here. You have to go further than blogs and polemical economists when it comes to these things. Actually if you want a very clear view of US mfring when things were sclerotic, just before its death, you should watch Moore&#8217;s _Roger & Me_. Not for Moore&#8217;s ridiculous theatrics and propaganda, but for the interviews with the former auto-plant workers. He got them right &#8212; or, rather, recognized who they were and allowed them to be who they were. I know because I was there, only a thousand miles east, at the other end of the rust belt. Same people in the factories and mines out there. </p>\n<p>Two, re your &#8220;which is it&#8221; question:</p>\n<p>Few American kids are able to get into STEM grad programs (though, to be fair, this is true all over the world; here we have &#8220;all American kids who managed to graduate with STEM BSes&#8221; v. &#8220;highly-motivated kids from everywhere else&#8221; competing for program spots). The ones who get in are generally pretty bright, even in programs that aren&#8217;t very good. Among the brightest of those are kids who&#8217;ll watch their bosses carefully and recognize that this is not the life they want. </p>\n<p>There you go. This is the sort of concatenation that my non-STEM undergrads have trouble following, btw. </p>\n<p>Three, re liberal utopias. You know, I spent my early adulthood in the world that Chainsaw Al made: a world of radical selfishness, theft, vicious racism, ill health, bad nutrition, a middle finger up to public welfare. Then I moved to a little university town that a Canadian friend once called &#8220;very Canadian&#8221;. I had an abused person&#8217;s contempt for it at first: grownups wandering around in the middle of the day! On bicycles! But I stayed here because not only was it kind to people who liked to read, but it was cheap as hell and was resisting the general trend to put up gates to keep out the poors. You could just walk in and use things &#8212; public things &#8212; well-kept public things &#8212; like you were an actual human being. There were beautiful libraries. Excellent, clean recreation centers. A well-kept and thriving downtown with a summer full of music and art festivals. Excellent, safe public schools. And healthcare. For a long time I stayed because I knew that even if I lost my insurance, I could get decent healthcare. It was a goddamned Brigadoon, this liberal utopia divorced from reality. </p>\n<p>I bought property here, and yes, the taxes here are high compared to surrounding areas. I pay them happily. I was still working myself sick, pulling all-nighters two or three times a week, because I was a single mother by then, and employed via internet by the world Chainsaw Al made. No benefits, race-to-the-bottom hourly wages. Picking out the gristle, turning down the many jobs that were expressly about preying on other people. But the town I was bringing my child up in was pleasant and safe and full of good things. </p>\n<p>Then I got a university job. A public university job. I became a state employee. And then, even though the wage was something you wouldn&#8217;t bother picking up in the street, I became a middle-class person. I can afford to be sick. I can take my daughter on trips, to a good museum, and help send her to college someday. Today I&#8217;m having a vacation. (Actually I&#8217;m doing work, but my bosses are yelling at me to stop it and go have a vacation. It&#8217;s hard to get out of the habit.) I have vacations now. Two summers ago I had two solid weeks in which I didn&#8217;t do a lick of job-related work, and just spent time with my daughter and friends in cities where I used to live &#8212; it was like a miracle. I never had anything like that in Chainsaw Al&#8217;s world. I am physically healthier than I&#8217;ve been in years. And I am paid for doing work that&#8217;s worth doing.</p>\n<p>I heartily recommend this liberal utopia divorced from reality to anyone.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2017-11-23 20:08:22+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Anton #164</p>\n<p>I am not sure you understand that what you wrote is self-refuting,</p>\n<p>&#8220;Your only empirical support is that Americans are becoming less likely to pick STEM.

The enrollment in computer science programs in particular plummeted in the first half of the 2000s and it is only in recent years that it has reached comparable levels to those prior to the dotcom bubble, fueled mostly by the success of a few Silicon Valley companies.

This is, as Scott notes towards the end, a <i>Republican plan</i>, helmed by Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, and Steve Mnuchin (who seems like a pretty standard Republican treasury pick). </p>\n<p>This is where you want to engage with the plan seriously, rather than busting out the <b>nazis are coming!</b>, if you want to be taken seriously about the scarier aspects of the Trump administration.

Vox has run a few sympathetic articles, if you&#8217;re allergic to conservative media.)</p>\n<p>2) Has anyone gotten confirmation that this is the actual effect of the bill? Apparently the Cornell administration was operating under the assumption that grad student tuitions wouldn&#8217;t be subject to the new taxes. This blog post goes into some detail but the conclusion is unclear:<br />\n<a href=\"https://surlysubgroup.com/2017/11/06/gop-raises-taxes-on-graduate-students-or-does-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://surlysubgroup.com/2017/11/06/gop-raises-taxes-on-graduate-students-or-does-it/</a></p>\n<p>3) Per above, I don&#8217;t think this is playing to the Republican anti-university base, given that they&#8217;re not playing this up. It&#8217;s probably  part of a broader attempt to limit deductions. Here&#8217;s where we benefit from the Republican representatives being much better educated than their supporters.</p>\n<p>4) Note that in the worst case here, we&#8217;re talking about grad students costing ~$10,000 extra (the added tax burden, assuming ~$50,000 tuition, which is rare). That&#8217;s about an 8th of their cost. I guess in theory the granting agencies could refuse to make this work, but then they wouldn&#8217;t have reason to exist, would they? Scott&#8217;s concern about smaller schools that don&#8217;t have a lot of slack is real &#8211; but smaller schools get a vanishingly small percentage of the research grants to begin with, meaning they&#8217;re not affected much.</p>\n<p>5) The tuition is absolutely an accounting gimmick.

You went to H, Y, or P because your father had, and if he&#8217;d gone to Dartmouth, well, we&#8217;ll just leave that alone. The faculties were prime, sure, because the rich collect all sorts of tony objects. At that time, though, it actually was possible for a kid to put himself (or herself) through college mowing lawns all summer, and traveling was an expensive thing. People, bright and often very playful people, went to their state universities. Which also had smart people teaching, many of whom just wanted nothing to do with the suffocating air of the Ivies, or were too &#8220;ethnic&#8221; when their careers began to have made the cut.</p>\n<p>By about 30 years ago &#8220;Ivy&#8221; was attainable by kids whose parents had been the first in their families to become professionals *or were even (looks around) black*. The quotas were gone, ish. And all of a sudden it became the province of very bright kids with something to prove. This cohort, incidentally, was my dating pool for a long time. And holy crap, did the tension in that triangle of &#8220;prove something/maintain prestige/get stared down by Class&#8221; screw up a lot of people. Really damaged a lot of bright people for life. </p>\n<p>20 years ago I started seeing ordinary middle-class teenagers panicking at the prospect of not getting into Ivies &#8212; somehow they&#8217;d been sold on the idea that they&#8217;d be living in the gutter if they didn&#8217;t get in. That&#8217;s when Felicia Ackerman, at Brown, wrote her column tut-tutting about what was happening in admissions and how it was destroying late childhood and somehow convincing very bright young people that they were factory seconds because they hadn&#8217;t gotten in, and how these kids were all such good candidates that the only really sensible way of doing it was to run a lottery.</p>\n<p>The crop I see coming out now are a mix of fantastically wealthy kids completely divorced from reality and desperadoes. The ones I meet are E strings tightened to snapping, and they seem to require a tremendous scaffolding around them of coaches and sherpas, as well as continuous assurance that all the right people love them, really love them. Yes, they&#8217;re bright. Often they&#8217;re even thoughtful, genuinely thoughtful, not application-glib thoughtful. But they seem to me a level of high-maintenance that I never met in the most messed-up of my Ivy boyfriends. I not only don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on there, I&#8217;m not sure I want to know. </p>\n<p>So anyway I&#8217;m wary of using &#8220;Ivies/MIT&#8221; as a proxy for &#8220;best/brightest&#8221;. There have always been some of those there. To a greater or lesser degree, though, they&#8217;ve always been elsewhere, too.  </p>\n<p>The current problem is that there&#8217;s now a significant gulf between the public schools and the Ivies and near-Ivies, which leaves the bright kids in a real bind. My kid&#8217;s decided against even applying because, in her words after watching the come-on videos, &#8220;they all seem like jerks.&#8221; There&#8217;s also the question of money. When neurologists are panicking about how they&#8217;ll send the kids to Penn, you know things are over the cliff. </p>\n<p>But then you turn around and look at the alternatives for really bright kids: where are they? The public American Us are threadbare, the faculty so busy with the email pinging and the desperation efforts at selling online classes and whatnot that they burn out a lot faster than they once did. The courses are remedial until you hit the top-level courses, and profs are under pressure there to lower that bar so enrollment can grow and the courses can survive. People have hired me to teach courses meant to, I kid you not, teach nearly-illiterate college students to read. The kids themselves are just bumping around in an increasingly expensive and understaffed Kafka machine, trying to figure out how to please their profs, collect enough credits, register for the things they need, and pay the bills to walk out with a degree in something that might, maybe, help them get a job. So the bright kids who haven&#8217;t been in Ivy Application Boot Camp since third grade also look at the selective non-Ivies, but there you&#8217;re looking at $60-70K a year with much less financial aid than you&#8217;d get at an Ivy. Most can&#8217;t go.</p>\n<p>In other words, the story here is really another Republican ed-funding story. The drain on US public universities began with Reagan. It&#8217;s been a 40-year fundamental assault on the entire notion of &#8220;public&#8221;, on Johnson&#8217;s world, and it&#8217;s strictly ideological. The shrugging at wasting talent and brains started then. difference now is that the people at the top who&#8217;re busy razing &#8220;public&#8221; actually no longer believe in democratic nations as a thing. They&#8217;re post-(or maybe pre)-nation-state in their thinking. They genuinely see absolutely no reason why they ought to be bound by such constructs or by the loyalties or sense of communal responsibilities that go with them. This is what makes the facebook/twitter hearings in Congress so sickening. Of course they aren&#8217;t being candid with the senators, those company reps. They don&#8217;t recognize the senators&#8217; legitimacy. And the senators are failing to name the problem in plain language and open up that fight. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m actually still in the US &#8212; my town&#8217;s just been a free-floating Canadianesque bit, though that quality&#8217;s slowly draining away, thanks to racism and years of Republican state rule (we recently had a local minimum-wage ordinance killed by the state, for instance). But one thing my kid&#8217;s been looking at is going to college in Canada. Int&#8217;l tuition there costs about what in-state tuition does here, and they haven&#8217;t got the crazy Running Man admissions process we do here, so the kids don&#8217;t get crazified through high school. Or the weird &#8220;you&#8217;re joining a (wildly expensive) club where we&#8217;re all pretty and love you&#8221; culture of US SLACs and Ivies. For the most part it&#8217;s just school with freedom and an apartment, unless you&#8217;re living at home. It&#8217;s shabby. You get a lot of smart (and mordantly funny, if my twitter circles are a representative sample) profs who know better than to waste their time on the kids who&#8217;re off to major in beer for a while before they drop out. It&#8217;s a bit of time capsule, frankly, from a USian pov. Can it last?

You cannot build an independent life if you can&#8217;t control your own fertility, but are going to be held responsible nonetheless for raising and maybe supporting children. Housing, well, it&#8217;s unlikely she&#8217;ll live anywhere near TO. But friends from Halifax to Vancouver and up to Edmonton seem to make out okay on normal jobs. (Another plus: friends.)

While I agree that there are still some actual public Ivies, there aren&#8217;t many, and there&#8217;s a serious problem: they work only for the wealthy and for kids who live in those states. Kids with money can go wherever they want. But the public universities were built with the purpose of educating kids without that kind of money. (Hence &#8220;public&#8221;.) When out-of-state COA runs $50-60K, and a kid&#8217;s not going to be eligible for university scholarships because they&#8217;re reserved (as they ought to be) for in-state kids, that&#8217;s the end. I&#8217;ve had sharp students who&#8217;ve gotten into some very nice public out-of-state universities, but just didn&#8217;t have the money. So they stay here instead and try to make something happen in a university that is no longer built for them &#8212; and it&#8217;s not easy. They have to find the right professors in a giant school pretty early in the game, before they have any idea what&#8217;s going on. I used to see more kids playing the &#8220;establish residency&#8221; game to go out of state, but it&#8217;s just gotten too expensive for a not-rich kid to hang around somewhere pretending it isn&#8217;t for school for a year or two. Anyway, the upshot&#8217;s that while those public Ivies might do a nice job of generating workforce, that does nothing about the problem of nonwealthy brains and talent going to waste in the large majority of states that aren&#8217;t home to public Ivies. </p>\n<p>About threadbare public university systems&#8230;this is a nationwide crisis, one we&#8217;ve been talking about but not dealing with successfully for at least a decade. And it&#8217;ll get worse as the state-employee retirees pile in and states have to confront their public pension malfeasance. Illinois&#8217; public university system is already collapsing &#8212; they just don&#8217;t have the money to pay people and keep the lights on. Connecticut&#8217;s system, I think it was, was seeking a $3B no-interest bond issue with a balloon payment a few years ago because they were having trouble servicing their existing debt. North Carolina is heavy on the debt scale, too, and they&#8217;ve even got the Research Triangle going for them. The flyover state systems have been scrambling for years &#8212; we&#8217;re now at a point shared by many others where we&#8217;re having to tell legislators that we cannot physically do the things they want us to do, not without more money. There&#8217;s noplace to put all the kids, nobody to grade the papers, nobody to teach extra sections even if you could rent a building to hold the classes in &#8212; nobody will take the jobs at the money offered, in some of these disciplines. If you&#8217;re in Boston, you can find an underemployed desperado in your field who&#8217;ll take the adjunct peanuts. If you&#8217;re in Grand Rapids, not so much. And again, for a long time we&#8217;ve had governments in power that just don&#8217;t see this as a problem. Raise the tuition, they say. If that means hundreds of thousands of kids can&#8217;t go, well, then they can&#8217;t go&#8230;though of course if they want to sign up with our bank&#8217;s indentured servant program, where they&#8217;ll major in the things we choose, and turn over 15% of their income over a number of years&#8230;.</p>\n<p>K12 is another story, one I know some about, as I used to make my living writing state-specific K12 curriculum. The disparities, state to state, are vast and depressing; Common Core, while well-meant, was developed by a team with little understanding of what&#8217;s actually possible in the classrooms that exist, with the teachers and kids and parents and local cultures and attitudes toward education that exist. (I&#8217;ve worked for and know some of those people.) The guy at the head of that project is, if I&#8217;m remembering right, a Yalie who grew up with two Jewish professional parents in Manhattan; it shows. Cares a lot about ed. Doesn&#8217;t, as the song goes, know the territory.</p>\n<p>About Congressional corruption &#8212; I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t help a bit, and if they had been less corruptible the tech emperors might&#8217;ve had more respect for longer, but I think this is actually about something deeper, a change that started with the rise of transnational corporations in the 60s and 70s and accelerated tremendously with the globalization of the internet in the 90s. I do not think these guys (almost always guys) regard themselves as bound by citizenry, by the concept of the nation-state. I think they believe they&#8217;ve not only superseded it but that they&#8217;ve got every right, given the scale of their money and reach. The arrogance regarding government &#8212; what it is, how it works, its necessity, how hard it is to hold together and run, the necessity of understanding, and serving rather than exploiting, people who are not essentially themselves &#8212; is not surprising, but to me that doesn&#8217;t make it less galling. It seems to me they view the entire thing as vestigial. They were sitting in that hearing room like they were tolerating a visit to an old-age home that was about to be knocked down. I get the impression that the entire notion of a public servant is truly baffling to some of those people, like asking &#8220;What time is up?&#8221;</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2017-11-25 00:48:26+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Fly on the Wall #181: Is it possible that what you perceive as the US giving up its good EE jobs to foreign competition, others would perceive simply as some of the traditional subject matter of EE being &#8220;already more-or-less solved problems&#8221; and &#8220;already commoditized&#8221;&#8212;and hotshot MIT undergrads always gravitating toward whatever they see as the current frontier?

We also desperately need civil engineers, to build the seawalls, and fortify cities against floods and hurricanes, and rebuild what will get destroyed in the &#8220;500-year disasters&#8221; that will now happen every year or so, and repair crumbling infrastructure more generally.</p>\n<p>Or: how come the US used to be able to build subways and train networks at reasonable cost, but is no longer able to?  There are many possible explanations, from political and bureacratic bloat to a probably-justified refusal to accept dangerous working conditions&#8212;but I can&#8217;t help wondering whether part of the problem is just that it&#8217;s hard nowadays to entice the most brilliant students to major in how to build and maintain subways.  Wasn&#8217;t that, like, solved a hundred years ago?  Who&#8217;d want to study that in preference to deep learning or Ethereum?  And so we end up with a country where subways fall apart and nobody remembers how to fix them.</p>\n<p>In a pure free market, you&#8217;d imagine such problems would solve themselves, by the wages going up for unsexy engineering jobs until the demand was met.

I&#8217;m in with many of your comments about affordability and education, but first I feel inclined to raise some red flags about Canada.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say that reproductive choice is not a fait accompli in Canada, especially in provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia, and especially in rural areas.</p>\n<p>In addition to Toronto, residents in Vancouver and Calgary are experiencing horrendous housing prices compared to their salaries.  I would say that the gap between take home salaries and housing prices is worse in Vancouver than anywhere in California:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/demographia-international-housing-study-vancouver-ranks-3rd-1.3947668\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/demographia-international-housing-study-vancouver-ranks-3rd-1.3947668</a></p>\n<p>Regarding Canada&#8217;s healthcare system, it is not perfect, and many students, if they move between provinces, and newcomers to Canada, have trouble finding a primary care physician.  Finding a good primary care physician in Canada can often take months and even years.  In Canada, if you cannot get a good primary care physician, you cannot adequately access the health care system. </p>\n<p>Many universities in Canada do not provide dental or vision insurance for their students.</p>\n<p>Regarding students not being able to attend university out of state because of the very high out of state tuitions, yes, I agree that this is an injustice, but again, this problem, to a lesser extent, exists in Canada as well.  For instance, out of province tuition to attend McGill is about $10,000 / year.  Add on top of this the cost of living, which is at least $20,000/year in most Canadian cities, as well as the requirement to pay tax on tuition, and tax on RA or TA money awarded in Canada, and you can quickly see that a PhD is not affordable for most out of province Canadians.  There are no Pell Grants (or similar) in Canada, and the NSERC award is reserved for only a very small number of students.</p>\n<p>On top of this, student loans are subject to a limited interest free period (6.5 years for undergraduate and Masters students, and 7.5 years for PhDs).  Once you pass this time period, you are subjected to personal loan interest rates (7-10%, which accrue from the date of graduation or the limited interest free period, whichever comes first.)</p>\n<p>This is very different than in the US, where traditionally, the Pell Grant was held at very low interest rate for a very long period while it was being paid off.</p>\n<p>I do think it very sad that so many bright young people in Canada and the US cannot go to university because of affordability issues.  This does then raise the question:  Why are we importing so much cheap, minimally trained &#8220;skilled&#8221; foreign labor in Canada and the US, while we ignore many willing and able young people who could be trained or apprenticed into these jobs??</p>\n<p>Also, why do we turn a blind eye to the many students who do graduate with a STEM degree, at considerable personal costs of time and money, who cannot then find employment? </p>\n<p>This has been going on for years, both in Canada and the US.  </p>\n<p>Given all of this, I&#8217;m not surprised that many people who have been sidelined from being able to get an education, or access the professional labor market, now shrug their shoulders about the taxation of graduate student tuitions.</p>\n<p>Amy, about this insight:</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this is actually about something deeper, a change that started with the rise of transnational corporations in the 60s and 70s and accelerated tremendously with the globalization of the internet in the 90s.

I worked a few years ago with the Blackfoot Native Americans, who exist in both Montana and Alberta, and I couldn&#8217;t help but think about what a great loss it was that more wasn&#8217;t done to allow them to integrate their own culture and language into the development of a school curriculum.  They have worked hard to do this, but what a tough slog it&#8217;s been, with the governments of Alberta and Montana pretty much fighting and talking down to them all the way.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure there are many other communities who are not well served by a blind application of common core standards.</p>\n<p>Thanks for your sensitive thoughts, Amy.

Other people I know have taken subjects like quantum electrodynamics.  So . . . I was watching the congressional hearing on quantum computing that someone put up on this blog a few weeks ago.  One of the speakers in the video wrung their hands about what we should do about the lack of quantum trained engineers in the US.  I had to laugh.  Perhaps because I work mostly as a circuit designer, I guess people assume that I&#8217;m only specialized in this area.  OK, I never actually worked in quantum computing.  But to have this hand wringing and sky is falling discussion about people not being trained in QM is ridiculous.  I bet there are thousands of still working engineers out there who have taken QM or nuclear physics who never were able to directly use it in the course of their careers.  Is there a database of classes taken by working engineers in these supposedly desperately needed STEM subjects?  (If there is, I&#8217;m still waiting to hear from these people.) Or is it assumed that if one hasn&#8217;t taken these classes in the last five years that complete brain erasure has occurred?  I really don&#8217;t know, but there does seem to be a Chicken Little quality to these Congressional Hearings on our lack of STEM research and training.</p>\n<p>Regarding nuclear power, Canada does have its act together on this one:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLOWPOKE_reactor\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLOWPOKE_reactor</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/canada-nuclear-power.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/canada-nuclear-power.aspx</a></p>\n<p>And, no, it wasn&#8217;t free market forces or self sacrificing engineers that enabled Canada&#8217;s nuclear program.  What did enable it was a good regulatory relationship between Ontario Power Generation, private energy companies, and universities and Ontario&#8217;s Long Term Power Generation Plan.</p>\n<p>Subways?  Come on!  If there aren&#8217;t many infrastructure projects in the US right now, it probably has something to do with the lack of tax dollars to fund these very expensive projects.  I strong doubt that the lack of infrastructure projects such as &#8220;subway building&#8221; has anything to do with a lack of willing and able structural and civil engineers.</p>\n<p>Scott, your comment:</p>\n<p>&#8220;But it\u2019s not a pure free market, and the students have extremely limited information, and for whatever other reasons the problem doesn\u2019t seem to be solving itself.

Stop listening to cries about a STEM shortage and do more to employ engineers over the course of their careers at salaries that are reasonably competitive with other professions,</p>\n<p>2.  Pressure companies that heavily offshore to bring some manufacturing back to the US,</p>\n<p>3.  Enforce the use of the H-1B visit so that it is used primarily for highly trained STEM degree holders with Masters and PhD with high demand skill sets (and not bachelor degree holders with basic computing skills,)</p>\n<p>4.  Set a wage floor for H-1Bs at $100K/year minimum,</p>\n<p>5.  Enforce tariffs to limit manufactured goods coming into the US (if these goods are otherwise produced here, or could be,)</p>\n<p>5.  Encourage corporations to increase the level of manufacturing R&D to at least 10% of top line revenue,</p>\n<p>6.  Develop long term plans (10, 15, 20 and 25 years) for long term infrastructure and energy projects (and ensure that stake holders come on board),</p>\n<p>7.  Regulate Wall Street so that it does not hobble long term infrastructure projects with unrealistic short term profitability requirements,</p>\n<p>8.  Regulate monopolies, and if necessary, break them up,</p>\n<p>9.  Block CEOs and other powerful board members from lobbying federal agencies and politicians,</p>\n<p>10.

Those getting into medicine or law don&#8217;t have to worry about being declared obsolete after the age of 40, in fact, quite the contrary. </p>\n<p>Another pernicious effect of the raise of Google and Facebook has been, indeed, ageism. Unlike say, Microsoft or Apple whose founders grew with their companies, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page and Sergey Brin never &#8220;grew up&#8221; together with their companies, rather, their explosive growth was due to the hiring of very experienced people at the top together with very young people at the bottom.

The kids were reading a Masha Gessen piece that was largely over their heads, and I hadn&#8217;t read it in a while. All of a sudden I was struck by the resemblance in her tone to Ayn Rand&#8217;s. Same hair-on-fire woman kind of tone &#8212; different warnings, but a very similar tone, and similar cadence. Escapees. I remember it because the first time I read Atlas Shrugged &#8212; I was the students&#8217; age &#8212; it pissed me off so hard that I actually threw it across the room. I mean not just the poverty of the political thinking but the incredibly miserable fiction, not that you can expect a lot more from propaganda. But it pissed me off *so* much that a couple of years later I went back and read it again, just to see what it was that had aggravated me like that. And that time I heard the woman with her hair on fire. It was a genuinely pathetic thing, as in &#8220;involving pathos&#8221;, not &#8220;contemptible&#8221;. But I could see better why she was pounding and insisting like that, so breathlessly.</p>\n<p>When I say that the dismantling of &#8220;public&#8221; began with Reagan, that&#8217;s not invective; it&#8217;s fact. I was alive for it &#8212; working for a Congressman through part of his time &#8212; and remember the change. Under Reagan, grants for students were decimated, public universities were pushed to go behave like corporations. Anything with &#8220;public&#8221; in the name &#8212; public televisions, public museums, public utilities, public recreation programs, everything but public libraries (reprieved for a while) were pushed to become &#8220;public-private partnerships&#8221; or simply privatised outright. &#8220;The public sector&#8221; was for slobs &#8212; including teachers, government scientists, government anything. And suddenly the political question from the right wasn&#8217;t &#8220;why should we pay so much?&#8221; but &#8220;why should I pay at all?&#8221; Which was at the time a shocking question, because the answer, obvious to nearly all, was: because you&#8217;re not the only one here, mister. Those are trends that have intensified over the last fortyish years, nearly unabated, as far as I can tell. And &#8220;why should I pay at all?&#8221; is a question I hear routinely from the mouths of outraged youths enjoying a taxpayer-subsidized education, a remnant of the old world.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t worry that the US will become a land of capped salaries, government-selected occupations, and government-issued apartments. (Except for black people, because that&#8217;s been our story all along there.) These things just have nothing to do with this place and its history. Even serious censorship is an iffy proposition: we&#8217;re spectacularly bad at shutting up, though it&#8217;s a bad sign when Rich Uncle Pennybags shows up at Senate hearings &#8212; if we&#8217;ve got that kind of humor, things are bad. Nationalism is proving a tough sale, too. Our big abridgments of personal rights, outside a few I&#8217;ll get to in a minute, run all the way to things like: you can&#8217;t endanger your workers&#8217; lives. You can&#8217;t foul the air and water freely. Your kids must have some sort of education, you must take care of them, etc. You must contribute to the maintenance of public facilities even if you don&#8217;t use or want them. The ways in which you can endanger yourself and others are limited. You must be licensed to practice professions. The details of these things are often onerous and expensive, sure. So are the details of many other worthwhile endeavors. </p>\n<p>(I&#8217;m also remembering the outrage of a suburban guy I knew at the loss of his high-flow showerhead. The guy wanted to shower under a waterfall, apparently, and the whole &#8220;you&#8217;re not the only one here&#8221; thing was lost utterly on him. And this was a major issue in his life, the showerhead. See, Ayn Rand comes to this in the end, she misnamed that other novel.)</p>\n<p>When I look back over our history, the only real usurpations we seem to be much good at involve enslavement or near-enslavement of nonwhites, the poor, and women; foreign wars of exploitation, and taking of land &#8212; from Native Americans, from city dwellers during urban-development projects, that sort of thing. Intellectual usurpations, intentional thwarting of talent, geographical corralling &#8212; beyond our eternal race war and misogyny, I don&#8217;t see that we&#8217;ve had much push in these areas. Corruption&#8230;yeah, we know how to block paths with corruption. But it seems to me that&#8217;s always sat side-by-side here with genuine shock at corruption and places that don&#8217;t operate that way. We don&#8217;t seem to lock it up very tight.</p>\n<p>So &#8212; anyway, no, I&#8217;m not very worried about the prospect of people&#8217;s being blocked, officially or subtly, from pursuing interests here&#8230;so long as the people you&#8217;re talking about are mostly white, mostly male. My expectation is that the biggest danger there will remain the increasing difficulty of getting there if you start out poor. Now, if you&#8217;re talking about pursuing interests while being paid handsomely for it, that&#8217;s another story, but I&#8217;d probably give it a big laugh and go off to get another cup of tea.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2017-11-25 07:30:22+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@The problem with gatekeepers (185)</p>\n<p>>Jeff Bezos is the world\u2019s newest $100 billion mogul.</p>\n<p>>Somebody has to explain to me how I, and other taxpayers, should continue to subsidize a constant supply of cheap highly qualified labor</p>\n<p>Jeff Bezos is an argument against public education, because he&#8217;s getting richer?  </p>\n<p>Yes, we all benefit from an educated workforce in the United States.

We&#8217;re one Supreme pneumonia case away from undoing a sadly-eroded Roe. (And you do get NDP surprises, though I don&#8217;t understand them.) Also aware of health-system shortcomings and deficits in dental/optical and also mental healthcare, and my sense is that some of this is not just a national/provincial-health problem, or a matter of cultural historical pressures to do with not actually needing any healthcare right now thank you, but also a problem of relative population sizes and national wealth. I had a Congolese student last year who&#8217;d been in med school in the Congo, was giving it another go here, and he asked me one day how it was that America had so *much*, when it came to healthcare, not just stuff and buildings sitting around but people, medicines, technologies&#8230;I blinked, and then I said, well, first you have an America, and then you have a world war that leaves America the wealthiest country in the world by far, and you bring all the scientists here, at which point he understood that there are things you probably cannot go home and recreate.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, rural areas here (as you know) are in some pretty desperate conditions medically. And of course depending on what goes on with ACA we could shortly be back in the bad old days, when you&#8217;d simply be terrified of getting sick enough to have to go to the doctor, and parents would stand in a sick kid&#8217;s room debating whether it was worth poisoning the insurance to take the kid to the doctor. </p>\n<p>As for student loans etc. &#8211; we&#8217;ve eroded the hell out of the Pell Grant program; you have to be quite poor to get one now, and it&#8217;s peanuts relative to in-state COA. Even our GI Bill students can&#8217;t cover costs on what they get. So the way they work it with loans is: you can probably get a subsidized loan in varying amounts, depending on what kind of student you are, and your grace period lasts six months post-graduation. After that you&#8217;re paying interest, which was pretty steep for a while; I don&#8217;t know what they charge now. Your loan will likely be sold to some loan-servicing corporation that will do its best to rob you, so you have to look sharp and be prepared to spend time fighting on the phone. Those loans, incidentally, won&#8217;t cover your COA, so your parents will be expected to take out private loans at shocking interest rates, too.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m aware too that there&#8217;s been creeping Americanization of attitudes when it comes to university in Canada, with some of the wacked-out competition emerging and some obsessive interest in ranking. Also some of the less happy impulses towards quotas.  But I don&#8217;t know how accurate my read is. An interesting thing, when we were looking at colleges a while back: I have a spookily clear sense of what kind of kids you find at colleges all over the eastern and midwestern US, but all that stops cold at the border. </p>\n<p>More to the point: it&#8217;s pretty easy to be a student in a new country, but not so easy for most people, I think, to make a life. I think that really would be the main thing.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2017-11-25 08:43:15+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@171<br />\nThe Business Insider data are for Class of 2016.

The notion that Ronald Reagan dismantled a utopian nirvana that was working for most Americans is demonstrably false if you take a look at unemployment rates, economic growth and importantly the defeat of Communism as a reasonable government system. In its current tradition, American academia back then was uber leftist. In the 1980s, the economics book written by Paul Samuelson -the Nobel Prize in Economics winner- said <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/12/why_were_americ.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/12/why_were_americ.html</a> &#8220;the Soviet economy is proof that, contrary to what many skeptics had earlier believed, a socialist command economy can function and even thrive.&#8221; American academia has been living in its own bubble with its own sense of reality for a long time. I am not surprised you then thought things were great. They were probably great for you. I know a lot of people from Russia and other countries of the former Warsaw Pact that still cannot wrap their minds around the persistence of pro-Communist thinking in American universities. A long stay in one of Cuba&#8217;s prisons for political reasons will probably change their minds of many of these academics. Also, when it comes to Canada, people vote with their feet: the number Canadians -both in relative and absolute terms- who leave the Canadian utopia for the American &#8220;nightmare&#8221; surpasses the number of Americans who do the trip the other way. Something doesn&#8217;t add up in your narrative.

Despite its odd specificity, this is actually a pattern that&#8217;s recurred over and over in the annals of human hatred: the screwing over of a relatively powerless group (Jews, nerds, grad students, kulaks), and its justification in terms of an alliance that exists, almost entirely in the oppressors&#8217; fevered imaginations, between the oppressed and some rich and powerful bogey-individual (Lord Rothschild, George Soros, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page).</p>\n<p>Gatekeepers, the hatred and resentment on display in your comments, the unconcealed thirst for the destruction of the entire world that this blog is about, have gotten tiresome to me.

As it happens, &#8220;I was there&#8221; too. I was one of the many working in Brussels and elsewhere to make the EU happen, even though at the time I found the project very, very dubious. Not because the referenda sold hot air, which they did, but because I really did not believe that Europe was going to find it that easy to put to bed millennia of internecine and unbelievably bloody war. And, later, because it seemed obvious to me that trying to marry north and south like that economically was reckless and asking for trouble. </p>\n<p>I was right &#8212; and wrong. I understood at the time, as did most everyone working on the project, I expect, that the rationale was legit: Europe had no choice. It had to have a massively intrusive trade union and become a real single market, based on a single currency, if it was going to survive economically. And that once you go that far, you&#8217;re probably going to have to go at least the rest of the road to confederacy, so you may as well build for it. And I was right about the harmonisation hot air, and the lies about &#8220;it&#8217;s not about political union&#8221;, and the readiness with which old enmities would re\u00ebmerge, and the trouble about linking north and south. </p>\n<p>But I was also wrong about how well the project would succeed. It succeeded marvelously well &#8212; well enough to develop a culture, or make a new life for very old bits of culture. Only a few years after &#8220;Europe&#8221; I began meeting young people who called themselves Europeans, rather than [country]men, and seeing art and entertainment that regarded Europe in a place in a way I hadn&#8217;t seen as a living thing before. It was quite remarkable. It was sturdy enough to absorb the DDR; it was attractive enough that the whole ring of countries around wanted in. Twelve to 28. You can see the trauma in Remain, in the UK &#8212; it skews young, because these are people who&#8217;ve grown up seeing themselves as Europeans.  Economically&#8230;I don&#8217;t pay the same kind of attention I used to, but it appears to me that in the main it&#8217;s been a success, with the serious exception of the continuously dangerous north/south problems and the reality that Germany &#8212; a unified Germany &#8212; was indeed calling the shots, meaning that the continent was and is relying very heavily on Germany&#8217;s good citizenship. </p>\n<p>As far as the revisionist 70s/80s US economic history up there goes: We had a bad time of it economically in the 70s largely because our industrial infrastructure &#8212; including our unions &#8212; refused to acknowledge that it was no longer 1955 and that the rest of the world had mostly caught up to us, and that we actually had to be competitive. I was there for that, too, and I doubt I&#8217;ll forget the slap in the face it was the first time I saw a modern plant in operation overseas. We were decades, even a century behind, dead man walking and didn&#8217;t know it. There are vacant corporate hqs and plantsite brownfields still left as monuments to the time. The GOP solution to the problem introduced a new and radical era of poverty, inequality, and violence in this country. I had a bitter taste of it before I moved here, where I&#8217;ve had a long reprieve. </p>\n<p>As for Communism in US universities at the time: someone&#8217;s been telling gatekeeper fairy tales. Marxism, big M and small, was pass\u00e9 in universityland by the 80s. Era of yuppies, investment banking, biotech, personal computing, jet sets and fancy shirts. It was an unbelievably hot party if you were too young and dumb to think about where the money was coming from. Small-m marxism, btw, is the stuff that survived through that time, and it has not to do with governance and economies but with social power  relationships.</p>\n<p>Finally, as for Samuelson: oh, my Samuelson. I would have to see that quote in the &#8217;89 edition to believe it, because I read my earlier (&#8217;83?) edition to bits and ain&#8217;t no praise of either command economies or autarky in there. Nothing in there to support such praise, either. I will say though that it did seem, and still seems, to me weirdly inconsistent. I mean sure, the bit about command economies, nobody thought that was a good idea, I mean I don&#8217;t know how many baloney NEPs you want before you&#8217;re forced to reckon with that. But the big argument on this side against Soviet economics was that you only get happy economies with vibrant free trade, which is why you can&#8217;t have a happy economy in a closed, autarkic system. The world, however, is only so big, and as far as I know we still don&#8217;t have those warp-drive intergalactic trading vessels. And if you look at US trade, it accounted at the time for something like, I think, all of 15% of GNP. (We still spoke in GNP then.) So it always did seem like a very iffy sort of argument to me. I suppose it&#8217;s also worth mentioning that Japan&#8217;s MITI, with its massive government-directed industrial investment programs, seemed to be crushing the competition everywhere at the time, so everyone was scrambling to figure out what the secret was, how they got it right so often and how to copy them. </p>\n<p>Anyway, what Scott says is right. I remember a long-ago interview with Mirsky where he&#8217;s fuming about, I think, NASA, saying the problem wasn&#8217;t that they wasted money, the problem was that they wasted ALL the money. The WWII-era program does not waste all the money, and &#8212; what can I say? &#8212; the hits keep coming. The massive stack of industrial R&D that uses the federal R&D as a basis seems to me proof enough of its success. </p>\n<p>Anyway anyway, I think gatekeeper&#8217;s thinking isn&#8217;t just paranoid; in the Gessen/Rand mode, it&#8217;s about the wrong country. It&#8217;s not trivial, the way that countries find their tunes and keep on playing them. Though maybe the Eagles said it better: &#8220;Aw but she can&#8217;t take you any way/you don&#8217;t already know how to go.&#8221;</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2017-11-26 03:37:01+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>This thread deserves a more differentiated  one than the one I gave in #193 &#8220;give up and come to Europe&#8221;.</p>\n<p>#20 says &#8216;we won the election, the universities are the enemy, and now we harm them&#8217;.</p>\n<p>Why are the universities the enemy?

You can trace it all back to the pre-single-currency efforts at harmonisation, which was the best you could do while retaining sovereignty, but not good enough. I haven&#8217;t heard talk about Spain or Portugal lately but there were similar problems, and frankly I haven&#8217;t been listening for less world-headlines ones. </p>\n<p>Factories: At the time it was steel mills. We had a giant but dying steel industry at the time, and it was night and day, what was going on inside the mills here and elsewhere. And it was a real shock to see it firsthand, both sides. Unmissable, how deluded we were about our own place in the world. We were in the early-mid 20th c; they were in the 21st already. I understand that I was being shown showpieces. But I didn&#8217;t see showpieces like that here. And the thing is that you have two choices in big commodity industries, right: you can be a killer at the bottom or you can do the very expensive stuff up top. We&#8217;d lost the advantage at the bottom, because other countries were making creditable steel while treating workers like slaves, and we were kidding ourselves mightily about our prospects at the top, because management refused to believe how far ahead the others had run. Wouldn&#8217;t put the money in, wouldn&#8217;t admit we were behind. Hence very large aging post-industrial brownfield sites in the US rust belt. </p>\n<p>Factories in the last 30 years: I&#8217;ve not only visited, I&#8217;ve worked in a couple. I don&#8217;t know what to say except that the rust belt is&#8230;rusty. &#8220;Bending metal&#8221; is still a thing, it doesn&#8217;t pay, it&#8217;s commodity work. What distinguishes us, or did distinguish (I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve never been) from China and others further down the chain, is that we have some semblance of labor regulations. If you&#8217;re going to poison your workers, you have to do it so slowly it can&#8217;t be pinned on you, or you have to do it all of a sudden and then get the lawyers ready. You can&#8217;t just poison them routinely and noticeably and then throw them away for a new crop; the feds will eventually arrive. People on the right complain bitterly about this sort of thing, but I notice that they&#8217;re not generally the ones disabled at 47 from industrial poisoning and accidents. Same thing with the footstamping for coal mining &#8212; I remember talking to coal miners out on strike. These guys looked 20 years older than they were, and a rough 20 years older. These aren&#8217;t jobs you&#8217;d wish on anyone, let alone want for your kids. I doubt that most of the people who are championing them have ever been anywhere near a mine or miners. </p>\n<p>France: had an interesting visit last spring visiting a govt-scientist friend in Provence; she&#8217;s got two college-aged kids, husband&#8217;s an exec.

They don&#8217;t worry about healthcare. Their food is beautiful and less expensive than ours; my daughter still rhapsodizes over the bread and butter. In a tiny village there are dozens of buses a day connecting to other towns and Marseille; public transit works. Roads in good shape, too, if congested. Art and culture of all kinds are free and open and ubiquitous in a way I haven&#8217;t seen since NYC of the 1970s: they want the kids to know, they want this stuff to be part of life. The kids are either in college for nominal money or are actually being paid to take quite rigorous courses, and after graduation they have a great deal of choice about where they can live and work; they can go seek opportunity. They travel regularly. Yes, my friend beats her forehead bloody on the wall of regulations about doing so much as ordering supplies for her lab, and there&#8217;s never money, and she&#8217;s not likely to go any further up the ladder careerwise because she made tactical errors 20 years ago. On balance? She ain&#8217;t moving back. </p>\n<p>When people are running away from social-dem tax regimes I think it tends to be the most able and impatient, the ones who feel personally thwarted and personally attacked by it. And they get what they&#8217;re asking for, usually, when they go to live in a place that&#8217;s far more cruel, like this one, and then their luck runs out &#8212; they have a child with a disability, or they get sick themselves, or their industry evaporates and they&#8217;re superfluous and not young anymore, or suddenly much bigger fishes emerge, and they find that the flip side of &#8220;do what you want&#8221; is &#8220;to hell with you, you don&#8217;t exist&#8221;. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a goer, that kind of selfishness. I mean I&#8217;ve run up against it too: I&#8217;ve sometimes worked in organizations where I wasn&#8217;t union, but the workforce was mostly union and my job was union-inflected, and I&#8217;d get bosses physically turning off my computer in front of me and telling me to go home and not work at home. Which, of course, made me crazy. There were things I wanted to do. But I also recognized that I&#8217;m an outlier in this regard, and that the way I work is not only terrible but impossible for most people. And that I&#8217;m not the only one here, mister, and people have to be able to make a living in some tolerable way that doesn&#8217;t use them up by the time they&#8217;re 45. So I&#8217;d go home and develop other things to do, do my own work. I live in absolutely zero fear of being told to stop it. Could I be stopped from publishing, or getting paid for writing? We&#8217;ve had that sort of thing before, briefly; it could happen. Would I be stopped from *working*, from writing? No, I don&#8217;t think so. We don&#8217;t really do intellectual gulags here; we&#8217;d have to change pretty substantially for that, I think. </p>\n<p>Along those lines, incidentally: Gatekeeper went lowering around about Cuban prisons. As it happens I&#8217;m in the middle of reading V\u00e1clav Havel&#8217;s letters from prison to his wife, 1979-1983. That was a decent test of being shut up. Limited to four pages a week, limited strictly on subject, cut off from his milieu, heavily censored and harassed by the prison boss, not to mention neurotic as hell and unrelenting in his demands for vitamins and cigarettes, and yet he still managed to work seriously around the censors and come out with stuff that would be foundational for work he did when he got out, maybe foundational to his trajectory to the presidency. You really have to go a very long way to stop someone from doing their work when they have powerful motive to do it. </p>\n<p>Gatekeepers&#8217;s paranoia: I was referring to his fears for life in the US. And no, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s correct on his old deep suspicion of the EU. It&#8217;s a little hard, from here, to remember just how creaky the European economies were in the 70s and 80s, how expensive it was trying to do business in a dozen little countries at once and in a dozen currencies, and how substantially removing those barriers opened up commerce. The other connective structures weren&#8217;t around yet &#8212; the $20 two-hour flights across Europe and of course, for most people, the internet. You still had to take a boat to the UK, schlep to Calais or wherever and ferry across. Poland was forever away, exotic. The deformities of 90s/00s finance hadn&#8217;t inflicted themselves on the societies yet, either. But on the whole I see a Europe that&#8217;s much stronger, and indeed more powerful, than it was 30 years ago.</p>\n]]>", "author": "amy", "published": "2017-11-26 21:36:45+00:00", "title": "By: amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Michael #199, I&#8217;d want to see that quote in the actual book, in its context.

[note that in US, the employee pays 6.2% of their income into Old Age Security, up to a maximum of $135K per year, and the employer matches this.  The total amount paid between employer and employee percentage wise in the US is less than half of what is paid in Greece.]  </p>\n<p>Between the 24% VAT, the 29% tax on business profits, and the heavy burden of employer shouldered pension fund payments, it is not uncommon for Greek businesses to end up running at a deficit and shut down.</p>\n<p>Some information on Greek taxes:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-greecehighlights-2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-greecehighlights-2017.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Before 2010, the VAT was at 19% (not 24%) and the business tax on profits was at 25% (not 29%).  It is notable that most Greek small businesses have failed in the last five years, and cannot shoulder the additional 10% combined burden imposed in 2010 of a 5% increase in the VAT and a 5% increase in the business tax on profit.</p>\n<p>It is true that some small Greek businesses do not declare all of their income and operate on a cash only basis, but that is not different from here in the US, where hair stylists, gardeners, taxi drivers, some auto mechanics, etc, want to be paid in cash, in order to avoid declaring their full income. Other than that, I think you would be hard pressed to say that Greeks pay less tax than other Europeans.

Republicans, on the other hand, represent at worst a monetary threat. If we&#8217;re gonna talk about a systemic &#8216;war on education&#8217; the former is a better fit. It&#8217;s more consistently waged; it&#8217;s more inexorable; and the damage it does is more permanent.</p>\n<p>And to view the monetary threat as existential is to ignore the obvious fact that many top universities are at their absolute peak in wealth and influence and have been trending upward in both for decades.

And yet Scott rants about how this tax threatens &#8220;the destruction of graduate education&#8221; &#8211; as if graduate education was in a state of ruin in 2003 because Harvard back then only had $20 Bil, rather than the $40 Bil it now controls.</p>\n<p>In personal terms, I can&#8217;t be happy about this tax because it does present an immediate threat to my own financial security and the financial security of my friends.

I don&#8217;t know of any similar litany of incidents targeted at left-leaning speakers.]</p>\n<p>As for Scott&#8217;s original post, it was the framing I found objectionable &#8211; evil right-wingers attacking the source of all that is good and just in the world. It might not have been clear from my tone of writing, but I do not support this tax in particular.</p>\n<p>In fact, let me state clearly, in one place, my opinion on this specific tax: (a) I am very much against it out of personal interest; (b) I am also <i>politically</i> against it, but only weakly. </p>\n<p>I consider the university system to be suffering from politicization (and I&#8217;ve given several examples of why I think that), and that this stems directly from the fact that the universities have acquired too much political and cultural power. On the one hand, this means that such political power should be checked in some way; on the other, I don&#8217;t think this tax was meant to act as a check, nor do I think it will have any effect like that.</p>\n]]>", "author": "I'm gonna get in trouble for this", "published": "2017-11-30 00:52:07+00:00", "title": "By: I'm gonna get in trouble for this"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@Iggitft#231- Nobody is disputing that left-wingers often treat Red Staters with disdain- indeed, Scott&#8217;s made the point that just as leftists stereotype nerds as Nice Guys TM living in their mother&#8217;s basements, they stereotype rural Red Staters as dumb bigots.

Although we started our lives in different points, in a way I feel we have followed similar paths to our current position of skepticism with respect to the official globalist tune that is promoted in Western academia. </p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to give out too much about me but if there is there is anybody the European Union has benefited is people like, allowing me -at the time- to pursue higher education in several countries, and leveraging that experience to then come here to the United States. And yet, I am also capable of self-criticism and reflection. It is clear that while a few privileged like me benefited from the system, the EU left lots of misery along the way. Other than the fact that Germany and France have not gone to war -as they used to prior to War World II- it is hard to see how the EU has benefited the average person of a EU member state. A Brussels based bureaucratic elite that is accountable to none has more impact in their lives than their duly elected representatives at the member state level.  And in general, globalism has always been about power of the same type: a selected unaccountable elite controlling the destiny of everybody else because they think they know better than ordinary people who usually vote against their interests. That&#8217;s a concept I vehemently oppose and why I find the federal structure of the United States, the electoral college and the separation of powers such visionary concepts. In the  United States, it takes a lot more than the domination of a few institutions -like academia or the media- or a few states -like California, New York and Massachusetts- to have control over the average American.</p>\n<p>Good luck with your lectures at Cornell!</p>\n]]>", "author": "The trouble with gatekeepers", "published": "2017-11-30 15:24:00+00:00", "title": "By: The trouble with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>I would like to challenge the notion that people are stupid if they don&#8217;t vote for what is in their narrow self interest, such as increased government benefits.</p>\n<p>For example, I can easily imagine an African American voter who votes Republican because he believes the identity politics practiced by the Dems is toxic and will eventually damage the fabric of society beyond repair. </p>\n<p>I would not regard such a vote as irrational, or the voter stupid.</p>\n]]>", "author": "T.

Even if universities decided to change their internal accounting rules to zero out graduate school tuition, and Federal funding agencies were somehow allowed to change rules for indirect costs, if the IRS decides something is of economic value, and the tax code does not explicitly consider it deductible, then it is taxable.  In principle, a neighbor giving you eggs is considered income. And if the IRS declares that a graduate education that some university considered &#8220;worth&#8221; $50,000 in 2017 is still &#8220;worth&#8221; $50,000 a year in 2019, then no amount of accounting legerdemain on the part of universities could alter that.
