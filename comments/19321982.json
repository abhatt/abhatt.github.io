But clearly they are not. A situation can be described purely in terms of information storage only in the rest frame of the storing device. In another Lorentz frame information flows with the motion of the device, and the communication facet surfaces. In fact, the Lorentz invariance of the laws of physics must mean that information storage and communication are inextricably linked, and proper understanding of one of them suffices for understanding of the other. Thus far no unified treatment of this sort exists.

Indeed, I would say that we already use something sort of like it in complexity theory, in that lower bounds on one-way communication complexity are routinely used to get lower bounds on the amount of data storage needed in streaming and online computation, and other related models.  (See, e.g., <a href=\"http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0606066\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper</a> by Francois Le Gall.)

This tension is revealed as an uncomfortable feeling that, if the laws of Nature are a simple computer program, then who wrote the program (the position, apparently, of Bekenstein), on the one hand; and, on the other hand, an equally uncomfortable feeling that if we discover anything like this program or think it highly plausible that it could be discovered, then what need is there for any other information on the program, and the question who did or not write the program is meaningless (the position, as far as I can make it out, of Quine and his disciples).</p>\n<p>I share Bekenstein&#8217;s view much more than Quine&#8217;s. Not only is there the question where the simple program came from, there&#8217;s the question how human thinkers came up with the assumptions that justify looking for the simple program. Our contemporary naturalistic view of cause and effect, for example, is radically different from what went under the same name before the Renaissance. You really kind of have to make this assumption of naturalistic, mechanistic cause and effect <i>before</i> you can even get started doing science in the modern sense.</p>\n<p>I would also note that, based on knowing a number of Jewish friends of varying persuasions ranging from haredim to &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; to Reconstructionist to Reform to completely secular, there is a radical loss of interest in science and clinging to Creationism that sets in as one moves from the &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; persuasion further to the right.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Gogins:Michael.html\">Michael Gogins</a>", "published": "2015-08-20 13:56:28+00:00", "title": "By: Michael Gogins"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>BD&#8221;E.
