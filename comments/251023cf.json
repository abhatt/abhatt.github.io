Do you have a lecture theatre that can hold more than 800 people? How many lecturers and TAs will be involved in the course?<br /><br />I am asking because we have had more than 300 first year students for three years in a row and some courses have had more than 400 enrolled students. Those courses are very demanding for one lecturer and a handful of TAs. <br /><br />Thanks for sharing, <br /><br />Luca", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Aceto:Luca.html\">Luca Aceto</a>", "published": "2014-09-11 18:06:34.051000-04:00", "title": ""}]
