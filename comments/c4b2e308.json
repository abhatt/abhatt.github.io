So, I&#8217;m not an expert, but have some background in this questions, and find it very interesting.</p>\n<p>The question implies a single canonical answer, presumably based on energy minimization.  This is formalized as Anfinsen&#8217;s dogma: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfinsen&#039;s_dogma\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfinsen&#039;s_dogma</a></p>\n<p>I see this as the &#8220;algorithmic&#8221; version of the problem, which is the question that Scott presumably answered, and to which I have nothing to add \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>However, from the real-world systems perspective, there are two important facts to keep in mind:</p>\n<p>* First, Anfinsen&#8217;s dogma isn&#8217;t really dogma. Of course, AA sequence is the *main* determinant of structure, but there may well be many locally stable configurations, and biological systems commonly use configurations that are not globally stable.  A great example of this is prions, which are non-functionally folded proteins, where fold configuration itself is infectious: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion</a></p>\n<p>Cells deal with the folding problem in part by using chaperones. This means the folding problem depends on a network of other complex molecules, each with their own complex structure & dynamics.  Also, the cell conditions can vary, including temperature to solute concentrations &#8211; sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, glucose, AMP, ATP, etc., an issue that Anfinsen&#8217;s dogma punts on (&#8220;at the environmental conditions&#8221;).  All of these are regulated by the cell, and have some effect on the energetics of the fold, as well as the chaperone. The extent to which within-cell environmental variation affects fold energetics is an interesting question in and of itself, and could potentially shed light on homeostasic constraints (i.e., how organisms regulate their internal environment).</p>\n<p>* Second, the *functional* structure of a protein in real-world systems is often probabilistic.  The majority of biological proteins are, at least in part, in an aqueous solution at approx room temperature.  In many cases, thermal vibration matters, and is critical to protein function.  Case in point: in the biology literature, protein structures have historically been determined by two predominant methods: x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).  The hard part of crystallography is growing a crystal.  Once that&#8217;s done, inferring a structure is &#8220;easy&#8221; &#8211; you just x-ray it!  NMR structure determination relies on the signals generated by lots of inter-nuclear interactions, and is a bit like a game of Sudoku.  NMR has a critical advantage, though, in that it provides information about the structure *in solution*, which is more biologically relevant.  Part of NMR&#8217;s unique information is what parts of the protein are more or less mobile, which can determine functionality.</p>\n<p>That said, as a biologist, I&#8217;m very excited about the potential of QC in chemistry, as per Scott&#8217;s comments. Immunology in general, and vaccine design in specific, would greatly benefit from &#8220;structural computability&#8221;, even if imperfect.</p>\n]]>", "author": "helmingstay", "published": "2016-09-04 09:12:39+00:00", "title": "By: helmingstay"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Are there any completeness proofs (i.e. Problem X is NP-complete) other than Cook&#8217;s Theorem that do not rely on reductions?

The argument is simply this: you agree that any given Turing machine, on any given input, either halts or doesn\u2019t halt? Well then, every call to a halting oracle has a definite right answer. Therefore, the operation of a TM with a halting oracle is mathematically well-defined at every point in time. Therefore, by the same intuition you used for ordinary TMs, you should conclude that the oracle TM either halts or doesn\u2019t halt, and that there\u2019s a definite fact of the matter about which it does.</p>\n<p>Continuing recursively in this way gets you to definite truth-values for all \u03a0k sentences, for any value of k\u2014and actually further, &#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Those two quotes seem to contradict each other, or at least use different notions of truth. Mine seems to use game semantics, and yours argues that arithmetic sentences have definite truth-values, i.e. allow Platonic semantics. Question: Would you argue against the conclusions from my quote, i.e. that one can accept the existence of Turing machines (including the fact that every Turing machine either halts or doesn&#8217;t halt on the empty input tape), and still reject the existence of Turing machines with access to an oracle for deciding the halting problem of a Turing machine (and be agnostic about whether every Turing machine either halts for all (finite) inputs or doesn&#8217;t halt for some inputs)?</p>\n<p>What do you think about higher-order concepts? For example, are oracle Turing machines a higher-order concept? What is your opinion on the importance of input encoding? For example, are encodings (notations) of ordinal numbers important for ordinal analysis, or is it just important whether an ordinal is computable or not? Are block codes, bifix codes, prefix codes, and recognizable variable length codes (recognized by unambiguous finite state transducers where the only accepting state is the initial state) concepts one should know?</p>\n<p>P.S.: The background story of my quote was not to deny Platonic truth for arithmetic sentences, but to understand the ontological commitments required for the model existence theorem, see <a href=\"http://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/14101/are-there-any-other-things-like-cogito-ergo-sum-that-we-can-be-certain-of/14461#14461\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net/questions/242604/model-existence-and-consistency-conditions-for-pi-10-oracles\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br />\nP.P.S.: I removed a discussion of reasonable input encodings for integers, because this comment is already too long, and the point that Turing machines are unable to reject infinite strings as invalid input is obvious anyway.</p>\n]]>", "author": "gentzen", "published": "2016-09-05 23:28:19+00:00", "title": "By: gentzen"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@Scott</p>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ll probably do another blog post soon, asking whether we should revive the idea of NaderTrading&#8221;</p>\n<p>In a Facebook post Eliezer Yudkowsky suggested that if a NaderTrading-like platform were to be revived, he would want it to acknowledge that Hillary/Trump votes are worth a lot more than third-party votes*, so that each major party vote would be traded for many third-party votes.

The best possible case is that this is a bijection from the B to A (as we have with binary above).  Failing that, hopefully at least we can get a &#8220;canonical form&#8221; map going the other way, back from A to B, that we can easily compute.  (And then we can say that the <i>real</i> encoding is given by restricting B to the image of the canonical form map.)  And if even that fails, well, hopefully we can at least, given two elements of B, check whether they yield the same element of A.</p>\n<p>Binary does great here, as I&#8217;ve said.  Straight-line programs?  Yikes.  You&#8217;ll have many straight-line programs for one number.  None seems particularly canonical.  And I guess checking equality is quick in that you can compute the actual number (in binary), but that just raises the question of why you aren&#8217;t just using binary.</p>\n<p>As for standard operations&#8230; OK, I guess you can add and multiply &#8212; and if you allow subtraction, subtract and take predecessors &#8212; in a trivial fashion, but&#8230; how do you compare?  How do you compare to 0, in particular?  By resorting to binary, it would seem.  Again: Why bother with this?  Just use binary.</p>\n<p>I really do not understand why you would want to ever consider this as an encoding of natural numbers.  (Although there is apparently <i>some</i> reason that a number of people come to, as for whatever reason a number of people have suggested something like this to me.  Most of those people were not mathematicians, though.)  Binary is good.

The syntactic strings were fine for me, but I was unsure about the equivalence relation on them, which is constructed in (the Henkin style proof of) the theorem. I guessed it would be easiest for me to understand it in terms of (oracle) Turing machines. The first realization is that I have to accept the existence of Turing machines and that there\u2019s a definite fact of the matter about whether a TM halts on the empty input tape or not. Otherwise, I cannot even talk about consistency at all.</p>\n<p>Now comes the surprise: The construction of the equivalence relation requires an oracle TM, and the constructed model can itself be seen as an oracle. However, even if we put in the true oracle for HALT, the resulting oracle (i.e. the constructed model) will not be the true oracle for HALT. But even more surprisingly, the model existence theorem doesn&#8217;t really need the true oracle for HALT, any plausible oracle (see below) will do. For the normal Henkin style proof, that oracle has to think/claim that the given axioms (for which we want to construct a model) are consistent, but Noah Schweber showed that <a href=\"http://mathoverflow.net/questions/242604/model-existence-and-consistency-conditions-for-pi-10-oracles/242679#242679\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rosser&#8217;s trick can be used to modify the proof such that even this is not required, as long as the oracle is plausible </a>(and he rigorously defined that notion too).</p>\n<p>OK, I guess you have heard this &#8220;we neither need it, nor is it preserved under &#8230;, hence we don&#8217;t want to assume that it always exists&#8221; attitude before. Even if you would accept that attitude towards existence, you could cite the Shoenfield&#8217;s absoluteness theorem as evidence that it is preserved in the relevant contexts. But my guess is that you basically reject that attitude to define existence based on such utilitaristic considerations. Still, I hope it became clear what it would mean to \u201creject the existence of a Turing machine\u201d (with or without an oracle for HALT).</p>\n<p>Now that I hopefully clarified things, let me link to Quine&#8217;s <a href=\"https://tu-dresden.de/gsw/phil/iphil/theor/ressourcen/dateien/braeuer/lehre/metameta/Quine---On-What-There-Is.pdf?lang=de\" rel=\"nofollow\">On What There Is</a> for some good reasons to reject &#8220;being of possibles (and universals)&#8221;, and the slogan &#8220;To be is to be the value of a variable&#8221; to sum up the criterion of ontological commitment. Finally, here are three different passages I wrote, which convey some feeling what it means for me personally to accept or reject the existence of idealized constructs:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That I can&#8217;t decide arbitrary \u03a01 sentences doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that my all powerful opponent cannot do it either. Maybe he just guesses the answer (if his enormous computational powers should fail to provide him a certain answer), and is so extremely lucky that he guesses right each time (when he plays against an inferior being like me).</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I want to assume the existence of Turing machines, not because I really believe in their physical existence, but because I believe that they will provide a useful and wide ranging abstraction. I want to assume that a \u03a01 sentence is either true or false, because I want falsifiable statements like statements about consistency to be either true or false. I don&#8217;t really know what I want for \u03a02 sentences. Many statements of practical interest are \u03a02 sentences, so I might be willing to bite the bullet and admit that even some unpractical \u03a02 sentences like Goodstein&#8217;s theorem are true, and that in fact every \u03a02 sentence is either true or false. But if this would mean that I also have to admit that every \u03a03 sentence is either true or false, than I may prefer to already deny this for \u03a02 sentences.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>This is only slightly better than the situation for most types of hypercomputation, where it is unclear to me which idealized situations should be modeled by those (I once replied: <a href=\"http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/33892/complexity-classes-p-np-vs-language-hierarchies-rec-re#comment68741_33893\" rel=\"nofollow\">So I need some type of all-knowing miracle machine to solve &#8220;RE&#8221;, I didn&#8217;t know that such machines exists.</a>)</p></blockquote>\n]]>", "author": "gentzen", "published": "2016-09-07 14:08:53+00:00", "title": "By: gentzen"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>In thinking on the wonderfully meta #66 I wonder what the implications would be of discovering a proof that P!=NP vs P=NP is undecidable.

I&#8217;m really not clear on in what way there is even supposed to be a problem here, and without an actual mathematical statement you&#8217;re trying to disprove I think you&#8217;re going to have a hard time convincing me there is one.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Sniffnoy", "published": "2016-09-08 06:44:58+00:00", "title": "By: Sniffnoy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>I could fairly easily write an addon you the reader of this blog could install which would automatically turn text like &#8220;Scott #7&#8221; in existing comments into a link to the comment in question, and add a &#8216;reply&#8217; link to each comment which would give you an inline reply box pre-populated with such a link.</p>\n<p>With a little more effort I could make it such that hovering over such a link would give you a floating box with the comment in question, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/6wPY1\" rel=\"nofollow\">4chan-style</a> (link SFW).</p>\n<p>With much more effort I could automatically rearrange comments into a tree based on post times and which comment they are replying to (assuming they either use the proposed link or the local convention of starting with &#8220;Scott #7&#8221; or similar).
