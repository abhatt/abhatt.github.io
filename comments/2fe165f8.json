[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@Eva Silverstein #136</p>\n<p>What you keep calling a mediocre &#8220;1 sigma&#8221; result is more like an 8 or 18-sigma result as that term is used in physics and in your postings.  It is also an effect size comparable to the difference between the male and female height distribution, where it has easily observed consequences for the disparity in sex distribution of tall people.  Similar effect sizes, also with very high significance levels, are found in other studies and meta-analyses.</p>\n<p>There is a factor of Sqrt(N) lost in the mistranslation between the &#8220;effect size sigma&#8221;, here equal to  about 1, and the &#8220;statistical significance sigma&#8221; that is compared against a normal or t-distribution to obtain a p-value.   Sample size 100 with a Cohen&#8217;s d of 0.99 would mean about 10 sigmas of normal distribution or somewhat lower (converted to a sigma or p-value) when using a t-distribution.   The paper you referenced is paywalled but the abstract suggests the sample sizes were much larger than 100.</p>\n<p>There is a similar change of meaning where you talk about events with &#8220;probability > 0.6&#8221; stuff.    The actual argument (e.g., in Damore&#8217;s memo) about sex differences is that if the male and female distributions are different, there will be a large disproportion of one sex or the other in the upper tail (of height, or interest in computer programming, or desire to work in an elementary school).  You are talking about different probability questions such as what is the probability that a randomly chosen female is more interested in computers than a randomly chosen male, or has higher math test score, or is taller.  Obviously those probabilities will be a lot higher and reflect the fact that the distributions overlap in most of their range (true for most sex differences except physical strength).   But the memo, and Larry Summers, and every similar argument about distributions, is about the upper tails where we find Google programmers and physicists.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Use Siren", "published": "2017-08-17 20:46:51+00:00", "title": "By: Use Siren"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>szopn #228: I find it really hard to buy your argument.

I&#8217;ve pretty clearly distinguished between not discriminating and affirmative action. I&#8217;ll try to rephrase. </p>\n<p>Note: there&#8217;s no question in my mind about discrimination; not that Damore cares about my opinion, political views are protected by CA law (they are not in the more conservative states).<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.workplacefairness.org/retaliation-political-activity#2\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.workplacefairness.org/retaliation-political-activity#2</a></p>\n<p>I am now trying to think through whether affirmative action based on race and gender should imply affirmative action for conservatives. </p>\n<p>I do think there is a difference between discrimination on highly visible unchangeable traits&#8212;such as gender, age and race&#8212;and others such as the beliefs one may hold that are mostly independent of one&#8217;s job (even if one accepts that these beliefs are somehow biologically determined and are unchangeable). You can choose when and who with you will discuss politics, and whether to bring up your views in an interview, and how to present them; you generally have much more control about how they are received. Additionally, some might never want to reveal them for privacy reasons. </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re arguing for affirmative action for conservatives, because conservative political opinion is as visible and as difficult (or more) for SV techies, and because discrimination against conservatives in STEM has as glorious a history as racism and sexism in STEM, you should absolutely make the case. </p>\n<p>What form would the affirmative action take? Should we hire more? Should we try to find out in an interview? Would conservatives want to reveal this information? What about those who preferred not to reveal their political views? Which category would they fall in? How would we know what anyone&#8217;s category was independent of self-reported claims?</p>\n<p>As we&#8217;ve seen described many times, studies have shown that those female or colored job applicants who &#8220;don&#8217;t tell&#8221; their gender or race are more likely to make it to the next step. Conservatives do have the choice to not tell. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;m unlikely to be able to respond further before Scott&#8217;s deadline.

(Maybe I\u2019m getting this wrong? But I\u2019m pretty sure this is true since the normal curve acts like e^{-x^2} instead of a pure exponential).&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yes, you are getting it wrong, but that&#8217;s totally fine, it&#8217;s pretty much one of the most common mistakes practically every human makes about interpreting probability. As far as I am concerned the only reason racism and sexism exists is because people generally don&#8217;t have good intuition about probability. This is the point I want to clarify and then I think we will basically understand each other. </p>\n<p>So, the way I model the interview process is that it checks for a &#8220;high level engineering and programming competence&#8221; ability. So, once we know that a person &#8220;passed&#8221; the interview, from my perspective this is mathematically equivalent to the prior &#8220;they are in the population who have this high level competence.&#8221; And the reality of the world, as we just observe it, is that among the women who have high level competence in engineering fields, they are distributed over a full spectrum of abilities, all of them passing a bar from &#8220;excellent&#8221; to &#8220;top of the field&#8221;. I can attest to this because I&#8217;ve been lectured by brilliant female professors who are the top by any standard, and have had many female colleagues who are just indisputably the very top of the field.</p>\n<p>Now, you might infer that &#8220;looking at the normal curve&#8221; is appropriate in this case to provide some inference, but the point is humans are distributed according to some distribution, but it is simply not necessarily a normal distribution. It&#8217;s close to it for some traits, but not for others. The only thing for which a normal curve is appropriate for is when you have the sum of a bunch of independent random variables&#8230; human traits and characteristics are obviously far more messy than that.</p>\n<p>Anyways, if you&#8217;d like to carry out your argument for why you think that a statement about &#8220;differences in average in a group&#8221; implies &#8220;distribution over the top performing members is skewed lower,&#8221; which I think is what you are getting at, I&#8217;ll let you do the derivation. Whatever that is though, I consider it irrelevant. The observed reality is that at places like Google, or in academia, the skills of both men and women employees are distributed similarly (with, in some cases, fewer absolute numbers of women). So, if your mathematical argument implied something different than this, it is only something that makes me doubt the validity of the bell curve model for the distribution we are talking about.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s one of the key points. Don&#8217;t assume something is Gaussian, that&#8217;s just a model. The underlying reality is what we can actually observe.</p>\n]]>", "author": "J J Lin 2003", "published": "2017-08-17 22:28:44+00:00", "title": "By: J J Lin 2003"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@Dan Staley #232</p>\n<p>&#8221; if your prior is that the average woman is less qualified, then the typical woman who passed the interview process is more likely to have just barely passed [than] the typical man who passed&#8221;</p>\n<p>The interview process isn&#8217;t applied to the whole population (in which case what you say is true), but to a self-selected population of people who became programmers and applied for jobs at Google.
