As such things do, the piece gets widespread media attention, so that motivates mainstream mathematicians to write rebuttal papers.

Some papers point out that, well, OK, yes, Euclid wasn&#8217;t fully precise (by today&#8217;s standards) in stating his axioms, and there&#8217;s a weird (mis)interpretation of them that does lead to something other than what today we would call &#8220;Euclidean geometry,&#8221; and under that misinterpretation, the Pythagorean theorem (along with most facts of elementary geometry) doesn&#8217;t hold.
