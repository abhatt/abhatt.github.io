We often wonder whether the NSA is ahead of open research in factoring algorithms etc.. but one area where it seems that they should have far outpaced open researchers is cryptanalysis of symmetric algorithms including MD4, MD5, SHA-0, SHA-1 etc.. Indeed it seems likely that they have far many more people working on this than academic researchers in this area. But at least from this passage it doesn&#8217;t seem that they were aware in 1994 of the attacks that would come only few years later.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Barak:Boaz.html\">Boaz Barak</a>", "published": "2014-11-19 06:52:09+00:00", "title": "By: Boaz Barak"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Although the material was an interesting read, I have to say that  the comments have been even more entertaining!  <img src=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n]]>", "author": "Dart", "published": "2014-11-19 16:56:21+00:00", "title": "By: Dart"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>There is a difference between the US and Europe regarding areas of cryptography/cryptoanalysis that are funded.
