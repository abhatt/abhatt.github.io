Insightful.</p>\n<p>Well I think you\u2019re right, without some causal mechanism you can point to that can fix something to be different, there\u2019s no way to get a handle on the universe exists question.</p>\n<p>So we need a \u2018multiverse of possible worlds\u2019 to exist, and then we need to point to some causal feature that could be different in the space of possible worlds that would prevent our particular region from existing?  That still wouldn\u2019t explain the existence of multiverse in the first though.</p>\n<p>Excellent answer to the mathematical question in the video, I agree with that.</p>\n<p>But I think we need to consider \u2018existence\u2019 not as an absolute Boolean value (Existence/Non-Existence), but more like a continuous shading (turning the brightness of a light up and down for example).  </p>\n<p>So while I agree with you that at least some mathematical truths \u2018exist\u2019 objectively (these seem like a plausible \u2018ground-state\u2019 for existence) I think that math has a \u2018weaker\u2019 sort of existence than physics.  If you imagine mathematics as the basic \u2018reality fluid\u2019, then physics is the \u2018ice\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s existence is more \u2018solid\u2019 than math.  But the most \u2018solid\u2019 form of existence, I think, resides in the coherent perceptions and explanations of a conscious mind.</p>\n<p>So we can define 3 main \u2018states\u2019 of existence; in order of increasing \u2018solidity\u2019:</p>\n<p>Mathematics >>>> Physics  >>>> Minds</p>\n<p>I think the correct measure of how strongly something exists is COHERENCE.  Coherence seems to be the only measure I can think of that can be applied across all three layers of existence above.  If we imagine \u2018pulling out\u2019 coherence, then \u2018existence\u2019 is lost for all three!  So perhaps we can say that COHERENCE is the reason why the universe exists.</p>\n]]>", "author": "mjgeddes", "published": "2016-02-05 23:14:03+00:00", "title": "By: mjgeddes"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@fred #9 #14</p>\n<p>Actually, you will never die, because there is always one more branch in the m.w.i. where you are kept alive.</p>\n<p>A bit creepy, but good luck to you &#8230;</p>\n]]>", "author": "wolfgang", "published": "2016-02-06 00:24:34+00:00", "title": "By: wolfgang"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Science can find an answer to materialistic nature of universe because this option can be explored & tested experimentally.<br />\nWhile philosophy explores an answer to conscious nature i.e. meaning & purpose of evolution of universe.

My thought is (hopefully, but no promises) less silly, that if MWI is true, the only worlds that should exist are ones that could have evolved to their state with some non-zero probability. The thought experiment is designed to ensure this, since the result is based on the outcome of a single quantum measurement. On the other hand, if it turned out that human lifespan could be described a function similar to &#8220;every year, we die with a probability of n/130, where n is our age&#8221;, then we shouldn&#8217;t expect any worlds with people living to 135.
