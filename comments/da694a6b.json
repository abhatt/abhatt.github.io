These problems are likely hard, to be clear!  Admittedly, the extent to which you should take &#8220;I find these problems hard&#8221; as evidence of &#8220;these problems are hard&#8221; is unclear.  Still, my assessment is that these problems seem hard.</p>\n<p>(Also, I don&#8217;t think any of these are well-known problems or have anything really out there written about them, but it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve tried to do much in the way of a literature search here; I could be wrong.)</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just going to write some short summaries here; details will be in links.</p>\n<p><b>Problem 1: A greedy coloring of the natural numbers</b></p>\n<p>This problem is due to Joshua Zelinsky.  Here&#8217;s an old unsolved problem: Is there a finite coloring of the positive integers such that for all (n,m)&ne;(2,2), n+m and n*m get different colors?  My understanding is that the expected answer is no.</p>\n<p>Josh asks the following variant: Say we greedily color the positive integers so as to satisfy this constraint.  I.e., are colors will be the positive integers, and we will color them in order, assigning each the lowest color we can so as to be consistent with what&#8217;s been assigned so far.  Can we at least show that this particular coloring uses infinitely many colors?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a little more about this problem <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~haltman/sillyprob.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, in which I also describe some other patterns appearing in this coloring that I&#8217;d like to see proven.</p>\n<p><b>Problem 2: Playing Snake on finite graphs</b></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we consider the game of Snake, but instead of playing on a grid, we play on an arbitrary finite graph.  For which graphs does the player have a winning strategy?</p>\n<p>Well, if H is a spanning subgraph of G, and H is winnable, then so is G.  Therefore it makes sense to focus on the minimal winnables, thus that become unwinnable when any edge is removed.  I&#8217;ve found three (or, depending on how you count, five) families of minimal winnables.  And, on graphs of 8 or fewer vertices, I&#8217;ve manually verified that these are all.  Unfortunately my method just becomes too difficult to carry out once you go up to 9 vertices.</p>\n<p>Question: Are these really all the minimal winnables?  Frankly, it seems ridiculous that they should be &#8212; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m calling the idea that they are a conjecture &#8212; but I don&#8217;t have a counterexample.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve written more about this problem, and some other questions we can ask about Snake on graphs, <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~haltman/snake.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

I&#8217;m just going to point to where I asked it on MathOverflow <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/204498/what-if-homotopy-were-expanded-to-allow-any-connected-space-instead-of-0-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Problem 4: The classical analogue of PDQP</b></p>\n<p>This is one I can&#8217;t point you to a webpage for but have written about before in the comments here, so I&#8217;ll link to that. \ud83d\ude42  I&#8217;ve also asked Scott, and Adam Bouland, about it before &#8212; so who knows, may want to talk to them, maybe they&#8217;ve done more with it that I don&#8217;t know about &#8212; but I feel like it&#8217;s worth publicizing again. \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>Basically: In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6507\" rel=\"nofollow\">this paper</a>, Scott, Adam Bouland, Joseph Fitzsimmons, and Mitchell Lee introduced a model of computation where we imagine we have a quantum state we are working with, only in addition to being able to measure parts of it in the ordinary way, we are also allowed to do magical &#8220;non-collapsing measurements&#8221;.  They pointed out that, among other things, in this model, all of SZK can be solved in polynomial time (SZK&subseteq;PDQP), the collision problem can be solved in constant time, and the unstructured search problem can be solved in time O(n^1/3) while requiring time &Omega;(n^1/4).</p>\n<p>In the comments on <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2096\">this post</a>, I noted that we can define a classical analogue of this model, in which we work not with a quantum state but an ordinary classical probability distribution (on which we can perform magical &#8220;non-destructive samples&#8221; \ud83d\ude42 ); and that much of what was in the paper above doesn&#8217;t actually depend on the quantum aspects and so is still true in this weaker model.  In particular, even without the quantum aspects, SZK is still polynomial-time (thanks to Adam Bouland for that observation), and the collision problem is still constant-time.</p>\n<p>But what about the search problem?  I have an algorithm in this model that shows that it&#8217;s at most O(n^1/2).  But can we get any corresponding &Omega;(n^1/k) lower bound?</p>\n<p>What with me not really being a complexity theorist &#8212; this is another one from category (2) &#8212; I thought I&#8217;d post it here (again \ud83d\ude1b ).</p>\n<p>(Maybe I should ask this one on cstheory.stackexchange?
