He&#8217;s talking about a possibility where, when you enter a time, what the computer would store would <i>actually be a specific instant of time</i>, but rather a sort of &#8220;floating time&#8221; object that would represent different instants depending on your current time zone, an object that would be dynamically cashed out to different instants only when necessary.  So if you enter &#8220;4 PM&#8221;, knowing that your&#8217;e going to be in California, the computer doesn&#8217;t attempt to guess that you&#8217;ll be in California and adjust the instant it stores appropriately &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t store an instant at all.  It stores an object that represents &#8220;4 PM&#8221;, and then when it actually needs to use this object, such as to check whether to trigger a notification, it notices that you are currently in California and interprets it as &#8220;4 PM Pacific time&#8221;.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting such a solution is easy or bulletproof; other people have already pointed out pitfalls with it (it doesn&#8217;t work for the phone call case).
