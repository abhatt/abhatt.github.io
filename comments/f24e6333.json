Which was not a set of ideas he&#8217;d expected. Maddeningly, the humanists are correct: science is a human endeavor, its values and methods and foci chosen and devised by humans, and these things are indeed the area of study of the humanists. So Sokal arrived to find himself and indeed science objects of inquiry.</p>\n<p>As I recall, the NYU crowd was not particularly friendly, which is something that maybe isn&#8217;t, or shouldn&#8217;t be, unexpected when the sciences are funded at 1000x the level of humanities. Which usually prompts some sort of response about the tangible value of science, to which I blandly respond with someting about the tangible expense of failing to have a well-framed and functional government. Very expensive not having a sense of history or political philosophy, also not having language to with which to frame laws and stir hearts.</p>\n<p>Anyway. It seems to me we jumped over the problem of the social sciences&#8217; reliance on models, abstracted and pared versions of reality, and how these require their own vocabulary. Science, when not being Very Serious about its models, tends to go for whimsy in the naming, which at this point I find irritating, but that&#8217;s how they do. Science can afford some whimsy; social sciences and especially humanities, living in cardboard boxes, has to dress sharp in order to be taken seriously, so they put on the fancy language duds.</p>\n<p>Let me suggest something, Scott, and it&#8217;s a thing I see very often in scientific writing: in universityland, students learn to use words that name concepts before they understand the concepts. They&#8217;re just out there throwing chunks of language around, learning to sound the part. Unfortunately, many of them never notice that they don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re talking about; they just learn syntax. So when they go out and have arguments with people about these things, whether in or out of academia, they&#8217;re just tossing language around as a means of gesturing at some quarter-grasped notion attached to something felt or seen. They&#8217;re not any too precise. And at this point we return to aspergerishness, because this sort of thing is guaranteed to drive the susceptible up a wall. The problem is that few people who engage in these conversations are at all likely to see a need for precision and clean, deep understanding of concepts and their provenance. Most people aren&#8217;t that sharp, particularly with language, and no, that doesn&#8217;t mean you can dismiss them from political argument. It does mean that instead of demanding precision they haven&#8217;t got, you must try to understand what they do mean, in all its cloudiness, and why.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Amy", "published": "2015-10-25 01:44:21+00:00", "title": "By: Amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Anonymous85 #209: I just tried, and got only 7 out of 16 correct!

I think the short version is, you can treat people as evidence or you can treat them as fellow arguers, but you can&#8217;t do both at once&#8230; unless they let you do so, and are willing to treat themselves as evidence, which lots of people aren&#8217;t.  And that&#8217;s often how you get the best evidence about them.</p>\n<p>Long version now.  Say you have an interesting argument going and someone jumps in and starts saying things that aren&#8217;t very clear.  You ask them to clarify particular points.  How do they respond?  Here are some possibilities:<br />\nA.) Actually clarifying &#8212; it turns out they had a clear idea all along and just didn&#8217;t express it well<br />\nB.) &#8220;Hm, I&#8217;m not so sure, now that you mention it.  I think I intended something rougly along the following lines. [&#8230;] Here are some more precise possibilities. [&#8230;] Evidence for and against each one: [&#8230;]&#8221; (or just some subset of this, possibly just &#8220;Honestly, now that you mention it, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;)<br />\nC.) Just further unclear verbiage, with no acknowledgement of inclarity<br />\nD.) Same as (C), but now with a demand that you accept what they are saying in the form that they are saying it and cease your distortions of it</p>\n<p>(A), of course, is great.  (B) means you&#8217;re potentially in for a lot of work, but it is helpful, it is furthering the discussion, and it&#8217;s frequently necessary and unavoidable.  (C) is, well, not an improvement.  (D) is terrible.</p>\n<p>So basically we have two ways of treating what people are saying: As arguments, to be taken as arguments and appropriately picked apart, or simply as phenomena, of evidence towards some more general pattern to be explained.  Generally clear things go under the former and unclear things go under the latter.  It&#8217;s OK for some things to go under both (though usually not at the same time).  Maybe you make an argument, thinking it makes sense, then people point out the problems with your concepts, you realize you&#8217;re not so sure what you actually mean, and it gets filed under evidence instead.  That&#8217;s fine; that&#8217;s (B) above.</p>\n<p>(And this is how you get a lot of the best evidence &#8212; take something unclear, point out something that doesn&#8217;t make sense, get the person who originally stated it to try to fix it, iterate heavily.)</p>\n<p>So you don&#8217;t have to be clear; the rule shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;be clear or be silent&#8221;.  But you should be clear on how clear you&#8217;re attempting to be (lampshading goes a long way!), and if it turns out you fell short, you should accept that and reclassify.  (Unless you were really were clear, in which case you should be able to argue for that!)</p>\n<p>So far this is all good.  The problem is those Cs and Ds &#8212; especially the Ds.  There seem to be a lot of people out there who want simultaneously to 1. be unclear, 2. not to have to in any way mark this, 3. not to have to admit this, 4. not to have to argue for this, 5. not to have to in any way clarify themselves, and 6. in fact really everyone they&#8217;re talking to should just shut up and accept what they say as it is.  They&#8217;re certainly not going to stand for multiple iterations of refining their concepts; they can&#8217;t admit that their concepts could possibly have any flaws in the first place.</p>\n<p>And hey &#8212; what these people say can certainly be useful&#8230; as evidence to be examined.  But you can&#8217;t treat such a person as a fellow arguer.  No way.</p>\n<p>So what are your options?  I guess it depends on just who you care about correctness among.  Some possibilities:<br />\n1.) If you just want to get the correct answer yourself, well, you&#8217;re going to have a hard time going it alone, but you don&#8217;t need to treat anyone as a fellow arguer.  There&#8217;s no group to wreck.  But I think most of us want a bit more than to just personally know the answer.<br />\n2.) If you have some tiny insulated group that has no problem with kicking out arbitrary people to maintain its borders, again, there&#8217;s no problem.  If someone starts being a problem, you kick them out.  But once again, does this really suffice for anyone?<br />\n3.) If you&#8217;re like me, what you want is is for &#8220;your people&#8221; to get the right answer &#8212; where &#8220;your people&#8221; is a very large group, too large for anyone to manage, but still having the property that <i>notionally</i> people in this group ought to be good truth-seekers (and possibly making a claim to that effect).  Unfortunately, despite such claims, what actually gets someone accepted as a group member may have little to do with this.  And such groups can be subverted and turned to epistemic closure and partisan hackery if they don&#8217;t recognize the threat of people trying to pervert the norms of discouse.  (Which is what the (D)s above try to do, at first subtlely, and then, once they&#8217;ve convinced you it&#8217;s OK, blatantly.)  And, y&#8217;know, this happens.  And you can to some extent get a new group, but it&#8217;s still a failure; you&#8217;re fleeing because the goal failed.<br />\n4.) And if you want society in general to get the right answer&#8230; well, I have no idea how anyone would accomplish that.</p>\n<p>So yeah &#8212; we do need to &#8220;try to understand what they do mean, in all its cloudiness, and why.&#8221;  But the best way to do that is to actually include them in their own decipherment, and for that to happen, they need to not screw things up, by for instance refusing to acknowledge when they&#8217;re unclear or objecting to any attempt to suggest that we need to interpret what they said in some alternate fashion.  If you merely want (2) you can kick them out, but then you lose out on a good source of information.  It would be much preferable to not have to kick them out, and frequently, it&#8217;s simply not a possibility in the first place.  So how do we get them to behave?</p>\n]]>", "author": "Sniffnoy", "published": "2015-10-25 07:38:49+00:00", "title": "By: Sniffnoy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Anonymous85 #209, Scott #211</p>\n<p>Fun test! </p>\n<p>I got 13/16 right merely by guessing whether any of the markings required more fine motor control than a toddler has.

They aren&#8217;t going to give you a reason, they&#8217;re only going to say the things they say, over and over again. As people do, only less stylistically. </p>\n<p>Argument is only a form of discourse, a kind of rhetoric. How it&#8217;s sung &#8212; you know, when that dopey mess of a half-educated student is ranting at you about, I don&#8217;t know, Bernie, when he has zero context for what kind of guy Bernie actually is, you need to just shut up and watch him. The kid, I mean. The kid&#8217;s own theatre is what you get for communication. The urgency, the way he moves, where the stresses in his speech are, which bits are plainly canned and which are his own, he is telling you something. If you pay attention only to the clarity of the text&#8217;s reason you&#8217;re missing the show. I&#8217;m thinking of Beneatha in A Raisin in the Sun, now, too &#8212; she has all kinds of reason and very tight rhetoric but what it shows you is that she&#8217;s out of her mind, she can&#8217;t live the way she does, she&#8217;s groping around seeking in a cudgel-of-scholarly-authority way she wants badly to have work, because she&#8217;s a kid, and she&#8217;s representative. </p>\n<p>In other words, the kind of argumentation you&#8217;re talking about is of limited use when people are talking &#8212; one way or another &#8212; about themselves.

I didn&#8217;t know what it was but I trusted that if I looked long enough I&#8217;d understand. That was right. Curiously &#8212; and this is to do with Jochem&#8217;s thing about context, taken literally &#8212; I find it much easier to see and hear these things outside museums and symphony halls, when you don&#8217;t have the importance of the institutions to contend with. Either way &#8212; if it doesn&#8217;t speak to you, then it doesn&#8217;t, and I see no point in hanging around for baloney culture reasons.

You get some real inanity that way. (You also get some genuinely funny and well-executed things, but that&#8217;s still not where the action is in art.)

But I wanted to share some final thoughts, which I hope will answer a large number of the comments I still haven&#8217;t answered.</p>\n<p>Of the dozens of critical comments I received, the one that made me think the most about what I was trying to say&#8212;for which I&#8217;m genuinely grateful!&#8212;was that of Susebron #128:</p>\n<ul>It seems to me that the problem you describe is not that plain language isn\u2019t used, but that it is used when it shouldn\u2019t be. Which, as far as I can tell, is the opposite of the problem you describe in the original post. If plain language should serve, then what would you name the concept of \u201cprivilege\u201d if not \u201cprivilege\u201d? If the problem is that the concept of \u201cprivilege\u201d gets conflated with the connotations of the plain word privilege, then why should people not come up with jargon which is disconnected from prior connotations?</ul>\n<p>Susebron and others are entirely right that my complaint, in this post, is not with abstruse academic jargon <i>per se</i>.  Yes, such jargon sometimes leads to hilarious results, as in the following sentence by the famous Berkeley theorist Judith Butler, which took first place in the 1998 <a href=\"http://denisdutton.com/bad_writing.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bad Writing Contest</a>:</p>\n<ul>The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition, convergence, and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure, and marked a shift from a form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects to one in which the insights into the contingent possibility of structure inaugurate a renewed conception of hegemony as bound up with the contingent sites and strategies of the rearticulation of power.</ul>\n<p>Yes, there are academic subcultures that stand eternally condemned for harboring sentences like that one in their midst.  But to be brutally honest, <i>if that were all there was to it, I wouldn&#8217;t care that much.</i>  I&#8217;d happily leave it to Alan Sokal to save the far left from itself, and leave it to my many friends in the social sciences and humanities to fight for clarity in their own fields.  After all, in some sense, the sentence above is a model of clarity and concision: in a mere 94 words, it completely answers the question of whether anyone should spend time studying Judith Butler.  So if the critical theorists were content with contentless puffery, people with scientific temperaments could respond by just &#8220;routing around&#8221; them, as Tim May #115 advocated.</p>\n<p>And as I acknowledged in the OP, there can even be social scientists and humanities scholars with <i>legitimate needs</i> for jargon: for example, those using a technical tool, like statistics or Chomskyan formal grammar.</p>\n<p>The problem, from my perspective, arises only when the social thinkers want to have it both ways: when they want to both (a) phrase all their arguments within a complicated, non-common-sense theoretical framework, and (b) treat those arguments as morally binding even on people <i>outside</i> the framework.</p>\n<p>To say it another way: I freely admit that I can be wrong about factual questions for abstruse theoretical reasons (indeed I often am).  I also admit that I can be wrong about moral questions for simple human reasons.  <i>But I don&#8217;t acknowledge the possibility that I can be wrong about a moral question for an abstruse theoretical reason.</i></p>\n<p>If you show me that I wronged someone, I&#8217;ll take that <i>extremely</i> seriously, and will probably obsess to the point of OCD about how to make restitution.  But whatever I did wrong must be explicable in plain language&#8212;for example, by telling me the actual stories of actual conscious beings who I harmed through malice or recklessness.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a full understanding of my wrongdoing might involve some complicated science, as well as consideration of probabilities and the remote future (e.g., if my sin involved releasing potent greenhouse gases).  But even in those cases, you ought to be able to &#8220;black-box&#8221; the scientific parts of your case against me, and state the moral part in straightforward human terms.</p>\n<p>What I won&#8217;t tolerate&#8212;can&#8217;t tolerate, while remaining psychologically healthy&#8212;is someone telling me that I should feel shame and guilt over something I did, but for moral reasons that only make sense within a Marxist framework, or an SJW framework, or a fundamentalist religious framework, or any other system that takes years of study to understand.  Was I racist or sexist or homophobic to someone?  Then that can be explained easily, and I&#8217;ll feel terrible about it and repent.  But was I simply &#8220;blind to my nerd technical privilege&#8221;?  Then sorry, but I won&#8217;t repent for crimes that I couldn&#8217;t even explain to (say) Mark Twain or Bertrand Russell or Alan Turing and have them understand what I was talking about.  I have too many <i>real</i> shortcomings to beat myself up over the fake ones.</p>\n<p>From this perspective, the problem with the word &#8220;privilege&#8221; is precisely that it moves so freely between the two worlds, that of social theory and that of real acts with real moral consequences.  As many commenters pointed out, it&#8217;s not an especially abstruse word, but it&#8217;s a deceiver, a trickster, a word that slimes well-meaning people with moral guilt without ever needing to identify a victim or a specific crime.  It would be fine as an everyday word, and <i>also</i> fine as a technical word; it&#8217;s only not fine as a chameleon, as a concept that creeps up and bites you, then scurries back to the theoretical realm before you can catch it and force it to explain itself.  It seems to me that many other social-justice words (&#8220;entitled,&#8221; &#8220;patriarchal,&#8221; &#8230;) do double-duty in just the same way.</p>\n<p>Anyway, when I talk about jargon, <i>this</i> is the phenomenon I&#8217;m complaining about.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2015-10-25 17:23:53+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott #230: good post.

And because she&#8217;s a product of this town, she&#8217;s been taught since infancy not to complain or ask favors and certainly not to parade her family&#8217;s business around to strangers.

As it happened, the media scholars were correct, there was an ideological agenda.

(Objecting to the assumption &#8220;that the infinite complexities of human life break down into neat, easily defined and quantifiable categories.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Here is a related discussion, I had with a close colleague, Avishai, in 95 at the IAS. The issue was that of systematic bias against women in academia and what should be done about it. (Of course, this is a description from memory.)</p>\n<p>(Below I will use the term &#8220;privilege&#8221; with its English meaning.)</p>\n<p>Avishai&#8217;s position was that the real problem is not bias against women but biases and injustice for many reasons. People are disadvantaged if they are little weird, if they are less socially connected, if there are more candid and less &#8220;diplomatic,&#8221; and for many other reasons unrelated to academic excellence. It is true that all these little biases, averaged out, may be more disadvantageous to women, but he argued that  we need to study injustice in academic decisions as a whole, correct those biases on case-by-case basis, and not pay special attention to the division between genders. </p>\n<p>The difficulty Avishai saw in targeting genders separately applies to the more general situation of gender bias.  If, for example, we will set a mechanism that will improve the situation of the most privileged women and harm men across the board. Is it just? desirable? or even worse, we may harm the most unprivileged among the men, and help the most privileged among women, leading to little more balance between genders and much more imbalance within the genders.</p>\n<p>My position was (and still is) different.  I  thought that, the problems regarding the representation and status of women in academia and related matters regarding relations across genders, make it necessary to deal with this issue separately. I also thought the effort to change the situation regarding genders represented in academia and the status of women there, the emerging mechanisms to make such a change, and  the social change such a change may bring, will be beneficial to the other forms of academic biases and injustice, that Avishai talked about. And also here, my point of view extends for greater generality. (Putting jargon aside it may be related to some essential difference of opinions among us.)</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kalai:Gil.html\">Gil Kalai</a>", "published": "2015-10-25 23:02:56+00:00", "title": "By: Gil Kalai"}]
