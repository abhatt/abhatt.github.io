My vision of &#8216;educational reform&#8217; consists more of rolling tumbrels and nice shiny guillotines being erected&#8230;</p>\n<p>  Okay, hyperbole aside, there are two things about the current system that bring out my inner Saint Just.    The first is how it shores up the class system, the second is the abomination called the &#8220;PhD&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>Just to take the easy one first, the number of people I know who have done PhDs and have just been chewed up by the system &#8211; and, yes, these are STEM PhDs &#8211; and produced little or nothing is ludicrous.  When you take the smartest and most driven people on the planet and work them like dogs, and still get so little out &#8211; <i> something has gone wrong</i>.  What that something is, is the disconnect between the number of tenured positions and the number of postgrads.  Less than 1% of postgrads ever make prof.  So what happens is too many young minds get mauled by psycho careerists.  Here, read this and see how many people agree with it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.devicerandom.org/2011/02/18/getting-a-life/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.devicerandom.org/2011/02/18/getting-a-life/</a></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a really good reason  that all, repeat, <i>all</i> the people I know in my field (biology) doing good, innovative work decided to drop out and start up.</p>\n<p>The even worse case is how the University as an institution shores up the <b>class system</b>.  A good working definition of a class system is that it&#8217;s more important who you know than what you can do (I&#8217;m drawing on Isabell Patterson&#8217;s distinction between the Society of Status vs the Society of Contract).  I&#8217;m a beneficiary of some pretty elite universities and I studied STEM.  What I got to see, over and over, was people who didn&#8217;t study this or didn&#8217;t study at those universities assured that &#8220;a career&#8221; was waiting for them just by virtue of &#8220;having a degree&#8221;.  And then come graduation it was &#8220;thanks for the cash, here&#8217;s your worthless paper, enjoy working at Starbucks&#8221;.  </p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t those poor students fault.  They&#8217;d been systematically given false information their entire lives.  If any other industry pulled a stunt on this scale, we&#8217;d have the greatest lawsuit in history.  Yet because it is &#8220;education&#8221;&#8230;</p>\n<p>Anyway, I look at Germany where I know many people who went straight into apprenticeships after school, are now running their own offices and owning their own homes.  Please tell me that&#8217;s not better than the fate of the 20-something sociology student in the US.  The scandal isn&#8217;t the waste of money but the far worse waste of people.</p>\n<p>  Since you&#8217;re teaching <b>Computer Science</b> let me say that CS is the exception that proves the rule&#8230; but the rule survives the proving with ease.  See, your field is way closer to the way formal, theoretical education got started in the Renaissance (c.f. Jacques Barzun, <i>From Dawn To Decadence</i>).  What happened was that different guilds got together to compare notes, and started working out larger theoretical systems that let them do better and better.  The point is they were teaching theoretical knowledge to people who already had vast amounts of practical experience &#8211; and so could actually make good use of the theoretical knowledge, could embody it in their work.  That seems similar to what you&#8217;re doing &#8211; many of your students will surely have prior coding experience, and all will be constantly gaining it.  So don&#8217;t worry: come the revolution, the howling mob will be sparing your department.</p>\n<p>My tuppence.
