I had a short discussion with my friend who said computer systems research like Networks or Operating Systems or databases is not real research they are nothing but engineering prototypes or an engineering approach. His opinion is one doesn&#8217;t have to be bright or talented to do CS systems research(common sense is enough) but on the contrary for CS theory one has to be talented and bright because it requires lot of advanced math knowledge. He said this is one of the reasons why CS theory people doesn&#8217;t want to approach systems research but do not disdain or look system research as mediocre area. I have to accept his opinion as valid and true. Even if CS theory scientists ignore system research there is nothing to be offended because it is difficult to do  theory research. Sometimes  I have seen I can understand few systems publication but not theory publications. It doesn&#8217;t mean research has to be hard and complicated. We can see very few thriving  cstheory departments at the universities whereas Isee many people doing many cs systems research at the universities and most of the research are repetitive. Personally I will not be offended if  cs theory people ignore Systems research or consider systems research as a low activity.
