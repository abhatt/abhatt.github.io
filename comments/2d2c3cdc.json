In the usual setup, however, the Chooser does not have access to the Predictor: the Chooser is \u201cordinary\u201d (we\u2019re to imagine a being much like ourselves), and the Predictor is flat-out more powerful. In that case you don\u2019t get a contradiction (at least, not without some additional assumptions from decision theory), but \u201cmerely\u201d a very interesting dilemma faced by the Chooser.&#8217;</p>\n<p>Thanks for your response, I appreciate your time! That makes sense. Is it possible to simply know if the Predictor is or is not &#8220;halted&#8221; within the bounds of the paradox? To me, being able to know the answer to that question at any time T I choose is essentially the same thing as being able to peer inside the Predictor, maybe examine source code, or do other actions to determine if it will &#8220;halt&#8221; in the future. Because, regardless of how much &#8220;access&#8221; I have to the Predictor, the Predictor&#8217;s job is still essentially the same (&#8220;will I halt at time T?&#8221;). I don&#8217;t know how &#8220;time&#8221; formally plays into the bounds of the paradox, but I envision &#8220;reducing&#8221; myself to a very simple &#8220;machine&#8221; w.r.t. the Predictor:</p>\n<p>1.) I walk into the room. There are two boxes and I can pick box b or both a & b.</p>\n<p>2.) I wait some amount of time T which I determine at random in the moment (maybe I pick it beforehand, maybe I just stand around awhile until I feel like making my observation). At the end of that time, I observe if the Predictor has &#8220;halted&#8221;. Maybe there&#8217;s a glowing red LED on the front and I observe whether or not that LED is still lit to determine if it has &#8220;halted&#8221;, or some other set of physical indicators that show the machine&#8217;s current state. This requires me to know &#8220;something&#8221; about the Predictor, but I don&#8217;t need to know anything beyond what I can physically observe in the moment. If the Predictor is some super-intelligent being, then I observe whether or not said being is &#8220;alive&#8221; at the moment.</p>\n<p>3.) If the Predictor has &#8220;halted&#8221;, I take both boxes. Otherwise I take box b.</p>\n<p>It seems that if I want to limit this to a purely decision-theory problem, it&#8217;s necessary to completely isolate the Predictor from me so I can&#8217;t make a decision based on its current observed state. It also seems that by making my decision in this way, I win because an inherent property of the Predictor seems to be that it doesn&#8217;t halt/die at random points in time. Hence predicting that it will be &#8220;alive&#8221;/not halted is a safe bet. Also, this implies that &#8220;oracle&#8221;-like access to the Predictor is, in the context of this problem, essentially the same as being able to observe the Predictor&#8217;s current state in some way.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Andrew", "published": "2018-08-09 05:22:04+00:00", "title": "By: Andrew"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@Andrew 29:<br />\nAssuming the usual rules, the Predictor has already halted by the time you are offered the choice.
