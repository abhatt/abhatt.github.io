[{"content": "I too liked Gilligan&#39;s Island, and it must have had a subconscious effect on me in the 1960s, or maybe it dives deep in all of us.  Since the 1960s, I&#39;ve had my share of virtual shipwrecks, some of them mistakes I made at Harvard.  I lived on a tropical island paradise and experienced hurricanes and their monstrous seas.  I&#39;ve met truly courageous people.  I spent time with the beautiful people (the Gingers and the Mary Annes) and hung out briefly with the the Howells, though I&#39;ve never been money-rich.  I&#39;ve been a skipper, I&#39;ve certainly been a Gilligan.  I even taught for four years, though I was never as smart as the Professor.  I got off the island, though I often wish I was still on it.  I miss the Professor, but I liked and was inspired by the whole crew, the teamwork, the camaraderie, the adventure.", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Knauth:Geoff.html\">Geoff Knauth</a>", "published": "2014-01-17 08:49:25.313000-05:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "Thanks for the comment Geoff.
