[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Very interesting, thanks!</p>\n<p>Btw, John Conway developed also an algorithm (actually a full Turing complete machine) to generate prime numbers.

This program generates indeed a long list of numbers and only those in power of 2 have an prime number exponent. Problem is that for finding large prime number through such exponents, you must wait a very long time before to re observe such a power.</p>\n<p>Best,<br />\nLaurent</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/j/Jacques:Laurent.html\">Laurent Jacques</a>", "published": "2015-08-19 20:54:21+00:00", "title": "By: Laurent Jacques"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Hi,<br />\nYou should also take a look at this draft showing that simple and clever tricks can make gcd algorithms sligthly more efficient for searching primes<br />\n<a href=\"http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/moritz/oeis/cloitre.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/moritz/oeis/cloitre.pdf</a></p>\n]]>", "author": "Cloitre", "published": "2015-08-19 21:32:51+00:00", "title": "By: Cloitre"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Thanks for mentioning FRACTRAN; I should have included it.
