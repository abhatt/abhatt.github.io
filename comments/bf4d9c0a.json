For instance, I did indicate that no matter what the specifics of the design, at each stage, the input and output must exclusively be only mechanical, and that each stage should independently produce a persistent record (such as a punched card) of both its inputs and outputs for later verification (whether 100% or statistically sampled). </p>\n<p>I seem to already have spent more than 10 minutes on it, haven&#8217;t I?&#8230; So, OK. Here&#8217;s my proposal.</p>\n<p>Let me think more about it, and come up with a concrete design or two, and send some documentation about it by email directly to Alex, with a cc to you. I would do that if and only if Alex would take my suggestions seriously enough to go through the (brief) documentation, and try to think of all possible attacks it is susceptible to, and let me know. I will then revise it, and send the revision, though I will keep the revisions down to only a few iterations (say fewer than five, to get the proposal going). If that&#8217;s OK by you two, let me know, say by reply at this blog, and I will soon begin work on it (though can&#8217;t commit time-frames&#8212;am too busy, and this is not one of my primary fields of interest). </p>\n<p>Speaking of right this moment, I am looking forward to having a delicious dinner, and so must drop this conversation right where it is, but before I sign off for the time being, here are a few further notings.</p>\n<p>If a chip can be surreptitiously replaced within 10 seconds, why not dump the electronic circuit part of it into a block of cold-setting resin at the time of manufacture? say with a couple of sprinklings of that dust of RFID into the resin (circuit-wise completely independent) such that each block can be non-destructively proded for its identity any time you desire? &#8230; If the public wants a simple visual interface, why must it be a GUI (on a computer)? Why can&#8217;t it be a color printout stuck in a non-replaceable way (and with procedural checks thrown in to ensure that it was not replaced) on to the very voting module of the EV System itself? In India, since a lot of our population is illiterate, we manage to pull through our elections using even graphical symbols for parties/independent candidates. These are simply B&W printed lists that are stuck next to the EVM buttons. They work. And, coming to the American public, even if it insists on only a HD GUI on an electronic monitor/computer display, OK, fine. Give them that. Just make sure to physically isolate it completely (right from their immediate power-sources) from the EVM&#8217;s voting module proper. By EVM&#8217;s voting module, I mean a counter, really speaking. The punching machine to specify the vote on to a punching card would be mechanically and physically separate. </p>\n<p>As to the electronic parts, my design would rely on the idea that whatever I program in C++, it can, in principle, be produced in pure hardware, without a single software component to it. </p>\n<p>&#8230; Anyway, I realize I&#8217;ve begun getting into more details than can make sense to you (or anyone else). So let me stop here, and await Alex&#8217;s and your nod. If both of you&#8212;and particularly, Alex&#8212;agrees, I will write a documentation on a proposed system or two that is practical enough, and, of course, safe enough.</p>\n<p>Thanks for highlighting this issue itself though. </p>\n<p>Bye for now, and take care,</p>\n<p>&#8211;Ajit<br />\nPS: I will check back tomorrow (say 24 hours later) or later. But, yes, I am willing to take this as a challenge&#8212;I mean, in a positive spirit. And I think as a good engineer (that&#8217;s what I imagine myself to be) I should be able to meet it&#8212;even if the first version or two may not be all that safe, in the sense, you know, it always helps to have another pair of eyes. And it would be beyond wonderful if those happen to come from groups like Alex&#8217;s (not to mention the general public at large). OK. Enough is enough.
