He has an Orthodox Jewish daughter and son-in-law, but he was also advised by the white nationalist Bannon and refused to condemn neo-Nazis, and obviously the tension doesn&#8217;t weigh too heavily on him.</p>\n<p>Regarding the Jerusalem thing, I suppose like many Jews around the world I have mixed feelings about it.  On the one hand, it&#8217;s an obvious fact that Jerusalem <i>is</i> the capital of Israel (i.e., the seat of its government), and will remain so as long as Israel exists.  So Trump&#8217;s latest international incident was at least prompted by his saying something truthful&#8212;which puts it in something like the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of all the international incidents he&#8217;s caused! \ud83d\ude42</p>\n<p>On the other hand, because Israel has so badly wanted the US to say that truthful thing, there&#8217;s been this game for decades where the US has dangled it as a carrot to try to induce Israel into a peace deal (which, of course, the Netanyahu government <i>does</i> need to be induced into, kicking and screaming).  So Trump effectively gave away this major prize for nothing&#8212;which would count as doofus diplomacy if it were diplomacy at all, rather than what it obviously is, namely more red meat for Trump&#8217;s evangelical base, damn the external consequences.  I would&#8217;ve preferred following the policy of previous US administrations, which is that Jerusalem gets recognized as the capital as part of a peace deal and only then.</p>\n<p>Note that I&#8217;ve avoided making any argument of the form, &#8220;you shouldn&#8217;t say that Jerusalem is Israel&#8217;s capital, because if you do there might be violent protests in Gaza or the West Bank or elsewhere in the Muslim world.&#8221;  Thankfully, that worry seems so far to have been overblown&#8212;but in any case, I don&#8217;t like giving in to blackmail.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2017-12-13 05:40:05+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>>  it\u2019s an obvious fact that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel (i.e., the seat of its government)</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that but I suppose it makes sense.
