Proven reserves means reserves that can be extracted with at least 90% probability or efficiency, profitably at current prices.   After that you have probable reserves (conceptually 50%), possible reserves (conceptually 10%), and technically recoverable reserves (recoverable at an economic loss).</p>\n<p>So, if you improve geological mapping, all of the lines can move:  Between provable and probable, probable and possible, etc.   If you improve extraction technology, again, all of the lines can move.  And if simply the price of the fuel goes up, then all of the lines move other than boundary of technically recoverable.   For instance, Canada&#8217;s proven oil reserves skyrocketed when the price of oil passed a certain threshold, because everyone knew that the tar sands are there in Alberta, but merely expensive to excavate.</p>\n<p>Coal is at the moment more than 10 times cheaper than oil in the US, per joule of energy.  It is so cheap and widespread that it is largely a regional resource rather than a global one.  It has a global price spread rather than a global price, because it also costs money to transport it.  Changes in the price of coal largely reflect mining supply vs demand, rather than the geological endowment.  There is a lot less effort to figuring out how to find and extract as much of it as possible, even at a fixed level of quality.

First because you would then know these numbers very well! Second Greg directly indicated &#8220;150 years is already too much&#8221;, and third I don&#8217;t think I would change my mind either if clathrate extraction was suddenly economically feasible with thousands of years of reserves (which is not too unreasonable scenario -we just don&#8217;t know yet).</p>\n<p>So imho the main reason is elsewhere, maybe in #39 and as per Greg that 150 years is already too much: you think the choice is suffer now (massively according to you, slightly according to Greg) or our children will suffer massively latter. I think massive suffer latter is not especially likely, and, more important, massive suffer now could as well delayed the rise of technological improvements that would make the cost lower both now and latter. Of course we can agree a few dollar on carbon tax is not massive suffer at all, and should be done anyway. </p>\n<p>Scott #70: Or maybe people mostly only leave comments here when they disagree with me?</p>\n<p>Sure! My guess is it forms some mexican hat, as for Kohonen maps. If you&#8217;d turn SO in LSO, I won&#8217;t comment -at least because I won&#8217;t read either. <img src=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>Fred #92: no, direct heating is peanut as compared to anthropic forcing. Multiply by ten and you&#8217;ll get ten peanuts. Worse, inertia is completly different: stop heat now and it leaves, stop CO2 now and AGW will still be on us for centuries (unless we also find fast ways to recapture huge amounts of CO2)</p>\n]]>", "author": "Jay", "published": "2014-11-26 17:36:39+00:00", "title": "By: Jay"}]
