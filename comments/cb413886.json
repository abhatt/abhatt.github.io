[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>OK, circling back to some older comments, Rahul #5:</p>\n<ul>Naive question: For a long time the laws of Physics seemed to be left-right symmetric.

Or have we reason to believe we won\u2019t find such laws?</ul>\n<p>To maybe add to Audun #10 and #11: it turns out to be a theorem in quantum field theory (whose proof I don&#8217;t understand) that the laws of physics <i>must</i> be &#8220;CPT-invariant&#8221;: that is, symmetric under reversing the direction of time (T), exchanging left with right (parity, P), <i>and</i> exchanging particles with antiparticles (charge, C).  The theorem says nothing about what happens if you do only one or two of the three, and indeed, it was experimentally discovered (as you said) that the laws of physics are <i>not</i> invariant under any stronger symmetry, like charge only (C), parity only (P), or charge plus parity (CP).
