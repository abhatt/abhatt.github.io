The idea would then be that what we think of as the physical world \u2018emerges\u2019 as a higher-level manifestation of mathematics.   </p>\n<p>This conception of mathematical realism differs substantially from Tegmark\u2019s \u2018mathematical multiverse\u2019 or other philosophical views of mathematical realism such as Platonism that regard mathematical objects as timeless abstractions outside space-time.</p>\n<p>In my conception, mathematics is not timeless, it\u2019s computation, and there is an arrow-of-time that exists for math just as there\u2019s an arrow of time that exists for physics.   My idea is that we should *define* the cosmological arrow-of-time as the direction of increasing complexity.    So more complex math objects are built from simpler ones, and this hierarchical increase in complexity *defines* time, which I think is truly fundamental.</p>\n<p>I think there\u2019s a mathematical hierarchy, and all of mathematics can be classified into 3 major levels of existence.   Here are my 3-levels of mathematical existence:</p>\n<p>(1)\tAt the base is \u2018Theory of Computation\u2019 \u2013 quantum computation at root.   So I think the mathematical realm is *equivalent* to the quantum realm.

At this second level we are talking about functions and relations, which I think is about how the lower-level Turing machines interact.  On this level I would also locate matrices and groups, and I would classify combinatorics, graph theory and number theory as arising at this level.   </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zarzuelazen.com/Algebra.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.zarzuelazen.com/Algebra.html</a></p>\n<p>(3)\tNext level up is \u2018Analysis\u2019 , and here we reach the level of the real numbers (the continuum).  Geometry and topology start to emerge at this level, so this is about calculus and related stuff.  I think complex numbers also live here.   At a high-enough level there\u2019s a \u2018phase transition\u2019 and sufficiently complex geometrical structures start to be interpreted as \u2018physical\u2019.<br />\n               <a href=\"http://www.zarzuelazen.com/SetTheory&#038;Analysis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.zarzuelazen.com/SetTheory&#038;Analysis.html</a></p>\n<p>Remember, I think the arrow-of-time is *defined* by the direction of increasing complexity as we move up the mathematical hierarchy.

You need some restrictions on the type of functions to bring it down into the complexity classes you&#8217;re interested in. For example you could require that your thingo-nant is in #P when restricted to permutation matrices, then extend it to square matrices in the natural way, and it should still be in #P (or something closely related depending on what kind of matrix elements you have). Then the question is, can you come up with anything that could plausibly be strictly between P and #P-complete (even if you couldn&#8217;t prove it, of course). My guess is the situation would still be like Scott#4, that a thingo-nant will almost always have a permanant lurking in there, or else be close to a determinant, but maybe you can tweak some parameters to be somewhere in between.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Another Trump Democrat", "published": "2016-10-15 20:07:24+00:00", "title": "By: Another Trump Democrat"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>If $P=BPP$ can random self reducibility be replaced by something stronger?
