However, it wouldn&#8217;t have caught the first &#8220;mistake&#8221;, and maybe not the second one either.  Scott&#8217;s theorem about PostBQP is correct as stated; what we found is a mistake in the  <i>interpretation</i> of the theorem.</p>\n<p>The way that I wrote it in the paper is that for each gate set \u0393, you get a complexity class PostBQP-\u0393.

The only way that I know how to prove that PostBQP-\u0393\u2287PostBQP if \u0393 is not FPTEAS is to use the quantum fault tolerance theorem to coerce \u0393 to a nearby gate set \u0393&#8217; that is FPTEAS or even rational.
