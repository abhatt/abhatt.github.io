Is there any? Or is it that the possibility not only does not exist but in fact <i>cannot</i>, because of the `T&#8217; in it? \ud83d\ude09 )</p>\n<p>Oh well&#8230; Too long a comment, once again!

Skipping achieved that for me, so I&#8217;d do it again in a microsecond, <i>despite</i> all the emotional problems that it might have exacerbated or prolonged.

Prominent examples include Julian Schwinger&#8217;s move from Harvard to UCLA, and Alexander Grothendieck&#8217;s move from the IHS to Montpellier.  </p>\n<p>At the time of his early death, John von Neumann too was negotiating a move from the IAS to the University of California system&nbsp;&mdash; we&#8217;ll never know how <i>that</i> would have turned out.</p>\n<p>The ratio (total&nbsp;endowment)/(total&nbsp;students) is a measure of how great the change in academic culture can be, in jumping to a state university.

Not only is there nothing to like in that, there&#8217;s not even any basis for dialogue.</p>\n<p>So what changed?  It was neither a specific incident nor a real change in my object-level views, so much as simply getting older, and becoming increasingly conscious that there&#8217;s nothing in the political or social world that&#8217;s not susceptible to &#8220;ironic reversals.&#8221;  Reading Scott Alexander&#8217;s blog certainly accelerated that insight.</p>\n<p>As one example, if you&#8217;re worried about the <i>worst</i> religious right on earth&#8212;i.e., the one that stones gays, beheads infidels, kidnaps women to use as sex slaves, celebrates the murder of Jews, and plausibly boasts about demographically taking over the world in the long run&#8212;then one of the supreme ironies of our time is that the American religious right is more of an ally to you than the modern social-justice left is.  (The parts of the left that are actually consistent in opposing religious fundamentalism&#8212;exemplified by Richard Dawkins and Maryam Namazie&#8212;are also the parts that get denounced every nanosecond by the social-justice left.)</p>\n<p>As a second example, suppose you&#8217;re a shy, intellectual, nerdy straight male who feels alienated by the dating mores of the modern world.  Who would you choose for an ally:</p>\n<p>(a) people with the bizarre belief that the earth is 6,000 years old, but who share your dissatisfaction with modern dating mores; see you as a sweet, well-meaning person who deserves to be happy; and just hope your studies of the natural world will eventually lead you to God; or</p>\n<p>(b) people who know the age of the earth but despise you for existing, and will do everything in their power to shame you as a misogynist monster if you ever breathe a word about your life experience?</p>\n<p>To clarify, I&#8217;m no friend of the religious right.
