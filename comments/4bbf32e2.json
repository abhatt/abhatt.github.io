Was meant to be a tongue-in-cheek comment. Should have added an exclamation mark to indicate this, but humor doesn&#8217;t always come off well in the online format, I find. </p>\n<p>I simply thought you were suggesting ignorance of Quantum Computing on my part, which would be fair enough, because it&#8217;s true. I know next to nothing about quantum computing. But confidence in the fallibility of quantum factoring methods seems well-placed given my initial observation, which I stand by, that if quantum computing worked and solved integer factorization or any problem, it would be of value &#8211; but not useful until we fully understood the mechanisms involved, so we could exploit them in further applications, allowing other science and technology developments. </p>\n<p>But when you said that, &#8216;&#8230;we have shown that if the simulation was exact, it would imply a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy, which complexity theorists consider \u201calmost as bad\u201d as P=NP&#8217;, I fail to see why, if P=NP, that this would be a bad thing. In the same reply, you conceded that a classical P-time factorization algorithm &#8216;still won\u2019t undercut the main economic or scientific rationale for QCs&#8217;. However, I disagree somewhat on this. Bar the exception of protein folding for biologists and reaction modelling for chemists for example, which I can comprehend the benefits by leveraging QC power, I struggle to see the economic rationale being other than &#8216;break all encryption&#8217; for example.</p>\n<p>You may state that elliptic curve, discrete logarithm etc are still safe with a classical P-time algorithm. However, I disagree, as it&#8217;s very likely that a solution to factorization could rapidly be adapted to these other encryption classes as well. </p>\n<p>For my two cents worth though, I entirely believe that the Ancient Greeks knew a P-time factorization algorithm. When the library at Alexandria was burned by the Romans, a LOT of learning was lost. Some historians have speculated it set the world back 1,000 years or more. For example, Pythagoras had invented a rudimentary form of calculus, something which was not revived again until the 15th century. So 40+ years doesn&#8217;t really do justice to the two Millennia that preceded the modern era. </p>\n<p>The difference was that in those days, any useful algorithm had limited utility, even if was a great discovery, because there were no computers of any kind to implement it on, so the classical versus quantum distinction was rather moot. Also, I have heard it mentioned that even classical computers use quantum effects at the holes in transistor gates. So in a sense, classical computers ARE already quantum, it&#8217;s just that perhaps they are a very diluted version of what researchers are striving for with true QC machines. So good luck with your research. I honestly hope QC computers start to work properly or usefully, although I don&#8217;t hold out much hope that they will, certainly not for another decade or more.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Jopus", "published": "2018-01-08 17:15:03+00:00", "title": "By: Jopus"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve never been fascinated by quantum computers, because quantum mechanics has already proven its worth for making intractable computations become tractable.
