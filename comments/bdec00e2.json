Attempting to &#8220;reclaim&#8221; insults words is just like the negro or homosexual attempting to reclaim the words that once insulted them.</p>\n<p>&#8212; I graduated from high school in 1970. No special SAT studies, no summer cram schools. I was accepted at Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley. Nobody in high school, that I recall, ever called me a dwork, a dweeb, a nerd, a tool, or any similar insult terms. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Werent&#8217; you that nerd who was in my chemistry class? &#8221; is an intended insult. </p>\n<p>&#8212; to &#8220;valorize,&#8221; as the lit-crit, cli-lit, leftist, feminista, queer community now calls it, such terms of denigration is to accept the inital term. &#8220;We are reclaming these terms.&#8221; As &#8220;Nizzaz Wiy </p>\n<p>&#8212; I am now wealthy, have some achievements can Google under my real name, and was never anyone&#8217;s dweeb, dork, geek, tool, or nerd.</p>\n<p>Scott, you are a brilliant addition to the human race. But you really need to stop with these every-few-months rants about how much of a dork or dweeb you are. </p>\n<p>Enjoy the ride and stop playing the self-deprecating schlemiel stereotypical  role that the (apparently) self-hating Jew Wood Allen apparently has lived in Real Life.</p>\n<p>P.S . Ask Dana if having a very successful career, a pretty wife, a couple of young kids is AT ALL consistent your self-trashing yourself as a nerd unsuited to the modern world.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not realistic, It&#8217;s self-insulting, narcisissitic, and it&#8217;s very probably borderline neurotic.</p>\n<p>&#8211;Tim May, my real,  Intel 1974-8, crypto, Cypherpunk since then</p>\n]]>", "author": "Tim May", "published": "2018-08-26 07:06:27+00:00", "title": "By: Tim May"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Dan T. #115</p>\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t merely her jaywalking that gave rise to Corvello\u2019s outrage.
