For the NAND gate, we know the answer to that question is yes.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are indeed several basic ways in which we &#8220;know&#8221; the answer is yes classically, but it is quite subtle IMO to specify in which way the quantum situation is less satisfactory than the classical one.  I&#8217;ll give some specific examples, but overall I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s still a lot to understand classically, in the same way that pseudo-random number generators are still not fully understood in computer science.  For a computer science analogue, giving a general proof of thermalization for a large variety of classical systems would probably be on par with proving P=BPP; actually, my guess is it would be harder as the standard arguments for thermalization roughly rely on assuming that certain events in a deterministic process can be treated as if they were random so they almost assume that good PRGs exist.</p>\n<p>For example, there is a line of research that dates back to Boltzmann, in which he shows that irreversible dynamics can emerge from reversible microscopic laws.  However, the original derivation makes an assumption originally called &#8220;molecular chaos&#8221; in which one assumes that pairs of particles that scatter off each other are drawn independently from the single particle distribution, giving the Boltzmann equation.  This does give irreversible dynamics, but requires an assumption.  Under similar assumptions, one can argue that irreversible quantum dynamics can emerge.  So, perhaps we would like to better justify this assumption.</p>\n<p>There is some rigorous work by Lebowitz and collaborators showing thermalization for certain initial conditions for specific systems.  This is extremely elegant work, but currently limited in which systems it can be applied to.  Conversely, there are some simple quantum systems (like free fermions) in which one can (much more straightforwardly) derive thermalization for certain initial conditions to a generalized Gibbs ensemble.  I&#8217;d say that currently the knowledge of the quantum setting is much less satisfactory here, but maybe there is no sharp qualitative difference in which we can say that classically this general problem is understood at the level of rigorous math and quantum mechanically it is not.</p>\n<p>There are also numerical studies.  Some of these numerical studies were in fact controversial classically, where certain systems were thought not to thermalize but were later learned to thermalize at extremely long time.  The quantum numerics are much worse of course, but thermalization can be seen in some of those numerics (but not all&#8230;.)</p>\n<p>A final interesting point is that we know from numerical studies using Monte Carlo on classical systems that good PRGs really are needed.  There are some famous cases where a poor choices of PRG led to inaccurate results in classical Monte Carlo, even though the PRG was considered good at the time.  So, the relation between thermalization and pseudorandomness is subtle.</p>\n]]>", "author": "matt", "published": "2014-04-15 00:52:09+00:00", "title": "By: matt"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott #84<br />\nConsidering the number of papers referencing it, it&#8217;s too bad John Conway named his cellular automaton thing &#8220;Game of Life&#8221; and not &#8220;Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Darkness&#8221;.</p>\n]]>", "author": "fred", "published": "2014-04-15 15:28:47+00:00", "title": "By: fred"}]
