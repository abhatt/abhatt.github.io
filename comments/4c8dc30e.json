Pure logical thinking cannot yield us any knowledge of the empirical world; all knowledge of reality starts from experience and ends in it. Propositions arrived at by purely logical means are completely empty as regards reality. Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics\u2014indeed, of modern science altogether.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Max Planck stated, \u201cLet us get down to bedrock facts. The beginning of every act of knowing, and therefore the starting-point of every science, must be our own personal experience.\u201d Planck also stated, \u201cThat we do not construct the external world to suit our own ends in the pursuit of science, but that vice versa the external world forces itself upon our recognition with its own elemental power, is a point which ought to be categorically asserted again and again . . . From the fact that in studying the happenings of nature . . . it is clear that we always look for the basic thing behind the dependent thing, for what is absolute behind what is relative, for the reality behind the appearance and for what abides behind what is transitory. . this is characteristic not only of physical science but of all science.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Einstein was adamant in his contention, \u201cTruth is what stands the test of experience.\u201d He stated thusly without ever having read Popper even.</p>\n<p>    Heisenberg would likely not have been a huge fan of the multiverse, writing, \u201cScience. . . is based on personal experience, or on the experience of others, reliably reported. . . Even today we can still learn from Goethe . . . trusting that this reality will then also reflect the essence of things, the \u2018one, the good, and the true.\u201d Schrodinger agrees with Hesinberg, stipulating, \u201cThe world is given but once. . . The world extended in space and time is but our representation. Experience does not give us the slightest clue of its being anything besides that.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Einstein warned us of metaphysics, \u201cTime and again the passion for understanding has led to the illusion that man is able to comprehend the objective world rationally by pure thought without any empirical foundations\u2014in short, by metaphysics.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Regarding the infinite complexity of the never-seen strings/infinite multiverses, Einstein wrote, \u201cAny intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius\u2014and a lot of courage\u2014to move in the opposite direction.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Even though many would consider him dated, Sir Francis Bacon wrote, \u201cAnd all depends on keeping the eye steadily fixed upon the facts of nature and so receiving their images simply as they are. For God forbid that we should give out a dream of our own imagination for a pattern of the world; rather may he graciously grant to us to write an apocalypse or true vision of the footsteps of the Creator imprinted on his creatures.\u201d</p>\n<p>    The Great mathematician Poincare understood the difference between math and reality, \u201cGeometry is not true, it is advantageous.\u201d \u2013Poincare</p>\n<p>    In Disturbing the Universe, Freeman Dyson writes, \u201cDick [Feynman] fought back against my skepticism, arguing that Einstein had failed because he stopped thinking in concrete physical images and became a manipulator of equations. I had to admit that was true. The great discoveries of Einstein\u2019s earlier years were all based on direct physical intuition. Einstein\u2019s later unified theories failed because they were only sets of equations without physical meaning. Dick\u2019s sum-over-histories theory was in the spirit of the young Einstein, not of the old Einstein. It was solidly rooted in physical reality.\u201d In The Trouble With Physics, Lee Smolin writes that Bohr was not a Feynman \u201cshut up and calculate\u201d physicist, and from the above Dyson quote, it appears that Feynman wasn\u2019t either. Lee writes, \u201cMara Beller, a historian who has studied his [Bohr's] work in detail, points out that there was not a single calculation in his research notebooks, which were all verbal arguments and pictures.\u201d</p>\n<p>    In his book Einstein, Banesh Hoffman and the great Michael Faraday exalt physical reality over mere math:</p>\n<p>    \u201cMeanwhile, however, the English experimenter Michael Farady was making outstanding experimental discoveries in electricity and magnetism. Being largely self-taught and lacking mathematical facility, he could not interpret his results in the manner of Ampere. And this was fortunate, since it led to a revolution in science. . . most physicists adept at mathematics thought his concepts mathematically na\u00efve.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Finally, Einstein reminds us, \u201cThe most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.\u201d</p>\n<p>    And,</p>\n<p>    \u201cThe important thing is not to stop questioning.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Well, the glaring question is, \u201cWhy are the greats being ignored?\u201d</p>\n<p>    Einstein wrote, \u201cWhen the solution is simple, God is answering.\u201d Should we not be seeking simplicity?</p>\n<p>    Einstein reminds us that physics must begin and end in physical reality, \u201cAlbert Einstein: Before I enter upon a critique of mechanics as a foundation of physics, something of a broadly general nature will first have to be said concerning the points of view according to which it is possible to criticize physical theories at all. The first point of view is obvious: The theory must not contradict empirical facts. . . The second point of view is not concerned with the relation to the material of observation but with the premises of the theory itself, with what may briefly but vaguely be characterized as the \u201cnaturalness\u201d or \u201clogical simplicity\u201d of the premises (of the basic concepts and of the relations between these which are taken as a basis). This point of view, an exact formulation of which meets with great difficulties, has played an important role in the selection and evaluation of theories since time immemorial.\u201d</p>\n<p>    Please let us start welcoming Einstein et al. in our books and blogs.

But philosophy, like other disciplines, has a bunch of sub-communities working in relative isolation. Any sampling you do is likely to be biased towards sub-communities whose work you&#8217;ve heard about through friends or acquaintances. For instance, even though I specialize in philosophy of science in one of the main departments for philosophy of science in the US, I&#8217;ve never read either Feyerabend or Kuhn. </p>\n<p>And with due respect, unless you&#8217;ve invested serious time and effort into philosophy, I don&#8217;t really think you are qualified to judge the field even if your sampling of it is fair. The same goes for Feynman, of whom I&#8217;m a big fan. Academics have a bad tendency to denigrate other academic fields whose goals and methods they haven&#8217;t actually taken the time to try to understand and appreciate (philosophers do this a lot too). </p>\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s possible to invest a lot of time and effort into understanding a field and then at the end conclude that it&#8217;s worthless. But if you are in that position, I think the more reasonable and humble thing to say is (in most cases), &#8220;that field is not for me,&#8221; not &#8220;99% of that field is crap.&#8221;</p>\n]]>", "author": "Olav", "published": "2014-01-23 19:09:13+00:00", "title": "By: Olav"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Jay #99: No, I don&#8217;t think that was a Kuhnian misunderstanding, just a regular, ordinary misunderstanding (on his part)! <img src=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />   Indeed, Dick seemed to agree in <a href=\"http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/01/25/factoring-is-in-bqp/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this followup post</a>.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2014-01-23 19:11:11+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Thanks, but this followup is precisely why I thought this story was very Kuhnian. <img src=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":-)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  </p>\n<p>Look what happened: at the end you&#8217;re still in disagrement.
