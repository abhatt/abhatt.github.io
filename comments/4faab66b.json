But that elides the problem mathematicians constantly face: what will work?&nbsp;[&hellip;]</p>\n<p>These themes converged in the on-line row over whether Wiles\u2019s proof of Fermat&#8217;s Last Theorem (FLT) uses Grothendieck universes. Universes are controversial in some circles since they are sets large enough to model Zermelo Fraenkel set theory (ZF) and so, by G\u00f6del&#8217;s incompleteness theorem, ZF cannot prove they exist.</p>\n<p>It is no surprise theoretically that a statement about numbers could be proved by high level set theory&nbsp;[&hellip;]  but it is surprising in fact that FLT should be proved this way. We do not expect to see the G\u00f6del phenomenon in such simple statements.&nbsp;[&hellip;]</p>\n<p>I am working to lessen the surprise in the case of FLT and other recent number theory by bringing the proofs closer to arithmetic. I have formalized the whole Grothendieck toolkit in finite order arithmetic. That is the strongest theory that is commonly called &#8220;arithmetic&#8221;.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The much-discussed HoTT mathematical foundations program provides a venue in which McLarty&#8217;s ideas are not only well-posed, but natural and even machine-checkable.</p>\n<p><b>Practical parallels</b>&nbsp; For engineers too, there are parallels with practical problems in quantum simulation.  A pretty considerable portion of the modern quantum simulation literature can be viewed as a McLarty-style effort to replace the large-dimension (uncountably infinite) Hilbert space of gauge field theory with low-dimension (usually finite, and at most countably infinite) varietal spaces.  </p>\n<p>For example, Google&#8217;s new programming language &#8220;TensorFlow&#8221;, implemented on Google&#8217;s new TPU chips (&#8220;Tensor Processing Units&#8221;), as the basis of Google&#8217;s new algorithms (&#8220;AlphaGo&#8221;) represent an evolving class of computations that are not obviously well-represented by Turing-equivalent von Neumann processors manipulating large-dimension \\( \\psi \\)-vectors.</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, in the Turing/von Neumann/Hilber computational world, physical systems are encoded as large-dimension vectors of complex numbers, while in the Grothendieck/McLarty/Google/varietal world, physical systems are encoded as smaller-dimension joins of polynomials.  </p>\n<p><b>Toward Varietal Comity</b>&nbsp; At the practical level, Grothendieck/McLarty/Google-style varietal simulations have been so successful that it is natural to wonder whether these dimension-reducing methods are applicable <i>universally</i>, consistent with the Extended Church-Turing Thesis (ECT) as a fundamental law of nature, that governs in particular all gauge-field-theory quantum universes.  </p>\n<p>In this practical universe the Standard Model of quantum physics is entirely correct, and yet Gil Kalai&#8217;s skeptical views regarding quantum computing (per Gil&#8217;s recent <i>Notice of the AMS</i> article, see too arXiv:1605.00992) are entirely correct <i>too</i>.</p>\n<p><b>Toward Quantum Supremacy</b>&nbsp; On the other hand, the experimental demonstration of Quantum Superiority&nbsp;&mdash; for example via scalably fault-tolerant quantum computing and/or scalable BosonSampling&nbsp;&mdash; would confound fond hopes for Varietal Comity (as it might be called), by overthrowing the Extended Church-Turing Thesis.</p>\n<p>So this is one of those transformational (and immensely enjoyable) epochs in science, in which there is plenty of high-quality literature, and stimulating arguments, and high-quality mathematics, on <i>both</i> sides of a fundamental scientific question.</p>\n<p><b>Conclusion</b>&nbsp; Scott answered the <i>Quora</i> question &#8220;Do you still think that philosophers should care more about computational complexity?&#8221; with &#8220;You better believe it! \ud83d\ude42 &#8221; (emoticon as in the original). </p>\n<p>The converse question &#8220;Should qubit-designers and BosonSamplers and quantum simulationists care more about computational philosophy?&#8221; is answered by works like Colin McLarty&#8217;s and Gil Kalai&#8217;s identically: &#8220;We&#8217;d better believe it! \ud83d\ude42 &#8220;</p>\n]]>", "author": "John Sidles", "published": "2016-05-25 20:43:00+00:00", "title": "By: John Sidles"}]
