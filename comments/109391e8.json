Even worse, such a \u201cmeasure\u201d of causal influence has nothing to do with a system&#8217;s mechanisms or connectivity, except that of its fundamental microscale. But changing the measure in the horrible way Scott suggests doesn\u2019t change the fact that causal structure does indeed shift its properties across scales, such as becoming more deterministic, less degenerate, or creating different mechanisms. This is the heart of causal emergence. A good measure like effective information is sensitive to this. Scott\u2019s arbitrary fix severs this connection so the measure has nothing to do with the strength of causal relationships.That\u2019s why it spits out random numbers for even a simple causal relationship, like that of a light switch to a light bulb.

But on the other hand, he refuses to let us consider the distribution D<sub>mic</sub> over microstates that would naturally arise by drawing a macrostate from D<sub>mac</sub>.  Instead he demands, for no discernable reason, that the microstate be drawn from the <i>uniform distribution over all microstates</i>, something  that would only make sense in a situation with no exogenous control.</p>\n<p>Of course, only by rigging the comparison in that way, is he able to arrive at the amazing conclusion that a D<sub>mac</sub> sample can give you more information than a D<sub>mic</sub> sample.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2017-06-08 03:33:36+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott #113: Thanks, I was getting confused here!
