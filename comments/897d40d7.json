Look at norms in tech, and norms in medicine. Medical conferences are far friendlier to women than tech conferences are, and there are reasons for that, not least of which have been lawsuits. In other words, those who run medical institutions have learned, slowly and painfully, that it&#8217;s wisest to avoid even the appearance of old-fashioned grab-assery. You will find, though, that sexism and misogyny still abound in the more macho and better-compensated areas of medicine, like orthopedic surgery, and the M:F numbers reflect that. </p>\n<p>If an institution&#8217;s going to support the career of a guy who contributes to what the feds call a hostile environment, they&#8217;re essentially saying it&#8217;s not that big a deal. Hosting the videos supports Lewin&#8217;s career. Should they do that &#8212; should a marquee like MIT do that &#8212; no, I don&#8217;t think so. He&#8217;s of course free to make and promote his own videos like anyone else in business.</p>\n<p>As for the &#8220;shy and nerdy&#8221; bit&#8230;you know, some of the gropiest, most misogynistic guys I&#8217;ve met have been of the shy and nerdy persuasion. I can only speculate on why that&#8217;s so, but no, I would certainly not equate shy/nerdy with harmless. In fact I think a shy/nerdy-normed world would be a significantly worse world for women. (Not least because so many nerdy guys are certain that they&#8217;re extremely fairminded and rational, when instead what they are is naive about both social structures and how many things play out in reality, and unwilling or unable to fathom that other people&#8217;s reactions to events might be both different from and as valid as their own.) </p>\n<p>Also, you want credit for not being a supporter of keeping sexual harassers on payroll? Okay, but only if you&#8217;re going to give me credit for not being a supporter of brain tumors. I think I agree with the &#8220;baseline&#8221; comment above. Seriously, this is the kind of thinking that leads to divorces, where a guy wants applause for doing some (though not nearly half) of the house/kid-related work. I mean think about what you&#8217;re asking.</p>\n<p>aviti: Google awaits you. Please do not ask others to do your homework for you. You might start with the tenure-track gender ratios, humanities:hard-sci, and also consider the relative sophistication of humanities and hard-sci professionals when it comes to issues like sexual harassment and gender equity. I find actually that this is a significant barrier to gender equity in STEM: the women tend to be far, far ahead of the men when it comes to reading in, discussion of, understanding of these issues.

Despite all the belly-aching around here about MIT&#8217;s decision, it will likely have a real effect on the behavior of top faculty, who will think twice now that they know such a prominent individual has been disciplined so rigorously (and fittingly) and had his legacy permanently and publicly damaged. Had MIT not gone this far, there would have been little publicity and little discussion of the Lewin incident, and lessons would not have been taken to heart by the people in positions of power who needed to take them to heart.</p>\n<p>Given how angry so many people here seem to be, just imagine how angry you&#8217;d all be if you were actually the victims of something really terrible or something that truly damaged your careers &#8212; like, you know, the sorts of things that many (though not all) women and other under-represented populations go through regularly in in many science and tech fields.</p>\n<p>In my ideal world, people, especially very smart people, would be able to exercise that level of imagination.

The other disciplinary actions taken by MIT seem sufficient to manage the school&#8217;s reputation and protect future potential victims. I disagree with the commenters who said it is inconsequential if the material is taken down from the site because OTHER sites will host the material anyway. Students from around the world watch lectures on OCW and some who might benefit from these lectures might never become aware of their existence if they are only available off-site.</p>\n<p>I also understand the concern that even if Dr. Lewin were banned from the site, students who watched his lectures online might find other ways of contacting him to ask questions (at which point he might repeat his previous unacceptable behaviors.) Someone suggested that the lectures should be left on the site together with a warning. This seems like a very reasonable compromise and would actually do MORE to protect students than pulling the lectures and having bootlegs proliferate off-site without this warning.</p>\n<p>As another compromise (one which I believe would protect students, act as a deterrent, spare victims the pain of having their victimizer remain in public view, and also serve the interest of students who might benefit from these lectures), I PROPOSE THE MOST SALIENT CONTENT OF THE LECTURES SHOULD BE PRESERVED WHILE THE NAME AND LIKENESS OF THE OFFENDING PROFESSOR IS CAST OUT FROM THE SITE (i.e. an avatar and voice actor should be used to recreate the lectures.) I admit this is somewhat silly, but would argue it&#8217;s LESS silly than punishing thousands of students for the actions of a professor.</p>\n<p>Even though I agree it is important to protect potential future victims from harm, I propose this pragmatic compromise only grudgingly, because whatever the specifics of this case, there is an important principle that is worth not losing sight of. If we were to censor the work of everyone who was personally a jerk or even a criminal, imagine how much poorer the world would be! Who decides where to draw the line? Do we ban the work of Kant because he was a racist? How about Twain because he used the &#8220;n&#8221; word in Huck Finn? (Some argue that context doesn&#8217;t matter and we should censor ANYTHING that might offend, even unintentionally.) Do we remove Caravaggio&#8217;s artwork from galleries because he stabbed someone? Do we burn copies of Einstein&#8217;s papers because he was an adulterer who married his cousin? Do we burn every copy Henry Ford&#8217;s anti-Semitic screed, or leave it in the historical record as a testament to his ignorance and intolerance?</p>\n<p>The activity of censorship is not only distasteful and illiberal, but inimical to the *very purpose* of a university. Undermining that purpose for all by the most extreme cases of physical self-defense should be judged completely unacceptable (though passionate debate exists around this issue, I do believe it is justifiable and prudent to censored certain information like detailed blueprints for nuclear weapons or the genomes of deadly pathogens.)</p>\n<p>I realize I have contradicted myself by saying censorship is unacceptable but the lectures should be taken down and replaced with a sanitized version.</p>\n<p>My high-mindedness dictates that censorship beyond that which is absolutely necessary for our continued survival and we find ourselves standing on the shoulders of midgets like Savonarola or 13th century Mongol hordes who destroyed the House of Wisdom. </p>\n<p>My pragmatism says sometimes its okay to compromise.
