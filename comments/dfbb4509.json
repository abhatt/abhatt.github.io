Hillary Clinton&#8217;s political affiliations throughout her life show statism at its worst, namely, the very reason people is cynic about career politicians.

Her political positions have only changed as she saw fit to advance her political career. Thus, she was against gay marriage in 1996 when DOMA was passed and it had overwhelming support, just as she was for the war in Iraq in the aftermath of 9/11 when the nation went through a period of extreme fear. Later, she turned against the war in Iraq and traditional marriage, and in this order, when both became unpopular positions.
