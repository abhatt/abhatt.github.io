[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Michale #123: Yes, the current German communist part, the DKP, is not banned, unlike its predecessor, the KPD. The reasoning was that the danger has passed so it&#8217;s not worth prosecuting them. Exactly the same reasoning has been applied to the current Nazi party, the NPD. Both the NPD and the DKP are abysmal failures, electorally speaking. And that&#8217;s anyway not about the Volksverhetzung law, but the article 21 of the German constitution.</p>\n<p>Regarding #108, that&#8217;s exactly the kind of answer I was expecting from Scott: that of course we can&#8217;t blame Jewish veterans for beating up Nazis, but we can&#8217;t have vigilantes making up their own laws and beating up whoever they want. In the case of preventing genocide, though, I think letting the vigilantes do the dirty work is a risk worth taking. That Scott was conflating a ban on hate speech with a ban on giving advice on how to pick up woman just shows how traumatized he is from his interactions with SJWs and how ignorant he is about hate speech laws.</p>\n<p>About the British case: I&#8217;m not really familiar with Britain.

I believe that the Germany&#8217;s Volksverhetzung law (as described here <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung</a> ) and similar laws that exist in other European countries are wrong and would not survive a constitutional challenge in the United States. I say that based on this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie</a> .</p>\n<p>With respect to &#8220;time and time again we have seen that hate speech leads to lynchings, pogroms, terrorism, and genocide&#8221;, a basic principle underlying US Supreme Court decisions on free speech is that so called &#8220;prior restrain&#8221; is a form of censorship (more info here <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_v._Minnesota\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_v._Minnesota</a> ). In essence, US jurisprudence is such that judges can only act on actual damages not &#8220;hypothetical/Minority Report&#8221; type of situations. Something I also agree with and one of the reasons I find the whole NSA/Google/Facebook spying coupled with &#8220;predictive analytics that try to predict behavior&#8221; particularly nefarious . Again, I know that Europeans as a whole feel generally differently about this, but this has been one of the big American/European divides throughout history. </p>\n<p>At the risk of simplifying things, somebody told me once that together with its imperfections -such as legalized slavery and racism- American culture grew out of those Europeans -and their descendants- who ran way from the Feudal lord seeking freedom and who settled in the Americas whereas current Europeans are the descendants of those Europeans who were happy putting up with abuses of the feudal lord so long as they had the protection said lord in exchange. In the XXI-st century, governments play the role of feudal lords for most Europeans, but a similar rationale still applies. How each side treats so called &#8220;hate speech&#8221; is a prime example of this difference in mindset.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2018-06-20 23:53:21+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Mateus Ara\u00fajo #128 </p>\n<p>And to continue with the discussion. The mantra in the US by those of us who are in favor of  free speech has always been that the answer to speech you don&#8217;t like is &#8220;more speech&#8221; not &#8220;suppression&#8221; of said speech. The issue of preemptively &#8220;suppressing&#8221; speech is a statist position that is generally accepted as valid in Europe and by some hard left people around here but it is not the majority view among Americans of either political persuasion.</p>\n<p>Many years back there was a case that highlighted the difference in approach of European courts vs American courts on this issue <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LICRA_v._Yahoo</a>! . Note that while the US Supreme Court refused to hear Yahoo!&#8217;s appeal, and therefore the decision by the Circuit/District courts did not create nationwide precedent, the district court said that the French court ruling violated US free speech protections. The circuit court reversed the district court opinion on standing grounds (ie, that the district court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a foreign matter) but not on the substance of the issue.  </p>\n<p>I am of the opinion that the right response to hateful speech is indeed more speech. For a variety of reasons. First, criminalizing speech only makes said speech go underground (it doesn&#8217;t make it go away). Second, and more importantly, confronting hateful ideas in the open is the best way to nullify them in the hearts of those who are watching and who might not have a strong opinion one way or another. One of the reasons regular Germans could claim &#8220;ignorance&#8221; when the atrocities committed by the Nazi government came to light was that said government controlled the flow of information to regular German citizens. The extreme Nazi censorship made it very difficult to said citizens to know the extent of the abuses (I would imagine that some version of what was going on reached many of them though).</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2018-06-21 01:56:45+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Comment #129: </p>\n<p>Scott, &#8220;In any official forum where it\u2019s possible to lodge accusations against someone and hurt their career, reputation, and life, it must also be possible for the accused to defend themselves and to call witnesses . . .&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tenured faculty (in my field, almost all men), rarely if ever even perceive that they are hurting the careers, reputations and life of the women they refuse to mentor, refuse to equitably teach, and refuse to equitably interact with.
