Nothing in it depended on the claim that Hillary is in any way preferable to Bernie Sanders.</p>\n<p>I <i>did</i> support Hillary over Bernie in the primaries (without any enormous enthusiasm), but that&#8217;s a separate discussion we could have.  Basically, by the standards of academia or many European countries, I&#8217;d probably be considered a centrist (or in Berkeley, a right-winger \ud83d\ude42 )&#8212;it&#8217;s only in the context of the US that my politics are liberal.  But even that&#8217;s an oversimplification, since on some issues (e.g. stopping climate change, legalizing drugs) I&#8217;m well to the left of the Democratic Party, while on other issues (Israel, SJW shaming campaigns&#8230;) I sharply dissent from what liberals nowadays are supposed to think.</p>\n<p>To take some of Bernie&#8217;s issues: on student debt, I think a huge part of the problem is that too many vocations now require college degrees when they really shouldn&#8217;t, when there&#8217;s no real reason for them to.  In such cases, what the college degree certifies might have nothing to do with anything the student learned in college, but simply that the student was smart and conscientious enough to get in.  But if the latter is all you care about, there are much faster ways to certify it, which would let millions of people join the workforce earlier and not saddle them with crippling debt.</p>\n<p>On wealth inequality, I agree with <a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ineq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paul Graham</a> that &#8220;inequality&#8221; is the wrong way to describe the problem.  The real problem is <i>poverty</i>.  So for example, if we could lift millions out of poverty, but only at the cost of making a few hundred obscenely rich people so much more obscenely rich that we&#8217;d increase the total inequality by some metric, I&#8217;d consider that to be a good trade.  And this is relevant, because very broadly speaking it&#8217;s what capitalism tends to do.</p>\n<p>Having said that, I think the experience of other countries clearly shows that the US could do more wealth redistribution than it does now, and also have a single payer healthcare system that would work better than our current Byzantine and broken one.  And rich people should also bear the brunt of the cost of fighting climate change and of modernizing our transportation system, electrical grid, etc to be smarter and more sustainable (an enormous, necessary undertaking on which we&#8217;ve barely even started).  From what I understand, the theoretically best way to raise funds for such things would be a massive tax on <i>consumption</i>, especially luxury consumption and environmentally damaging consumption (like beef).  But in the world as it is, higher corporate taxes, estate taxes, and capital gains taxes would do.</p>\n<p>On your last question: given how viciously I was attacked for discussing what one might have considered an orders of magnitude less incendiary topic (nerds and dating), and how much of my limited social capital I used up on that, there are various things I&#8217;d rather do right now than host a discussion about race and IQ on this blog.

He needs, and must, prefer the lives of Americans over the possibly tragic collateral damage caused by fighting aggressively against its enemies. </p>\n<p>I also do not see how Obama advanced the interests of the US within the middle east. You seem to be claiming that he has done many things with good intentions. Since we seem to agree that the middle east is in a complete chaos we now know that all his actions failed. You claim that this failure is not on Obamas&#8217; shoulders, because the chaos was inevitable, if I understand correctly. So my question: why did Obama even make all these actions, if the fate of the middle east was doomed from the start? He certainly seemed to believe otherwise in 2008.

They are worried about the possible collapse of the MAD doctrine following the installation of &#8220;anti missile&#8221; defenses on Russia borders (it appears that in a short time these can be converted into nuclear weapons launchers), and suspect that US intends either to &#8220;preventively strike&#8221; Russia (actually this is also what Paul Craig Roberts thinks, and not only him), or otherwise &#8220;change&#8221; Russia&#8217;s government into something of a Yelstin type government.
