Ok, I see, sorry for the misunderstanding.

Some say that viewpoint diversity on matters such as understanding transgenderism is unnecessary because there is nothing to talk about and any inquiry into understanding the science behind it is transphobia. Second, you seem like someone who might be a fan of John Stuart Mill. Well, what is his view on this matter? Clash ideas against one another. Even if you know you are correct your position becomes stronger and more clear by encountering resistance.
