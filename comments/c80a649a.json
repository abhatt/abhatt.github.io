Berthold was a phenomenal researcher. I had a chance to visit him and his group in Aachen for 10 days in 2007. I was quite impressed by the strong research that he built at Aachen. I have been quite impressed by his breakthrough results in various areas even in the past couple of years, e.g., his recent single-author SODA paper in Bayesian mechanism design, or his nice STOC&#39;14 paper about online stochastic packing.
