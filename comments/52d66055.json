If 8 characters drawn from the large set is OK, that&#8217;s 52 bits, which you can get in 12 characters drawn from the small alphabet. Yet Stanford requires 20 characters and then demands our gratitude for their bullshit generousity. And that 8 character password is only as good as the 12 character a-z password if every character has equal chance of being uppercase, of being a number or a symbol. Is that true?
