The reason is just that a 2-prover, 1-round interactive protocol is <i>exactly</i> a 2-prover game!  The verifier submits questions to the provers and receives answers from them, the goal of the provers is to cause the verifier to accept with the maximum probability, and the verifier&#8217;s algorithm defines the function that the provers are trying to maximize.  And the provers can use entanglement to coordinate their answers.
