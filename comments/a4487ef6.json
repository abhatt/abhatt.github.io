[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Excellent post.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve spent a few hours on this problem every year or so since undergrad (maybe 10 years ago?). I&#8217;m glad to know that it does in fact appear to be hard. What&#8217;s particularly maddening about it is how easy it is to analyze n!+k where k is not itself a square. E.g., n! - 1 is only a square when n=1 or n= 2 because for \\(n \\geq 3\\), \\(n! - 1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 3\\), so it can&#8217;t be a square. The same proof works for n! + 2 (which is never square), and a similar proof works for n! + 3 (which is only a square when n = 1 or n=3).</p>\n<p>Incidentally, I think this question arises fairly naturally in the study of factorial primes.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Stephens=Davidowitz:Noah.html\">Noah Stephens-Davidowitz</a>", "published": "2017-04-13 16:21:37+00:00", "title": "By: Noah Stephens-Davidowitz"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Thanks much for your comments!

I forgot about 4= 2! + 2 :). Sorry about that.</p>\n<p>For non-square k, I meant that it is easy to prove that there are only finitely many examples and even to enumerate all examples as long as you&#8217;re willing to run in time poly(k). Then, this procedure suffices:<br />\n1) Find a modulus m such that k is not a square mod m. (This can be done by factoring k and then applying quadratic reciprocity and the CRT. One can always get a value less than k.)<br />\n2) Enumerate all examples of squares n!+k for n < m.</p>\n<p>Of course, the resulting enumeration gives all examples of n!+k for which k is prime, but it runs in time proportional to k. </p>\n<p>I&#039;m not sure about very large non-square k.
