Namely, a good reasoner R should have beliefs about logical facts, such as the outputs of long-running computations. However, if R is computable, then there are computations that are too complicated for R to predict their results in advance with certainty. I think we both agree that the correct response here is the subjectivist point of view: you can still reason about logical facts, even if you are uncertain about them&#8212;you just use probabilities, which might be in (0,1) even for facts that are logically determined by things you already believe. </p>\n<p>The &#8220;problem of logical omniscience&#8221; is just that it doesn&#8217;t work to extend logic to probability in the natural way. Roughly, if you believe in all the axioms of first-order logic (assign P(&#8220;A&#8221;)=1 and P(&#8220;not A&#8221;)=0 for axioms A), and your probabilities respect logical connectives (so that P(&#8220;A or B&#8221;) + P(&#8220;A and B&#8221;) = P(&#8220;A&#8221;) + P(&#8220;B&#8221;)), then your beliefs are uncomputable. So we have to relax these constraints. </p>\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t argue against subjectivism, I don&#8217;t think. But it does mean we need a new notion of &#8220;good reasoning&#8221;. In the case of empirical uncertainty, we have what appears to be the correct theory of how to update on evidence (probabilistic conditioning). In the case of logical facts, we have a satisfying theory of computationally unbounded reasoning: logical deduction over recursively axiomatizable theories. </p>\n<p>But in the case of logical uncertainty, we need a notion of how to arrive at correct beliefs about logical facts in cases where you can&#8217;t just compute those facts. I hope that at some point this problem is completely solved in the framework of Bayesian probability theory, for example by having a computationally easy prior and then updating it on the results of non-trivial computations. The contribution of the paper is to give a candidate criterion for &#8220;good reasoning under logical uncertainty&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I have always read the Dutch book criterion in the following alternative way, \u201cif an agent BELIEVES that a bet is guaranteed to lead to a sure loss then the agent should not enter into it\u201d.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is one way to relax the constraint of logical coherence. Hacking [1] proposed something much like this. However, as pointed out by Eells [2], this criterion seems extremely weak: it only penalizes reasoners for reporting beliefs that are incoherent with respect to facts they already know, so it doesn&#8217;t incentivize them to discover new facts. </p>\n<p>The paper gives a less radical weakening of the Dutch book criterion: instead of requiring that reasoners report beliefs that are <em>completely</em> unexploitable by <em>any</em> bookie, we can require only that their beliefs not be <em>repeatedly</em> exploitable by <em>efficiently computable</em> bookies. This requirement turns out to be feasible, and to incentivize reasoners to satisfy a variety of desirable properties. Unfortunately, although the Garrabrant induction criterion is firmly subjectivist, it does not seem particularly Bayesian; it&#8217;s an active area of research to understand logical induction in a more interpretable and philosophically clean light.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] there is always some uncertainty about which formal system is the \u201ccorrect\u201d one.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Even if we assume that we only care about computations, which can be unambiguously referred to using logic, there remains the problem of reasoning under computational limitations about long-running computations. If we fix <em>any</em> formal system that represents computations (in the technical sense), logical deduction in that system is slow: sometimes the quickest way to &#8220;predict&#8221; the output of a computation using logical deduction is to directly simulate every step of the computation in your formal system. </p>\n<blockquote><p>all of these [logical] laws are basically empirical [&#8230;]</p></blockquote>\n<p>I somewhat agree with this&#8212;perhaps we should only care about logic insofar as it composes or models good reasoning in practice. However, there is something intuitively very fundamental about logical relationships, where logical structure feels like part of the territory rather than just part of the map, and I&#8217;m still confused around this.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] there is no situation in which all rational agents MUST regard inductive reasoning as valid</p></blockquote>\n<p>I might have some bets I&#8217;d like to make with you \ud83d\ude42 More seriously, there is a sense in which Garrabrant induction performs objectively successful subjective reasoning. In empirical uncertainty, there is a prior in the background by which a reasoner is judged, and there need not be a canonical prior. However, in the case of logical uncertainty, there is a canonical objective territory against which reasoners can be judged: which statements are provable and which are refutable.</p>\n<p>[1] Hacking, Ian. &#8220;<a>Slightly more realistic personal probability</a>.&#8221; Philosophy of Science (1967): 311-325.<br />\n[2]\tEells, Ellery. &#8220;<a>Bayesian problems of old evidence</a>.&#8221; Scientific Theories 14 (1990): 205-223.</p>\n]]>", "author": "<a href=\"http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/b/Benson=Tilsen:Tsvi.html\">Tsvi Benson-Tilsen</a>", "published": "2016-10-10 22:52:10+00:00", "title": "By: Tsvi Benson-Tilsen"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>amy #28: Good to have you here as always!</p>\n<p>I certainly don&#8217;t want to instigate another gender-politics mega-thread (!), but the comment of Anon #19 reminded me of something that&#8217;s been bugging me greatly.

It definitely looks to me like you&#8217;ve lumped things into people-who-agree-with-you and people-who-disagree-with-you and are acting like everyone who disagrees with you thus agrees with each other.  Rather than there just being a lot of disparate groups out there whose beliefs don&#8217;t have any sytematic relations to one another.  Group A who disagrees with you, and group B disagrees with you, are not necessarily closer to one another than either is to you.</p>\n<p>(Relatedly, this is why I think &#8220;political axes&#8221; are usually unhelpful; people always seem to draw them up with one of the axes being &#8220;agrees with me / disagrees with me&#8221;, leading to unnatural and outgroup-homogeneity-biased classifications.  I&#8217;m sure in a sufficiently high-dimensional space you could have a decent classification of political beliefs, but in practice the axes people draw rarely seem to be that helpful.)</p>\n<p>(By the way, have I mentioned how much I like the system of colors in Magic: The Gathering? \ud83d\ude42  The actual colors themselves are not actually much good as a way of making sense of real-world ideas, of course, there&#8217;s a lot that it misses ther; but I think the system of relations <i>between</i> is&#8230; well, it has some nice clean symmetry that real life doesn&#8217;t, real life is much messsier, but it&#8217;s a good antidote to looking at axes, IMO.  This point shamelessly stolen from Taymon Beal <a href=\"https://anomalybeta.com/2013/08/15/my-favorite-game/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p>[0]OK, actually here I&#8217;m not really talking about taking it just at face value, but throwing in as well some of what you seem to be trying to imply as well.  And by the way, might I suggest that it&#8217;s really not a good thing to try to argue by hinting like that?  If you&#8217;ve got a claim to make, spell it out so it can be properly argued with.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Sniffnoy", "published": "2016-10-11 16:25:19+00:00", "title": "By: Sniffnoy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott @#7: Mark Hadley has had some proposals about deriving QM from GR: see <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/mhadley/papers\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/staff/academic/mhadley/papers</a>, particularly his thesis.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not knowledgeable enough about the topic to know if there&#8217;s any &#8220;there&#8221; there, though.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Jon Lennox", "published": "2016-10-11 16:49:38+00:00", "title": "By: Jon Lennox"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Fishlips #17 and David Roberts #31: Sheesh!
