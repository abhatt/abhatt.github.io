I don&#8217;t like when I am asked to be like &#8220;someone else&#8221;, so I don&#8217;t like to ask others to do so.</p>\n<p>My point here is that it seems you have a knack for communicating computer science ideas to the public at large that escapes other experts in the field of theoretical computer science. From personal experience having worked with, and continue to work with, very smart technical people, not everybody in computer science has this gift. It&#8217;s already hard to have experts in computer science understand each other points when they discuss non trivial issues. Having the public know about these issues in very important, particularly given that debates about what AI will accomplish or its limits aside, I have no doubt that we are in a path in that will make the computer systems of tomorrow even more complex than those of today. And their impact in society will also be greater. At the same time, and this is something that Carl Sagan mentioned during one of his last interviews, it seems that the ability of the public at large to understand these issues seems going down. I have stopped counting the number of conversations that I have tried to have with regular folks about the danger of Google, Apple and the like tracking everybody&#8217;s smartphone GPS position data that can be correlated with their identity and online tracking only to be told &#8220;I have nothing to hide, I don&#8217;t care&#8221;. I get the feeling that if these same people were asked to live with a video camera taping their daily lives at home they would not be as understanding and yet, I find the former type of tracking way more dangerous for privacy. My take is that most regular folks do not understand computing on large amounts of data as a technology.</p>\n<p>On a more personal note, when I was growing up, I got a lot of inspiration from Carl Sagan&#8217;s documentaries. Nobody in my family had ever pursued a career in science so other than the encouragement I got from my high school teachers, Carl Sagan was the closest I had as an informal mentor as I navigated college life and beyond.  </p>\n<p>So all this to say that becoming a public computer science intellectual could be, depending on your personal preferences of course, more rewarding than leading an obscure intellectual life that gets rewarded with things like membership in the National Academy of Engineering or the National Academy of Science. The public doesn&#8217;t generally know who these people are and very few of them are remembered after their deaths unless they have done something of significance that affects society at large. I bet Carl Sagan has had more impact for science as a whole through the number of people he inspired to become scientists or engineers than most of the people who were elected to the National Academy of Science at the time he was refused membership to the same.</p>\n]]>", "author": "The problem with gatekeepers", "published": "2017-12-20 06:31:14+00:00", "title": "By: The problem with gatekeepers"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott this is my theory.
