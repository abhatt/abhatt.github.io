The first nonstop flights I found from Boston to London and back were about \u20ac1450/$1600, and flights with reasonable connections would have been even cheaper. Of course this may be because of my travel preferences. I try to have a rest day between a long flight and the conference, and I never fly back on the day the conference ends.<br /><br />Rigid schedule is definitely one thing that drives flight prices up. When I was on a personal grant and had to pay for conference trips myself, I attended more conferences than these days. Instead of just going to a conference on whim, spending extra days at the destination, and even combining the conference trip with a vacation, I now have to justify everything to my employer. As a result, the number of attended conferences has gone down, while the price of attending a conference has gone up.", "author": "Jouni Sirn", "published": "2015-07-04 12:48:26.629000-04:00", "title": ""}, {"content": "I was surprised that even your travel is subject to the US-carrier-only restriction. I thought that was largely restricted to publicly-funded universities, and not private universities. Assuming you can charge your travel to a non-federal grant, would you still be subject to the US-flag-carrier restriction? And how easy is it to apply and get internally-funded grants at Harvard?
