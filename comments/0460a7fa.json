So I followed your advice, and bought your book, QCSD. I read all of it cover to cover. Frankly speaking, I did not understand 95% of the materials, especially how easily you posed and solved the problems. I have not given up, and I will re-read the book again after I finish writing my PhD thesis (my major is engineering), somewhere in March 2016.  I think I need more background materials. I searched my university library and found a book by Chuang et al. \u201cQuantum computation and quantum information.\u201c Do you reccomend this book? Also what othe authors should I seek to cover enough starting materials to enrich my understanding of complexity theory? </p>\n<p>Sorry I put this here where everyone is cheering the recent good work.</p>\n]]>", "author": "aviti", "published": "2015-07-03 01:10:35+00:00", "title": "By: aviti"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>aviti #8: Yes, Nielsen and Chuang is the standard textbook for quantum computing; it&#8217;s excellent (even though 16 years old by now).
