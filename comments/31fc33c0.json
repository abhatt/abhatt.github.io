It is not actually the case that the &#8220;underprivileged&#8221; have a fixed set of needs, which they either &#8220;can afford&#8221; or &#8220;can&#8217;t afford&#8221;.  Poor people respond to economic incentives and disincentives just like everyone else does.   In US states with wise energy policies, poor people emit less CO2 along with everyone else.  These states do not have more poverty or more income inequality.  Actually, many of them have less poverty, because states that care more about the environment also tend to care more about poverty.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Perhaps the plan is to teach everyone who votes enough about turbulence modeling that they\u2019ll be able to validate GCMs themselves and skip the middle-men?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ostensibly the point here is about how to persuade people, but you slip in one of the tell-tale red herrings of global warming pseudo-skepticism.  Namely, you talk as if global warming is a scientific <i>deus ex machina</i> that rests only on fancy computer models.   Of course, yes, scientists make computer models, because why shouldn&#8217;t they, if they have computers?   However, you do not need any very fancy models to interpret infrared absorption by CO2, directly measured by satellites; nor the summer collapse of the Arctic ice sheet; nor the fact that Glacier National Park is losing its glaciers and Alaska&#8217;s snow season has shortened.   These things aren&#8217;t hard to understand even when they are explained by hypocrites.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Preaching to the choir doesn\u2019t change the mind of the median voter, who may be more easily swayed \u201cto believe it\u2019s a crisis when the people who keep telling me it\u2019s a crisis start acting like it\u2019s a crisis\u201d.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, despite Scott&#8217;s hyperbole, the accusation of hypocrisy is also a complete red herring.  If you consider <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions\" rel=\"nofollow\">CO2 emissions per capita by US state</a>, you can see a clear pattern that state politics is correlated with greenhouse gas emissions.   Californians and New Yorkers believe in global warming, and they aren&#8217;t hypocrites.  But the thing about accusations of hypocrisy is that it is routine to argue by anecdote, rather than comprehensive statistics.  Citing travel to &#8220;faraway conferences&#8221; is just a smart-aleck remark; it&#8217;s not data.</p>\n<p>Besides, even when smart-alecks don&#8217;t find any shred of hypocrisy, they turn smug instead of changing their minds.

The South African divestment movement eventually succeeded; the turning point came when it was backed by powerful national governments.   However, almost anyone who is anti-corporate would naturally support divestment; the movement has to have more to it than that, or else it will be entirely futile.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it would not be futile because it might &#8220;alienate moderates&#8221;.  It would be futile because, as you say, denouncing companies as evil without changing fundamental incentives doesn&#8217;t solve anything.</p>\n<p>I also note that the South African divestment movement asked companies to do something relatively simple for them.   Despite talk about Exxon changing its business model, it would have to change so much that it would afterwards be Exxon in name only.   This particular divestment movement has the rather grandiose goal of expecting Exxon to curl up and die.  Which in fact is what is happening to US coal companies to some extent, thanks to the natural gas boom and to new environmental policies.  But it&#8217;s not happening to Exxon, and I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s really possible.</p>\n<blockquote><p>As an aside, are there any charities devoted to funding basic research on renewable energy?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a noble question, and one answer is that some of the best such charities are universities themselves, MIT notably among them.  You can make earmarked donations to universities.   However, another answer is that it&#8217;s not really the point.   The countries that emit the most CO2 have vast opportunities to emit less with existing technologies, and endorsing research as the one thing that everyone likes amounts to procrastination.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Fossil fuels have done a lot of good in the larger scope of history. They enabled the industrial revolution, and thus living standards above subsistence for the first time in human history.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There is a lot more to the industrial revolution than just fossil fuels.  Moreover, most of world&#8217;s anthropogenic CO2 comes from the second stage of industrialization in the 20th century, and not the primitive industrial revolution in the 19th century.   In this second stage, we have had plenty of chances to emit less carbon dioxide, if only we had understood global warming earlier, and if only more people would take it seriously.</p>\n<p>In fact, we have punished ourselves with various regrettable externalities of coal combustion all along, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">COPD</a>, acid rain, and environmental mercury.   Now you could always wax philosophical about this with abstract statements such as, &#8220;every technology comes with side effects&#8221;.   But the truth is that coal is a very primitive technology that has always been a dirty way to generate energy.  We&#8217;ve had hydroelectric power for 130 years, natural gas for about a century, and nuclear power for 60 years.  We&#8217;ve had a lot of time to switch to better choices than coal.  What has happened with transportation fuel is more complicated, but it&#8217;s been clear since the 1970s that the US has been a short-sighted pig with oil consumption.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ironic that an inert byproduct of combustion could be the agent of society\u2019s destruction.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Okay, yes, I have talked about hard choices, but I really did mean <i>politically</i> hard choices more than <i>economically</i> hard choices.   The choice in front of us is not actually, &#8220;do we sacrifice now or destroy ourselves later&#8221;.   Rather, it&#8217;s &#8220;do we as the human race cooperate now, or do we sorely regret it later&#8221;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One nice thing about market-based solutions, like a carbon tax, is that we don\u2019t need to make the decision in particular cases. We just need to put the right price on carbon, and let individuals, and individual nations, decide how to proceed.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For sure, carbon taxes (or greenhouse taxes) are by far the best economic approach to this problem.  Yet at another level, they aren&#8217;t any solution at all.   In between an overarching government and individuals, you have an array of large public and private institutions.  They have to respond to a carbon tax (or similar) with specific choices.   When a state opens or closes a power plant of any given kind, that&#8217;s not actually an individual choice or even a free-market choice.  It&#8217;s a hybrid of market forces and public policy.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of supposing that no one has to worry about a problem, if there is an abstract framework to encourage someone to worry about it.

Coal electricity is a major correlate.   To a large extent, you can think of the state government itself as the market agent that selects the mode of electricity production.

The change in the world was piecemeal &#8212; first you couldn&#8217;t smoke in college classrooms, then at work, then on buses and airplanes, then in theatres and official public buildings, then the vending machines disappeared (sorry, kids), then, then, then. The last to go has been smoking in bars (ending a 10-year run of unsociability for asthmatic me). The current battles are over smoking around children in child-custody cases. </p>\n<p>If it were up to the public we&#8217;d still be going around wreathed in smoke. Along the way, though, as the piecemeal social changes were worked for a multitude of reasons, it became rude to smoke. It simply isn&#8217;t done, if you&#8217;re above a certain social class &#8212; and it&#8217;s done less than it was, even if you aren&#8217;t. And even if you were furious at the nanny state for interfering with your right to give yourself and your kids lung cancer. I think this, rather than the wallet, is what really cements the social changes. </p>\n<p>Much of conservation is about &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8221;. Don&#8217;t run the furnace or the a/c. Don&#8217;t leave that on. Don&#8217;t leave the door hanging open. Don&#8217;t fly to Canberra, don&#8217;t buy the enormous house, don&#8217;t have a third child you can&#8217;t afford anyway. One of the civic don&#8217;ts I&#8217;ve seen lately is &#8220;don&#8217;t idle&#8221; &#8212; you&#8217;re sitting outside the school waiting for your kid; please turn off the car. A sign reminds you; you have to be a bit obstinate, socially antagonistic, to keep running the engine after that. If &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8221; is not only easy and relatively palatable but standing right in front of you, then it becomes your way of life, meaning you don&#8217;t have to be a conservation nerd to do it, and high-emission living begins to look a bit filthy, antisocial. So I think this is, like the anti-smoking campaigns, a slow thing, and one pushed by multiple interests, but probably not ineffectual.</p>\n<p>Apropos of Joshua Zelinsky&#8217;s #157, there are many ways of makaing what are effectively involuntary changes that do allow the underprivileged, brains-or-moneywise, to participate. For instance: My house is poorly insulated for my climate, and poorly situated, with no southern exposure at all, windows facing east and west. Change building codes, and, if necessary, go on subsidizing mortgages (as we already do), and the better-insulated, more passively-solar-heated house requires, say, 30% less natural gas to heat and some large chunk less in air-conditioning and furnace-blower electricity. And we&#8217;ve seen this before. The underprivileged here mostly do drive cars, but now the cars get 26 mpg, not 11 mpg. (Too bad we&#8217;ve done our urban planning so that they drive many more miles annually than they used to.)</p>\n]]>", "author": "Amy", "published": "2015-06-11 18:58:08+00:00", "title": "By: Amy"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Devil&#8217;s Advocate #162 and anyone else who might be interested.</p>\n<p>How about this :</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/semmott/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/semmott/</a></p>\n<p>I have his book,which needless to say,attracted much publicity/discussion/dispute and which has since been revised.</p>\n<p>Details of the revisions on the website.</p>\n<p>He is a leading scientist in C ambridge and has a number of research interests.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got his book.</p>\n]]>", "author": "jane", "published": "2015-06-11 19:17:39+00:00", "title": "By: jane"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>@jane and Devil&#8217;s Advocate (various #s):</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not so sure the math on talented and clever people works out so well if such traits are, as they seem to be, (1) correlated with longer generations, and (2) partially hereditary.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there&#8217;s also a lot which is culture- and income-based when it comes to the length of generations (and the number of kids per), and those fronts <i>do</i> look promising overall.
