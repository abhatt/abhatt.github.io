That is, what you say is &#8220;natural&#8221; here is I think exactly what Einstein et al were saying:  this kind of determinism is *required* by the perfect EPR type correlations, if you want to avoid nonlocality.  And this is worth stressing, because Bell took himself to be adding something to the EPR argument, i.e., as building on their earlier identification that locality requires determinism.  If you think of Bell&#8217;s argument in this &#8220;two-part&#8221; way, it is much easier to appreciate that the ultimate upshot is that locality is untenable, without getting into a lot of complicated discussions about exactly how he formulated &#8220;locality&#8221;, etc.</p>\n<p>In any case, it&#8217;s not clear to me why one would want to use/preserve the terminology of &#8220;local realism&#8221; at all.  Surely beginners can be helped to understand the EPR argument from locality to (local) deterministic hidden variables, and can then be helped to understand Bell&#8217;s proof that local deterministic hidden variable theories can&#8217;t make the right predictions for a wider class of correlations, so that locality is untenable.  If you just acknowledge and remember the first, EPR, part of Bell&#8217;s two-part argument, everything is simple and clear, including the fact that &#8220;local realism&#8221; is at best some &#8220;middle term&#8221; in the argument that isn&#8217;t actually of any particular importance.  What&#8217;s important is that locality is incompatible with the (now very well confirmed) QM predictions.  </p>\n<p>Let me say this again from another perspective.  You said that local determinism is a natural first guess about how the universe works and suggested that it&#8217;s worth knowing and sharing the proof that this can&#8217;t be right.  That&#8217;s all fine and good, but it would be a shame if you then bury what is to me an equally important thing:  if your second guess about how the universe works is that it is local but indeterministic (or, ridiculously, &#8220;unreal&#8221;) that too doesn&#8217;t work!  Basically what upsets me about the whole &#8220;local realism&#8221; terminology is that everybody who uses it seems to think that if only we jettison &#8220;realism&#8221; (which really always comes down to meaning deterministic hidden variables) then we can preserve locality.  That is everybody&#8217;s standard view of ordinary QM:  it&#8217;s local, and it&#8217;s only if you foolishly try to muck it up by restoring determinism that you run into problems with nonlocality.  But this is simply wrong.  Ordinary QM is already nonlocal, and you don&#8217;t even need anything remotely as fancy as Bell&#8217;s theorem to see this.  Just look at the theory (especially the collapse postulate!).  (Of course it&#8217;s nice to have a formal definition of &#8220;locality&#8221; that we can use to unambiguously diagnose ordinary QM as nonlocal.  But once you know where to look the nonlocality is so blatant and obvious that you don&#8217;t really need any of this fancy stuff to see it.)  </p>\n<p>As to Wolfram, I never got around to reading his book, so it was a little hard to follow all the details of your argument in the book review.  But in so far as Wolfram claimed that the QM correlations could be reproduced with a deterministic and relativistic model, I think I would agree with you that that is problematic.  But then it seems like the heart of your counter-thesis is that one needs irreducible indeterminism and/or superposition.  To me these options also both seem problematic and I would want to press you to explain how even the perfect EPR correlations (just a subset of the general QM predictions after all) can be explained in a local (or is it just a relativistic?) way by introducing indeterminism and/or superposition.  My sense is that this kind of claim tends to arise when people focus too narrowly on just the second part of Bell&#8217;s two-part argument (the part showing that local deterministic hidden variables imply a Bell inequality) while forgetting the first (EPR) part (the part showing that locality requires local deterministic hidden variables already for the simpler sub-class of QM predictions).  </p>\n<p>But the relationship between locality and relativity is subtle, and I kind of lose sight of what exactly both you and Wolfram are even claiming to argue for here.  So take this with a large grain of salt.  But my sense is indeed that there is nothing new here that wasn&#8217;t already known to Bell.  (For sure that is my opinion of Conway/Kochen &#8212; I don&#8217;t think they proved anything new at all; they just made a big mess with words regarding the so-called free will assumption of Bell&#8217;s inequality.)</p>\n]]>", "author": "Travis", "published": "2015-09-20 13:46:03+00:00", "title": "By: Travis"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Flavio,</p>\n<p>Well, I wouldn&#8217;t want you to do something you hate, I am genuinely curious if you, as you put it, put your money where your mouth is.

Also, it does provide a nice introduction to J.S. Bell views &#8211; whose writings I definitely have to read, sooner or later.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the EPR paradox and Bell inequalities are tricky subjects, which may be more suited for a discussion among philosophers then among physicists (and computer scientist? \ud83d\ude09 ). The EPR paradox in particular is an archetypical example of a problem which in itself is almost a mathematical triviality, and yet it is extremely difficult to achieve a widespread consensus about its interpretation.</p>\n<p>IMHO, what Bell experiments have shown is that the &#8220;realism&#8221; assumption given by EPR is demonstrably false, and that quantum physics is indeed a local theory! The point is that, for me at least, &#8220;local&#8221; simply is the statement that superluminal communication is impossible! And I cannot really understand which are the other interpretation of the word &#8220;local&#8221;. Probably, there is some metaphysical confusion going around, stemming from the fact that in order to simulate a Bell inequality violation with a classical system, one would need faster-than-light communication&#8230;</p>\n<p>So, Travis, following your paper: it is evident that the EPR argument is sufficient to rule out the possibility that the (quantum mechanical) world satisfies the &#8220;local causality condition&#8221;, as given in equation (1) of your paper. Let me explain and comment over that here, for those who have not read it.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s suppose that exist `entities&#8217; which provide an `objective&#8217; description of the state of reality, i.e. what Bell called &#8220;beables&#8221;; in which be-able is used in contrast to observ-able, to denote something which `is&#8217;, rather than something which is merely `observed&#8217;. Ok, this seems to be a pretty metaphysical definition; but I think it can be described more concretely as follows. By beable, it is meant a description of the state of reality, at a given time, which:</p>\n<p>1) is not necessarily observable;<br />\n2) is correlated with the `future evolution of the system&#8217;: by this, we mean that the measurements made in the future will have outcomes which are probabilistically correlated with these beables;</p>\n<p>and moreover, if these beables are &#8220;complete&#8221;, then:</p>\n<p>3) these beables provide all possible information about the future measurement outcomes: that is, the beables completely determine, given the measurement which will be performed, the probability of obtaining a certain future measurement outcome.</p>\n<p>Well, with these assumptions, the beables seem to me to be pretty similar to a set of &#8220;hidden variables&#8221;; also, it seems to me that the &#8220;realism&#8221; hypothesis has been implicitly introduced, as the measurement outcomes are determined by these beables&#8230; but let&#8217;s move on.</p>\n<p>Now, we suppose that Alice and Bob are far away from each other, and that we have a complete beable for Alice&#8217;s experiment, which however is disjoint form Bob&#8217;s past light-cone (represented in Fig. 2 in your paper). Then, the condition 3) above can be expressed as:</p>\n<p>P( a | Beable, b ) = P( a | Beable )</p>\n<p>in which &#8220;a&#8221; is Alice&#8217;s outcome and &#8220;b&#8221; any experiment that Bob can perform in a causally disjoint region of space, so that by the no-faster-than-light-communication principle, it cannot influence Alice&#8217;s results. And this is exactly equation (1) of your paper, i.e. the &#8220;local causality condition&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This condition seems to be very natural, almost obvious&#8230; but it is bluntly violated by Quantum Mechanics, as shown by EPR. For a maximally entangled pair of qubits we get P(a|Beable) = 1/2 and P(a|Beable,b) = 1; i.e., Bob&#8217;s measurement is completely correlated with Alice&#8217;s measurement!</p>\n<p>Ok, so this &#8220;local causality condition&#8221; is violated&#8230; what can one learn from it? There are three possible way-out, as far as I can see:</p>\n<p>1) Quantum Mechanics is incomplete (the solution supported by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen); pictorically, it could be represented as a hole in the &#8220;beable&#8221; reagion in Fig. 2 in your paper, which allows information to flow from the common past of Alice and Bob to influence Alice&#8217;s experiment, without being `comprehended&#8217; by the standard Quantum Mechanics theory.</p>\n<p>2) Locality is violated (supported by JS Bell himself), however without violating the no-faster-than-light-communication principle. However I cannot understand this position&#8230; for me no-superluminal signalling is just the definition of locality, so what are we talking about? If one can give me a satisfying alternative definition of locality, I would be very happy&#8230;</p>\n<p>3) The beables/hidden-variables/realism assumption is wrong (and standard quantum mechanincs is right). Just to elaborate a little bit further: it is assumed that the beables determine Alice&#8217;s measurements, but the beables themselves are never measured! If, instead, one tries to observe these beables by preventively measuring Alice&#8217;s quantum system, this will give a (complete) description of Alice&#8217;s system, but then it will be unentangled from Bob&#8217;s system! So we end up with having P(a|Beable) = P(a|Beable,b) = 1.</p>\n<p>Ok, so far I have talked only about the EPR paradox. </p>\n<p>Conceptually, what the violation of Bell inequalities adds to the argument is that it precludes point 1) above to be a valid argument. Any hidden-variable/realistic (local) theory which assigns a definite value (at least probabilistically) for Alice&#8217;s and Bob&#8217;s measurements, cannot violate Bell&#8217;s inequalities!</p>\n<p>Since also point 2) is extremely well verified, it seems to me that the problem has been pretty much resolved, in favour of solution 3) above&#8230;</p>\n<p>Finally, I apologize for the length of this comment&#8230; But I have wanted to write a little bit about Bell inequalities for ages!</p>\n]]>", "author": "Davide Orsucci", "published": "2015-09-20 18:09:08+00:00", "title": "By: Davide Orsucci"}]
