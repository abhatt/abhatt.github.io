[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Greg #66, I think I can answer some of your questions.</p>\n<p>First, one small point: Peano arithmetic is a theory in the language of the natural numbers, so it does not have any way to talk about or prove things about the real numbers. One appropriate setting (which is still quite close to things like PA) for things like the Hadwiger-Nelson problem is second order arithmetic (where we can quantify not just over natural numbers, but also sets of natural numbers). In this setting we can talk about real numbers as e.g. Dedekind cuts.</p>\n<p>Second, yes the figure showing that the local chromatic number of the plane is at most 7 is valid in ZF and also in all but extremely weak theories of second order arithmetic.</p>\n<p>Third, a sentence in first order logic is called \u03a0_1 if the only quantifiers that appear in it are universal (although typically, bounded existential quantifiers are also allowed). More properly, this should be called \u03a0^0_1 where the superscript indicates that the sentence is first order. A sentence in second order logic where the only second order quantifiers are universal is called \u03a0^1_1 and so on. What Scott is asking is if the Hadwiger-Nelson problem is equivalent to a \u03a0^0_1 statement in the language of the natural numbers. Note that a sentence being \u03a0^0_1 in set theory is pretty different than a sentence being \u03a0^0_1 in arithmetic (because in set theory this already means we can quantify over all sets and not just over natural numbers). The reason Scott is asking this is because \u03a0^0_1 sentences over the natural numbers have the interesting property that if they are independent of PA (or whatever sufficiently strong theory you fancy) then they are actually true. This is because a \u03a0^0_1 statement being false is equivalent to the existence of a counterexample satisfying a statement where all quantifiers are bounded and PA is strong enough to prove all true statements with only bounded quantifiers (in fact, much less than PA is needed).</p>\n<p>Fourth, the de Bruijn-Erdos theorem (along with the observation about finite unit-distance graphs being always represented in the plane by algebraic numbers) shows that in ZFC, the problem of showing that the chromatic number of the plane is greater than, say, 6 is equivalent to a \u03a0^0_1 statement of arithmetic (though note that this is not quite the same as the Hadwiger-Nelson problem). But without choice (or more accurately, without the ultrafilter lemma), it is at least not obviously equivalent to a \u03a0^0_1 statement. On the other hand, your proposed &#8220;local chromatic number&#8221; can be shown to be equivalent to a \u03a0^0_1 statement even in a very weak theory. So if someone were to show this &#8220;local&#8221; version independent of your favorite theory of second order arithmetic (or ZF or whatever) then they would have simultaneously resolved the problem itself in whatever stronger system they used to prove the independence. Of course, it is also possible for it to be independent of ZF but independent that it&#8217;s independent, etc.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the Shelah-Soifer papers don&#8217;t say anything about the local version. In fact, they show that for some graphs, the local version and the global version can disagree when choice is not present (in their case, specifically in a model without choice and where all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable).</p>\n]]>", "author": "Patrick", "published": "2018-04-15 07:44:31+00:00", "title": "By: Patrick"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Scott #60:</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll use &#8220;orthogonal rank&#8221; to refer to &#8220;the smallest dimension in which there is an orthogonal representation&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03542\" rel=\"nofollow\">paper by Laura Man\u010dinska and David Roberson</a> gives separations between quantum chromatic number and orthogonal rank.
