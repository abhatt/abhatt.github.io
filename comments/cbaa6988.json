[{"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Sniffnoy #21: Yes, I think it can be made reasonably intuitive.  Suppose you&#8217;re a verifier, expecting two quantum witnesses that you&#8217;re going to cross-check against each other by measuring them in different, randomly-chosen bases.  If the prover can entangle the witnesses, that might open up lots of ways for the prover to cheat&#8212;just like how entanglement lets you &#8220;cheat&#8221; in the CHSH game, winning it with greater than the &#8220;maximum possible&#8221; probability.  So the assumption that the witnesses are unentangled gives more power to the verifier.  And of course, the other way to think about it is that, if the verifier had wanted to eliminate the prover entirely, in the case of one witness it would just need to solve a convex optimization problem, but in the case of two or more witnesses (that are promised to be unentangled) it needs to solve a non-convex one.</p>\n<p>If you want to understand how the promise of unentanglement actually gets used in real protocols, I think the first step would be to check out the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0738\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blier-Tapp protocol</a>, which verifies that a graph is 3-colorable with two unentangled quantum proofs of log(n) qubits each, albeit with only a 1/poly(n) probability of catching cheating provers (which is why it doesn&#8217;t imply QMA(2)=NEXP&#8212;that 1/poly(n) becomes 1/exp(n) when you scale up by an exponential).  Next you could look at <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/qma2out.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">our paper</a>, where we verify that a 3SAT instance is satisfiable using O(&radic;n polylog(n)) unentangled quantum proofs of log(n) qubits each.

A curious feature of Martin&#8217;s proof is that, at the end of the day, it <i>gives an algorithm</i> to simulate QMA(2) protocols, but it does so in an extremely non-explicit way&#8212;basically by chaining together a sequence of reductions, rather than by directly telling you how you&#8217;d program your computer to do the simulation.  If there <i>were</i> a bug, then possibly a good way to find it would be to unravel the reduction sequence into an actual algorithm.  Actually <i>implementing</i> the algorithm might be overkill, though, particularly since the polynomial blowups would be quite large, and might make it almost impossible to notice the difference between exponential time and doubly-exponential time in any simulations that we could feasibly do.</p>\n]]>", "author": "Scott", "published": "2015-11-02 14:35:02+00:00", "title": "By: Scott"}, {"content": "<![CDATA[<p>Douglas #20 and Sniffnoy #22,</p>\n<p>Ok.

Is QMA known to be, as a complexity class, robust to this kind of change, or would this modification deeply impact the properties of this complexity class?</p></blockquote>\n<p>My answer: Essentially every topic in both quantum physics and quantum computation/information has the property that anything that you could with real or quaternionic amplitudes can be co-opted in one way or another by formalism with complex amplitudes.  The essential point is that the norm squared of an amplitude is a probability.   After that, everything works better with complex amplitudes simply because the complex numbers are both commutative and algebraically closed.</p>\n<p>This point is woven into linear algebra itself.  Do you ever wonder why linear algebra is largely taught over the complex numbers?  There is a notion of quaternionic linear algebra, so why isn&#8217;t it usually taught?   The answer is that quaternionic linear algebra reduces to a special case of complex linear algebra.  Real and complex linear algebra also reduce to special cases of each other, but in the end the version with complex numbers is just nicer because they are algebraically closed.  (Since they are simpler for many purposes, I think that they should have been called the &#8220;complete&#8221; numbers rather than the complex numbers.)</p>\n<p>There are some questions in mathematics and even in quantum physics that are more nicely stated in terms of quaternions than complex numbers.

Apparently the answer is that gallium arsenide is historically the one major, credible alternative to silicon.   Doped semiconductor transistors clobber everything else for intrinsic reasons; in a nutshell, that you get an overwhelming combination advantage of speed, reliability, miniaturization, and scalability.   (Some of the hyped alternatives that show up in the press from time to time don&#8217;t even have voltage gain and thus aren&#8217;t yet viable; and have other practical disadvantages.)
