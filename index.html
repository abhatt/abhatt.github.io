Arvind Mithal—almost always referred to as Arvind—is now the head of the faculty of computer science at a Boston trade school. The school, also known as MIT, is of course one of the top places for all things computer science. From education to service to startups to research, MIT is perhaps the best in the world.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might discuss one of Arvind’s main research themes.</p>
<p>
Although this work started in the 1980’s I believe that it underscores an important point. This insight might apply to current research topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing">quantum computers</a>.</p>
<p>
But first I cannot resist saying something personal about him. Arvind is a long time friend of mine, and someone who gets the <i>stuck in elevator measure</i> of many hours. This measure is one I made up, but I hope you get the idea.</p>
<p>
Arvind is the only name I have ever known for Arvind. I was a bit surprised to see that the Wikipedia reference for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_(computer_scientist)">him</a> states his “full” name. He told me that he found having one name—not two—was a challenge. For example, he sometimes had to explain when arriving at a check-in desk at a conference that he only had one name. His name tag often became: </p>

<p>because the conference software could not handle people with one name. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The prehistory </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
About forty years ago one of the major open problem in CS was how to make computers go faster. It is still an issue, but in the 1980’s this problem was one of all-hands-on-deck. It was worked on by software engineers, by electrical engineers, by researchers of all kinds including complexity theorists. Conferences like FOCS and STOC—hardcore theory conferences—often contained papers on how to speed up computations. </p>
<p>
Two examples come to mind:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array">systolic</a> arrays led by Hsiang-Tsung Kung then at CMU.

An ultracomputer has N processors, N memories and an N log N message-passing switch connecting them. Note, the use of “N” so you can <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/">tell</a> that it came from a theorist. </p>
<p>
Arvind tried to make computers faster by inventing a new type of computer architecture. Computers then were based on the classic von Neumann architecture or control flow architecture. He and his colleagues worked for many years trying to replace this architecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow#Hardware_architecture">dataflow</a>. </p>
<p>
A bottleneck in von Neumann style machines is caused by the program counter fetch cycle. Each cycle the program counter decides which instruction to get, and thus which data to get. These use the same hardware channel, which causes the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann bottleneck</a>. We have modified Wikipedia’s graphic to make the bottleneck aspect clearer:</p>

</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The promise </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Arvind is usually identified with the invention of <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191029.pdf">dataflow</a> computer architecture. The key idea of this architecture is to avoid the above bottleneck by eliminating the program counter. If there are no instructions to fetch, then it would seem that we can beat the bottleneck. Great idea.</p>
<p>
Dataflow architectures do not have a program counter, and so data is king. Roughly data objects move around in such a machine, and they eventually appear at computational units. Roughly these machines operate, at a high level, like a directed graph from complexity theory. Data moves along edges to nodes that compute values. Moreover, nodes compute as soon as all the input data is present. After the node computes the value, the new data is sent to the next node; and so on. </p>

<p>
The hope was that this would yield a way to increase the performance of computers. No program counter, no instruction fetching, could make dataflow machines faster. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The actual </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The dataflow idea is clever. The difficulty is while dataflow can work, classic von Neumann machines have been augmented in various ways. The competition rarely stays put. These updates did not eliminate the von Neumann bottleneck, but they reduce the cost of it, and let von Neumann machines continue to get faster. Caches are one example of how they avoid the bottleneck, thus making the dataflow machines less attractive. Thus, a cache for program instructions makes it likely that the program fetch step does not actually happen. This is an attack on the main advantage of dataflow machines. </p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/tve/papers-ucb/limits.pdf">paper</a> by David Culler, Klaus Schauser, and Thorsten von Eicken titled <i>Two Fundamental Limits on Dataflow Multiprocessing?</i> discusses these issues in detail. They start by saying: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The advantages of dataflow architectures were argued persuasively in a seminal 1983 paper by Arvind and Iannucci and in a 1987 revision entitled “Two Fundamental Issues in Multiprocessing”. However, reality has proved less favorable to this approach than their arguments would suggest. This motivates us to examine the line of reasoning that has driven dataflow architectures and fine-grain multithreading to understand where the argument went awry. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—Lessons </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are the lessons? Is there one? </p>
<p>
I claim there are lessons. The work of Arvind on dataflow was and is important. It did not lead to the demise of von Neumann machines. I am using one right now to write this.</p>
<p>
Dataflow did lead to insights on programming that have many applications. The dataflow idea may yet impact special computational situations: there is interest in using them for data intensive applications.</p>
<p>Ken adds that dataflow has been realized in other ways. Caches and pipes and subsequent architecture innovations profit from designs that enhance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference">locality</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a> programming model gives a general framework that fits this well. The paradigm of <a href="http://\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing">streaming</a> is even a better fit. Note that Wikipedia says both that it is “equivalent to dataflow programming” and “was explored within dataflow programming”—so perhaps the parent lost out to the wider adaptability of her children.</p>
<p>
I think there are lessons: Practical goals like making hardware go faster, are complex and many faceted. A pure theory approach such as systolic arrays or ultra computers or dataflow machines is unlikely to suffice. Also the existing technology like von Neumann machines will continue to evolve. </p>
<p>
A question is: Could quantum computers be subject to the same lesson? Will non-quantum machines continue to evolve in a way to make the quantum advantage less than we think? Or is this type of new architecture different? Could non-quantum machines incorporate tricks from quantum and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>

<p>This semester, like many other universities, Harvard switched to a pass/fail grade model. (In typical Harvard style, we give them different names – “Emergency Satisfactory” and “Emergency Unsatisfactory” –  but that doesn’t matter much).</p>



<p>One unexpected but happy consequence of this policy is that even though I already submitted the grades for my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">crypto course</a>, I can now take the time and send students detailed feedback on their final projects. Typically,  both students and faculty tend to be focused on the “bottom line” of exams or papers – what is the final grade. The comments are viewed as of marginal importance and only serve to justify why points have been deducted.</p>



<p>Now that there is no grade, I am actually giving many more comments on the write ups, trying to focus on giving students feedback on writing and presentation that will be useful for them later on. I benefited immensely from the extensive comments on my writing that I received from my advisor Oded Goldreich. While I will never match Oded’s thoroughness and dedication, I try to at least provide some of this to my students (though unlike Oded, I use blue and not red ink, and also do not intersperse the comments with Hebrew curses for emphasis <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> )</p>

remarkable recent improvements in their ability to solve a huge variety of
practical problems, the development of a satisfying and rigorous mathematical
understanding of their performance is one of the main challenges in the field
of learning theory. Against this background, we study the expressive power of
neural networks through the example of the classical NP-hard Knapsack Problem.
</p>
<p>Our main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with
rectified linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack
instance and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. In order
to find optimum Knapsack solutions, an RNN of depth four and width depending
quadratically on the profit of an optimum Knapsack solution is sufficient. We
also prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of
the computed Knapsack solution: For Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items,
an RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least
$1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results
build upon a dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem as well as
a careful rounding of profit values that is also at the core of the well-known
fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem. Finally,
we point out that similar results can be achieved for other optimization
problems that can be solved by dynamic programming, such as, e.g., various
Shortest Path Problems and the Longest Common Subsequence Problem.

to achieve a small function cost for these actions, as well as a small cost for
moving between actions. While the general problem requires a polynomial
dependence on the dimension, we show how to get dimension-independent bounds
for well-behaved functions. In particular, we consider the case where the
convex functions are $\kappa$-well-conditioned, and give an algorithm that
achieves an $O(\sqrt \kappa)$-competitiveness. Moreover, when the functions are
supported on $k$-dimensional affine subspaces--e.g., when the function are the
indicators of some affine subspaces--we get $O(\min(k, \sqrt{k \log
T}))$-competitive algorithms for request sequences of length $T$. We also show
some lower bounds, that well-conditioned functions require
$\Omega(\kappa^{1/3})$-competitiveness, and $k$-dimensional functions require
$\Omega(\sqrt{k})$-competitiveness.

under computationally expensive metrics, like the continuous Fr\'echet distance
on trajectory data. Based on clustering for metric indexes, we obtain a dynamic
tree structure whose size is linear in the number of trajectories, regardless
of the trajectory's individual sizes or the spatial dimension, which allows one
to exploit low `intrinsic dimensionality' of data sets for effective search
space pruning.
</p>
<p>Since the distance computation is expensive, generic metric indexing methods
are rendered impractical. We present strategies that (i) improve on known upper
and lower bound computations, (ii) build cluster trees without any or very few
distance calls, and (iii) search using bounds for metric pruning, interval
orderings for reduction, and randomized pivoting for reporting the final
results.

<p>We analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods with extensive
experiments on diverse synthetic and real-world data sets. The results show
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for exact queries, and even further
speed-ups are achieved for queries that may return approximate results.
Surprisingly, the majority of exact nearest-neighbor queries on real data sets
are answered without any distance computations.

with machine-learned advice, where each page request additionally comes with a
prediction of when that page will next be requested. In this model, a natural
goal is to design algorithms that (1) perform well when the advice is accurate
and (2) remain robust in the worst case a la traditional competitive analysis.
Lykouris and Vassilvitskii give such an algorithm by adapting the Marker
algorithm to the learning-augmented setting. In a recent work, Rohatgi (SODA
2020) improves on their result with an approach also inspired by randomized
marking. We continue the study of this problem, but with a somewhat different
approach: We consider combining the BlindOracle algorithm, which just na\"ively
follows the predictions, with an optimal competitive algorithm for online
caching in a black-box manner. The resulting algorithm outperforms all existing
approaches while being significantly simpler. Moreover, we show that combining
BlindOracle with LRU is in fact optimal among deterministic algorithms for this
problem.

Functional transducers are those for which the relation is a function. We
characterize functional nondeterministic transducers whose relations can be
verified by a deterministic two-tape automaton, show how to construct such an
automaton if one exists, and prove the undecidability of the criterion.

experiments. The problem arises in the OFRG method for analyzing microbial
communities. The OFRG method performs classification of rRNA gene clones using
binary fingerprints created from a series of hybridization experiments, where
each experiment consists of hybridizing a collection of arrayed clones with a
single oligonucleotide probe. This experiment produces analog signals, one for
each clone, which then need to be classified, that is, converted into binary
values 1 and 0 that represent hybridization and non-hybridization events. In
addition to the sample rRNA gene clones, the array contains a number of control
clones needed to calibrate the classification procedure of the hybridization
signals. These control clones must be selected with care to optimize the
classification process. We formulate this as a combinatorial optimization
problem called Balanced Covering. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and we
show some results on hardness of approximation. We propose approximation
algorithms based on randomized rounding and we show that, with high
probability, our algorithms approximate well the optimum solution. The
experimental results confirm that the algorithms find high quality control
clones. The algorithms have been implemented and are publicly available as part
of the software package called CloneTools.

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the task of ranking members of a population according to their qualifications based on a training set of binary outcome data. A natural approach for ranking is to reduce to prediction: first learn to predict individuals’ “probability” of success; then rank individuals in the order specified by the predictions. A concern with this approach is that such rankings may be vulnerable to manipulation. The rank of an individual depends not only on their own qualification but also on every other individuals’ qualifications, so small inaccuracies in prediction may result in a highly inaccurate and unfair induced ranking. We show how to obtain rankings that satisfy a number of desirable accuracy and fairness criteria, despite the coarseness of binary outcome data.<br />
We develop two parallel definitions of evidence-based rankings. First, we study a semantic notion of <em>domination-compatibility</em>: if the training data suggest that members of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> are on-average more qualified than the members of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />, then a ranking that favors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> (i.e., where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> dominates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />) is blatantly inconsistent with the data, and likely to be discriminatory. Our definition asks for domination-compatibility, not just for a pair of sets (e.g., majority and minority populations), but rather for every pair of sets from a rich collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> of subpopulations. The second notion—evidence-consistency—aims at precluding even more general forms of discrimination: the ranking must be justified on the basis of consistency with the expectations for every set in the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" />. Somewhat surprisingly, while evidence-consistency is a strictly stronger notion than domination-compatibility when the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> is predefined, the two notions are equivalent when the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> may depend on the ranking itself. Finally, we show a tight connection between evidence-based rankings and multi-calibrated predictors [HKRR’18]. This connection establishes a way to reduce the task of ranking to prediction that ensures strong guarantees of fairness in the resulting ranking.<br />

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>I was seriously depressed for the last week, by noticeably more than my baseline amount for the new pandemic-ravaged world.  The depression seems to have been triggered by two pieces of news:</p>



<ol><li>The US Food and Drug Administration—yes, the same FDA whose failure to approve covid tests in February infamously set the stage for the deaths of 100,000 Americans—has now <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-testing-seattle-bill-gates.html">banned</a> the Gates Foundation’s program for at-home covid testing.  This, it seems to me, is not the sort of thing that could happen in a still-functioning society, one where people valued their own and their neighbors’ physical survival, and viewed rules and regulations as merely instruments to that end.  It’s the sort of thing that one imagines in the waning years of a doomed empire, when no one pretends anymore that they can fix or improve the Leviathan; they’re all just scurrying to flee the Leviathan as it collapses with a thud.  More broadly, I <em>still</em> don’t think that the depth of America’s humiliation and downfall has sunk in to most Americans.  For me, it starts and ends with a single observation: <strong>where fifty years ago we landed humans on the moon, today we can no longer make or distribute paper masks, even when hundreds of thousands of lives depend on it.</strong>  Look, there are many countries, like Taiwan and New Zealand, that managed to protect both their economies <em>and</em> their vulnerable citizens’ lives, by crushing the virus early.  Then there are countries that waited, until they faced an excruciating choice between the two.  But here in the US, we’ve somehow achieved the worst of both worlds—triggering a second Great Depression while <em>also</em> utterly failing to control the virus.  Can we abandon the charade of treating this as a legible “policy choice,” to be debated in earnest thinkpieces?  To me, it just feels like the death-spasm of a collapsing Leviathan.</li><li>Something that, at first glance, might seem trivial by comparison, but isn’t: the University of California system—ignoring the <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/kkb-jn-standardized-testing.pdf">advice</a> of its own Academic Senate, and at the apparent insistence of its chancellor Janet Napolitano—will now <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2020/05/24/the-story-behind-university-of-californias-landmark-decision-to-ditch-the-sat/">permanently end</a> the use of the SAT and ACT in undergraduate admissions.  This is widely expected, probably correctly, to trigger a chain reaction, whereby one US university after the next will abandon standardized tests.  As a result, admissions to the top US universities—and hence, most chances for social advancement in the US—will henceforth be based <em>entirely</em> on shifting and nebulous criteria that rich, well-connected kids and their parents spend most of their lives figuring out, rather than merely <em>mostly</em> based on such criteria.  The last side door for smart noncomformist kids is now being slammed shut.  From now on, in the US, the <em>only</em> paths to success that clearly delineate their rules will be sports, gambling, reality TV, and the like.  In case it matters to anyone reading this, I feel certain that a 15-year-old me wouldn’t stand a chance in the emerging regime—any more than nerdy Jewish kids did in the USSR of the 1970s, or the US of the 1920s.  (As I’ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">previously recounted</a> on this blog, the US’s “holistic” college admissions system, with its baffling-to-foreigners emphasis on “character,” “leadership,” “well-roundedness,” etc. rather than test scores, originated in a successful push a century ago by the presidents of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to keep Jewish enrollments down.  Today the system fulfills precisely the same function, except against Asian-Americans rather than Jews.)  Ironically but predictably, the death of the SAT—i.e., of one of the most fearsome weapons against entrenched wealth and power ever devised—is being <em>celebrated</em> by the self-described champions of the underdog.  I have one question for those champions: do you not understand what your system will <em>actually</em> do to society’s underdogs?  Or do you understand perfectly well, and approve?</li></ol>



<p>To put it bluntly—since events like these leave no room for euphemism—a hundred thousand Americans are now dead from covid, and hundreds of thousands more are poised to die, because smart people are no longer in charge.  And the death of the SAT will help ensure that smart people will never be <em>back</em> in charge.  Obama might be remembered by history as America’s last smart-person-in-charge, its last competent technocrat—but one man couldn’t stop a tidal wave of stupid.</p>



<p>I know from experience what many will readers will say to all this: “instead of wallowing in gloom, Scott, why don’t you just make falsifiable predictions about the bad outcomes you expect from these developments, and then score yourself later?”</p>



<p>So here’s the thing about that.</p>



<p>Shortly after Trump was elected, I changed this blog’s background to black, as a small way to mourn the United States that I’d grown up thinking that I lived in, the one that had at least some ideals.  Today, with four years of hindsight, my thinking then feels <em>overly optimistic</em>: why plain black?  Why not, like, images of rotting corpses in a pit?</p>



<p>And yet, were I foolish enough to register predictions in 2016, I would’ve said that within one year, Trump’s staggering incompetence would <em>surely</em> cause some catastrophe or other to grip the country—a really obvious one, with mass death and even Trump’s beloved stock market cratering.</p>



<p>And then after a year, commenters would ridicule me, because none of that had happened.  After two years, they’d ridicule me again because it <em>still</em> hadn’t happened, and after three years they’d ridicule me a third time.</p>



<p>Now it’s happened.</p>



<p>America, we now know, is like the cartoon character who runs off a cliff: it dangled in midair for three years, defying physics, before it finally looked down.</p>



<p>Look, I’m a theoretical computer scientist.  By training, I deal in asymptotics, not in constant factors.  I don’t often make predictions with deadlines; when I do, I often regret it.  It’s a good thing that I became an academic rather than an investor!  For I’ve learned that the only “oracular power” I have is to make statements like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My eyes, my brain, and the pit of my stomach are all blaring at me that the asymptotics of this situation just took a sharp turn for the worse.  Sure, for an unknown length of time, noise and constant factors could mask the effects.  But eventually, either (1) society will need to reverse what it just did, or else (2) terrible effects will spring from it, or else (3) the entire universe no longer makes sense.</p></blockquote>



<p>When I’ve felt this way in the past, option (3) rarely turned out to be the right answer.</p>



<p>So, what can anyone say that will make me less depressed?  Thanks in advance!</p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>From the Virtual Transition Team for EC 2020:</i> Due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the 2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020) will be held virtually.  This change of format offers exciting new opportunities. This guide can also be found on the </span><a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/participation/covid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC 2020 webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15 – 19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions.</span><br />
<b>June 22 – July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Live EC Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions.</span><br />
<b>July 13:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tutorial Watch Parties, Business Meeting and Poster Session</span><br />
<b>July 14 – 16:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> EC Conference (Paper Watch Parties, Paper Poster Sessions, and Plenaries).</span><br />
<b>July 17 – 22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Workshops.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee has been hard at work revisioning EC 2020 as a virtual event.  The event aims to emphasize opportunities afforded by the virtual format with activities that are intractable in the physical format, but not to recreate aspects of the physical conference experience that are difficult virtually.  Some aspects of the event will look similar to a physical conference, while some will be quite different.  The desiderata for the selected format are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize exposure for EC papers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize interaction between community members.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow broad global accessibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizational team studied the results of many virtual conferences that have already taken place (</span><a href="https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAMAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/243882-the-asplos-2020-online-conference-experience/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASPLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.eurosys2020.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EuroSys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://iccp2020.engr.wustl.edu/vsetup.html?fbclid=IwAR3ONLEftxPsTmW4b1oTyCjvAFWWOxWRWS4bV6kTox1yP8AUpgSAbkL76Qc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICCP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@iclr_conf/gone-virtual-lessons-from-iclr2020-1743ce6164a3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICLR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/4/20/wagon-lessons-learned"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WAGON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others, as well as the </span><a href="https://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/acm/VirtualConferences_GuideToBestPractices_CURRENT.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACM guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  Some general rules of thumb are (a) prerecording talks, (b) emphasizing posters, (c) expecting about four hours a day of participation, (d) prime time is 11am-3pm ET.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee adopted a strategy that allows the minimal commitment level for authors and attendees of presenting and viewing 18 minute talks and attending activities only during the main EC week of July 13-17.  However, official EC events will run June 15 to July 24 and the planning committee highly encourages members of the community to enjoy a more relaxed pace where all programming is plenary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration will be mandatory but complementary with ACM SIGecom membership ($10 Professional / $5 Student) which can easily be completed online.  Registration will open on June 1.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15-19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To give junior researchers plenty of time to prepare for the EC conference, the mentoring workshops and tutorial live pre-recording sessions will be held the week of June 15.  In addition to the usual activities, junior students will be paired with senior students who will share their EC itinerary and be available for discussions of papers and events in online chat throughout the duration of the EC events.  There will be three tutorials, each broken into four 45 minute segments and recorded over several days and with live audiences of EC participants.  Students will be able to work together on exercises in between sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 22 – July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  EC papers will keep the usual 18-minute format.  The planning committee highly encourages authors to choose to pre-record their EC talks in live pre-recording sessions.  Each session comprises three papers and is followed by a virtual coffee break for discussion between the speakers, coauthors, and attendees.  Speakers and attendees are recommended to schedule for 2 hours.  These sessions are all plenary and will be scheduled for synergies in topic and preferred timing of the speakers.  These sessions begin at regular times:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Eastern/China 9:00, 13:00, 17:00, 21:00, 1:00, 5:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Central/Israel  8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 24:00, 4:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mountain/Europe 7:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, 23:00, 3:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Pacific/London  6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00, 2:00.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect about three sessions a day over the ten weekdays between June 22 and July 3.  (Pre-recording sessions are optional but highly encouraged for authors of EC papers.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Conference</span></h2>
<p><b>July 13-16: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 13 is tutorial day.  It will include the EC business meeting and a contributed poster session for breaking results and results from other venues.  The main conference runs July 14-July 16 with programming from 9am-5pm Eastern.  This programming includes pre-recorded talk watch parties, poster discussion sessions for the papers, live plenary talks, and live highlights beyond EC.  The paper and poster discussion sessions will run in two-hour blocks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 1: 3-5 parallel tracks of watch parties (3 papers each), with realtime chat with the authors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 2: plenary 1-minute lightning talks for all papers, breakout room for discussion for each paper with poster (a poster is 1-4 slides in PDF). (The lightning talks and poster discussion rooms are optional but highly encouraged for authors of the session’s papers.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these watch parties will be in parallel sessions and some may be at times that are hard for some members of the community to attend, the planning committee highly encourages participation in the live pre-recording sessions (June 22-July 3) and all talks will be available for individual viewing in advance of the conference. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Workshops</span></h2>
<p><b>July 17-22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Three workshops will take place on the Friday of EC and the following week.  Details for these events are still being worked out by the organizers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Presentation by Student or Postdoctoral Research Award.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="http://www.sigecom.org/award-presentation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Best Presentation by a Student or Postdoctoral Researcher Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to encourage and acknowledge excellence in oral presentations by students and recent graduates. In addition to an honorarium, this year’s winner will be invited to present in a special session at WINE 2020 with expenses covered by SIGecom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be considered for the award, the presenter must participate in a live pre-recording session. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This year will feature several “fun” categories for video presentations. Audience nominations are requested for creative and fun videos in the categories of: Best Video, Best Cameo by a Child or Pet, Best Special Effects, Best Soundtrack, or Best [Insert Your Nomination Here]. Submit nominations </span><a href="https://forms.gle/bfWEqDwseGHnciUP6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Transition Team</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual aspects of the conference are being coordinated by a Virtual Transition Team appointed by the SIGecom Executive Committee, that in addition to the </span><a href="http://sigecom.org/officers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/organizing-committee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC 2020 organizing committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes the following officers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual General Chair: Jason Hartline</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Local Chair: Yannai Gonczarowski</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Global Outreach Chairs: Rediet Abebe and Eric Sodomka</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is looking forward to interacting with everyone in the community at an outstanding conference!</span></p></div>

(The Baseball season is delayed or cancelled, so I post about baseball instead.)<br />
<br />
This post is going to ask a question that you could look up on the web. But what fun with that be?<br />
<br />
The following statements are true<br />
<br />
1) Don Larsen, a professional baseball player who played from 1953 to 1967, is still alive. He is 90 years old (or perhaps 90 years young---I don't know the state of his health).  He was born Aug 7, 1929. He is best know for pitching a perfect game in the World Series in 1956, pitching for the Yankees. He played for several other teams as well, via trades (this was before free agency).<br />
(CORRECTION- I wrote this post a while back, and Don Larsen has died since then.)<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Whitey Ford, a professional baseball player who played from 1950 to 1967, is still alive. He is 91 years old (or perhaps 91 years young---I don't know the state of his health).  He was born Oct 21,  1928. He had many great seasons and is in the hall of fame. He played for the New York Yankees and no other team.<br />
<br />
3) From 1900 (or so) until 1962 there were 16 professional baseball teams which had 25 people each. From 1962 until 1969 there were 20 teams which had 25 people each. There were also many minor league teams.<br />
<br />
4) The youngest ballplayers are usually around 20. The oldest around 35. These are not exact numbers<br />
<br />
SO here is my question: Try to estimate<br />
<br />
1) How many LIVING  retired major league baseball players are there now who are older than Don Larsen?<br />
<br />
2) How many LIVING retired major league baseball players are of an age between Don and Whitey?<br />
<br />
3) How  many LIVING retired major league baseball players are older than Whitey Ford?<br />
<br />
Give your REASONING for your answer.<br />
<br /></div>

Saeed Salehi is a logician at the University of Tabriz in Iran. Three years ago he gave a <a href="http://wrm17.mi.ras.ru/slides/Salehi.pdf">presentation</a> at a Moscow workshop on proofs of the diagonal lemma.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would discuss the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma">diagonal lemma</a>. </p>
<p>
The lemma is related to Georg Cantor’s famous diagonal argument yet is different. The logical version imposes requirements on when the argument applies, and requires that it be expressible within a formal system. </p>
<p>
The lemma underpins Kurt Gödel’s famous 1931 <a href="http://www.w-k-essler.de/pdfs/goedel.pdf">proof</a> that arithmetic is incomplete. However, Gödel did not state it as a lemma or proposition or theorem or anything else. Instead, he focused his attention on what we now call Gödel numbering. We consider this today as “obvious” but his paper’s title ended with “Part I”. And he had readied a “Part II” with over 100 pages of calculations should people question that his numbering scheme was expressible within the logic. </p>
<p>
Only after his proof was understood did people realize that one part, perhaps the trickiest part, could be abstracted into a powerful lemma. The tricky part is <em>not</em> the Gödel numbering. People granted that it can be brought within the logic once they saw enough of Gödel’s evidence, and so we may write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" class="latex" title="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" /> for the function giving the Gödel number of any formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> and use that in other formulas. The hard part is what one <em>does</em> with such expressions. </p>
<p>
This is what we will try to motivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Tracing the Lemma </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Rudolf Carnap is often credited with the first formal statement, in 1934, for instance by Eliott Mendelson in his famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250868.Introduction_to_Mathematical_Logic">textbook</a> on logic. Carnap was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap">member</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle">Vienna Circle</a>, which Gödel frequented, and Carnap is <a href="http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00004&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=">considered</a> a giant among twentieth-century philosophers. He worked on sweeping grand problems of philosophy, including logical positivism and analysis of human language via syntax before semantics. Yet it strikes us with irony that his work on the lemma may be the best remembered.</p>
<p>
Who did the lemma first? Let’s leave that for others and move on to the mystery of how to prove the lemma once it is stated. I must say the lemma is easy to state, easy to remember, and has a short proof. But I believe that the proof is not easy to remember or even follow. </p>
<p>
Salehi’s <a href="http://wrm17.mi.ras.ru/slides/Salehi.pdf">presentation</a> quotes others’ opinions about the proof:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Sam Buss: “Its proof [is] quite simple but rather tricky and difficult to conceptualize.”</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> György Serény (we jump to Serény’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0606425.pdf">paper</a>): “The proof of the lemma as it is presented in textbooks on logic is not self-evident to say the least.”</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Wayne Wasserman: “It is `Pulling a Rabbit Out of the Hat’—Typical Diagonal Lemma Proofs Beg the Question.”</p>

<p>
So I am not alone, and I thought it might be useful to try and unravel its proof. This exercise helped me and maybe it will help you.</p>
<p>
Here goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Stating the Lemma </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28w%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(w)}" class="latex" title="{S(w)}" /> be a formula in Peano Arithmetic (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" />). We claim that there is some sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++PA+%5Cvdash+%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
<p>Formally, </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(x)}" class="latex" title="{S(x)}" /> is some formula in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" />. Then there is a sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> so that 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++PA+%5Cvdash+%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The beauty of this lemma is that it was used by Gödel and others to prove various powerful theorems. For example, the lemma quickly proves this result of Alfred Tarski:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" /> is consistent.

The proof is this. Assume there is such a formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BTr%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Tr(x)}" class="latex" title="{Tr(x)}" />. Then use the diagonal lemma and get 	</p>

<p>This shows that 	</p>

<p>This is a contradiction. A short proof. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Proof </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The key is to define the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(n)}" class="latex" title="{F(n)}" /> as follows: Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is the Gödel number of a formula of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A(x)}" class="latex" title="{A(x)}" /> for some variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28n%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+A%28%5Culcorner+A%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(n) = \ulcorner A(\ulcorner A(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(n) = \ulcorner A(\ulcorner A(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " /></p>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is not of this form then define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28n%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(n)=0}" class="latex" title="{F(n)=0}" />. This is a strange function, a clever function, but a perfectly fine function, It certainly maps numbers to numbers. It is certainly recursive, actually it is clearly computable in polynomial time for any reasonable Gödel numbering. Note: the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> does depend on the choice of the variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. Thus, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+y%3D0+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+%28%5Culcorner+y%3D0+%5Curcorner%29%3D0+%5Curcorner%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner, " /></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+x%3D0+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+%28%5Culcorner+x%3D0+%5Curcorner%29%3D0+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner. " /></p>
<p>	          Now we make two definitions:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++g%28w%29+%26%5Cequiv%26+S%28F%28w%29%29+%5C%5C++++++++%5Cphi+%26%5Cequiv%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " /></p>
<p>
Now we compute just using the definitions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%2C+g%2C+%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F, g, \phi}" class="latex" title="{F, g, \phi}" />:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++%5Cphi+%26%3D%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5C%5C+++++++++++++++++%26%3D%26+S%28F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29%29+%5C%5C+++++++++++%26%3D%26+S%28%5Culcorner+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5C%5C+++++++++++++++%26%3D%26+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        \phi &amp;=&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \\                 &amp;=&amp; S(F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner)) \\           &amp;=&amp; S(\ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner) \\               &amp;=&amp; S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        \phi &amp;=&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \\                 &amp;=&amp; S(F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner)) \\           &amp;=&amp; S(\ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner) \\               &amp;=&amp; S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). \end{array} " /></p>
<p>We are done.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But … </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Where did this proof come from? Suppose that you forgot the proof but remember the statement of the lemma. I claim that we can then reconstruct the proof. </p>
<p>
First let’s ask: Where did the definition of the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> come from? Let’s see. Imagine we defined </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++g%28w%29+%26%5Cequiv%26+S%28F%28w%29%29+%5C%5C++++++++%5Cphi+%26%5Cequiv%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " /></p>
<p>But left <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> undefined for now. Then</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++%5Cphi+%26%3D%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5C%5C+++++++++++++++++%26%3D%26+S%28F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        \phi &amp;=&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \\                 &amp;=&amp; S(F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner)). \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        \phi &amp;=&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \\                 &amp;=&amp; S(F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner)). \end{array} " /></p>
<p>But we want <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi+%3D+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi = S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)}" class="latex" title="{\phi = S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)}" /> that happens provided:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Culcorner+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner) = F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner) = F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). " /></p>
<p>This essentially gives the definition of the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But but … </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Okay where did the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> come from? It is reasonable to define 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28w%29+%5Cequiv+S%28F%28w%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  g(w) \equiv S(F(w)), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  g(w) \equiv S(F(w)), " /></p>
<p>for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. We cannot change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> but we can control the input to the formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />, so let’s put a function there. Hence the definition for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> is not unreasonable. </p>
<p>
Okay how about the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" />? Well we could argue that this is the magic step. If we are given this definition then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> follows, by the above. I would argue that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> is not completely surprising. The name of the lemma is after all the “diagonal” lemma. So defining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> as the application of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> to itself is plausible.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Taking an Exam </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Another way to think about the diagonal lemma is imagine you are taking an exam in logic. The first question is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Prove in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" /> that for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(x)}" class="latex" title="{S(x)}" /> there is a sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> so that 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>You read the question again and think: “I wish I had studied harder, I should have not have checked Facebook last night. And then went out and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />” But you think let’s not panic, let’s think.</p>
<p>
Here is what you do. You say let me define 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28x%29+%3D+S%28F%28x%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  g(x) = S(F(x)), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  g(x) = S(F(x)), " /></p>
<p>for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. You recall there was a function that depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />, and changing the input from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(x)}" class="latex" title="{F(x)}" /> seems to be safe. Okay you say, now what? I need the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. Hmmm let me wait on that. I recall vaguely that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> had a strange definition. I cannot recall it, so let me leave it for now.</p>
<p>
But you think: I need a sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" />. A sentence cannot have an unbound variable. So <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> cannot be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(x)}" class="latex" title="{g(x)}" />. It could be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28m%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(m)}" class="latex" title="{g(m)}" /> for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" />. But what could <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> be? How about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" class="latex" title="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" />. This makes 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%3D+g%28%5Culcorner+g+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \phi = g(\ulcorner g \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \phi = g(\ulcorner g \urcorner). " /></p>
<p>It is after all the diagonal lemma. Hmmm does this work. Let’s see if this works. Wait as above I get that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is now forced to satisfy 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) = \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) = \ulcorner g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " /></p>
<p>Great this works. I think this is the proof. Wonderful. Got the first question. </p>
<p>
Let’s look at the next exam question. Oh no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">new paper</a>, we explore how closely
the ImageNet benchmark aligns with the object recognition task it serves as a
proxy for. We find pervasive and systematic deviations of ImageNet annotations
from the ground truth, which can often be attributed to specific design choices
in the data collection pipeline. These issues indicate that ImageNet accuracy
alone might be insufficient to effectively gauge real model performance.  </i></p>

<h2 id="contextualizing-progress-on-benchmarks">Contextualizing Progress on Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Large-scale benchmarks are central to machine learning—they serve both
as concrete targets for model development, and as proxies for assessing model
performance on real-world tasks we actually care about. However, few benchmarks
are perfect, and so as our models get increasingly better at them, we must also
ask ourselves: <i>to what extent is performance on existing benchmarks
indicative of progress on the real-world tasks that motivate them?</i></p>

<p>In this post, we will explore this question of <i>benchmark-task alignment</i>
in the context of the popular
<a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/">ImageNet object recognition dataset</a>.
Specifically, our goal is to understand how well the underlying ground truth is
captured by the dataset itself—this dataset is, after all, what we consider
to be the gold standard during model training and evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="a-sneak-peak-into-imagenet">A sneak peak into ImageNet</h3>
<p>The ImageNet dataset contains over a million images of objects from a thousand,
quite diverse classes. Like many other benchmarks of that scale, ImageNet was
not carefully curated by experts, but instead created via crowd-sourcing,
without perfect quality control. So what does ImageNet data look like? Here are
a few image-label pairs from the dataset:</p>

<div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/0.jpg" />
      <div class="fake_label">missile</div>
      <div class="true_label">projectile</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img">

      <div class="fake_label">stage</div>

    </div>
    <div class="fake_img">

    </div>
    <div class="fake_img">

      <div class="fake_label">Norwich terrier</div>
      <div class="true_label">Norfolk terrier</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>These samples appear pretty reasonable…but are they? Actually, while these
are indeed <i>images</i> from the dataset, the labels shown above are
<i>not</i> their actual ImageNet labels!
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/" id="reveal">[Click to see the actual ImageNet labels]</a>
Still, even though not “correct” from the point of view of the ImageNet
dataset, these labels <i>do</i> correspond to actual ImageNet classes, and
appear plausible when you see them in isolation. This shows that for ImageNet
images, which capture objects in diverse real-world conditions, the ImageNet
label may not properly reflect the ground truth.</p>

<p>In our work, we dive into examining how this label misalignment actually
impacts ImageNet: how often do ImageNet labels deviate from the ground truth?
And how do shortcomings in these labels impact ImageNet-trained models?</p>

<h3 id="revisiting-the-imagenet-collection-pipeline">Revisiting the ImageNet collection pipeline</h3>
<p>Before going further, let’s take a look at how ImageNet was created. To build
such a large dataset, the creators of ImageNet had to leverage scalable methods
like automated data collection and crowd-sourcing. That is, they first selected
a set of object classes (using the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a>
hierarchy), and queried various search engines to obtain a pool of candidate
images. These candidate images were then verified by annotators on <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical
Turk (MTurk)</a> using (what we will refer to as) the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task: annotators were shown images retrieved
for a specific class
label, and were subsequently asked to select the ones that actually contain an
object of this class. Only images that multiple annotators validated ended up
in the final dataset.</p>

</div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Imagenet collection pipeline:</strong> Click on a
stage at the top for an illustration. </div>

<p>While this is a natural approach to scalably annotate data (and, in fact, is
commonly used to create large-scale benchmarks—e.g.,
<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/">PASCAL VOC</a>,
<a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a>, <a href="http://places.csail.mit.edu/">places</a>),
it has an important caveat. Namely, this process has an inherent bias: the
annotation task itself is phrased as a leading question. ImageNet annotators
were not asked to provide an image label, but instead only to verify if a
<i>specific</i> label (predetermined by the image retrieval process) was
<i>contained</i> in an image. Annotators had no knowledge of what the other
classes in the dataset even were, or the granularity at which they were
required to make distinctions. In fact, they were explicitly instructed to
ignore clutter and obstructions.</p>

<p>Looking back at the ImageNet samples shown above, one can see how this setup
could lead to imperfect annotations. For instance, it is unclear if the average
annotator knows the differences between a “Norwich terrier” and a “Norfolk
terrier”, especially if they don’t even know that both of these (as well as 22
other terrier breeds) are valid ImageNet classes. Also, the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task itself might be ill-suited for annotating
multi-object images—the answer to the <span class="sc">Contains</span> question would be yes for any
object in the image that corresponds to an ImageNet class. It is not unthinkable
that the same images could have made it into ImageNet under the labels “stage”
and “Norwich terrier” had they come up in the search results for those classes
instead.</p>

<p>Overall, this suggests that the labeling issues in ImageNet may go beyond just
occasional annotator mistakes—the <i>design</i> of the data collection
pipeline itself could have caused these labels to systematically deviate from
the ground truth.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosing-benchmark-task-misalignment">Diagnosing benchmark-task misalignment</h3>

<p>To characterize how wide-spread these deviations are, we first need to get a
better grasp of the ground truth for ImageNet data. In order to do this at
scale, we still need to rely on crowd-sourcing. However, in contrast to the
original label validation setup, we design a new annotation task based directly
on <i>image classification</i>. Namely, we present annotators with a set of
possible labels for a single image <i>simultaneously</i>. We then ask them to
assign one label to every object in the image, and identify what they believe
to be the main object. (Note that we intentionally ask for such fine-grained
image annotations since, as we saw before, a single label might be inherently
insufficient to capture the ground truth.)</p>

<p>Of course, we need to ensure that annotators can meaningfully perform this
task. To this end we  devise a way to narrow down the label choices they are
presented with (all thousand ImageNet classes would be nearly impossible for a
worker to choose between!). Specifically, for each image, we identify the most
relevant labels by pooling together the top-5 predictions of a diverse set of
ImageNet models and filtering them via the <span class="sc">Contains</span>
task. Note that, by doing so, we are effectively bootstrapping the existing
ImageNet labels by first using them to train models and then using model
predictions to get better annotation candidates.</p>

<p>This is what our resulting annotation task looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/main_task.jpg" /></p>

<p>We aggregate the responses from multiple annotators to get per-image estimates
of the number of objects in the image (along with their corresponding labels),
as well as which object humans tend to view as the main one.</p>

<p>We collect such <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/ImageNetMultiLabel">annotations for 10k images from the ImageNet validation
set</a>. With these more
fine-grained and accurate annotations in hand, we now examine where the
original ImageNet labels may fall short.</p>

<h3 id="multi-object-images">Multi-object images</h3>
<p>The simplest way in which ImageNet labels could deviate from the ground truth
is if the image contains multiple objects. So, the first thing we want to
understand is: how many ImageNet images contain objects from more than one
valid class?</p>

<p>It turns out: quite a few! Indeed, more than <b>20%</b> of the images contain
more than one ImageNet object. Examples:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <div class="choices_one">
    <span class="widgetheading">Inspect Image</span>
  </div>
  <div class="choices_img">
    <span class="widgetheading">Image</span>

  </div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Multi-object images:</strong> Choose an image on
the left to see the annotations we obtain for it.  </div>

<p>Looking at some of these images, it is clear that the problem is not just
natural image clutter but also the fact that certain objects are quite likely
to co-occur in the real-world—e.g., “table lamp” and “lamp shade”. This means
that choosing classes which in principle correspond to distinct objects (e.g.,
using WordNet) is not enough to guarantee that the corresponding images have
unambiguous labels. For example, see if you can guess the ImageNet label for
the samples below:</p>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Co-occurring objects:</strong> Select a class pair on the top and see if
you can identify which images correspond to each class (click on "Show Labels"

</div>

<h4 id="model-performance-on-multi-object-images">Model performance on multi-object images</h4>

<p>So, how do models deal with images that contain multiple objects? To understand
this, we evaluate a number of models (from AlexNet to EfficientNet-B7), and
measure their accuracy (w.r.t. the ImageNet labels) on such images. We plot
these accuracies below (as a function of their full test accuracy):</p>

<canvas width="400" id="multi_drop" height="200"></canvas>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Performance on multi-object images:</strong>
Model accuracy variation as a function of the number of objects in the image.
Hover over each data point to see the corresponding model name.
</div>

<p>Across the board, in comparison to their performance on single-object images,
models suffer around a 10% accuracy drop on multi-object ones. At the same
time, this drop more-or-less disappears if we consider a model prediction to be
correct if it matches the label of <i>any</i> valid object in the image (see
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">paper</a> for specifics).</p>

<div class="footnote">
    <strong>Aside:</strong> The original motivation of top-5 accuracy was
    exactly to accommodate such multi-label images. However, we find that, while
    it does largely account for these multi-object confusions, it also seems to
    overestimate accuracy on single-object images.
</div>

<p>Still, even though models seem to struggle with multi-object images, they
perform much better than chance (i.e., better than what one would get if they
were picking the label of an object in the image at random). This makes sense
when the image has a single prominent object that also matches the ImageNet
label. However, for a third of all multi-object images the ImageNet label does
not even match what annotators deem to be the main object in the image. Yet,
even in these cases, models still successfully predict the ImageNet label
(instead of what humans consider to be the right label for the image)!</p>

<canvas width="400" id="overfitting" height="200"></canvas>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Performance on images with annotator-label disagreement:</strong>
Model accuracy on images where annotators do not consider the ImageNet label to
be the main object. Baseline: accuracy of picking the label of a random
prominent object in the image.
</div>

<p>Here, models seem to base their predictions on biases in the dataset which
humans do not find salient. For instance, models get high accuracy on the class
“pickelhaube”, even though, pickelhaubes are usually present in images with
other, more salient objects, such as “military uniforms”, suggesting that
ImageNet models may be overly sensitive to the presence of distinctive objects
in the image. While exploiting such biases would improve ImageNet accuracy,
this strategy might not translate to improved performance on object recognition
in the wild. Here are a few examples that seem to exhibit a similar mismatch:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <div class="choices_one">
    <span class="widgetheading">Inspect Image</span>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Annotator-label disagreement:</strong> Select an image on the left to

different from the (annotator-selected) "main label".
</div>

<h3 id="biases-in-label-validation">Biases in label validation</h3>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the ImageNet data filtering process. Recall
that each class in ImageNet was constructed by automatically retrieving many
images and filtering them (via the <span class="sc">Contains</span> task described above). How likely
were annotators to filter out mislabeled images under this setup?</p>

<p>To understand this, we replicate the original filtering process on the existing
ImageNet images. But this time, instead of only asking annotators to check if
the image is valid with respect to its ImageNet label (i.e., the search query),
we also try several other labels (each in isolation, with different sets of
annotators).</p>

<p>We find that annotators frequently deem an image to be valid for <i>many</i>
different labels—even when only one object is present. Typically, this occurs
when the image is ambiguous and lacks enough context (e.g. “seashore” or
“lakeshore”), or annotators are likely confused between different semantically
similar labels (e.g., “assault rifle” vs. “rifle”, dog breeds). It turns out
that this confusion, at least partly, stems from the one-sidedness of the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task—i.e., asking annotators to ascertain the validity of a specific
label without them knowing about any other options. If instead we present
annotators with all the relevant labels simultaneously and ask them to choose
one (as we did in our annotation setup), this kind of label confusion is
alleviated: annotators select significantly fewer labels in total (see our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">paper</a> for details). So, even putting
annotator’s expertise aside, the specific annotation task setup itself
drastically affects the quality of the resulting dataset labels.</p>

</div>

<p>Going back to ImageNet, our findings give us reason to believe that annotators
may have had a rather limited ability to correct errors in labeling. Thus, in
certain cases, ImageNet labels were largely determined by the automated image
retrieval process—propagating any biases or mixups this process might
introduce to the final dataset.</p>

<p>In fact, we can actually see direct evidence of that in the ImageNet
dataset—there are pairs of classes that appear to be <i>inherently
ambiguous</i> (e.g., “laptop computer” and “notebook computer”) and neither
human annotators, nor models, can tell the corresponding images apart (see
below). If such class pairs actually overlap in terms of their ImageNet images,
it is unclear how models can learn to separate them without memorizing specific
validation examples.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="beyond-test-accuracy-human-centric-model-evaluation">Beyond test accuracy: human-centric model evaluation</h3>

<p>Performance of ImageNet-trained models is typically judged based on their
ability to predict the dataset labels—yet, as we saw above, these labels may
not fully capture the ground truth. Hence, ImageNet accuracy may not reflect
properly model performance—for instance, measuring accuracy alone could
unfairly penalize models for certain correct predictions on  multi-object
images. So, how can we better assess model performance?</p>

<p>One approach is to measure model-human alignment directly—we present model
predictions to annotators and ask them to gauge their validity:</p>

<canvas width="400" id="limit" height="200"></canvas>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Human-based model evaluation:</strong> Fraction of annotators that
select a label as valid in the <span class="sc">Contains</span> task (i.e.,
selection frequency) for ImageNet labels and model predictions. Baseline:
(number of correct predictions) × (average selection frequency of the
ImageNet label).
</div>

<p>Surprisingly, we find that for state-of-the-art models, annotators actually
deem the prediction that models make to be valid about as often as the ImageNet
label (even when the two <i> do not</i> match). Thus, recent models may be
better at predicting the ground truth than their top-1 accuracy (w.r.t. the
ImageNet label) would indicate.</p>

<p>However, this does not imply that improving ImageNet accuracy is meaningless.
For instance, non-expert annotators may not be able to tell apart certain
fine-grained class differences (e.g., dog breeds) and for some of these images
the ImageNet label may actually match the ground truth. What it does indicate,
though, is that we are at a point where it may be hard to gauge if better
performance on ImageNet corresponds to actual progress or merely to exploiting
idiosyncrasies of the dataset.</p>

<p>For further experimental details and additional results (e.g., human confusion
matrices), take a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">our paper</a>!</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>We took a closer look at how well ImageNet aligns with the real-world object
recognition task—even though ImageNet is used extensively, we rarely question
whether its labels actually reflect the ground truth. We saw that oftentimes
ImageNet labels do not fully capture image content—e.g., many images have
multiple (ImageNet) objects and there are classes that are inherently
ambiguous. As a result, models trained using these labels as ground truth end
up learning unintended biases and confusions.</p>

<p>Our analysis indicates that when creating datasets we must be aware of (and try
to mitigate) ways in which scalable data collection practices can skew the
corresponding annotations (see our
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias">previous post</a> for another
example of such a skew). Finally, given that such imperfections in our datasets
could be inevitable, we also need to think about how to reliably assess model
performance in their presence.</p>

We study the MaxRes rule in the context of certifying unsatisfiability. We show that it can be exponentially more powerful than tree-like resolution, and when augmented with weakening (the system MaxResW), p-simulates tree-like resolution. In devising a lower bound technique specific to MaxRes (and not merely inheriting lower bounds from Res), we define a new semialgebraic proof system called the SubCubeSums proof system. This system, which p-simulates MaxResW, is a special case of the Sherali-Adams proof system. In expressivity, it is the integral restriction of conical juntas studied in the contexts of communication complexity and extension complexity. We show that it is not simulated by Res. Using a proof technique qualitatively different from the lower bounds that MaxResW inherits from Res, we show that Tseitin contradictions on expander graphs are hard to refute in SubCubeSums. We also establish a lower bound technique via lifting: for formulas requiring large degree in SubCubeSums, their XOR-ification requires large size in SubCubeSums.</div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) roughly asks what the “complexity” of a given string is. Informally, one can think of this as determining the degree of “computational order” a string has.</p>
<p>In the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in MCSP. A series of exciting results have begun unraveling what looks to be a fascinating story. This story already reveals deep connections between MCSP and a growing list of fields, including cryptography, learning theory, structural complexity theory, average-case complexity, and circuit complexity. As an example, Santhanam recently proved a conditional equivalence between the complexity of MCSP and the existence of one-way functions.</p>
<p>This talk is split into two parts. The first part is a broad introduction to MCSP, answering the following questions: What is this problem? Why is it interesting? What do we know so far, and where might the story go next? The second part discusses recent joint work with Bruno Loff and Igor Oliveira showing that the “multi-output version” of MCSP is NP-hard.</p></blockquote>

Gerolamo Cardano is often credited with introducing the notion of complex numbers. In 1545, he wrote a book titled <i>Ars Magna</i>. He introduced us to numbers like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B-5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{-5}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{-5}}" /> in his quest to understand solutions to equations. Cardano was often short of money and gambled and played a certain board game to make money—see the second paragraph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano#Mathematics">here</a>. </p>
<p>
Today, for amusement, Ken and I thought we’d talk about tells.</p>
<p>
What are tells? Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(poker)">says</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A tell in poker is a change in a player’s behavior or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player’s assessment of their hand. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/tell/" rel="attachment wp-att-17068"><img width="201" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/tell.jpg?w=201&amp;h=300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17068" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Tells </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken and I have been thinking of tells in a wider sense—when and whether one can declare inferences amid uncertain information. Historians face this all the time. So do biographers, at least when their subjects are no longer living. We would also like to make inferences in our current world, such as about the pandemic. The stakes can be higher than in poker. In poker, if your “tell” inference is wrong and you lose, you can play another hand—unless you went all in. With science and other academic areas the attitude must be that you’re all-in all the time.</p>
<p>
Cardano furnishes several instances. Wikipedia—which we regard as an equilibrium of opinions—says that Cardano </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers … [but] did not understand their properties, [which were] described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This is a negative inference from how one of Cardano’s books stops short of treating imaginary numbers as objects that follow rules. </p>
<p>
There are also questions about whether Cardano can be considered “the father of probability” ahead of Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Part of the problem is that Cardano’s own writings late in life recounted his first erroneous reasonings as well as final understanding in a Hamlet-like fashion. Wikipedia doubts whether he really knew the rule of multiplying probabilities of independent events, whereas the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some Laws.pdf">essay</a> by Prakash Gorroochurn cited there convinces us that he did. Similar doubt extends to how much Cardano knew about the natural sciences, as correct inferences (such as mountains with seashell fossils having once been underwater) are mixed in with what we today regard as howlers.</p>
<p>
Every staging of Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> shows a book by Cardano—or does it? In Act II, scene 2, Polonius asks, “What do you read, my lord?”; to which Hamlet first replies “Words words words.” Pressed on the book’s topic, Hamlet perhaps references the section “Misery of Old Age” in Cardano’s 1543 book <i>De Consolatione</i> but what he <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/page_102/">says</a> is so elliptical it is hard to tell. The book also includes particular allusions between sleep and death that go into Hamlet’s soliloquy opening Act III. The book had been published in England in 1573 as <i>Cardan’s Comfort</i> under the aegis of the Earl of Oxford so it was well-known. Yet the writer Italo Calvino <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pQabBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Hamlet+words+words+words+Cardano&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mu1gcM6b8E&amp;sig=ACfU3U3W7te91qlDaIIC8EeHLM1GxpR2Dw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikkNjX1MfpAhWChHIEHQaWDZsQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hamlet words words words Cardano&amp;f=false">held back</a> from the inference:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> To conclude from this that the book read by Hamlet is definitely Cardano, as is held by some scholars of Shakespeare’s sources, is perhaps unjustified. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
To be sure, there are some who believe Shakespeare’s main source was Oxford, in manuscripts if not flesh and blood. One reason we do not go there is that we do not see the wider community as having been able to establish reliable principles for judging what kinds of inferences are probably valid. We wonder if one could do an experiment of taking resolved cases, removing most of the information to take them down to the level of unresolved cases, and seeing what kinds of inferences from partial information would have worked.  That’s not our expertise, but within our expertise in math and CS, we wonder if a little experiment will be helpful.</p>
<p>
To set the idea, note that imaginary numbers are also called complex numbers. Yet the term complex numbers can mean other things. Besides numbers like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%2B+3i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2 + 3i}" class="latex" title="{2 + 3i}" /> it also can mean how hard it is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_complexity">construct</a> a number. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In number theory, the integer complexity of an integer is the smallest number of ones that can be used to represent it using ones and any number of additions, multiplications, and parentheses. It is always within a constant factor of the logarithm of the given integer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
How easy is it to tell what kind of “complex” is meant if you only have partial information?  We don’t only mean scope-of-terminology issues; often a well-defined math object is used in multiple areas.  Let’s try an experiment.</p>

We show that lower bounds for explicit constant-variate polynomials over fields of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ are sufficient to derandomize polynomial identity testing over fields of characteristic $p$. In this setting, existing work on hardness-randomness tradeoffs for polynomial identity testing requires either the characteristic to be sufficiently large or the notion of hardness to be stronger than the standard syntactic notion of hardness used in algebraic complexity. Our results make no restriction on the characteristic of the field and use standard notions of hardness.

We do this by combining the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with a white-box procedure to take $p$-th roots of circuits computing a $p$-th power over fields of characteristic $p$. When the number of variables appearing in the circuit is bounded by some constant, this procedure turns out to be efficient, which allows us to bypass difficulties related to factoring circuits in characteristic $p$.

We also combine the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with recent ``bootstrapping'' results in polynomial identity testing to show that a sufficiently-hard family of explicit constant-variate polynomials yields a near-complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing. This result holds over fields of both zero and positive characteristic and complements a recent work of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon, who obtained a slightly stronger statement over fields of characteristic zero.</div>

We introduce a continuous analogue of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, which we name CLWE. We give a polynomial-time quantum reduction from worst-case lattice problems to CLWE, showing that CLWE enjoys similar hardness guarantees to those of LWE. Alternatively, our result can also be seen as opening new avenues of (quantum) attacks on lattice problems. Our work resolves an open problem regarding the computational complexity of learning mixtures of Gaussians without separability assumptions (Diakonikolas 2016, Moitra 2018). As an additional motivation, (a slight variant of) CLWE was considered in the context of robust machine learning (Diakonikolas et al.~FOCS 2017), where hardness in the statistical query (SQ) model was shown; our work addresses the open question regarding its computational hardness (Bubeck et al.~ICML 2019).</div>

Finite languages lie at the heart of literally every regular expression. Therefore, we investigate the approximation complexity of minimizing regular expressions without Kleene star, or, equivalently, regular expressions describing finite languages. On the side of approximation hardness, given such an expression of size~$s$, we prove that it is impossible to approximate the minimum size required by an equivalent regular expression within a factor of  $O\left(\frac{s}{(\log s)^{2+\delta}}\right)$ if the running time is bounded by a quasipolynomial function depending on~$\delta$, for every $\delta&gt;0$, unless the exponential time hypothesis (ETH) fails. For approximation ratio~$O(s^{1-\delta})$, we prove an exponential time lower bound depending on~$\delta$, assuming ETH. The lower bounds apply for alphabets of constant size. On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem can be approximated in polynomial time within~$O(\frac{s\log\log s}{\log s})$, with~$s$ being the size of the given regular expression. For constant alphabet size, the bound improves to~$O(\frac{s}{\log s})$. Finally, we devise a familiy of superpolynomial approximation algorithms that attain the performance ratios of the lower bounds, while their running times are only slightly above those excluded by the ETH.</div>

<p>Two years ago, I posted detailed <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3943">lecture notes</a> on this blog for my Intro to Quantum Information Science undergrad course at UT Austin.  Today, with enormous thanks to UT PhD student Corey Ostrove, we’ve gotten the notes into a much better shape (for starters, they’re now in LaTeX).  You can <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf">see the results here</a> (7MB)—it’s basically a 260-page introductory quantum computing textbook in beta form, covering similar material as many other introductory quantum computing textbooks, but in my style for those who like that.  It’s missing exercises, as well as material on quantum supremacy experiments, recent progress in hardware, etc., but that will be added in the next version if there’s enough interest.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>Crucial decisions are increasingly being made by automated machine learning algorithms. These algorithms rely on data, and without high quality data, the resulting decisions may be inaccurate and/or unfair. In some cases, data is readily available: for example, location data passively collected by smartphones. In other cases, data may be difficult to obtain by automated means, and it is necessary to directly survey the population.</p>

<p>However, individuals are not always motivated to take surveys if they receive no benefit. Offering a monetary reward may incentivize some individuals to participate, but there is a problem with this approach: what if an individual’s data is correlated with their willingness to take the survey?</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="457" alt="" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/correlation.png?w=459" class="wp-image-1708" height="184" /></figure></div>

<p>For concreteness, imagine that you are a health administrator trying to estimate the average weight in a population. This is a sensitive attribute that individuals may be reluctant to disclose, especially if their weight is not considered healthy. A generic survey may yield disproportionately more respondents with “healthy” weights, and thus may result an an inaccurate estimate (see, e.g, Shields et al., 2011).</p>

<p>In this post, we discuss three papers which propose solutions to this problem through the lens of <em>mechanism design</em>. The idea is to carefully design payments so that we received an unbiased sample, leading to a hopefully accurate estimate.</p>

We assume that each agent also has a personal cost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" />, representing her level of reluctance to reveal her data. Agent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> is willing to reveal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" /> if and only if she receives a payment of at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" />. Our goal is to allocate higher payments to agents with higher <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" />‘s, in order to get an unbiased sample. However, we also must obey an budget constraint: we cannot spend more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" /> total. The solution is to transact non-deterministically: with some probability, offer to purchase an agent’s data. Agents with higher costs will receive higher payments, but lower transaction probabilities.</p>

<p>We assume that agents are drawn at random independently from some distribution. Our crucial assumption is that we known the marginal distribution of agent costs, which we denote <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}" /> (we will explore later what happens when this assumption is removed). However, we do not know the distribution of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />, and that distribution can be arbitrarily correlated with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}" />. As mentioned above, one might expect agents with less “desirable” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />‘s may have higher costs, but one can imagine more complex correlations as well.</p>

<p>Our mechanisms consist of two parts: an <em>allocation rule</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />, and a <em>payment rule</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="P" class="latex" title="P" />. Given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="P" class="latex" title="P" />, the mechanism works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Ask each agent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> to report <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" /> denote the actual reported cost.</li><li>With probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A(c)" class="latex" title="A(c)" />, we purchase the agent’s data and pay her <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="P(c)" class="latex" title="P(c)" />. With probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+-+A%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="1 - A(c)" class="latex" title="1 - A(c)" />, we do not buy the data, and no payment is made.</li><li>At the end, use the data we learned to form an estimate of the population average of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\bar{z}" class="latex" title="\bar{z}" /> denote our estimate.</li></ol>

<p>In this model, agent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />‘s expected utility for reporting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=u_i%28c%29+%3D+A%28c%29+%28P%28c%29+-+c_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)" class="latex" title="u_i(c) = A(c) (P(c) - c_i)" />.</p>

<p>We have four main requirements:</p>

<ol><li><strong>Truthfulness. </strong>It should be in each agent’s best interest to truthfully report <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" />.</li><li><strong>Individual rationality. </strong>Agents should not receive negative utility if they are honest, i.e., we should have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c_i%29+%5Cge+c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="P(c_i) \ge c_i" class="latex" title="P(c_i) \ge c_i" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />.</li><li><strong>Budget constrained. </strong>Our total expected payment should not exceed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="B" class="latex" title="B" />, i.e., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Csum_i+A%28c_i%29+P%28c_i%29%5D+%5Cle+B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B" class="latex" title="\mathbb{E}[\sum_i A(c_i) P(c_i)] \le B" />.</li><li><strong>Unbiased. </strong>Our estimate isn’t consistently too high or too low. Specifically, the expected value of our estimate should be equal to the true average, i.e., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5B%5Cbar%7Bz%7D%5D+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%5Bz_i%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]" class="latex" title="\mathbb{E}[\bar{z}] = \mathbb{E}[z_i]" />.</li></ol>

<p>Lack of bias doesn’t mean that our estimate is accurate, however. To this end, our primary goal is to <strong>minimize the variance</strong>, subject to the mechanism obeying the four above criteria. We evaluate variance via a worst-case framework: given a mechanism, we wish minimize the variance with respect to the worst-case distribution of agents for that mechanism. The idea is that the distribution of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />‘s is not known to the mechanism, so we require it to perform well for all distributions.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="438" alt="" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/goal.jpg?w=970" class="wp-image-1729" height="203" />Goal.</figure></div>

<p>When we refer to the “optimal” mechanism, we mean minimum variance, subject to being truthful, individually rational, budget constrained, and unbiased (henceforth TIBU).</p>

<p><strong>The Horvitz Thomspon Estimator</strong></p>

<p>Once we have learned the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />‘s, how do we actual form an estimate of the mean? Luckily for us, this question has a simple answer. If we restrict ourselves to linear unbiased estimators, there is a unique way to do this, known as the <em>Horvitz-Thompson estimator</em>:</p>

<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbar%7Bz%7D+%3D+%5Cdisplaystyle%5Csum%5Climits_i+%5Ccfrac%7Bz_i%7D%7BA%28c_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}" class="latex" title="\bar{z} = \displaystyle\sum\limits_i \cfrac{z_i}{A(c_i)}" /></p>

<p>Thus our task is simply to choose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="P" class="latex" title="P" />.</p>

<h2>Approach #1</h2>

<p>This model was first considered by Roth and Schoenebeck (2012). They are able to characterize a mechanism which is TIBU and has variance at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="1/n" class="latex" title="1/n" /> more than the optimal variance, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> is the number of agents. However, they do make the strong assumption that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" /> is either 0 or 1.</p>

<p>Their approach relies on <em>Take-It-Or-Leave-It</em> mechanisms. Such a mechanism is defined by a distribution $G$ over the positive real numbers, and works as follows:</p>

<ol><li>Each agent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" /> reports a cost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" />.</li><li>Sample a payment <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />.</li><li>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%5Cge+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p \ge c" class="latex" title="p \ge c" />, buy the agent’s data with payment <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" />. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p+%3C+c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="p &lt; c" class="latex" title="p &lt; c" />, do not buy the agent’s data.</li></ol>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="293" alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EDzLmHAWwAAEPkl.jpg" height="212" /></figure></div>

<p>This amounts to an allocation rule <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A%28c%29+%3D+1+-+%5Ctext%7BPr%7D%5Bp%5Cge+c%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]" class="latex" title="A(c) = 1 - \text{Pr}[p\ge c]" />, and a payment rule <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28c%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="P(c)" class="latex" title="P(c)" /> equal to the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> conditioned on being at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" />. The authors show that these mechanisms are fully general, i.e., any allocation and payment rule can be implemented by a Take-It-Or-Leave-It mechanism.</p>

<p>The proof of their main result is primarily based on using the calculus of variations to optimize over the space of distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. The paper contains some additional results, for example regarding an alternate model where we wish to minimize the budget, but that is outside the scope of this blog post.</p>

<h2>Approach #2</h2>

<p>Although the above result is a great step, it leaves room for improvement. First of all, the assumption that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" /> is binary is quite strong, and does not apply to our running example of body weight. Secondly, their mechanism does not quite achieve the optimal variance. Chen et al. (2018) remedy both of these concerns. That is, they allow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" /> to be any real number, and they characterize the TIBU mechanism with optimal variance. Their result also generalizes to more complex statistical estimates, not just the average <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />, and it holds for both continuous and discrete agent distributions.</p>

<p>The approach of Chen et al. (2018) is based on two primary ideas. First, they show that any monotone allocation rule (i.e., we are always less likely to purchase data from an agent with higher cost) can be implemented in a TIBU fashion by a unique payment rule. Thus we only need to identify the optimal allocation rule. (This is similar to the standard result from auction theory about implementable monotone allocation rules (Myerson 1981).)</p>

<p>The second idea is to view the problem as a zero-sum game between ourselves (the mechanism designer) and an adversary who chooses the distribution of agents. Given a distribution, we choose an allocation rule to minimize the variance, and given an allocation rule, the adversary chooses a distribution to maximize the variance.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="292" alt="" src="https://i2.wp.com/marketbusinessnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Zero-Sum-Game.jpg?fit=511%2C521&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=1200%2C1223.4833659491" height="297" /></figure></div>

<p>The authors are able to solve for the equilibrium of this game and thus identify the TIBU mechanism with minimum possible variance.</p>

<h2>Approach #3</h2>

<p>Approach #2 gave us our desired result: a minimum variance mechanism subject to our four desired properties (TIBU), for any distribution of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="z_i" class="latex" title="z_i" />‘s. But we are still making a very strong assumption: that we know the distribution of agent costs.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="427" alt="" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/prior.png?w=500" class="wp-image-1766" height="230" /></figure></div>

<p>Chen and Zheng (2019) do away with this assumption in a follow-up paper. They consider a model where the mechanism has no prior information on the distribution of costs (or on the distribution of data), and $n$ agents arrive one-by-one in a uniformly random order. Each agent reports a cost, and we decide whether to buy her data, and what to pay her. In order to price well, we need to learn the cost distribution, but we must do this while simultaneously making irrevocable purchasing decisions. The main result is a TIBU mechanism with variance at most a constant factor worse than optimal.</p>

<p>The authors note that after each step <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />, the reported costs up to that point induce an empirical cost distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}_i" />. Using the results of Chen et al. (2018), we can determine the optimal mechanism for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{F}_i" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}_i" />. The basic idea is to use that mechanism for the current step, learn a new agent cost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" /> (note that the agent reports <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="c_i" class="latex" title="c_i" /> regardless of whether we purchase her data) and then update our empirical distribution accordingly. (The authors actually end up using an approximately optimal allocation rule, but the idea is the same.) The mechanism also uses more budget in the earlier rounds, to make up for the pricing being less accurate.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>In this post, we considered the problem of surveying a sensitive attribute where an agent’s data may be correlated with their willingness to participate. We discussed three different approaches, all of which rely of giving higher payments to agents with higher costs, in order to incentivize them to participate and to obtain an unbiased estimate. The final approach was able to give a truthful, individually rational, budget feasible, and unbiased mechanism with approximately optimal variance, without making any prior assumptions on the distribution of agents.</p>

<p>However, all three of the approaches assume that agents cannot lie about the data. This is reasonable for some attributes, such as a body weight, where an agent can be asked to step onto a physical scale. However, requiring participants come in person to a particular location will certainly lead to less engagement. Furthermore, for other sensitive attributes, there may not be a verifiable way to obtain the data. Future work could investigate alternative models where this assumption is not necessary. For example, perhaps agents do not maliciously lie, but rather are simply inaccurate at reporting their own attributes. For example, research has demonstrated that people consistently over-report height and under-report weight (e.g., Gorber et al., 2007). Could a mechanism learn the pattern of inaccuracy and compensate for that to still obtain an unbiased estimate?</p>

<div>
Professor Dudley worked in Probability and Statistics. His work is now</div>
<div>
being used in Machine Learning. Here is a guest-post-obit by</div>
<div>
David Marcus who had Prof. Dudley as his PhD Thesis Advisor.</div>

-----------------------------------</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Guest Blog Obit by David Marcus:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Dick was my thesis advisor at M.I.T. After I got my Ph.D. in 1983, I went</div>
<div>
to work in industry, so did not work closely with him, as some of his other</div>
<div>
students did. But, I enjoyed working with him very much in graduate school.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Dick was very precise. His lecture notes and articles (and later his books)</div>
<div>
said exactly what needed to be said and didn't waste words. In his classes,</div>
<div>
he always handed out complete lecture notes, thus letting you concentrate</div>
<div>
on the material rather than having to take a lot of notes.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Dick was very organized, but his office had piles of papers and journal</div>
<div>
articles everywhere. There is a picture <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2020/richard-dudley-mit-mathematics-professor-emeritus-dies-0218">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Before Dick was my advisor, I took his probability course. My orals were</div>
<div>
going to be towards the end of the term, and I was going to use probability</div>
<div>
as one of my two minor areas. So, I spent a lot of time studying the</div>
<div>
material. Dick gave a final exam in the course. The final exam was unlike</div>
<div>
any other final exam I ever took: The exam listed twelve areas that had</div>
<div>
been covered in the course. The instructions said to pick ten and for each</div>
<div>
area give the main definitions and theorems and, if you had time, prove the</div>
<div>
theorems. Since I had been studying the material for my orals, I didn't</div>
<div>
have much trouble, but if I hadn't been studying it for my orals, it would</div>
<div>
have been quite a shock!(COMMENT FROM BILL: Sounds like a lazy way to make up an exam, though on this</div>
<div>
level of may it works. I know of a prof whose final was</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Make up 4 good questions for the final. Now Solve them.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Once Dick became my advisor, Dick and I had a regular weekly meeting. I'd</div>
<div>
tell him what I'd figured out or what I'd found in a book or journal</div>
<div>
article over the last week and we'd discuss it and he'd make suggestions.</div>
<div>
At some point, I'd say I needed to think about it, and I'd leave. I never</div>
<div>
did find out how long these meetings were supposed to last because I was</div>
<div>
always the one to end them.(COMMENT FROM BILL: It's good someone ended them! Or else you might never</div>
<div>
had graduated :-) )</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
When I began working with Dick, he said he already had a full</div>
<div>
load of students, but he would see if he had something I could work on. The</div>
<div>
problem Dick came up with for me to work on was to construct a</div>
<div>
counterexample to a theorem that Dick had published. Dick knew his</div>
<div>
published proof was wrong, and had an idea of what a counterexample might</div>
<div>
look like, so suggested I might be able to prove it was a counterexample.</div>
<div>
In retrospect, this was perhaps a risky thesis problem for me since if the</div>
<div>
student gets stuck, the professor can spend time figuring out how to do it.</div>
<div>
But, in this case, presumably Dick had already put some effort into it</div>
<div>
without success. Regardless, with Dick's guidance, I was able to prove it,</div>
<div>
and soon after got my Ph.D.(COMMENT FROM BILL: Sounds risky since if Dick could not do it, maybe it's too hard.)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In 2003 there was a conference in honor of Dick's 65th birthday. All of his</div>
<div>
ex-students were invited, and many of them attended. There was a day of</div>
<div>
talks, and we all went out to dinner (Chinese food, if I recall correctly)</div>
<div>
in the evening. At dinner, I asked Dick if any of his other students had</div>
<div>
written a thesis that disproved one of his published theorems. He said I</div>
<div>
was the only one.(COMMENT FROM BILL: Really good that not only was he okay with you disproving</div>
<div>
his theorem, he encouraged you to!)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>

Given a multivariate polynomial computed by an arithmetic branching program (ABP) of size $s$, we show that all its factors can be computed by arithmetic branching programs of size $\text{poly}(s)$.

<p><i> We discuss our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">paper</a>
on diagnosing bias in dataset replication 
studies. Zooming in on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">ImageNet-v2</a>
reproduction effort, we explain the majority of the accuracy drop between
ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 (from 11.7% to 3.6%) after accounting
for bias in the data collection process. </i></p>

<h2 id="measuring-progress-in-supervised-learning">Measuring Progress in Supervised Learning</h2>
<p>In the last few years, researchers have made extraordinary progress on
increasing accuracy on vision tasks like those in the <a href="http://image-net.org">ImageNet</a>,
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a>, and <a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a> datasets. Progress on these tasks is promising, but
comes with an important caveat: the test sets used to measure performance are
finite, fixed, and have been used and re-used by countless researchers over
several years.</p>

<p>There are (at least) two possible ways in which evaluating solely with test-set
accuracy could hinder our progress on the tasks researchers design benchmarks to
proxy (e.g. general image classification for ImageNet). The first of these
issues is adaptive overfitting: since each dataset has only one test
set to measure performance on, algorithmic progress on that (finite and fixed)
test set could be mistaken for algorithmic progress on the distribution from
which the test set was chosen from.</p>

<p>The second issue that could arise is
oversensitivity to irrelevant properties of the test distribution
arising from the dataset collection process; for example, the image encoding
algorithm used to save images.</p>

<p><em>How can we assess whether models are truly making progress on the tasks that
our benchmarks proxy</em>?</p>

<h3 id="dataset-replication">Dataset replication</h3>
<p>A promising approach to diagnosing the two above issues is <em>dataset
replication</em>, in which one mimics the original test set creation process as
closely as possible to make a new dataset. Then, existing models’ performance on
this newly created test set should identify any models that have adaptively
overfit to the original test set. Moreover, since every intricacy of a dataset
collection process cannot be mimicked exactly, natural variability in the
replication should help us unearth cases of algorithms’ oversensitivity to the
original dataset creation process.</p>

<p>The problem of replicating the original test set creation process is harder than it may initially appear. Particularly challenging is controlling for relevant covariates In experimental design, a <a href="https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/confusing-statistical-terms-5-covariate/">covariate</a>is a variable that is not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics">independent variable</a> (in our case the choice of dataset), but affects measurements of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics">dependent variable</a> (in our case the accuracy).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; For example, suppose we wanted to replicate a study about the effect of a certain drug on an age-linked disease. After gathering subjects, we have to reweight or filter them so that the age distribution matches that of the original study, as otherwise the results of the studies are incomparable. This filtering/reweighting step is analogous to dataset replication, with participant age being the relevant covariate., or variables that we expect to have an impact on the outcome (i.e., model accuracy) we measure.</p>

<p>To match covariate distributions between the new reproduction and the original
dataset, we frame dataset replication as a two-step process. In step one, the
replicator collects candidate data using a data pipeline as similar as possible
to that used by the original dataset creators. Then, after approximating the
original pipeline, the dataset replicator should identify the relevant covariate
statistic(s), and choose candidates (via filtering or reweighting the collected
candidate data) so that the distributions of the statistic under the replicated
and original datasets are equal. We call this process statistic
matchingIn causal inference literature, statistic matching is often
referred to as enforcing covariate balance..</p>

<h3 id="imagenet-v2">ImageNet-v2</h3>
<p>In their recent work, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al.</a> use
dataset replication to take a closer look at model performance on ImageNet, one
of the most widely used computer vision datasets. They first use an apparatus
similar to that of the original <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575">ImageNet
paper</a> to collect a large set of candidate
images and labels from the photo-sharing site <a href="https://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>Then, in the second step, they identify and control for a covariate called the
“selection frequency.” Selection frequency is a measure of how frequently a
(time-limited) human decides that an image (with its candidate label) is
“correctly labeled.” We can get estimate selection frequencies by asking crowd
workers questions like:</p>

<p><br />
</p>

  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/idbias/selfreq.png" />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Selection frequency is a very reasonable (and in some sense, the
“right”) covariate to control for, since the original ImageNet dataset 
was filtered using a similar measureTo construct ImageNet, the
authors scraped many candidate image-label pairs, and just as above, asked
crowd workers whether the image corresponded to the label---filtering was done
via a convincing-majority vote procedure, making the selection frequency a
relevant metric.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al.</a> obtain empirical selection
frequency estimates for the ImageNet validation set and their collected
candidate pool by presentingThe figure above is simplified for
clarity—in reality, datapoints are presented to the crowd workers as
groups of 48 images, all corresponding to the same candidate label, and
annotators are asked to select the images in that group that truly correspond to
the
label. each (image, label) pair to 10 crowd workers.</p>

<p>By filtering on the selection frequency in various ways, the authors come up
with three new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageNet-v2</code> datasets. One of these, called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchedFrequency</code>, is a “true” dataset replication in the sense that it tries
to control for the selecion frequency by filtering the candidate images and
labels so that the resulting selection frequency distribution matches that of
the original ImageNet validation set. 
Since our focus is on dataset
replication, from now on we’ll ignore the other datasets, and use
“MatchedFrequency” and “ImageNet-v2” interchangeably. For convenience, we’ll
also use “ImageNet” and “ImageNet-v1” interchangeably to refer to the original
ImageNet validation setSince the test set is not released, the
ImageNet validation set usually acts as a de facto test set, and the two terms
(validation and test) are used interchangeably to refer to the validation
set..</p>

<p>The key observation made by the ImageNet-v2 authors—and the one that we’ll
focus on in this post—is a <em>consistent</em> drop in accuracy that models suffer
when evaluated on ImageNet-v2 instead of ImageNet:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<canvas width="400" id="v1v2_orig" height="200"></canvas>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Each dot in the scatter plot above represents a model—the $x$ coordinate is
the model’s ImageNet accuracy, and the $y$ coordinate is the model’s accuracy
when evaluated on ImageNet-v2. (You can mouse over the dots to see
model names!) Ideally, since the generating pipelines for the two datasets are
similar, and the relevant covariates were matched, one would expect all of the
models to fall on the dotted line $y = x$. Yet, across the examined models,
their accuracies dropped by an average of 11.7% between ImageNet and
ImageNet-v2.</p>

<h2 id="our-findings">Our Findings</h2>
<p>The significant accuracy drop above presents an empirical mystery given the
similarity in data pipeline between the two datasets. Why do classifiers perform
so poorly on ImageNet-v2?</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">work</a>, we identify an aspect of the dataset reproduction process
that might lead to a significant accuracy drop. The general phenomenon we
identify is that in dataset replication, even mean-zero noise in measurements of
the relevant covariate/control variable can result in significant bias in the
resulting matched dataset if not accounted for.</p>

<p>In the case of ImageNet-v2, we show how noisy readings of the selection
frequency statistic can result in bias in the ImageNet-v2 dataset towards lower
selection frequency and consequently, lower accuracyRecht et al. observed previously that changes in selection frequency affect model performance..</p>

<p>After accounting for this bias and thus controlling for selection
frequency, we estimate that the adjusted ImageNet to ImageNet-v2
accuracy gap is less than or equal to 3.6% (instead of the initially observed
11.7%).</p>

<p>In the next few sections, we’ll focus on ImageNet-v2, first trying to get a
clearer picture of the source of statistical bias in this dataset replication
effort, and then discussing ways to correct for it.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-the-bias">Identifying the bias</h3>

<p>Earlier, we decomposed the data replication process into two steps: (1)
replicating the pipeline, and (2) controlling for covariates via statistic
matching. 
To perform the latter of these two steps, one
first needs to find the distribution of the relevant statistic (e.g., selection
frequency, in the case of ImageNet) for both the original test set as well as
the newly collected data. 
Just as with any empirical statistic, however, we can’t 
read the true selection frequency $s(x)$ for any given image $x$. We can only sample from a binomial random variable,</p>

<p>\[
    \widehat{s}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\text{Binomial}(n, s(x)),
\]</p>

<p>to obtain a selection frequency estimate, i.e., where $n$
is the number of crowd workers used.</p>

<p>Now, even though the expected value of the measurement we get is indeed $s(x)$
(i.e., $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an unbiased estimator of $s(x)$), 
the reading itselfThis is not the same as the underlying selection frequency for an image; for example, a
image-label pair $x$ might have a true selection frequency of $s(x) = 0.645$,
meaning that on average a crowd annotator is 64.5% likely to say that the image
corresponds to the label. If we ask 10 crowd annotators to label the pair,
however, we never observe this 64.5% number. will be $k/n$ for some integer $k$ (with $n=10$, in the
case of the ImageNet-v2 replication process).</p>

<p>To see why this seemingly innocuous fact impacts the dataset replication
process, suppose we knew exactly what the distribution of true selection
frequency looked like for both the original ImageNet test set and the candidate
images collected through the ImageNet-v2 replication pipeline:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<canvas id="priorCtx"></canvas>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Suppose now that we estimate a selection frequency of $\widehat{s}(x) = 0.7$ for
a given image $x$ (i.e., seven of the ten workers who were shown the image and
its candidate label, marked it as correctly labeled). The key observation here
is that given this empirical selection frequency, the most likely value for
$s(x)$ is not $\widehat{s}(x)$ (even though $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an unbiased
estimator of $s(x)$). Instead, the maximum likelihood estimate actually depends
on which dataset $x$ is from!</p>

<p>If $x$ was sourced from ImageNet, it’s more likely that $s(x) &gt; 0.7$ and
therefore that $\widehat{s}(x)$ is an underestimate, since most of the mass of
the ImageNet selection frequency distribution—see our (hypothetical) plot
above—is on $s(x) &gt; 0.7$. Conversely, if $x$ was a newly collected candidate
image, then most likely $s(x) &lt; 0.7$.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Remark:</strong> Mathematically, the phenomenon is that
$E[\widehat{s}(x)|s(x)] = s(x)$, but $E[s(x)|\widehat{s}(x)]$ is not equal to $s(x)$, and
instead depends on the distribution of $s(x)$ via Bayes'
ruleSpecifically, we have that for a given dataset,
$$p(s|\widehat{s}) = \frac{p_{data}(s) \cdot p_{binom}(\widehat{s}|s)} {\int
p(s') p_{binom}(\widehat{s}|s')\ ds'},$$ where $p_{data}$ is the density function
for selection frequencies under this dataset, and $p_{binom}$ is the binomial
probability mass function..
</div>

<p>The interactive graph below visualizes this intuition: by moving the
slider, you can adjust the “observed” selection frequency $\widehat{s}(x)$. The 
shaded curves then show what our belief about the corresponding true
selection frequency $s(x)$ looks like, depending on which pool the image
came from.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<canvas id="posteriorCtx"></canvas>

    <span class="inplabel">Easy (20/20)</span>
    </div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Thus, if the selection frequency distribution of ImageNet is skewed upwards
compared to that of the collected candidate images (which is likely, since
ImageNet was already filtered for qualityImageNet was
originally constructed by collecting candidate images in a way similar to the
ones described here, and then subsequently filtering for quality using a
"majority vote" based on selection frequency. when it was
constructed), matching the two data sources via observed selection frequency
will result in ImageNet images having systematically higher selection
frequencies than their new ImageNet-v2 counterparts. Also, the noiser our
reading of observed selection frequency are (i.e. the less annotators we use),
the more important the source distribution becomes, and so the greater the
effect of the bias. Indeed, if we were able to use infinite annotators for each
image, the bias would disappear, as we would have perfect readings of the
corresponding selection frequency. The only possible value for $s(x)$ would then
be $s(x) = \widehat{s}(x)$, making the shaded distributions above collapse
into a point mass at the green line.</p>

<p>The bias we are describing is summarized visually in the interactive graph below: by adjusting the
sliders, you can manipulate the distributions of “true” selection frequency for
ImageNet (red) and for the candidate data (black), as well as the number of
annotators used to estimate selection frequencies. The distribution of
ImageNet-v2 selection frequencies resulting from performing statistic matching
is shown in blue. Notice that as long as the candidate selection frequencies do
not come from the same distribution as the ImageNet selection frequencies,
the resulting ImageNet-v2 test set never matches the original test set
statistics. For the reasons we discussed earlier, having less annotators, or having a bigger gap between ImageNet and the candidate
distribution, also exacerbate the effect.</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-the-effects-of-bias">Quantifying the Effects of Bias</h2>

<p>The model above, paired with the fact that ImageNet (having already been
filtered for quality before) is likely much higher-quality than candidate images sourced from
Flickr, predicts that ImageNet-v2 images’ selection frequencies are
consistently lower than those of ImageNet images. To test this
theory, we set up another crowdsourced task that is extremely similar (but
not quite identicalWe implemented a few changes for quality control but kept
the task instructions and interface constant: the exact differences are outlined in Appendix
B.2 of our paper.) to the one used by the ImageNet-v2
creators, this time using 40 annotators per image (instead of 10) to estimate
its selection frequency. A histogram of the selection frequencies we 
observed in our experiment is shown below:</p>

<p><br /></p>

  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/idbias/selfreq_histogram.png" />

<p><br /></p>

<p>Even though the ImageNet-v2 creators report average selection
frequencies for ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 of 0.71 and 0.73 respectively, our
new experiments yield average selection frequencies of 0.85 and 0.81; note the change
in relative ordering (why are the selection frequencies
higher?We discuss this in depth in Appendix B.2 of our
paper. The task and instructions are the same, so we hypothesize that the
discrepancy boils down to either (a) data quality: we used <a href="https://blog.mturk.com/tutorial-managing-worker-cohorts-with-qualifications-e928cd30b173">worker
qualifications</a> to ensure annotator quality while the original experiment did
not—qualifications have been shown to reduce the share of low-quality or
inattentive crowd workers from 34% to 2% in other studies (e.g., the
study we reference found that 16%/0.4% of workers without/with qualifications reported
having had a <em>fatal</em> heart attack while watching television); or (b) data makeup:
workers are presented with grids of 48 images at a time in both experiments,
with grids containing a mix of ImageNet, ImageNet-v2, and candidate
images—but the exact proportions of this mix differ between the two
experiments.).</p>

<div class="footnote"><strong>Aside</strong>: Why did we need to run a new
crowdsourced study to observe this gap, instead of using the data already
collected for the ImageNet-v2 study? The answer is finite-sample reuse:
the selection frequencies collected in the original study are
precisely the ones used to filter the ImageNet-v2 dataset. So, by
construction, these selection frequency will match the selection
frequencies of the ones of ImageNet test set, regardless of whether
there is bias in the selection processTo draw a crude analogy here,
suppose that instead of matching image datasets we are matching piles of coins: 
Pile A is rigged $P(\text{heads})=1$, but Pile B is fair $P(\text{heads}) =
0.5$. We flip all the coins in both piles 10 times each---inevitably (if
there are enough total coins in Pile B), some of the Pile B coins will land
"heads" all 10 times, and will thus appear identical to the rigged Pile A
coins. Are they in fact identical? (After all, these coins match the Pile A
coins according to the "number of heads" statistic!) The answer is obviously
"no," but the key is that even though all the coins in Pile B are
fair (and flipping them another 10 times would reveal this), it's impossible to
conclude anything other than $P(\text{heads}) = 1$ solely from the
already-collected data on the selected coins.. If we're
careful about avoiding this finite-sample reuse (for example, by
re-performing the filtering process using half of the annotators and then
measuring selection frequencies with the other half) we can actually identify
bias in the original data—the process for doing so
is shown in Appendix C of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">our paper</a>.</div>

<h3 id="how-does-this-bias-affect-measured-accuracy">How does this bias affect measured accuracy?</h3>

<p>Our model and experiments suggest that matching empirical statistics from
different sources introduces bias into the dataset replication pipeline, and
that in the case of ImageNet-v2 this means that selection frequencies are
actually lower for the new ImageNet-v2 test set compared to the old one. Since
selection frequency is meant to roughly reflect data quality, and is known (as
found already by the ImageNet-v2 authors) to affect model accuracy, we expect the
downwards selection frequency bias in ImageNet-v2 to directly translate into a downwards
bias in model accuracy.</p>

<p>To test if this is really the case, we use a progressively increasing number of
annotators $n$ out of the 40 that we collected. For each $n$, we matchWe perform this matching via reweighting, rather than
filtering---more details are given in the next section. the
ImageNet-v2 observed selection frequencies (calculated using $n$ annotators) to
the ImageNet onesFor context, the ImageNet-v2 creators
matched their candidate pool to ImageNet with $n = 10$, and measure the
resulting model accuracies.
Our statistical model predicts that more annotators means less noise in the
observed selection frequencies, which in turn means less bias and higher model accuracies
in the original selection frequency used to create ImageNet-v2, and so we
should see the resulting model accuracies
increase. The data confirms this prediction: below we plot model accuracies on
ImageNet versus their adjusted accuracies on ImageNet-v2—using the slider
below the graph, you can vary the number of annotators used to make the
adjustment from zero (i.e. no matching, just raw ImageNet-v2 accuracies) to 40
(accuracies after statistic matching using all 40 annotations).</p>

<p>After using 40 workers to control for selection frequency
between ImageNet and ImageNet-v2, we reduce the 11.7% gap that was originally observed
to a gap of 5.7%. This is already a significant reduction, but the trend of the
graph suggests that 5.7% is still an overestimate—the gap continues to
consistently shrink with each increase in number annotators. In the final part
of this post, we’ll use a technique from classical statistics to get
an even better estimate of the real, bias-adjusted gap between ImageNet and
ImageNet-v2 model accuracies.</p>

<h2 id="adjusting-for-bias-with-the-statistical-jackknife">Adjusting for Bias with the Statistical Jackknife</h2>

<p>The statistic matching that led to the previous graph was based on what we’ll call a
<em>selection frequency-adjusted accuracy</em> estimator, defined for a given
classifier $f$ as:</p>

<p>\[
    \text{Acc}(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n 
    E_{x\sim \text{ImageNet-v2}}\left(1[\text{$f$ is correct on }x] | \widehat{s}(x) = \frac{k}{n}\right)\cdot 
    P_{x\sim \text{ImageNet}}\left(\widehat{s}(x) = \frac{k}{n}\right)
\]</p>

<p>This estimator has a simple interpretation: it is equivalent to
(a) sampling an ImageNet-v1 image and observing its (empirical) selection frequency;
then (b) finding a random ImageNet-v2 image with the same (empirical) selection
frequency, and recording the classifier’s correctness on that input. So what we are
estimating here is what a model’s accuracy on ImageNet-v2 would be, if the
selection frequencies of ImageNet-v2 were distributed as in the ImageNet test
set. (Notice that if the ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 selection frequency
distributions already matched, then this estimator would be independent from $n$
and would evaluate to exactly model accuracy on ImageNet-v2.)</p>

<p>Now, the $\text{Acc}(n)$ estimator is subject to the same bias as dataset
replication itself, as it too ignores the discrepancy between the empirical
selection frequency $\widehat{s}(x)$ and the true selection frequency $s(x)$.
Since we’ve been talking about bias pretty abstractly in this post, it’s worth
noting that the $\text{Acc}(n)$ estimator ties everything back to the formal,
statistical definition of bias. Specifically, our main finding can be restated
(though maybe less intuitively) as “$\text{Acc}(n)$ is a downwards-biased
estimator of the true reweighted accuracy,” that is</p>

<p>\[
    E[\text{Acc}(n)] &lt; \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} \text{Acc}(n). 
\]</p>

<p>So, from this perspective, our graph in the previous section can be viewed as just a plot of the value of $\text{Acc}(n)$ for every
classifier for various values of $n$. Also, the estimator behaves exactly how as predicted by
our model of the bias—as $n$ increases, $\widehat{s}(x)$ becomes a less
noisy estimator of $s(x)$, so the bias in the matching process decreases and
so $\text{Acc}(n)$ increases.</p>

<p>Now, what we really want to know is what $\text{Acc}(n)$ looks like as $n
\rightarrow \infty$, especially given that even when we use 40 annotators for
statistic matching the adjusted accuracy still improves.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09619">our paper</a> we present further techniques for tackling this problem.
These include making use of tools from empirical Bayes estimation techniques,
beta-binomial regression, and kernel density estimation. To keep things short
here, we’ll only discuss the simplest estimation method we use: one based on a
technique known as the statistical jackknife.</p>

<p>The jackknife dates back to the work of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1015.9344&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Maurice Quenouille</a> and <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoms/1177706647">John
Tukey</a> in the 1950s, and provides a way to estimate the bias of anyTechnically, certain
mild assumptions, such as the estimator being (statistically) consistent and having
bias that is analytic in $1/n$, are needed. statistical estimator. In
short, the jackknife estimate of an $n$-sample estimator
$\Theta_n(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ is given by</p>

<p>\[
    b_{jack}(\widehat{\theta}_n) 
    = (n-1)\cdot \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1} 
    \widehat{\theta}_{n-1}^{(i)} - \widehat{\theta}_n 
    \right),
\]</p>

<p>\[
    \text{where}\qquad \widehat{\theta}_{n-1}^{(i)} =
    \widehat{\theta}(X_1,\ldots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},\ldots,X_n) \text{ is the $i$th
    leave-one-out estimate.}
\]</p>

<article class="small">
A brief summary: consider our $n$-sample estimator $\Theta_n$, and define
$\Theta$ to be the true value of the estimator, i.e. $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}
\Theta_n$. In our case, $\Theta$ would be the adjusted accuracy of ImageNet-v2
if we had infinite workers. Now, suppose that the bias in $\Theta_n$ is on
the order of $1/n$, i.e.

\[
    E[\Theta_n] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n}
\]

Now, for a given n-sample estimate $\widehat{\Theta}_n$, we define a
<em>leave-one-our</em> estimator $\widehat{\Theta}_n^{(-i)}$ to be $\widehat{\Theta}_n$ 
computed with all but the $i$th datapoint. There are $n$ possible such leave-one-out 
estimators for a given $\widehat{\Theta}_n$. The main idea behind the jackknife
is to make the following two approximations:

\[
    \widehat{\Theta}_n \approx E[\Theta_n] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n}
\]
\[
    \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1} \widehat{\Theta}_n^{(-i)} \approx E[\Theta_{n-1}] = \Theta + \frac{b(\Theta)}{n-1}
\]

Using these two assumptions, one can solve for $b(\Theta)$ and end up with the
bias estimate given in the post.

</div>
</section>

<p>Averaging across all of the classifiers studied, the jackknife estimates the
bias in our estimator as about 1.0%, meaning that the bias-corrected gap
between ImageNet and ImageNet-v2 shrinks from 11.7% (without any correction) to
5.7% (using the 40 annotators we have to correct), to 4.7% (using this additional
jackknife bias correction). Moreover, as our paper discusses, this is almost
certainly still an overestimate—using more refined methods for bias estimation
reduces the gap to somewhere between 3.4% and 3.8% (with variation being across
different methods).</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-conclusions">Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>We find that noise—even if it is mean-zero—can result in bias in dataset reproductions if not
accounted for. Zooming in on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ImageNet-v2</code> replication effort, we use
statistical modeling to find that majority of the observed accuracy drop can be
explained by differences in selection frequency distribution between the
original dataset and its replication. Our results suggest that statistic modeling
of the data collection process can be an important tool in data replication efforts.

procedures, further experiments, and future directions.</p></div>

In STOC 1988, Ben-Or, Goldwasser, and Wigderson (BGW) established an important milestone in the fields of cryptography and distributed computing by showing that every functionality can be computed with perfect (information-theoretic and error-free) security at the presence of an active (aka Byzantine) rushing adversary that controls up to $n/3$ of the parties.

We study the round complexity of general secure multiparty computation in the BGW model. Our main result shows that every functionality can be realized in only four rounds of interaction, and that some functionalities cannot be computed in three rounds. This completely settles the round-complexity of perfect actively-secure optimally-resilient MPC, resolving a long line of research.

Our lower-bound is based on a novel round-reduction technique that allows us to lift existing three-round  lower-bounds for verifiable secret sharing to four-round lower-bounds for general MPC. To prove the upper-bound, we develop new round-efficient protocols for computing degree-2 functionalities over large fields, and establish the completeness of such functionalities. The latter result extends the recent completeness theorem of Applebaum, Brakerski and Tsabary (TCC 2018, Eurocrypt 2019) that was limited to the binary field.</div>

Cynthia Dwork is the <a href="http://www.sigact.org/prizes/knuth/citation2020.pdf">winner</a> of the 2020 Donald E. Knuth Prize. The prize is awarded jointly by ACM SIGACT and the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee. The ceremony will include a lecture by Cynthia at <a href="https://focs2020.cs.duke.edu/">FOCS 2020</a>, which is still projected to meet in-person at Duke next November 16–19.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate Cynthia and talk a little about her work.</p>
<p>
I, Dick, have known her for many years. I am excited to see that she has won the Knuth prize. </p>
<p>
She has always been a top researcher and a terrific speaker. I fondly recall some of her earlier talks at Princeton and elsewhere. There is something about her ability to explain complex ideas in a lucid manner. I have often thought that this ability must be one of the reasons she has been so successful in her research. </p>
<p>
We will talk a little about <em>differential privacy</em> (DP) and then her other joint work which led to another prize. We should be quick to <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/06/cynthia-dwork-and-a-brilliant-idea/">mention</a> that <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/02/07/still-a-brilliant-idea/">others</a> have been instrumental in both developments.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Quantifying an Idea </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
DP might have been appreciated long before there were large databases and computer systems. The genius is not just the simplicity of the idea but the development of mathematical tools to govern its application.</p>
<p>
For a simple example, suppose a professor has a general policy of posting exam average scores in her class of 100. Suppose she posts that the average is 73.3 after 98 students have taken the exam but two need to make it up a week later. Then suppose she re-posts the average after they take it and it is 72.5. The difference may not seem like much. But the class learns two things: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Both students had their makeup scores included in the average. (If the 73.3 is exact then it is not even possible to get a rounded 72.5 with just one score of zero, pending the other.) <p></p>
</li><li>
The two students collectively bombed the exam. (Just possibly one got a zero while the other did OK, but even then the other’s score was below average.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Your first thought might be that the fault is in the excessive precision in the grade reporting. If she had rounded to the nearest integer then both averages would have been reported as “73” and there would be no problem. But rounding is accidental. The new average could have been 72.49, which would be rounded down to “72,” when the set of possible interpretations is worse than before. </p>
<p>
In wide-scale situations where queries for multiple averages at different times are allowed, effects of rounding may cancel so that a large statistical analysis can subtract them out. Thus passively reducing precision is not enough. The key is to affect the precision actively by adding a random <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\pm \epsilon}" /> to the reported results, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" /> is judiciously chosen. The point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Adding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\pm \epsilon}" />, better than rounding, makes inference much harder. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the exam-score example, randomly adding or subtracting a number between 0 and 2 changes the calculus so that seeing “73.3” and then “72.5” does not allow a high-confidence inference about the makeup students’ scores. One could reason that the first number could easily have been 72.3 and the second 73.5, in line with interpretations where the makeup students upped the average. Actually, a jump from 72.3 to 73.5 in the <em>true</em> averages is impossible from just two new scores, so the class could deduce that the reported averages are fudged. But that is OK. Two basic purposes of reporting the averages are met despite the fudging: </p>
<ul>
<li>
to show the exam was consistent with past years—especially good to know this year; <p></p>
</li><li>
to give you some idea (knowing your own score exactly) where you stand relative to the class.
</li></ul>
<p>
In related situations, one could argue that a mean of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm 1}" class="latex" title="{\pm 1}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" /> is not enough. If the exam has 100 one-point questions each with a 73.3% expectation of getting it right for everyone, then the standard deviation about the mean is almost <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />. Using a mean change of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm 2}" class="latex" title="{\pm 2}" /> seems also fine in this case, whereas rounding to the nearest 05 (i.e., reporting “70” or “75” as the average) might be too coarse.</p>
<p>
We do not intend our example to be definitive, only that it conveys relevant issues. The example is enough to convey that DP leads into deep matters in statistics and <em>what can be inferred by statistical methods</em>. The latter melds the complexity-theoretic notion of knowledge gain from interactive protocols with statistical (machine) learning. And as with quantum computing, theorems and methods from the subfield have come back to inform fundamental questions about complexity (of course, this is true of crypto in general).</p>

Chess has all moved online, as heralded by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/sports/coronavirus-chess-online-tournament.html">two</a> recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/sports/chess-cheating-south-dakota-races.html">articles</a> in the New York Times and one in the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/forget-sourdough-everyone-is-playing-chess-now-11588845643">proclaiming</a>, “Sports: Chess Is the New King of the Pandemic.” </p>
<p>
As these articles also note, cheating has long been a major concern for online chess. I have been a recourse for second-opinions in online cheating cases but have not tried to be <em>primary</em> in this domain. A great conversation in November 2006 with Daniel Sleator (who—besides being famous for splay trees and amortized analysis—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Chess_Club#History">co-founded</a> the Internet Chess Club) told me how online cheating detection avails much information about the manner of play that is not applicable or reliably available in OTB chess. Also for academic reasons, I chose a minimal approach of using no information besides the moves of the games and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo ratings</a> of the players. An unexpected advantage of that choice is exemplified by an e-mail I received—fifteen minutes before a conference call on Wednesday with representatives of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) and other online platforms—from a different chess organizer requesting a statement that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …you will only use the data of the games, and not any personal data that might be obtained from the [tournaments] for your research, such as player name etc. … in writing as a standard precaution … to make sure that there isn’t third party usage of the data or usage outside of its intent. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Some recent legal decisions have confirmed that the moves of the games are public data and cannot be copyrighted. The e-mail did not mention the players’ ratings. As used by FIDE and the US and most online platforms (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-we-calculate-nba-elo-ratings/">and</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings">much</a> <a href="https://dotesports.com/general/news/elo-ratings-explained-20565">more</a> <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/methodology/how-our-nfl-predictions-work/">widely</a>), those are 4-digit numbers, and they are public. Knowing all four digits might be enough to pinpoint the identity of a player. </p>
<p>
Thus I suggested rounding the rating to the nearest 10 or even 20. This makes little difference to my statistical cheating tests, which already give 25 Elo points benefit-of-doubt for uncertainty about the rating. Tournament officials I’ve served have done this in a couple of individual cases but now the need is <em>en masse</em>. </p>
<p>
The question based on the previous section above is whether I should instead (or also) suggest that they implement full DP by adding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\pm \epsilon}" /> with a mean of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" title="{\pm 10}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+20%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pm 20}" class="latex" title="{\pm 20}" /> or so, with-or-without rounding. A caveat is that it is easy for someone with a tournament spreadsheet to round a column of figures before exporting text to me, but applying a random function is less familiar and prone to major mess-ups.</p>

<p></p><p>
The Knuth Prize is not Cynthia’s only win for 2020. In December she was awarded the 2020 IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal. A <a href="https://ieeetv.ieee.org/ieeetv-specials/honors-2020-cynthia-dwork-wins-the-ieee-richard-w-hamming-medal">video</a> gives a one-minute summary of differential privacy and her work on <em>non-malleable</em> cryptosystems via lattice bases. The latter stems from her 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~dolev/pubs/nmc.pdf">paper</a> with Danny Dolev and Moni Naor (DDN).</p>
<p>
We have not covered this crypto topic before. It involves chosen-ciphertext attacks where Eve, the evesdropper, first gets hold of a transmitted ciphertext <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. The cryptosystem is <em>malleable</em> if Eve can know enough about the structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> to make a legal ciphertext <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y'}" class="latex" title="{y'}" />, one that may decode to a plaintext <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x'}" class="latex" title="{x'}" /> that advances her interests compared to the intended <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability_(cryptography)">article</a> gives an example where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> embeds a numerical field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> that Eve can recognize and alter en-route. The paper gives a similar example where Eve cannot disrupt the transmission of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> but can separately send her own <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y'}" class="latex" title="{y'}" /> with a value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r'}" class="latex" title="{r'}" /> that gives her advantage. This may be so even without being able to decode or gain any information about the plain value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />, except that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r'}" class="latex" title="{r'}" /> is different in a meaningful way. For instance, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r'}" class="latex" title="{r'}" /> could be a lower bid on a contract or higher bid in a secure auction.</p>
<p>
One would think that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> should just be encoded via an error-correcting code whose range is secure so that an attacker would be overwhelmingly unlikely to find another value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r'}" class="latex" title="{r'}" /> in the legal range of the code. However, this clashes with the goal of <em>homomorphic encryption</em> which allows numerical operations on encoded values. Or the technology used may be too simple, as in the paper’s mention of submitting bids to a fax number. </p>
<p>
Note: both fax machines and the paper date to the previous millennium. But the paper next gives an example that is staying with us in this millennium, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> is a proof of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" />. Suppose Alice arranges to transmit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> to a referee Ralph using a zero-knowledge protocol, but Eve is able to intercept their messages. Eve can impersonate Ralph to Alice and impersonate Alice to Ralph as Ralph asks questions in the protocol. It may seem impossible to forestall such a “man-in-the-middle” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">attack</a> without extrinsic considerations of hardware and timing, but DDN design an ingenious scheme for <em>non-malleable zero-knowledge proofs</em>. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> A Video </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
<em>En-passant</em> of this, we want to note a great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wl-3kadvgw">video</a> that was made for next month’s Women in Theory <a href="https://womenintheory.wordpress.com/">workshop</a>. It has an all-female cast and lyrics by Avi Wigderson parodying the song “I Will Survive.” Cynthia is not in the video, but she likewise has been a great spokesperson for the experiences of women in our professional life.</p>

Our congratulations again to Cynthia—by name—on the Knuth and Hamming prizes.</p>
