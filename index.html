<div class="content">
In [20] Goldwasser, Grossman and Holden  introduced pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for search problems where a powerful prover can convince a probabilistic polynomial time verifier that a solution to a search problem is canonical.  They studied  search problems for which polynomial time algorithms are not known and for which many solutions are possible. They showed that whereas there exists a constant round pseudo deterministic proof for graph isomorphism where the canonical solution is the lexicographically smallest isomorphism, the existence of pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for NP-hard problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.

In this paper, we turn our attention to studying  doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proofs for polynomial time search problems:  pseudo-deterministic proofs with the extra requirement that the prover runtime is polynomial  and the verifier runtime to verify that a solution is canonical is significantly lower  than the complexity of finding any solution, canonical or otherwise. Naturally this question is particularly interesting for search problems for which a lower bound on its worst case complexity  is known or has been widely conjectured. 

We show doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic algorithms for a host of natural problems whose complexity has long been conjectured. In particular:

We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for linear programming where the canonical solution which the prover will provide is  the lexicographically greatest optimal solution for the LP. To this end, we show how through perturbing the linear program and strong duality this solution can be both  computed efficiently by the prover, and verified by the verifier.  
The time of the verifier is $O(d^2 )$ for a linear program with integer data and at most $d$ variables and constraints, whereas the time to solve such linear program is $\tilde{O}(d^{\omega} )$ by randomized algorithms [11] for $\omega$  the exponent for fast matrix multiplication .


We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for 3-SUM and problems reducible to 3-SUM where the prover is a $O(n^2)$ time algorithm and the verifier takes time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$. 


We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the hitting set problem} where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the prover runs in time $\tilde{O}(m^2)$ where $ m = \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} |S| + \sum_{T \in \mathcal{T}} |T|$ for inputs  collections of sets $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$.

We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the Zero Weight Triangle problem where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 + \omega/3})$ and the prover runs in randomized time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$. The Zero Weight Triangle problem is equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Path problem, a well-studied problem that is the foundation of many hardness results in graph algorithms [39,38], under sub-cubic reductions.</div>

We study the problem of finding monotone subsequences in an array from the viewpoint of sublinear algorithms. For fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that the non-adaptive query complexity of finding a length-$k$ monotone subsequence of $f \colon [n] \to \mathbb{R}$, assuming that $f$ is $\varepsilon$-far from free of such subsequences, is $\Theta((\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k \rfloor})$. Prior to our work, the best algorithm for this problem, due to Newman, Rabinovich, Rajendraprasad, and Sohler (2017), made $(\log n)^{O(k^2)}$ non-adaptive queries; and the only lower bound known, of $\Omega(\log n)$ queries for the case $k = 2$, followed from that on testing monotonicity due to Erg\"un, Kannan, Kumar, Rubinfeld, and Viswanathan (2000) and Fischer (2004).</div>

<p><s>Five</s> Six papers this month: results on testing separations, linearity testing in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), testing for regular languages, graph property testing, topological property testing, and Boolean rank. </p>



<p><strong>Hard properties with (very) short PCPPs and their applications</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Eldar Fischer, Amit Levi, and Ron D. Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/088/">arXiv</a>). Probably, the most significant takeaway from this work is a (largest possible) separation between standard and tolerant property testing. PCPPs (Probabilistically Checkable Proofs of Proximity) are the “NP” variant of property testing, where the tester is aided by a proof string. Consider property \(\mathcal{P}\). If \(x \in \mathcal{P}\), there must be a proof string that makes the tester accept (with probability 1). If \(x\) is far from \(\mathcal{P}\) (in the usual property testing sense), for any proof string, the tester must reject with sufficiently high probability. PCPPs have played a role in the classical constructions of PCPs, but have also found uses in getting a better understanding of property testing itself. And this paper shows how PCPP constructions can be used to get property testing separations. The main result in this paper is a property \(\mathcal{P}\) that (basically) requires \(\Omega(n)\) queries to “property test”, but has a PCPP system where the proof length is \(\widetilde{O}(n)\). (\(n\) is the input length.) The main construction uses collections of random linear codes. Significantly, these constructions show a strong separation between standard vs tolerant property testing, and standard vs erasure-resilient property testing. (The latter is a recent variant by <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1075661?journalCode=smjcat">Dixit et al</a>, where certain parts of the input are hidden from the tester.) There is a property that is testable in a constant number of queries, but requires \(\widetilde{\Omega}(n)\) queries to test tolerantly (for any non-trivial choice of parameters). An analogous result holds for erasure-resilient testing.</p>



<p><strong>Distribution-Free Testing of Linear Functions on R^n</strong>, by Noah Fleming and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03391">arXiv</a>). Linearity testing is arguably <em>the</em> canonical problem in property testing, yet there is still much to be learned about it. This paper considers functions \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\), and the <em>distribution-free setting</em>. (In this setting, distance is measured according is an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the input, and the tester can access samples from this distribution. For \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the “standard” distribution would the \(n\)-dimensional Gaussian.) The main result is that linearity testing can be done in the distribution-free setting with \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\) queries, assuming that the distribution is continuous. The primary technical tool, an interesting result in its own right, is that additivity \((f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y))\) can be tested in \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\) queries. The significance of the testing result is cemented by an \(\Omega(n)\) lower bound for sample-based testers.</p>



<p><strong>Sliding window property testing for regular languages</strong> by Moses Ganardi, Danny Hucke, Markus Lohrey, Tatiana Starikovskaya (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10261">arXiv</a>). Fix a regular language \(\mathcal{R}\). Consider the streaming model, and the basic question of recognizing whether the string (being streamed) is in \(\mathcal{R}\). Simple, you will say! Run the DFA recognizing \(\mathcal{R}\) in constant space. Now, suppose there is a sliding window length of \(n\). The aim is to determine if the past \(n\) symbols (the “active window”) form a string in \(\mathcal{R}\). Suprisingly (at least to me), there is a full characterization of the space required for randomized algorithms, and (depending on \(\mathcal{R}\)), it is either \(\Theta(1)\), \(\Theta(\log\log n)\), \(\Theta(\log n)\), or \(\Theta(n)\).  In the interest of beating these lower bounds, suppose we wish to property test on the active window. It turns out the answer is quite nuanced. There are deterministic \(O(\log n)\)-space testers and randomized two-sided \(O(1/\varepsilon)\)-space testers for all regular languages. For randomized one-sided testers, there are multiple possibilities for the optimal space complexity, and there is a full characterization of these regular languages.</p>



<p><strong>A characterization of graph properties testable for general planar graphs with one-sided error (It’s all about forbidden subgraphs)</strong> by Artur Czumaj and Christian Sohler (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10647.pdf">arXiv</a>). Property testing of sparse graphs has been receiving more attention, but most results focus on the bounded degree setting. Unfortunately, many of these results break quite dramatically on sparse graphs with unbounded degrees. This paper focuses on property testing, within the class of unbounded degree planar graphs. (Meaning, the input is always assumed to be planar.) The results achieve a significant goal: as the title suggests, there is a complete characterization of properties that are constant-query testable with one-sided error. The easier part is in showing that all such properties can be reduced to testing \(H\)-freeness. The harder (remarkable) result is \(H\)-freeness can be tested in general planar queries with constant queries. (This is non-trivial even for triangle-freeness.) And, as is easy to conjecture but hard to prove, these results carry over for all minor-closed families.  As a small indication of the challenge, most testers for bounded-degree graphs work by doing constant depth BFSes. When high degree vertices are present, this method fails, and we really need new ideas to deal with such graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Near Coverings and Cosystolic Expansion – an example of topological property testing</strong> by Irit Dinur and Roy Meshulam (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/126/">ECCC</a>). In most algebraic settings, property testing results can be seen as local to global theorems. When do local constraints on a large object imply a global condition? This paper gives a topological instantiation of this phenomenon. We need to define the <em>cover</em> of a simplicial complex \(X\). For concreteness, think of a 2D simplicial complex \(X\), which is a hypergraph with hyperedges of size at most 3, where subsets of hyperedges are also present. A 2-cover is a simplicial complex \(X’\) with the following property. It has two copies of each vertex of \(X\). Each hyperedge of \(X\) must have two “corresponding” disjoint copies in \(X’\). Let the copies of vertex \(v\) be \(v_0, v_1\). Then, for every hyperedge (say) \((u,v,w)\) of \(X\), there must be two disjoint hyperedges in \(X’\) involving copies of the corresponding vertices. One can consider the property testing twist: if the neighborhoods of “most” vertices \(v\) in \(X\) satisfy these condition (with respect to the neighborhoods of the copies of \(v\) in \(X’\)), then is \(X’\) close to being a cover of \(X\)? Indeed, this paper proves that such a “property testing condition” holds iff \(X\) is a high-dimensional expander.</p>



<p><strong>Property testing of the Boolean and binary rank</strong> by Michal Parnas, Dana Ron, and Adi Shraibman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11632">arXiv</a>). The Boolean rank of a matrix \(M\) is a fundamental quantity that appears in many lower bound constructions. (Recall that an \(n \times m\) Boolean matrix \(M\) has a rank \(r\) if \(M\) can be expressed as \(X \cdot Y\), where \(X \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n \times d}\) and \(Y \in \mathbb{F}_2^{d \times m}\).) In the real-valued setting, results show that one can property test rank in \(poly(d/\varepsilon)\) queries. This paper proves an analogous result for the Boolean rank. There is a surprise element here: over reals, the rank can be computed in polynomial time, and many of the geometric intuitions can be brought over to the property testing problem. On the other hand, the Boolean rank is NP-hard to compute exactly, yet we can still get a tester with \(poly(d)\) query complexity. The paper also gives results for <em>binary rank</em>. For the binary rank, we require the component matrices \(X, Y\) to be Boolean, but algebraic operations are over the reals. In the case, the tester has query complexity \(2^{2d}\) (with varying dependencies on \(\varepsilon\) for adaptive/non-adaptive testers). The intriguing open problem is whether \(poly(d)\)-query testers exist for binary rank.</p>

creations of district maps with highly asymmetric electoral outcomes to
disenfranchise voters, and it has a long legal history. Measuring and
eliminating gerrymandering has enormous implications to sustain the backbone of
democratic principles of a society. Although there is no dearth of legal briefs
involving gerrymandering over many years, it is only more recently that
mathematicians and applied computational researchers have started to
investigate this topic. However, it has received relatively little attention so
far from the computational complexity researchers dealing with theoretical
analysis of computational complexity issues, such as computational hardness,
approximability issues, etc. There could be many reasons for this, such as
descriptions of these problem non-CS non-math (often legal or political)
journals that theoretical CS (TCS) people usually do not follow, or the lack of
coverage of these topics in TCS publication venues. One of our modest goals in
writing this article is to improve upon this situation by stimulating further
interactions between the gerrymandering and TCS researchers. To this effect,
our main contributions are twofold: (1) we provide formalization of several
models, related concepts, and corresponding problem statements using TCS
frameworks from the descriptions of these problems as available in existing
non-TCS (perhaps legal) venues, and (2) we also provide computational
complexity analysis of some versions of these problems, leaving other versions
for future research.
</p>
<p>The goal of writing this article is not to have the final word on
gerrymandering, but to introduce a series of concepts, models and problems to
the TCS community and to show that science of gerrymandering involves an
intriguing set of partitioning problems involving geometric and combinatorial
optimization.

Achlioptas-Iliopoulos-Kolmogorov [2] and by Achlioptas-Iliopoulos-Sinclair [3].
These papers analyze a random walk algorithm for finding objects that avoid
undesired "bad events" (or "flaws"), and prove that under certain conditions
the algorithm is guaranteed to find a "flawless" object quickly. We show that
conditions proposed in these papers are incomparable, and introduce a new
family of conditions that includes those in [2, 3] as special cases.
</p>
<p>Secondly, we extend our previous notion of "commutativity" in [15] to this
more general setting, and prove that it allows to use an arbitrary strategy for
selecting the next flaw to address. In the special case of primary flaws we
prove a stronger property: the flaw selection strategy does not affect at all
the expected number of steps until termination, and also does not affect the
distribution induced by the algorithm upon termination. This applies, in
particular, to the single-clause backtracking algorithm for constraint
satisfaction problems considered in [3].

polynomial time does not works for identifying the tractable problems in big
data computing. This paper adopts the sublinear time as the new tractable
standard to recognize the tractability in big data computing, and the
random-access Turing machine is used as the computational model to characterize
the problems that are tractable on big data. First, two pure-tractable classes
are first proposed. One is the class $\mathrm{PL}$ consisting of the problems
that can be solved in polylogarithmic time by a RATM. The another one is the
class $\mathrm{ST}$ including all the problems that can be solved in sublinear
time by a RATM. The structure of the two pure-tractable classes is deeply
investigated and they are proved $\mathrm{PL^i} \subsetneq \mathrm{PL^{i+1}}$
and $\mathrm{PL} \subsetneq \mathrm{ST}$. Then, two pseudo-tractable classes,
$\mathrm{PTR}$ and $\mathrm{PTE}$, are proposed. $\mathrm{PTR}$ consists of all
the problems that can solved by a RATM in sublinear time after a PTIME
preprocessing by reducing the size of input dataset. $\mathrm{PTE}$ includes
all the problems that can solved by a RATM in sublinear time after a PTIME
preprocessing by extending the size of input dataset. The relations among the
two pseudo-tractable classes and other complexity classes are investigated and
they are proved that $\mathrm{PT} \subseteq \mathrm{P}$, $\sqcap'\mathrm{T^0_Q}
\subsetneq \mathrm{PTR^0_Q}$ and $\mathrm{PT_P} = \mathrm{P}$.

for 5G. It allows several users to transmit on the same frequency and time
resource by performing power-domain multiplexing. At the receiver side,
successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied to mitigate interference
among the multiplexed signals. In this way, NOMA can outperform orthogonal
multiple access schemes used in conventional cellular networks in terms of
spectral efficiency and allows more simultaneous users. This paper investigates
the computational complexity of joint subcarrier and power allocation problems
in multi-carrier NOMA systems. We prove that these problems are strongly
NP-hard for a large class of objective functions, namely the weighted
generalized means of the individual data rates. This class covers the popular
weighted sum-rate, proportional fairness, harmonic mean and max-min fairness
utilities. Our results show that the optimal power and subcarrier allocation
cannot be computed in polynomial time in the general case, unless P = NP.
Nevertheless, we present some tractable special cases and we show that they can
be solved efficiently.

in streams of data. Increasingly, tools for change-point detection are applied
in settings where data may be highly sensitive and formal privacy guarantees
are required, such as identifying disease outbreaks based on hospital records,
or IoT devices detecting activity within a home. Differential privacy has
emerged as a powerful technique for enabling data analysis while preventing
information leakage about individuals. Much of the prior work on change-point
detection (including the only private algorithms for this problem) requires
complete knowledge of the pre-change and post-change distributions. However,
this assumption is not realistic for many practical applications of interest.
This work develops differentially private algorithms for solving the
change-point problem when the data distributions are unknown. Additionally, the
data may be sampled from distributions that change smoothly over time, rather
than fixed pre-change and post-change distributions. We apply our algorithms to
detect changes in the linear trends of such data streams.

convex loss functions, is an important optimization problem that has many
machine learning applications. NSM is generally NP-hard, and so to exactly
solve NSM is almost impossible in polynomial time. As regards the case of
quadratic objective functions, exact algorithms based on quadratic
mixed-integer programming (MIP) have been studied, but no existing exact
methods can handle more general objective functions including Huber and
logistic losses; this is unfortunate since those functions are prevalent in
practice. In this paper, we consider NSM with $\ell_2$-regularized convex
objective functions and develop an algorithm by leveraging the efficiency of
best-first search (BFS). Our BFS can compute solutions with objective errors at
most $\Delta\ge0$, where $\Delta$ is a controllable hyper-parameter that
balances the trade-off between the guarantee of objective errors and
computation cost. Experiments demonstrate that our BFS is useful for solving
moderate-size NSM instances with non-quadratic objectives and that BFS is also
faster than the MIP-based method when applied to quadratic objectives.

<b>The quest towards quantum computational supremacy</b><br />
<br />
September saw some huge news in the area of quantum computing, with rumours that the Google AI Lab has achieved a milestone known as 'quantum computational supremacy', also termed 'quantum supremacy' or 'quantum advantage' by some authors. Today, we examine what this term means, the most promising approach towards achieving this milestone, and the best complexity-theoretic evidence we have so far against classical simulability of quantum mechanics. We will not be commenting on details of the purported paper since there is no official announcement or claim from the authors so far.<br />
<br />
<b>What it means</b><br />
<br />
First off, the field of quantum computational supremacy arose from trying to formally understand the differences in the power of classical and quantum computers. A complexity theorist would view this goal as trying to give evidence to separate the complexity classes BPP and BQP. However, it turns out that one can gain more traction from considering the sampling analogues of these classes, SampBPP and SampBQP.  These are classes of distributions that can be efficiently sampled on classical and quantum computers, respectively. Given a quantum circuit U on n qubits, one may define an associated probability distribution over 2^n outcomes as follows: apply U to the fiducial initial state |000...0&gt; and measure the resulting state in the computational basis. This produces a distribution D_U.<br />
<br />
A suitable way to define the task of simulating the quantum circuit is as follows<b style="font-style: italic;">:</b><br />
<br />
Input: Description of a quantum circuit U acting on n qubits.<br />
<br />
Output: A sample from the probability distribution D_U obtained by measuring U|000...0&gt; in the computational basis.<br />
<br />
One of the early works in this field was that of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205133">Terhal and DiVincenzo</a>, which first considered the complexity of sampling from a distribution (weak simulation) as opposed to that of calculating the exact probability of a certain outcome (strong simulation). Weak simulation is arguably the more natural notion of simulating a quantum system, since in general, we cannot feasibly compute the probability of a certain outcome even if we can simulate the quantum circuit. Subsequent works by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.3245">Aaronson and Arkhipov</a>, and by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1407">Bremner, Jozsa, and Shepherd</a> established that if there is a classically efficient weak simulator for different classes of quantum circuits, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.<br />
<br />
<br />
So far, we have only considered the question of exactly sampling from the distribution D_U. However, any realistic experiment is necessarily noisy, and a more natural problem is to sample from a distribution that is not exactly D_U but from any distribution D_O that is ε-close in a suitable distance measure, say the variation distance.<br />
<br />
The aforementioned work by Aaronson and Arkhipov was the first to consider this problem, and they made progress towards showing that a special class of quantum circuits (linear optical circuits) is classically hard to approximately simulate in the sense above. The task of sampling from the output of linear optical circuits is known as boson sampling. At the   time, it was the best available way to show that quantum computers  may solve some problems that are far beyond the reach of classical computers.<br />
<br />
Even granting that the PH doesn't collapse, one still needs to make an additional conjecture to establish that boson sampling is not classically simulable.  The conjecture is that additively approximating the output probabilities of a random linear optical quantum circuit is #P-hard.  The reason this may be true is that output probabilities of random linear optical quantum circuits are Permanents of a Gaussian random matrix, and the Permanent is as hard to compute on a random matrix as it is on a worst-case matrix. Therefore, the only missing link is to go from average-case hardness of exact computation to average-case hardness of an additive estimation. In addition, if we make a second conjecture known as the "anti-concentration" conjecture, we can show that this additive estimation is non-trivial: it suffices to give us a good multiplicative estimation with high probability.<br />
<br />
So that's what quantum computational supremacy is about: we have a computational task that is efficiently solvable with quantum computers, but which would collapse the polynomial hierarchy if done by a classical computer (assuming certain other conjectures are true). One may substitute "collapse of the polynomial hierarchy" with stronger conjectures and incur a corresponding tradeoff in the likelihood of the conjecture being true.<br />
<br />
<b>Random circuit sampling</b><br />
<br />
In 2016,<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00263"> Boixo et al</a>. proposed to replace the class of quantum circuits for which some hardness results were known (commuting circuits and boson sampling) by random circuits of sufficient depth on a 2D grid of qubits having nearest-neighbour interactions. Concretely, the proposed experiment would be to apply random unitaries from a specified set on n qubits arranged on a 2D grid for sufficient depth, and then sample from the resulting distribution. The two-qubit unitaries in the set are restricted to act between nearest neighbours, respecting the geometric This task is called random circuit sampling (RCS).<br />
<br />
At the time, the level of evidence for the hardness of this scheme was not yet the same as the linear optical scheme. However, given the theoretical and experimental interest in the idea of demonstrating a quantum speedup over classical computers, subsequent works by<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04402"> Bouland, Fefferman, Nirkhe and Vazirani</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06957">Harrow and Mehraban</a> bridged this gap (the relevant work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Aaronson and Chen</a> will be discussed in the following section). Harrow and Mehraban proved anticoncentration for random circuits. In particular, they showed that a 2-dimensional grid of n qubits achieve anticoncentration in depth O(\sqrt{n}), improving upon earlier results with higher depth due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.0692">Brandao, Harrow and Horodeck</a>i. Bouland et al. proved the same supporting evidence for RCS as that for boson sampling, namely a worst-to-average-case reduction for exactly computing most output probabilities, even without the permanent structure possessed by linear optical quantum circuits.<br />
<br />
<b>Verification</b><br />
<br />
So far, we have not discussed the elephant in the room: of verifying that the output distribution supported on 2^n outcomes. It turns out that there are concrete lower bounds such as those due to Valiant and Valiant, showing that verifying whether an empirical distribution is close to a target distribution is impossible if one has few samples.<br />
<br />
Boixo et al. proposed a way of certifying the fidelity of the purported simulation. Their key observation was to note that if their experimental system is well modelled by a noise model called global depolarising noise, estimating the output fidelity is possible with relatively few outcomes. Under global depolarising noise with fidelity f, the noisy distribution takes the form D_N = f D_U + (1-f) I, where I is the uniform distribution over the 2^n outcomes. Together with another empirical observation about the statistics of output probabilities of the ideal distribution D_U, they argued that computing the following cross-entropy score would serve as a good estimator of the fidelity:<br />
<br />
f ~ H(I, D_U) - H(D_exp, D_U), where H(D_A,D_B) is the cross-entropy between the two distributions: H(D_A, D_B) = -\sum_i p_A log (p_B).<br />
<br />
The proposal here was to experimentally collect several samples from D_exp, classically compute using brute-force the probabilities of these outcomes in the distribution D_U, and estimate the cross-entropy using this information. If the test outputs a high score for a computation on sufficiently many qubits and depth, the claim is that quantum supremacy has been achieved.<br />
<br />
Aaronson and Chen gave alternative form of evidence for the hardness of scoring well on a test that aims to certify quantum supremacy similar to the manner above. This sidesteps the issue of whether a test similar to the one above does indeed certify the fidelity. The specific problem considered was "Heavy Output Generation" (HOG), the problem of outputting strings that have higher than median probability in the output distribution. Aaronson and Chen linked the hardness of HOG to a closely related problem called "QUATH", and conjectured that QUATH is hard for classical computers.<br />
<br />
<b>Open questions</b><br />
<br />
Assuming the Google team has performed the impressive feat of both running the experiment outlined before and classically computing the probabilities of the relevant outcomes to see a high score on their cross-entropy test, I discuss the remaining positions a skeptic might take regarding the claim about quantum supremacy.<br />
<br />
"The current evidence of classical hardness of random circuit sampling is not sufficient to conclude that the task is hard". Assuming that the skeptic believes that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse, a remaining possibility is that there is no worst-to-average-case reduction for the problem of *approximating* most output probabilities, which kills the proof technique of Aaronson and Arkhipov to show hardness of approximate sampling.<br />
<br />
"The cross-entropy proposal does not certify the fidelity." Boixo et al. gave numerical evidence and other arguments for this statement, based on the observation that the noise is of the global depolarising form. A skeptic may argue that the assumption of global depolarising noise is a strong one.<br />
<br />
"The QUATH problem is not classically hard." In order to give evidence for the hardness of QUATH, Aaronson and Chen examined the best existing algorithms for this problem and also gave a new algorithm that nevertheless do not solve QUATH with the required parameters.<br />
<br />
It would be great if the community could work towards strengthening the evidence we already have for this task to be hard, either phrased as a sampling experiment or together with the verification test.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think this is an exciting time for quantum computing and to witness this landmark event. It may not be the first probe of an experiment that is "hard" to classically simulate, since there are many quantum experiments that are beyond the reach of current classical simulations, but the inherent programmability and control present in the experimental system is what enables the tools of complexity theory to be applied to the problem. A thought that fascinates me is the idea that we may be exploring quantum mechanics in a regime never probed this carefully before, the "high complexity regime" of quantum mechanics. One imagines there are important lessons in physics here.<br />

<p>Consider an experiment aimed for establishing quantum supremacy: your quantum computer produced a sample <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" /> which is a 0-1 string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> from a certain distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_i" class="latex" title="D_i" />. The research assumption is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_i" class="latex" title="D_i" />  is close enough to a fixed distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> accounts for the computing process and the noise) which is very hard to be demonstrated on a classical computer. By looking at a large number of samples you can perform a statistical test on the samples to verify that they were (approximately) sampled from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" />, or at least that they were sampled from a probability distribution that is very hard to be computed on a classical computer!</p>
<p>But, is it possible that all the distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_i" class="latex" title="D_i" />‘s are very different? Namely that each sample is taken from a completely different distribution? More formally, is it possible  that under a correct modeling of the device for two different samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_j" class="latex" title="x_j" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_i" class="latex" title="D_i" /> has a very small correlation with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_j" class="latex" title="D_j" />? In this case we say that the experiment outcomes are <strong>not robust</strong> and that the situation is <strong>chaotic</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of questions that I propose to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we test robustness?</li>
<li>Do the supremacy experiments require that the experiment is robust?</li>
<li>If, after many samples, you reach a probability distribution that require exponential time on a classical computer should you worry about the question whether the experiment is robust?</li>
<li><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do the 10,000,000 samples for the Google 53-qubit experiment represent a robust sampling experiment?</span></li>

<p>(Crossposted <a href="https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2019/10/03/ultra-wide-deep-nets-and-the-neural-tangent-kernel-ntk/">at CMU ML</a>.)</p>

<p>Traditional wisdom in machine learning holds that there is a careful trade-off between training error and generalization gap. There is a “sweet spot” for the model complexity such that the model (i) is big enough to achieve reasonably good training error, and (ii) is small enough so that the generalization gap - the difference between test error and training error - can be controlled. A smaller model would give a larger training error, while making the model bigger would result in a larger generalization gap, both leading to larger test errors. This is described by the classical U-shaped curve for the test error when the model complexity varies (see Figure 1(a)).</p>

<p>However, it is common nowadays to use highly complex over-parameterized models like deep neural networks. These models are usually trained to achieve near zero error on the training data, and yet they still have remarkable performance on test data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin et al. (2018)</a> characterized this phenomenon by a “double descent” curve which extends the classical U-shaped curve. It was observed that, as one increases the model complexity past the point where it can perfectly fits the training data (i.e., <em>interpolation</em> regime is reached), test error continues to drop! Interestingly, the best test error is often achieved by the largest model, which goes against the classical intuition about the “sweet spot.” The following figure from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin et al. (2018)</a> illustrates this phenomenon.</p>

</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Consequently one suspects that the training algorithms used in deep learning - (stochastic) gradient descent and its variants - somehow implicitly constrain the complexity of trained networks (i.e., “true number” of parameters), thus leading to a small generalization gap.</p>

<p>Since larger models often give better performance in practice, one may naturally wonder:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How does an infinitely wide net perform?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer to this question corresponds to the right end of Figure 1(b). This blog post is about a model that has attracted a lot of attention in the past year:  deep learning in the regime where the width - namely, the number of channels in convolutional filters, or the number of neurons in fully-connected internal layers - goes to infinity. At first glance this approach may seem hopeless for both practitioners and theorists: all the computing power in the world is insufficient to train an infinite network, and theorists already have their hands full trying to figure out finite ones. But in math/physics there is a tradition of deriving insights into questions by studying them in the infinite limit, and indeed here too the infinite limit becomes easier for theory.</p>

<p>Experts may recall the connection between infinitely wide neural networks and kernel methods from 25 years ago by <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/pin.abstract.html">Neal (1994)</a> as well as the recent extensions by <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1EA-M-0Z">Lee et al. (2018)</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11271">Matthews et al. (2018)</a>. These kernels correspond to infinitely wide deep networks whose all parameters are chosen randomly, and <em>only the top (classification) layer is trained</em> by gradient descent. Specifically, if $f(\theta,x)$ denotes the output of the network on input $x$ where $\theta$ denotes the parameters in the network, and $\mathcal{W}$ is an initialization distribution over $\theta$ (usually Gaussian with proper scaling), then the corresponding kernel is

where $x,x’$ are two inputs.</p>

<p>What about the more usual scenario when <em>all layers are trained</em>? Recently, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07572.pdf">Jacot et al. (2018)</a> first observed that this is also related to a kernel named <em>neural tangent kernel (NTK)</em>, which has the form
</p>

<p>The key difference between the NTK and previously proposed kernels is that the NTK is defined through the inner product between the gradients of the network outputs with respect to the network parameters. This gradient arises from the use of the gradient descent algorithm. Roughly speaking, the following conclusion can be made for a sufficiently wide deep neural network trained by gradient descent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A properly randomly initialized <strong>sufficiently wide</strong> deep neural network <strong>trained by gradient descent</strong> with infinitesimal step size (a.k.a. gradient flow) is <strong>equivalent to a kernel regression predictor</strong> with a <strong>deterministic</strong> kernel called <em>neural tangent kernel (NTK)</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was more or less established in the original paper of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07572.pdf">Jacot et al. (2018)</a>, but they required the width of every layer to go to infinity in a sequential order. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">our recent paper</a> with Sanjeev Arora, Zhiyuan Li, Ruslan Salakhutdinov and Ruosong Wang, we improve this result to the non-asymptotic setting where the width of every layer only needs to be greater than a certain finite threshold.</p>

<p>In the rest of this post we will first explain how NTK arises and the idea behind the proof of the equivalence between wide neural networks and NTKs. Then we will present experimental results showing how well infinitely wide neural networks perform in practice.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-neural-tangent-kernel-arise">How Does Neural Tangent Kernel Arise?</h2>

<p>Now we describe how training an ultra-wide fully-connected neural network leads to kernel regression with respect to the NTK. A more detailed treatment is given in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">our paper</a>. We first specify our setup. We consider the standard supervised learning setting, in which we are given $n$ training data points ${(x_i,y_i)}_{i=1}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}$ drawn from some underlying distribution and wish to find a function that given the input $x$ predicts the label $y$ well on the data distribution. We consider a fully-connected neural network defined by $f(\theta, x)$, where $\theta$ is the collection of all the parameters in the network and $x$ is the input. For simplicity we only consider neural network with a single output, i.e., $f(\theta, x) \in \mathbb{R}$, but the generalization to multiple outputs is straightforward.</p>

<p>We consider training the neural network by minimizing the quadratic loss over training data:

Gradient descent with infinitesimally small learning rate (a.k.a. gradient flow) is applied on this loss function $\ell(\theta)$:                                                                               
where $\theta(t)$ denotes the parameters at time $t$.</p>

<p>Let us define some useful notation. Denote $u_i = f(\theta, x_i)$, which is the network’s output on $x_i$. We let $u=(u_1, \ldots, u_n)^\top \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the collection of the network outputs on all training inputs. We use the time index $t$ for all variables that depend on time, e.g. $u_i(t), u(t)$, etc. With this notation the training objective can be conveniently written as $\ell(\theta) = \frac12 |u-y|_2^2$.</p>

<p>Using simple differentiation, one can obtain the dynamics of $u(t)$ as follows: (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">our paper</a> for a proof)​

where $H(t)$ is an $n\times n$ positive semidefinite matrix whose $(i, j)$-th entry is $\left\langle \frac{\partial f(\theta(t), x_i)}{\partial\theta}, \frac{\partial f(\theta(t), x_j)}{\partial\theta} \right\rangle$.</p>

<p>Note that $H(t)$ is the <em>kernel matrix</em> of the following (time-varying) kernel $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ evaluated on the training data:

In this kernel an input $x$ is mapped to a feature vector $\phi_t(x) = \frac{\partial f(\theta(t), x)}{\partial\theta}$ defined through the gradient of the network output with respect to the parameters at time $t$.</p>

<p>###The Large Width Limit</p>

<p>Up to this point we haven’t used the property that the neural network is very wide. The formula for the evolution of $u(t)$ is valid in general. In the large width limit, it turns out that the time-varying kernel $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is (with high probability) always close to a <em>deterministic</em> fixed kernel $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(\cdot,\cdot)$, which is the <strong>neural tangent kernel (NTK)</strong>. This property is proved in two steps, both requiring the large width assumption:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 1: Convergence to the NTK at random initialization.</strong> Suppose that the network parameters at initialization ($t=0$), $\theta(0)$, are i.i.d. Gaussian. Then under proper scaling, for any pair of inputs $x, x’$, it can be shown that the random variable $ker_0(x,x’)$, which depends on the random initialization $\theta(0)$, converges in probability to the deterministic value $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x,x’)$, in the large width limit.</p>

    <p>(Technically speaking, there is a subtlety about how to define the large width limit. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07572.pdf">Jacot et al. (2018)</a> gave a proof for the sequential limit where the width of every layer goes to infinity one by one. Later <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04760">Yang (2019)</a> considered a setting where all widths go to infinity at the same rate. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955">Our paper</a> improves them to the non-asymptotic setting, where we only require all layer widths to be larger than a finite threshold, which is the weakest notion of limit.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Step 2: Stability of the kernel during training.</strong> Furthermore, the kernel <em>barely changes</em> during training, i.e., $ker_t(x,x’) \approx ker_0(x,x’)$ for all $t$. The reason behind this is that the weights do not move much during training, namely $\frac{|\theta(t) - \theta(0)|}{|\theta(0)|} \to 0$ as width $\to\infty$. Intuitively, when the network is sufficiently wide, each individual weight only needs to move a tiny amount in order to have a non-negligible change in the network output. This turns out to be true when the network is trained by gradient descent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Combining the above two steps, we conclude that for any two inputs $x, x’$, with high probability we have

As we have seen, the dynamics of gradient descent is closely related to the time-varying kernel $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$. Now that we know that $ker_t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is essentially the same as the NTK, with a few more steps, we can eventually establish the equivalence between trained neural network and NTK: the final learned neural network at time $t=\infty$, denoted by $f_{\mathsf{NN}}(x) = f(\theta(\infty), x)$, is equivalent to the <em>kernel regression</em> solution with respect to the NTK. Namely, for any input $x$ we have

where $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x, X) = (ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x, x_1), \ldots, ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x, x_n))^\top \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(X, X) $ is an $n\times n$ matrix whose $(i, j)$-th entry is $ker_{\mathsf{NTK}}(x_i, x_j)$.</p>

<p>(In order to not have a bias term in the kernel regression solution we also assume that the network output at initialization is small: $f(\theta(0), x)\approx0$; this can be ensured by e.g. scaling down the initialization magnitude by a large constant, or replicating a network with opposite signs on the top layer at initialization.)</p>

<h2 id="how-well-do-infinitely-wide-neural-networks-perform-in-practice">How Well Do Infinitely Wide Neural Networks Perform in Practice?</h2>

<p>Having established this equivalence, we can now address the question of how well infinitely wide neural networks perform in practice — we can just evaluate the kernel regression predictors using the NTKs! We test NTKs on a standard image classification dataset, CIFAR-10. Note that for image datasets, one needs to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve good performance. Therefore, we derive an extension of NTK, <em>convolutional neural tangent kernels (CNTKs)</em> and test their performance on CIFAR-10. In the table below, we report the classification accuracies of different CNNs and CNTKs:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/cntk_acc.jpeg" style="width: 700px;" />
<br />
</div>

<p>Here CNN-Vs are vanilla practically-wide CNNs (without pooling), and CNTK-Vs are their NTK counterparts. We also test CNNs with global average pooling (GAP), denotes above as CNN-GAPs, and their NTK counterparts, CNTK-GAPs. For all experiments, we turn off batch normalization, data augmentation, etc., and only use SGD to train CNNs (for CNTKs, we use the closed-form formula of kernel regression).</p>

<p>We find that CNTKs are actually very power kernels. The best kernel we find, 11-layer CNTK with GAP, achieves 77.43% classification accuracy on CIFAR-10. This results in a significant new benchmark for performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being 10% higher than methods reported by <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1g30j0qF7">Novak et al. (2019)</a>. The CNTKs also perform similarly to their CNN counterparts. This means that ultra-wide CNNs can achieve reasonable test performance on CIFAR-10.</p>

<p>It is also interesting to see that the global average pooling operation can significantly increase the classification accuracy for both CNNs and CNTKs. From this observation, we suspect that many techniques that improve the performance of neural networks are in some sense universal, i.e., these techniques might benefit kernel methods as well.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>

<p>Understanding the surprisingly good performance of over-parameterized deep neural networks is definitely a challenging theoretical question. Now, at least we have a better understanding of a class of ultra-wide neural networks: they are captured by neural tangent kernels! A hurdle that remains is that the classic generalization theory for kernels is still incapable of giving realistic bounds for generalization. But at least we now know that better understanding of kernels can lead to better understanding of deep nets.</p>

<p>Another fruitful direction is to “translate” different architectures/tricks of neural networks to kernels and to check their practical performance. We have found that global average pooling can significantly boost the performance of kernels, so we hope other tricks like batch normalization, dropout, max-pooling, etc. can also benefit kernels. Similarly, one can try to translate other architectures like recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, to kernels as well.</p>

<p>Our study also shows that there is a performance gap between infinitely wide networks and finite ones. How to explain this gap is an important theoretical question.</p></div>

As someone who reads a significant number of court documents and decisions (I still do expert witness work), I can recommend for your reading pleasure the <a href="https://admissionscase.harvard.edu/files/adm-case/files/2019-10-30_dkt_672_findings_of_fact_and_conclusions_of_law.pdf">very recent decision on the Harvard admissions case</a>.  For those who want a sense of how Harvard admissions works, you will get a good summary of the information that came out during the trial.  For those who want to see a well-written court decision, in my opinion, this is a good example.  (Whether you agree with the decision or not, you should find the decision well written;  it lays out the issues and challenges in determining the decision clearly, and similarly explains the reasons for the ultimate conclusion clearly.)  And for those who care about the actual underlying issues of discrimination and affirmative action, I think the document provides a lot of food for thought, with a depth beyond what you'll see in the  news coverage.</div>

<p>Maybe I should hope that people <em>never</em> learn to distinguish for themselves which claimed breakthroughs in building new forms of computation are obviously serious, and which ones are obviously silly.  For as long as they don’t, this blog will always serve at least one purpose.  People will cite it, tweet it, invoke its “authority,” even while from my point of view, I’m offering nothing more intellectually special than my toddler does when he calls out “moo-moo cow! baa-baa sheep!” as we pass them on the road.</p>



<p>But that’s too pessimistic.  Sure, most readers <em>must</em> more-or-less already know what I’ll say about each thing: that <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Google’s quantum supremacy claim</a> is serious, that <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2212">memcomputing to solve NP-complete problems</a> is not, etc.  Even so, I’ve heard from many readers that this blog was at least helpful for double-checking their initial impressions, and for making <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2410">common knowledge</a> what before had merely been known to many.  I’m fine for it to continue serving those roles.</p>



<p>Last week, even as I dealt with fallout from Google’s quantum supremacy leak, I also got several people asking me to comment on a <em>Nature</em> paper entitled <a href="https://www-nature-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/articles/s41586-019-1557-9">Integer factorization using stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions</a> (warning: paywalled).  See also <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q3/poor-mans-qubit-can-solve-quantum-problems-without-going-quantum.html">here</a> for a university press release.</p>



<p>The authors report building a new kind of computer based on asynchronously updated “p-bits” (probabilistic bits).  A p-bit is “a robust, classical entity fluctuating in time between 0 and 1, which interacts with other p-bits … using principles inspired by neural networks.”  They build a device with 8 p-bits, and use it to factor integers up to 945.  They present this as another “unconventional computation scheme” alongside quantum computing, and as a “potentially scalable hardware approach to the difficult problems of optimization and sampling.”</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02742-x">commentary accompanying the </a><em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02742-x">Nature</a></em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02742-x"> paper</a> goes much further still—claiming that the new factoring approach, “if improved, could threaten data encryption,” and that resources should now be diverted from quantum computing to this promising new idea, one with the advantages of requiring no refrigeration or maintenance of delicate entangled states.  (It should’ve added: and how big a number has Shor’s algorithm factored anyway, 21?  Compared to 945, that’s peanuts!)</p>



<p>Since I couldn’t figure out a gentler way to say this, here goes: it’s <strong>astounding</strong> that this paper and commentary made it into <em>Nature</em> in the form that they did.  Juxtaposing Google’s sampling achievement with p-bits, as several of my Facebook friends did last week, is juxtaposing the Wright brothers with some guy bouncing around on a pogo stick.</p>



<p>If you were looking forward to watching me dismantle the p-bit claims, I’m afraid you might be disappointed: the task is over almost the moment it begins.  <strong>“p-bit” devices can’t scalably outperform classical computers, for the simple reason that they <font color="red">are</font> classical computers.</strong>  A little unusual in their architecture, but still well-covered by the classical <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/bernays2.ppt">Extended Church-Turing Thesis</a>.  Just like with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation">quantum adiabatic algorithm</a>, an energy penalty is applied to coax the p-bits into running a local optimization algorithm: that is, making random local moves that preferentially decrease the number of violated constraints.  Except here, because the whole evolution is classical, there doesn’t seem to be even the <em>pretense</em> that anything is happening that a laptop with a random-number generator couldn’t straightforwardly simulate.  In terms of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/opinion/impeachment-trump-nixon.html">this editorial</a>, if adiabatic quantum computing is Richard Nixon—hiding its lack of observed speedups behind subtle arguments about tunneling and spectral gaps—then p-bit computing is Trump.</p>



<p>Even so, I wouldn’t be writing this post if you opened the paper and it immediately said, in effect, “look, <em>we know</em>.  You’re thinking that this is just yet another stochastic local optimization method, which could clearly be simulated efficiently on a conventional computer, thereby putting it into a different conceptual universe from quantum computing.  You’re thinking that factoring an n-bit integer will self-evidently take exp(n) time by this method, as compared to exp(n<sup>1/3</sup>) for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve">Number Field Sieve</a>, and that no crypto is in even remote danger from this.  But here’s why you should still be interested in our p-bit model: because of other advantages X, Y, and Z.”  Alas, in vain one searches the whole paper, <em>and</em> the lengthy supplementary material, <em>and</em> the commentary, for any acknowledgment of the pachyderm in the pagoda.  Not an asymptotic runtime scaling in sight.  Quantum computing is there, but stripped of the theoretical framework that gives it its purpose.</p>



<p>That silence, in the pages of <em>Nature</em>—<em>that’s</em> the part that convinced me that, while on the negative side this blog seems to have accomplished nothing for the world in 14 years of existence, on the positive side it will likely have a role for decades to come.</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> See a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342#comment-1820670">response in the comments</a>, which I appreciated, from Kerem Cansari (one of the authors of the paper), and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342#comment-1820674">my response to the response</a>.</p>



<p><strong>(Partly) Unrelated Announcement #1:</strong> My new postdoc, <a href="https://andrearocchetto.github.io/">Andrea Rocchetto</a>, had the neat idea of compiling a <a href="https://quantumfactsheet.github.io/">Quantum Computing Fact Sheet</a>: a quick “Cliffs Notes” for journalists, policymakers, and others looking to get the basics right.  The fact sheet might grow in the future, but in the meantime, check it out!  Or at a more popular level, try the <a href="https://quantumatlas.umd.edu/">Quantum Atlas</a> made by folks at the University of Maryland.</p>



<p><strong>Unrelated Announcement #2:</strong> Daniel Wichs asked me to give a shout-out to a new <a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/">Conference on Information-Theoretic Cryptography</a>, to be held June 17-19 in Boston.</p>



<p><strong>Third Announcement:</strong> Several friends asked me to share that <a href="https://peterwittek.com/">Prof. Peter Wittek</a>, quantum computing researcher at the University of Toronto, has <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-renowned-ai-expert-university-of-toronto-prof-missing-after-avalanche/?fbclid=IwAR0FTnzQxRL79-oo43xjKaNEA7Oe1rA8A2yVjvhrgodxG1wJzhfhJZt9oJw">gone missing</a> in the Himalayas.  Needless to say we hope for his safe return.</p></div>

<div class="content">
In this paper we prove two results about $AC^0[\oplus]$ circuits. 

We show that for $d(N) = o(\sqrt{\log N/\log \log N})$ and $N \leq s(N) \leq 2^{dN^{1/d^2}}$ there is an explicit family of functions $\{f_N:\{0,1\}^N\rightarrow \{0,1\}\}$ such that 
$f_N$ has uniform $AC^0$ formulas of depth $d$ and size at most $s$; 
$f_N$ does not have $AC^0[\oplus]$ formulas of depth $d$ and size $s^{\varepsilon}$, where $\varepsilon$ is a fixed absolute constant. 

This gives a quantitative improvement on the recent result of Limaye, Srinivasan, Sreenivasaiah, Tripathi, and Venkitesh, (STOC, 2019), which proved a similar Fixed-Depth Size-Hierarchy theorem but for $d \ll \log \log N$ and $s \ll \exp(N^{1/2^{\Omega(d)}})$. 

As in the previous result, we use the Coin Problem to prove our hierarchy theorem. Our main technical result is the construction of uniform size-optimal formulas for solving the coin problem with improved sample complexity $(1/\delta)^{d+4}$ (down from $(1/\delta)^{2^{O(d)}}$ in the previous result).

In our second result, we show that randomness buys depth in the $AC^0[\oplus]$ setting. Formally, we show that for any fixed constant $d\geq 2$, there is a family of Boolean functions that has polynomial-sized randomized uniform $AC^0$ circuits of depth $d$ but no polynomial-sized (deterministic) $AC^0[\oplus]$ circuits of depth $d$.

Previously Viola (Computational Complexity, 2014) showed that an increase in depth (by at least $2$) is essential to avoid superpolynomial blow-up while derandomizing randomized $AC^0$ circuits. We show that an increase in depth (by at least $1$) is essential even for $AC^0[\oplus]$. 

As in Viola's result, the separating examples are promise variants of the Majority function on $N$ inputs that accept inputs of weight at least $N/2 + N/(\log N)^{d-1}$ and reject inputs of weight at most $N/2 - N/(\log N)^{d-1}$.</div>

<p><em>[Guest post by Sid Banerjee.]</em></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Divergent Evolution: The formation of new species when populations experience different selective pressures.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>While the canonical example is Darwin’s finches, it could apply as well to matching theorists! A notable feature of the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/market2019-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first</a> and <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/market2019-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second</a> workshops at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/market2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simons Institute program on Matching Markets</a> was how researchers in Economics, Operations Research and TCS all share common antecedents (Fulkerson, Gale, Scarf, Shapley, Walras — to name but a few giants invoked regularly), and yet have taken the theory in  diverse directions. The workshops helped create a healthy dialogue between the communities, as everyone tries to understand each other’s objectives and techniques. </p>



<p>A more notable aspect of matching theory in recent years has been its  impact on the design of real-world marketplaces. Over the two workshops,  a mix of speakers from academia and industry covered a host of markets,  including <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">payment routing</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-127" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online advertising</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney exchange</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-estate</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">public housing</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/ridesharing-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ride-sharing</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/driving-efficiencies-freight-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-haul trucking</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/ratings-design-and-barriers-entry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restaurant reviews</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/tba-129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">school choice</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/unreasonable-effectiveness-artificial-currencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">food-banks</a> and many many others. A common theme that emerged was that online marketplaces, with the support of good algorithm and mechanism designers, are slowly taking over the economy.</p>



<p>And talking of giants of matching theory, another event held in parallel with the program was a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/richard-m-karp-distinguished-lecture-inaugural-lecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebration</a> of the achievements and contributions of Dick Karp, with Vijay Vazirani giving the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/rmklectures2019-fall-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inaugural lecture</a> of the Simons Institute Richard M. Karp Distinguished Lecture Series. Vijay’s talk touched on both the above themes, with a sweeping overview of three great threads in matching theory (stable matching, market equilibria, and online matching). He highlighted the critical role of algorithmic thinking in their development, and concluded with a tantalizing 40-year-old open problem connected to finding a polynomial-time algorithm for the Hylland-Zeckhauser market equilibrium. It is an excellent starting point for those interested in the program, or matching markets in general!</p></div>

<div class="content">
Richard Guy is a mathematician. He co-authored the classic book <i>Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays </i> with Elywn Berlekamp and John Conway.<br />
<br />
On Sept 30 (today) he turned 102. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_centenarians_(scientists_and_mathematicians)">this list </a> he is the oldest living mathematician, and he would need to live to 110 to be the oldest mathematician ever. <br />
<br />
I have met him twice. He was at the Gathering for Gardner Conference as a young 98-year old. I told him that his book Winning Ways had a great influence on me. He asked it if was positive or negative. I later saw him at a Math conference where he went to my talk on The Muffin Problem. So he is still active.<br />
<br />
His Wikipedia site says that he says he regards himself as an Amateur Mathematician. While it is awkward to disagree with how someone sees himself, I'll point out that he is an author or co-author of 11 books, has many papers, and has solved Erdos Problems. He has taught some but I couldn't really find out what his source of income is or was. This takes us back to the word `amateur' which has several meanings:<br />
<br />
Amateur: Someone who does X for the love of X (Amor is Love in Spanish), and not for money. This could be true of Richard Guy. This notion of amateur may be lost on my younger readers since this it used to be a thing to NOT take money since it somehow soils what you do. In those days Olympic athletes could not have played professionally beforehand.  We can't imagine that now.<br />
<br />
Amateur: Someone who dabbles in something but is not really that good. This could NOT be true of Richard Guy.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aside from games he has also worked in Number Theory. His book <i>Unsolved Problems in Number Theory </i> has inspired many (including me). <br />
<br />
So happy birthday Richard Guy!<br />
<br />
He is the also the oldest living person we have honored on this blog. Second oldest was Katherine Johnson, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/08/katherine-johnson-1918.html"></a> who is still alive.</div>

We consider the celebrated radio network model for abstracting communication in wireless networks. In this model, in any round, each node in the network may broadcast a message to all its neighbors. However, a node is able to hear a message broadcast by a neighbor only if no collision occurred, meaning that it was the only neighbor broadcasting. 


While the (noiseless) radio network model received a lot of attention over the last few decades, the effect of noise on radio networks is still not well understood. In this paper, we take a step forward and show that making radio network protocols resilient to noise may require a substantial performance overhead. Specifically, we  construct a multi-hop network and a communication protocol over this network that works in $T$ rounds when there is no noise. We prove that any scheme that simulates our protocol and is resilient to stochastic noise, requires $\Omega(T \log n)$ rounds. 

This stands in contrast to our previous result (STOC, 2018), showing that protocols over the single-hop (clique) network can be made noise resilient with only a constant overhead. Our result also settles a recent conjecture by Censor{-}Hillel, Haeupler, Hershkowitz, Zuzic (2018).

We complement the above result by giving a scheme to simulate any protocol with a fixed order of transmissions with only an $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ overhead.</div>

Andrew Booker is a mathematician at the University of Bristol, who works in analytic number theory. For example he has a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00603.pdf">paper</a> extending a result of Alan Turing on the Riemann zeta function. Yes our Turing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I will talk about his successful search for a solution to a 64 year old problem.</p>
<p>
He was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wymmCdLdPvM&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> on the search problem authored by Tim Browning and Brady Haran. The question was to find a solution to 	</p>

<p>Booker <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04284.pdf">found</a> 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+%288+866+128+975+287+528%29%5E%7B3%7D+-+%288+778+405+442+862+239%29%5E%7B3%7D+-+%282+736+111+468+807+040%29%5E%7B3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  33 = (8 866 128 975 287 528)^{3} - (8 778 405 442 862 239)^{3} - (2 736 111 468 807 040)^{3}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  33 = (8 866 128 975 287 528)^{3} - (8 778 405 442 862 239)^{3} - (2 736 111 468 807 040)^{3}. " /></p>
<p>The search was for all possible solutions with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" title="{x,y,z}" /> bounded by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%5E%7B16%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{10^{16}}" class="latex" title="{10^{16}}" />. Note that this is expensive, and is not even close to polynomial time in the number of bits. But it is feasible today thanks to modern technology: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The total computation used was approximately <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B23%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{23}" class="latex" title="{23}" /> core-years over one month of real time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Before we turn to our discussion, note that Booker’s paper on extending Turing is really a result on proof checking. Turing had great intuition, terrible that we lost him so early. He, Turing, essentially proved the first result ever on how to efficiently check a computation. Booker says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Turing introduced a method for certifying the completeness of a purported list of zeros of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z(t)}" class="latex" title="{Z(t)}" /> that is guaranteed to work (when the list is in fact complete). Turing’s method has remained a small but essential ingredient in all subsequent verifications of RH and its many generalizations. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is checking the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%28t%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z(t)}" class="latex" title="{Z(t)}" />.</p>
<p>
Speaking of checking, when I was drafting this I initially had the wrong solution: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++33+%3D+%288+866+128+975+287+528%29%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+%288+778+405+442+862+239%29%5E%7B3%7D+-+%282+736+111+468+807+040%29%5E%7B3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  33 = (8 866 128 975 287 528)^{3} + (8 778 405 442 862 239)^{3} - (2 736 111 468 807 040)^{3}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  33 = (8 866 128 975 287 528)^{3} + (8 778 405 442 862 239)^{3} - (2 736 111 468 807 040)^{3}. " /></p>
<p>which is <b>wrong</b>. Can you quickly see why this cannot be right? Answer at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Press </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The press love Booker’s result. Not the one on the zeta function, the one on the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{33}" class="latex" title="{33}" />.</p>
<p>
Part of the excitement is caused by the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{33}" class="latex" title="{33}" />. In complexity theory we rarely see explicit numbers—more likely to see expressions like 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++O%28n%5E%7B%5Clog_2+3%7D%28%5Clog+%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B3%7D%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  O(n^{\log_2 3}(\log \log n)^{3}) " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  O(n^{\log_2 3}(\log \log n)^{3}) " /></p>
<p>and worse. </p>
<p>
The press seem to like the numerology of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{33}" class="latex" title="{33}" />.

The press from <em>Newsweek</em> and other sites talked about Booker’s solution.

One <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/math-concepts/mathematician-has-just-cracked-33-problem.htm">said</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> To crunch the numbers, he then used a cluster of powerful computers – 512 central processing unit (CPU) cores at the same time – known as Blue Crystal Phase 3.

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> More Press </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The press love Booker’s result. Not the one on the zeta function, the one on the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{42}" class="latex" title="{42}" />. This search was jointly led by Andrew Sutherland of MIT.</p>
<p>
Part of the excitement is caused by the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{42}" class="latex" title="{42}" />. In complexity theory we rarely see explicit numbers—more likely to see expressions like 	</p>

<p>and worse. </p>
<p>
The press seem to like the numerology of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{42}" class="latex" title="{42}" />.

<ul>
<li>
The atomic number of molybdenum. <p></p>
</li><li>
It was the code for international direct-dial phone calls to Czechoslovakia, until the “velvet divorce” split the codes into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B420%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{420}" class="latex" title="{420}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B421%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{421}" class="latex" title="{421}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
It was Jackie Robinson’s old jersey number. Major League Baseball retired the number for all teams. The last player allowed to wear it was Mariano Rivera of the Yankees, himself a Hall-of-Famer, except that all players on all teams wear it on April 15. Rivera is nicknamed “Mo” which is the symbol for molybdenum—are we the first to notice this coincidence?<p></p>

But <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/search?q[s]=42&amp;q[sort]=newest">here</a> the <em>Quanta</em> magazine seems not to have mentioned the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{42}" class="latex" title="{42}" /> at all in over three months:</p>

I hope we will get the same coverage for our big results. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Less Press </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Booker and Sutherland also <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2216941-mathematicians-find-a-completely-new-way-to-write-the-number-3/">discovered</a> that </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++569936821221962380720%5E3+-+569936821113563493509%5E3+-+472715493453327032%5E3+%3D+3.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  569936821221962380720^3 - 569936821113563493509^3 - 472715493453327032^3 = 3.

<p>This is the next-largest solution after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%3D+1%5E3+%2B+1%5E3+%2B+1%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3}" class="latex" title="{3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3+%3D+4%5E3+%2B+4%5E3+%2B+%28-5%29%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3 = 4^3 + 4^3 + (-5)^3}" class="latex" title="{3 = 4^3 + 4^3 + (-5)^3}" />. Weird. And the first solution not to duplicate a number. And it uses two numbers that agree to markedly more decimal places than those in the above solutions for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{33}" class="latex" title="{33}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B42%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{42}" class="latex" title="{42}" />. Weirder.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Smart Search </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Booker wanted to search for a solution to 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++k+%3D+x%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+y%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+z%5E%7B3%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  k = x^{3} + y^{3} + z^{3}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  k = x^{3} + y^{3} + z^{3}. " /></p>
<p>Actually his main interest was in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3D33%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k=33}" class="latex" title="{k=33}" />, but his method is general. How does one do this for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%2Cz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y,z}" class="latex" title="{x,y,z}" /> bounded by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB+%3D+10%5E%7B16%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B = 10^{16}}" class="latex" title="{B = 10^{16}}" />. The obvious method is: Try all numbers below <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />. </p>
<p>
This is too expensive and requires <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28B%5E%7B3%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\widetilde{O}(B^{3})}" class="latex" title="{\widetilde{O}(B^{3})}" /> time. Too much, even with a cluster of fast processors.</p>
<p>
An improvement is to try all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y}" class="latex" title="{x,y}" /> in the range and then check that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-x%5E%7B3%7D-y%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k-x^{3}-y^{3}}" class="latex" title="{k-x^{3}-y^{3}}" /> is cube. This runs in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28B%5E%7B2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\widetilde{O}(B^{2})}" class="latex" title="{\widetilde{O}(B^{2})}" /> time. Still too much.</p>
<p>
A key insight is to re-write the equation as 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++k+-z%5E%7B3%7D+%3D+x%5E%7B3%7D+%2B+y%5E%7B3%7D+%3D+%28x+%2B+y%29%28x%5E%7B2%7D+-+xy+%2B+y%5E%7B2%7D%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  k -z^{3} = x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  k -z^{3} = x^{3} + y^{3} = (x + y)(x^{2} - xy + y^{2}). " /></p>
<p>Then we note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x+y}" class="latex" title="{x+y}" /> must be a divisor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-z%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k-z^{3}}" class="latex" title="{k-z^{3}}" />. Since there are few such divisors, we can improve the time greatly. For the divisors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk-z%5E%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k-z^{3}}" class="latex" title="{k-z^{3}}" /> some simple algebra and the quadratic formula shows that 	</p>

<p>and 	</p>

" class="latex" title="\displaystyle  y = \frac{d}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{4|k-z^{3}| - d^{3}}{3d}}. " /></p>
<p>This shows that the search is now reduced to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BO%7D%28B%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\widetilde{O}(B)}" class="latex" title="{\widetilde{O}(B)}" />. Still too much, but close to doable. The next trick is to avoid the factoring step. See Booker’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04284.pdf">paper</a> for the rest of the search description. </p>

In quantum computational complexity theory, the class QMA models the set of problems efficiently verifiable by a quantum computer the same way that NP models this for classical computation. Vyalyi proved that if $\text{QMA}=\text{PP}$ then $\text{PH}\subseteq \text{QMA}$. In this note, we give a simple, self-contained proof of the theorem, using only the closure properties of the complexity classes in the theorem statement. We then extend the theorem in two directions: (i) we strengthen the consequent, proving that if $\text{QMA}=\text{PP}$ then $\text{QMA}=\text{PH}^{\text{PP}}$, and (ii) we weaken the hypothesis, proving that if $\text{QMA}=\text{coQMA}$ then $\text{PH}\subseteq \text{QMA}$. Lastly, we show that all the above results hold, without loss of generality, for the class QAM instead of QMA. We also formulate a ``Quantum Toda's Conjecture''.</div>

<p>I have prepared this talk which is a little unusual and is in part historical and speculative. You can view the slides <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/talks/lower-bounds-201909.pdf">here</a>. I am scheduled to give it in about three hours at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/cs/algorithms-and-theory-seminar/">Boston University</a>. And because it’s just another day in the greater Boston area, while I’ll be talking my ex office-mate <span class="field-content">Vitaly Feldman</span> will be speaking <a href="https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/toc-seminar">at Harvard University</a>.  His talk looks quite interesting and attempts to explain why overfitting is actually necessary for good learning. As for mine, well you’ll have to come and see or take a peek at the slides.</p></div>

Let $p \ge 2$. We improve the bound $\frac{\|f\|_p}{\|f\|_2} \le (p-1)^{s/2}$ for a polynomial $f$ of degree $s$ on the boolean cube $\{0,1\}^n$, which comes from hypercontractivity, replacing the right hand side of this inequality by an explicit bivariate function of $p$ and $s$, which is smaller than $(p-1)^{s/2}$ for any $p &gt; 2$ and $s &gt; 0$. We show the new bound to be tight, within a smaller order factor, for the Krawchouk polynomial of degree $s$.

This implies several nearly-extremal properties of Krawchouk polynomials and Hamming spheres (equivalently, Hamming balls). In particular, Krawchouk polynomials have (almost) the heaviest tails among all polynomials of the same degree and $\ell_2$ norm (this has to be interpreted with some care). The Hamming spheres have the following approximate edge-isoperimetric property: For all $1 \le s \le \frac{n}{2}$, and for all even distances $0 \le i \le \frac{2s(n-s)}{n}$, the Hamming sphere of radius $s$ contains, up to a multiplicative factor of $O(i)$, as many pairs of points at distance $i$ as possible, among sets of the same size (there is a similar, but slightly weaker and somewhat more complicated claim for general distances). This also implies that Hamming spheres are (almost) stablest with respect to noise among sets of the same size. In coding theory terms this means that a Hamming sphere (equivalently a Hamming ball) has the maximal probability of undetected error, among all binary codes of the same rate.

We also describe a family of hypercontractive inequalities for functions on $\{0,1\}^n$, which improve on the `usual' ``$q \rightarrow 2$" inequality by taking into account the concentration of a function (expressed as the ratio between its $\ell_r$ norms), and which are nearly tight for characteristic functions of Hamming spheres.</div>

The concept of matrix rigidity was first introduced by Valiant in [Val77].  Roughly speaking, a matrix is rigid if its rank cannot be reduced significantly by changing a small number of entries.  There has been extensive interest in rigid matrices as Valiant showed  that rigidity can be used to prove arithmetic circuit lower bounds.  

In a surprising result, Alman and Williams showed that the (real valued) Hadamard matrix, which was conjectured  to be rigid, is actually not very rigid. This line of work was extended by [DE17] to a family of matrices related to the Hadamard matrix, but over finite fields.  In our work, we take another step in this direction and show that for any abelian group $G$ and function $f:G \rightarrow \mathbb C$, the matrix given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y \in G$ is not rigid.  In particular, we get that complex valued Fourier matrices, circulant matrices, and Toeplitz matrices are all not rigid and cannot be used to carry out Valiant's approach to proving circuit lower bounds. This complements a recent result of Goldreich and Tal  who showed that Toeplitz matrices are nontrivially rigid (but not enough for Valiant's method).  Our work differs  from previous non-rigidity results in that those works considered matrices whose underlying group of symmetries was of the form ${\mathbb F}_p^n$ with $p$ fixed and $n$ tending to infinity, while in the families  of matrices we study, the underlying group of symmetries can be any abelian group and, in particular,  the cyclic group ${\mathbb Z}_N$, which has very different structure. Our results also suggest natural new candidates for rigidity in the form of matrices whose symmetry groups are highly non-abelian. We are also able to extend these results to matrices with entries in a finite field, assuming sufficiently large dimension.

Our proof has four parts. The first extends the results of [AW16,DE17]  to generalized Hadamard matrices over the complex numbers via a new proof technique. The second part handles the $N \times N$ Fourier matrix when $N$ has a particularly nice factorization that allows us to embed smaller copies of (generalized) Hadamard matrices inside of it. The third part uses results from number theory to bootstrap the non-rigidity for these special values of $N$ and extend to all sufficiently large $N$.  The fourth and final part involves using the non-rigidity of the Fourier matrix to show that the group algebra matrix, given by $M_{xy} = f(x - y)$ for $x,y \in G$, is not rigid for any function $f$ and abelian group $G$.</div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: A sunflower with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> petals is a collection of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> sets so that the intersection of each pair is equal to the intersection of all. Erdos and Rado in 1960 proved the sunflower lemma: for any fixed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" />, any family of sets of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="w" class="latex" title="w" />, with at least about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%5Ew&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="w^w" class="latex" title="w^w" /> sets, must contain a sunflower. The famous sunflower conjecture is that the bound on the number of sets can be improved to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5Ew&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="c^w" class="latex" title="c^w" /> for some constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="c" class="latex" title="c" />. Despite much research, the best bounds until recently were all of the order of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%5E%7Bcw%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="w^{cw}" class="latex" title="w^{cw}" /> for some constant c. In this work, we improve the bounds to about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Clog+w%29%5Ew&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="(\log w)^w" class="latex" title="(\log w)^w" />.</p>
<p>There are two main ideas that underlie our result. The first is a structure vs pseudo-randomness paradigm, a commonly used paradigm in combinatorics. This allows us to either exploit structure in the given family of sets, or otherwise to assume that it is pseudo-random in a certain way. The second is a duality between families of sets and DNFs (Disjunctive Normal Forms). DNFs are widely studied in theoretical computer science. One of the central results about them is the switching lemma, which shows that DNFs simplify under random restriction. We show that when restricted to pseudo-random DNFs, much milder random restrictions are sufficient to simplify their structure.</p>
