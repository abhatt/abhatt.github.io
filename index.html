<p>We have…I don’t know, I’ve lost count of the number of papers this month. It’s a big bonanza. Sublinear algorithms for edit distance, planar graphs, distributions, bipartite graphs, groups, error correcting codes, Bayesian nets, polynomials…</p>



<p>Let’s proceed with the spread.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Sublinear-Time Edit Distance for Preprocessed Strings</strong> by Karl Bringmann, Alejandro Cassis, Nick Fischer, and Vasileios Nakos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14137">arXiv</a>). The edit distance between strings is a classic and important problem in algorithms. You might recall that classic \(O(n^2)\) algorithm to compute the edit distance between strings of length \(n\). It has been show that getting a \(O(n^{2-\delta})\) time algorithm is SETH-hard. But what can be done in sublinear time? This paper considers the preprocessed version: suppose we can perform near-linear preprocessing on the strings. We now want to distinguish between edit distance between \(\leq k\) and \(\geq k\cdot n^{o(1)}\). This paper shows that with near-linear preprocessing on strings, one can solve this problem in \(k \cdot n^{o(1)}\) time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Closeness Testing of Discrete Distributions Made <s>Complex</s> Simple</strong> by (our own) Clément L. Canonne and Yucheng Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12640">arXiv</a>). Given two distributions \(p, q\) over support \([k]\), the aim is to distinguish between (i) the distributions being equal, and (ii) the total variation distance between \(p, q\) being at least \(\epsilon\). The tester should has a failure probability of at most \(\delta\). A recent work nails down the sample complexity with respect to all parameters. This paper gives a simpler proof of the main result. Earlier proofs used Poissonization tricks and fairly clever arguments about Poisson random variables. This proof is much more transparent, and uses an identity that relates the expectation of a random variable to its characteristic function. A nice feature of this proof is that it works directly with the multinomial distribution, which means a fixed number of samples (rather than choosing the number of samples from a distribution).</p>



<p><strong>Tolerant Bipartiteness Testing in Dense Graphs</strong> by Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, Rahul Raychaudhury, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12397">arXiv</a>). Testing bipartiteness of dense graphs is about as a classic as it gets. We wish to distinguish a bipartite graph from one that requires \(\varepsilon n^2\) edge removals to make it bipartite. Readers of this blog should know that there is a \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})\)-query property tester for this problem. (Ok, so now you know.) This paper studies the tolerant version of bipartiteness testing. Note that this is equivalent to approximating the maxcut, up to additive error \(\varepsilon n^2\). Classic approximation algorithms show that the latter can be done in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-6})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}))\) time. This paper considers the easier problem of distinguishing whether the distance to bipartiteness is at most \(\varepsilon\) or at least \(2 \varepsilon\). This problem is solved in \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})\) queries and \(\exp(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}))\). </p>



<p><strong>Properly learning monotone functions via local reconstruction</strong> by Jane Lange, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11894">arXiv</a>). Ah yes, monotone functions. An ongoing love (obsession? interest?) for property testing people. This paper studies the problem of proper learning of Boolean valued monotone functions over the Boolean hypercube. Given access to uniform random evaluations of a monotone function \(f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\), we wish to compute a monotone function \(g\) that approximates the original function. Classic results from Fourier analysis show that an approximation  can be learned using \(\exp(\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon)\) queries. But this approximation function might not be monotone, and only yields improper learning. This paper gives a proper learner that outputs a monotone approximation, in roughly the same query complexity. This result directly gives a constant tolerance monotonicity tester for Boolean functions. The paper uses recent results from distributed algorithms and local computation. It also leads to tolerant testers for monotonicity over posets with small diameter.</p>



<p><strong>Massively Parallel Computation and Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Embedded Planar Graphs</strong> by Jacob Holm and Jakub Tětek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09035">arXiv</a>). Sublinear algorithms for planar graphs is another ongoing love (at least for me). This paper considers a new take of this problem: suppose we have access to a geometric embedding of a planar graph \(G\). Can we get sublinear algorithms for a variety of problems? This paper first shows how to construct a convenient decomposition, called an \(r\)-division, in sublinear time. This division can be used to approximate Lipschitz graph parameters, such as maximum matching sizes, maximum independent set, etc. The paper also shows how to compute an \(r\)-division in the MPC model, which solves many classic graph  problems (connected components, matchings, etc.) in \(O(1)\) rounds. There is a (conditional) lower bound showing that, without an embedding, it is not possible to solve such problems in \(O(1)\) rounds (and sublinear space per processor).</p>



<p><strong>Independence Testing for Bounded Degree Bayesian Network</strong> by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Clément L. Canonne (again, our own), and Joy Qiping Yang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08690">arXiv</a>). Given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) on the Boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\), the problem is to determine whether \(\mathcal{P}\) is a product distribution. In general, this problem requires \(\Omega(2^n)\) samples. Suppose \(\mathcal{P}\) has a sparse, “efficient” description. Can we do better? This paper shows that when \(\mathcal{P}\) is generated by a Bayesian network (with bounded indegree), then the independence testing problem can be solved with a \(\widetilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)\) samples. Think of a Bayesian network as a DAG, where each vertex generates a Bernoulli random variable. The variable at a vertex depends only the outcomes at its neighborhood.</p>



<p><strong>Low Degree Testing over the Reals </strong>by Vipul Arora, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Noah Fleming, Esty Kelman, and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08404">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/051/">ECCC</a>). The problem testing low degree polynomials goes back to the birth of property testing. This paper studies real valued polynomials, in the distribution free setting. Formally, we have query access to a function \(f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\). The distance is measured with respect to an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the domain. This paper shows that the real low degree testing problem can be solved in \(poly(d\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries (under some reasonableness conditions on the distribution). The approach is go to via the “self-correct and test” approach: try to compute a low degree polynomial that fits some sampled data, and then check how far the self-corrected version is from another sample.</p>



<p><strong>Testing distributional assumptions of learning algorithms</strong> by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07196.pdf">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of learning a halfspace over \(\mathbb{R}^n\). If the underlying distribution is Gaussian, then this class can be learned in \(n^{poly(\varepsilon^{-1})}\) samples. If the distribution is arbitrary, no \(2^{o(n)}\) algorithm is known despite much research. This paper introduces the notion of having a <em>tester-learner</em> pair. The tester first checks if the input distribution is “well-behaved” (Gaussian-like). If the tester passes, then we run the learner. Indeed, this perspective goes back to some of the original motivations for property testing (when is testing faster than learning). The intriguing aspect of this problem is that we do not have efficient testers for determining if an input distribution is Gaussian. This paper circumvents that problem by estimating certain moments of the distribution. If these moments agree with the moments of a Gaussian, then the learner is guaranteed to succeed. We get the best of both worlds: if the input distribution is Gaussian, the learning is done correctly. If the learner succeeds, then then output (hypothesis) is guaranteed to be correct, regardless of the input distribution.</p>



<p><strong>Testability in group theory</strong> by Oren Becker, Alexander Lubotzky, and Jonathan Mosheiff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04539">arXiv</a>). This paper is the journal version of a result of the authors, and it gives a group theoretic presentation of a property testing result. Consider the following problem. The input is a pair permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2)\) over \([n]\). The aim is to test whether they commute: \(\sigma_1 \sigma_2 = \sigma_2 \sigma_1\). Another result of the authors gives a tester that makes \(O(\varepsilon^{-1})\) queries. They refer to this problem as “testing the relation” \(XY = YX\). This paper gives a grand generalization of that result, best explained by another example. Consider another relation/property denoted \(\{XZ = ZX, YZ = ZY\}\). This property consists of all triples of permutations \((\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3)\), where \(\sigma_3\) commutes with the other two. A consequence of the main theorem is that this property is not testable with query complexity independent of \(n\). The main result of this paper is a characterization of testable relations, which goes via studying the expansion of an infinite graph associated with the relation.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Positive Semidefiniteness Using Linear Measurements</strong> by Deanna Needell, William Swartworth, and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03782">arXiv</a>). The input is a \(d \times d\) real, symmetric matrix \(M\) and we wish to determine if it is positive semidefinite (all eigenvalues are positive). For the testing problem, we reject when the minimum eigenvalue is at most \(-\varepsilon \|M\|_2\). (The paper also considers general Schatten \(p\)-norms.) This paper gives a list of results for non-adaptive vs adaptive, and one-sided vs two-sided testers. There are two access models considered: a single query consists of either a (i) matrix-vector product \(Mx\) or (ii) vector-matrix-vector product \(y^TMx\). Typical models that query entries of the matrix require strong bounds on the entries, which is less reasonable in practical situations. An interesting discovery is that the non-adaptive, one-sided complexity is \(\Theta(\sqrt{d}\varepsilon^{-1})\) while the two-sided bound is independent of \(d\).</p>



<p><strong>Relaxed Locally Decodable and Correctable Codes: Beyond Tensoring</strong> by Gil Cohen and Tal Yankovitz (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/045/">ECCC</a>). Locally decodable and correctable codes are a fundamental object of study in property testing (and TCS in general). Consider a locally correctable code (LCC). Given a string \(x\), the decoder/corrector makes \(q\) queries to \(x\), and outputs a symbol. We can think of the output collectively as a string \(y\). If \(x\) is a codeword, then \(y = x\). Otherwise, \(dist(y,z) \leq \varepsilon\), where \(z\) is some codeword close to \(x\). In the relaxed version, the corrector is allowed to output \(\bot\), denoting that it has discovered corruption. The distance is only measured in the coordinates where the corrector does not output \(\bot\). Thus, the corrector gets a “free pass” if it outputs \(\bot\). But note that when \(x\) is a codeword, the output must be exactly \(x\). This paper gives a Relaxed LCC with query complexity \((\log n)^{O(\log\log\log n)}\), a significant improvement over the previous best \((\log n)^{O(\log\log n)}\). It is know from previous work that the query complexity must be \(\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})\).</p>



<p><strong>Verifying The Unseen: Interactive Proofs for Label-Invariant Distribution Properties</strong> by Tal Herman and Guy Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/052/">arXiv</a>). This paper considers the distribution testing problem in the context of interactive proofs. The verifier, who wishes to test a property of a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\), interacts with a prover who knows the distribution. The guarantee required is the standard one for interactive proof systems: in the YES case, an honest prover should be able to convince the verifier. In the NO case, no prover can convince the verifier with high probability. There are two important parameters of interest: the sample complexity of the verifier, and the communication complexity of the messages. It is useful to consider the two extremes. In one extreme, the verifier can simply solve the problem herself, ignoring the prover. This could require \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) queries (for the hardest properties like entropy and support size). Another extreme is for the honest prover to simply send an approximate description of the distribution, which takes \(O(n)\) bits. The prover can just test equality to the prover message, which only takes \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\) queries. This paper shows a 2-round protocol for any (label-invariant) property where both the communication and the sample complexity can be made \(\Theta(\sqrt{n})\). This result shows the power of interaction for distribution testing problems.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Since the late 19th century, mathematicians have realized the importance and generality of selection problems: given a collection of sets, select an element in each set, possibly in a “nice” way. Of particular importance in computer science is the scenario where the ground set is a metric space, in which case it is natural to ask for <strong>Lipschitz</strong> selection. In this talk I will describe a far-reaching extension of this classical Lipschitz selection problem to an *online* setting, where sets are streaming to the selector. I will show how Riemannian gradient descent (aka mirror descent) can be used to approach this type of problems. I will illustrate the power of the framework by solving a long-standing problem in online shortest path known as layered graph traversal (introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis in 1989).</p>

L \leq k^n$, such that every substring of length $n$ appears at most once.
Etzion [Theor. Comp. Sci 44 (1986)] gives an algorithm to construct binary
cut-down de Bruijn sequences that requires $o(n)$ simple $n$-bit operations per
symbol generated. In this paper, we simplify the algorithm and improve the
running time to $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time per symbol generated using
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ space. We then provide the first successor-rule approach for
constructing a binary cut-down de Bruijn sequence by leveraging recent ranking
algorithms for fixed-density Lyndon words. Finally, we develop an algorithm to
generate cut-down de Bruijn sequences for $k&gt;2$ that runs in $\mathcal{O}(n)$
time per symbol using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space after some initialization. While
our $k$-ary algorithm is based on our simplified version of Etzion's binary
algorithm, a number of non-trivial adaptations are required to generalize to
larger alphabets.

for the generalized Stanley inequality. We also establish several new
inequalities on order polynomials, and prove an asymptotic version of Graham's
inequality.

integration, which advocates a multi-perspective approach permitting reasoning
with a selection of diverse and possibly conflicting standpoints rather than
forcing their unification. In this paper, we introduce nested sequent calculi
for propositional standpoint logics--proof systems that manipulate trees whose
nodes are multisets of formulae--and show how to automate standpoint reasoning
by means of non-deterministic proof-search algorithms. To obtain worst-case
complexity-optimal proof-search, we introduce a novel technique in the context
of nested sequents, referred to as "coloring," which consists of taking a
formula as input, guessing a certain coloring of its subformulae, and then
running proof-search in a nested sequent calculus on the colored input. Our
technique lets us decide the validity of standpoint formulae in CoNP since
proof-search only produces a partial proof relative to each permitted coloring
of the input. We show how all partial proofs can be fused together to construct
a complete proof when the input is valid, and how certain partial proofs can be
transformed into a counter-model when the input is invalid. These
"certificates" (i.e. proofs and counter-models) serve as explanations of the
(in)validity of the input.

propose an algorithm that given a graph $G$ and an integer $d$, either finds an
elimination forest of $G$ of depth at most $d$ or concludes that no such forest
exists; thus the algorithm decides whether the treedepth of $G$ is at most $d$.
The running time is $2^{O(d^2)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$ and the space usage is
polynomial in $n$. Further, by allowing randomization, the time and space
complexities can be improved to $2^{O(d^2)}\cdot n$ and $d^{O(1)}\cdot n$,
respectively. This improves upon the algorithm of Reidl et al. [ICALP 2014],
which also has time complexity $2^{O(d^2)}\cdot n$, but uses exponential space.

applications. This paper considers scheduling coflows with precedence
constraints in identical parallel networks, such as to minimize the total
weighted completion time of coflows. The identical parallel network is an
architecture based on multiple network cores running in parallel. In the
divisible coflow scheduling problem, the proposed algorithm achieves
$(6-\frac{2}{m})\mu$ and $(5-\frac{2}{m})\mu$ approximate ratios for arbitrary
release time and zero release time, respectively, where $m$ is the number of
network cores and $\mu$ is the coflow number of the longest path in the
precedence graph. In the indivisible coflow scheduling problem, the proposed
algorithm achieves $(7-\frac{2}{m})\mu$ and $(6-\frac{2}{m})\mu$ approximate
ratios for arbitrary release time and zero release time, respectively. In the
single network core scheduling problem, we propose a $5\mu$-approximation
algorithm with arbitrary release times, and a $4\mu$-approximation without
release time. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be modified to solve the
coflows of multi-stage jobs scheduling problem. In multi-stage jobs, coflow is
transferred between servers to enable starting of next stage. This means that
there are precedence constraints between coflows of job. Our result represents
an improvement upon the previous best approximation ratio of $O(\tilde{\mu}
\log(N)/ \log(\log(N)))$ where $\tilde{\mu}$ is the maximum number of coflows
in a job and $N$ is the number of servers.

functions: \[ \text{Maj}_n = h(g_1,\ldots,g_m), \] where each $g_j :\{0,1\}^{n}
\to \{0,1\}$ is an arbitrary function that queries only $k \ll n$ variables and
$h : \{0,1\}^m \to \{0,1\}$ is an arbitrary combining function. We prove an
optimal lower bound of \[ m \ge \Omega\left( \frac{n}{k} \log k \right) \] on
the number of functions needed, which is a factor $\Omega(\log k)$ larger than
the ideal $m = n/k$. We call this factor the composition overhead; previously,
no superconstant lower bounds on it were known for majority.
</p>
<p>Our lower bound recovers, as a corollary and via an entirely different proof,
the best known lower bound for bounded-width branching programs for majority
(Alon and Maass '86, Babai et al. '90). It is also the first step in a plan
that we propose for breaking a longstanding barrier in lower bounds for
small-depth boolean circuits.
</p>
<p>Novel aspects of our proof include sharp bounds on the information lost as
computation flows through the inner functions $g_j$, and the bootstrapping of
lower bounds for a multi-output function (Hamming weight) into lower bounds for
a single-output one (majority).

non-simultaneously released jobs on a group of $m$ unrelated parallel machines
so as to minimize maximum job completion time, the makespan. In the scheduling
literature, the problem is commonly considered to be solvable in polynomial
time by linear programming (LP) techniques proposed in Lawler and Labetoulle
\cite{ll78}. The authors in \cite{ll78} give a LP formulation of the version
with simultaneously released jobs and show how an optimal solution to this LP
can be used to construct an optimal schedule to the latter problem. As the
current study shows, for non-simultaneously released jobs, unlikely, there
exist a linear program such that a schedule with the minimum makespan can be
constructed based on an optimal LP solution. We also prove that, in case no
splitting of the same job on a machine is allowed (i.e., job part assigned to a
machine is to be processed without an interruption on that machine), the
problem is NP-hard. As a side result, we obtain that, whenever job splitting is
not allowed, given an optimal LP solution, it is NP-hard to find an optimal
schedule with the minimum makespan that agrees with that LP solution. We also
extend the schedule construction procedure based on an optimal LP solution from
Lawler and Labetoulle \cite{ll78} for non-simultaneously released jobs. The
extended procedure, among all feasible schedules that agree with any feasible
(not necessarily optimal) LP solution, generates one with the minimum makespan.
Such procedure is helpful, in particular, because, as we show, there may exist
no optimal schedule that agrees with an optimal LP solution if jobs are
non-simultaneously released.

In a breakthrough result, Ta-Shma described an explicit construction of an almost optimal binary code (STOC 2017).  Ta-Shma's code has distance $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ and rate $\Omega\bigl(\varepsilon^{2+o(1)}\bigr)$ and thus it almost achieves the Gilbert-Varshamov bound, except for the $o(1)$ term in the exponent.  The prior best list-decoding algorithm for (a variant of) Ta-Shma's code achieves is due to Alev et al (STOC 2021).  This algorithm makes use of SDP hierarchies, and is able to recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2^{\log(1/\varepsilon)^{1/6}}$.  In this work we give an improved analysis of a similar list-decoding algorithm.  Our algorithm works for Ta-Shma's original code, and it is able to list-decode almost all the way to the Johnson bound: it can recover from a $\frac{1-\rho}{2}-$fraction of errors as long as $\rho\geq2\sqrt{\varepsilon}$.</div>

Hrube\v{s} and Wigderson (2015) initiated the complexity-theoretic study of noncommutative formulas with inverse gates. They introduced the Rational Identity Testing (RIT) problem which is to decide whether a noncommutative rational formula computes zero in the free skew field. In the white-box setting, deterministic polynomial-time algorithms are known for this problem following the works of Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016) and Ivanyos, Qiao, and Subrahmanyam (2018).

A central open problem in this area is to design an efficient deterministic black-box identity testing algorithm for rational formulas. In this paper, we solve this problem for the first nested inverse case. More precisely, we obtain a deterministic quasipolynomial-time black-box RIT algorithm for noncommutative rational formulas of inversion height two via a hitting set construction. Several new technical ideas are involved in the hitting set construction, including key concepts from matrix coefficient realization theory (Vol?i?, 2018) and properties of cyclic division algebra (Lam, 2001). En route to the proof, an important step is to embed the hitting set of Forbes and Shpilka for noncommutative formulas (2013) inside a cyclic division algebra of small index.</div>

<div class="content">
A Boolean maximum constraint satisfaction problem, Max-CSP\((f)\), is specified by a predicate \(f:\{-1,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}\). An \(n\)-variable instance of Max-CSP\((f)\) consists of a list of constraints, each of which applies \(f\) to \(k\) distinct literals drawn from the \(n\) variables. For \(k=2\), Chou, Golovnev, and Velusamy [CGV20, FOCS 2020] obtained explicit ratios characterizing the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming approximability of every predicate. For \(k \geq 3\), Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy [CGSV21, arXiv:2102.12351] proved a general dichotomy theorem for \(\sqrt n\)-space sketching algorithms: For every \(f\), there exists \(\alpha(f)\in (0,1]\) such that for every \(\epsilon&gt;0\), Max-CSP\((f)\) is \((\alpha(f)-\epsilon)\)-approximable by an \(O(\log n)\)-space linear sketching algorithm, but \((\alpha(f)+\epsilon)\)-approximation sketching algorithms require \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) space.
     
In this work, we give closed-form expressions for the sketching approximation ratios of multiple families of symmetric Boolean functions. Letting \(\alpha'_k = 2^{-(k-1)} (1-k^{-2})^{(k-1)/2}\), we show that for odd \(k \geq 3\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = \alpha'_k\), and for even \(k \geq 2\), \(\alpha(k\)AND\()\, = 2\alpha'_{k+1}\). Thus, for every \(k\), \(k\)AND can be \((2-o(1))2^{-k}\)-approximated by \(O(\log n)\)-space sketching algorithms; we contrast this with a lower bound of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, Velingker, and Velusamy [STOC 2022] implying that streaming \((2+\epsilon)\cdot2^{-k}\)-approximations require \(\Omega(n)\) space! We also resolve the ratio for the "at-least-\((k-1)\)-\(1\)'s" function for all even \(k\); the "exactly-\(\frac{k+1}2\)-\(1\)'s" function for odd \(k \in \{3,\ldots,51\}\); and fifteen other functions. We stress here that for general \(f\), the dichotomy theorem in [CGSV21] only implies that \(\alpha(f)\) can be computed to arbitrary precision in \(\textbf{PSPACE}\), and thus closed-form expressions need not have existed a priori. Our analyses involve identifying and exploiting structural "saddle-point" properties of this dichotomy.
    
Separately, for all threshold functions, we give optimal "bias-based" approximation algorithms generalizing [CGV20] while simplifying [CGSV21]. Finally, we investigate the \(\sqrt n\)-space streaming lower bounds in [CGSV21], and show that they are incomplete for \(3\)AND, i.e., they fail to rule out \((\alpha(3\)AND\()-\epsilon)\)-approximations in \(o(\sqrt n)\) space.</div>

<i>Retire from your job, but never retire your mind.</i></p>
<p>
Bob Sedgewick is becoming an <a href="https://dof.princeton.edu/book/export/html/5486">emeritus</a> professor: </p>
<p>
When Faculty transfer to emeritus status and retain a professional connection with Princeton, they are expected to conduct their future research and University-related activities with the same ethical standards currently expected from all Princeton Faculty. </p>
<p>
Emeritus faculty members may receive such University publications as the Princeton University Bulletin and the Princeton Alumni Weekly, as well as agendas and minutes of University Faculty Meetings. They may attend meetings of the University and departmental faculty upon invitation, but do not have votes at these meetings. Emeritus faculty members continue to receive University identification cards and to have use of the library, the athletic facilities and dining facilities on the same basis as active faculty members. </p>
<p>
A not so recent picture: <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/rs/"><img width="218" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rs.jpg?resize=218%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19971" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Some History </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Sedgewick got his PhD at Stanford and returned to Brown to start his academic career as an assistant professor in 1975. He was promoted to associate professor in 1980 and full professor in 1983. At Brown, he <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/events/25th-anniversary/hist_text.html">participated</a> in the <a href="https://news.brown.edu/articles/2014/05/cs35#:~:text=This year marks the 35th,Digital VAX-11/80.">founding</a> of the computer science department, in 1979. </p>
<p>
Later in 1985 he joined the faculty at Princeton as <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/05/03/sedgewick-recognized-contribution-computer-science-education">founding</a> chair of the Department of Computer Science. Two founding positions—pretty neat. His first-year courses in computer science are among the most popular ever offered at Princeton. He also pioneered the practice of replacing large live lectures with on-demand online videos—pretty clever. </p>
<p>
Bob has worked at research institutions outside of Princeton during summers and leaves. Three come to mind: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://idaccr.org/about-us">IDA</a>, the Institute for Defense Analyses, gave him an opportunity to work with the CRAY-1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">supercomputer</a>.
</li><li> <a href="https://www.parc.com">PARC</a>, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, gave him an opportunity to see the personal computer come into existence.
</li><li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation">INRIA</a>, The Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, gave him a chance to work closely with Philippe Flajolet
</li></ul>
<p>
I joined him at IDA a few years later. I had to get a security clearance which is another whole story—see this <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/09/03/open-problems-that-might-be-easy/">post</a> for some fun thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Some More History </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Bob and I wrote some papers together: Two were on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration">VLSI</a>. The first on <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1981Lower.pdf">lower</a> bounds on the size of chips that computed something and the second on a language <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1982ALI.pdf">ALI</a> for designing VLSI circuits. </p>
<p>
Another paper was included also Jin-yi Cai and Andy Yao on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/336546">Towards Uncheatable benchmarks</a>. Or see a follow-on <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-387-35568-9_18.pdf">paper</a>. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
It was wonderful working <i>for</i> Bob when he was the chair of Computer Science and wonderful working <i>with</i> him on the above papers and more. </p>
<p>
Bob, have a wonderful time being retired. And happy emeritus status.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://scottaaronson.blog" title="Shtetl-Optimized">Scott Aaronson</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>So, I’d been planning a fun post for today about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E">DALL-E</a> image-generating AI model, and in particular, a brief new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13807">preprint</a> about DALL-E’s capabilities by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~davise/">Ernest Davis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus">Gary Marcus</a>, and myself.  We wrote this preprint as a sort of “adversarial collaboration”: Ernie and Gary started out deeply skeptical of DALL-E, while I was impressed bordering on awestruck.  I was pleasantly surprised that we nevertheless managed to produce a text that we all agreed on.</p>



<p>Not for the first time, though, world events have derailed my plans.  The most important part of today’s post is this:</p>



<p><strong>For the next week, I, Scott Aaronson, will personally match all reader donations to <a href="https://fundtexaschoice.org/">Fund Texas Choice</a>—a group that helps women in Texas travel to out-of-state health clinics, for reasons that are neither your business nor mine—up to a total of $5,000.</strong></p>



<p>To show my seriousness, I’ve already donated $1,000.  Just let me know how much you’ve donated in the comments section!</p>



<p>The first reason for this donation drive is that, perhaps like many of you, I stayed up hours last night reading Alito’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21835435-scotus-initial-draft">leaked decision</a> in a state of abject terror.  I saw how the logic of the decision, consistent and impeccable on its own terms, is one by which the Supreme Court’s five theocrats could now proceed to unravel the whole of modernity.  I saw how this court, unchecked by our broken democratic system, can now permanently enshrine the will of a radical minority, perhaps unless and until the United States is plunged into a second Civil War.</p>



<p>Anyway, that’s the first reason for the donation drive.  The second reason is to thank <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>‘s commenters for their … err, consistently generous and thought-provoking contributions.  Let’s take, for example, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">this</a> comment on last week’s admittedly <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405">rather silly post</a>, from an anonymous individual who calls herself “Feminist Bitch,” and who was enraged that it took me <em>a</em> <em>full day</em> to process one of the great political cataclysms of our lifetimes and publicly react to it:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>OF COURSE. Not a word about Roe v. Wade being overturned, but we get a pseudo-intellectual rationalist-tier rant about whatever’s bumping around Scott’s mind right now. Women’s most basic reproductive rights are being curtailed AS WE SPEAK and not a peep from Scott, eh? Even though in our state (Texas) there are already laws ON THE BOOKS that will criminalize abortion as soon as the alt-right fascists in our Supreme Court give the go-ahead. If you cared one lick about your female students and colleagues, Scott, you’d be posting about the Supreme Court and helping feminist causes, not posting your “memes.” But we all know Scott doesn’t give a shit about women. He’d rather stand up for creepy nerdbros and their right to harass women than women’s right to control their own fucking bodies. Typical Scott.</p></blockquote>



<p>If you want, you can <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6405#comment-1938839">read</a> all of Feminist Bitch’s further thoughts about my failings, with my every attempt to explain and justify myself met with further contempt.  No doubt my well-meaning friends of both sexes would counsel me to ignore her.  Alas, from my <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/01/the-blog-comment-that-achieved-an-internet-miracle/384539/">infamous ordeal</a> of late 2014, I know that with her every word, Feminist Bitch speaks for thousands, and the knowledge eats at me day and night.</p>



<p>It’s often said that “the right looks for converts, while the left looks only for heretics.”  Has Feminist Bitch ever stopped to think about <em>how</em> our civilization reached its current terrifying predicament—how Trump won in 2016, how the Supreme Court got packed with extremists who represent a mere 25% of the country, how Putin and Erdogan and Orban and Bolsonaro and all the rest consolidated their power?  Does she think it happened because wokeists like herself reached out too much, made too many inroads among fellow citizens who share <em>some</em> but not <em>all</em> of their values?  Would Feminist Bitch say that, if the Democrats want to capitalize on the coming tsunami of outrage about the death of <em>Roe</em> and the shameless lies that enabled it, if they want to sweep to victory in the midterms and enshrine abortion rights into federal law … then their best strategy would be to double down on their condemnations of gross, creepy, smelly, white male nerdbros who all the girls, like, <em>totally hate</em>?</p>



<p>(until, thank God, some of them don’t)</p>



<p>I continue to think that the majority of my readers, of all races and sexes and backgrounds, are reasonable and sane.  I continue to think the majority of you recoil against hatred and dehumanization of <em>anyone</em>—whether that means women seeking abortions, gays, trans folks, or (gasp!) even white male techbros.  In this sad twilight for the United States and for liberal democracy around the world, we the reasonable and sane, we the fans of the Enlightenment, we the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=3922">Party of Psychological Complexity</a>, have decades of work cut out for us.  For now I’ll simply say: I don’t hear from you nearly enough in the comments.</p></div>

In this survey we describe progress over the last decade or so in understanding the complexity of solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) approximately in the streaming and sketching models of computation. After surveying some of the results we give some sketches of the proofs and in particular try to explain why there is a tight dichotomy result for sketching algorithms working in subpolynomial space regime.</div>

In this paper, we prove strengthened lower bounds for constant-depth set-multilinear formulas. More precisely, we show that over any field, there is an explicit polynomial $f$ in VNP defined over $n^2$ variables, and of degree $n$, such that any product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formula computing $f$ has size at least $n^{\Omega \left( n^{1/\Delta}/\Delta\right)}$. The hard polynomial $f$ comes from the class of Nisan-Wigderson (NW) design-based polynomials. 

Our lower bounds improve upon the recent work of Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (STOC 2022), where a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega (\Delta n^{1/\Delta})}$ was shown for the size of product-depth $\Delta$ set-multilinear formulas computing the iterated matrix multiplication (IMM) polynomial of the same degree and over the same number of variables as $f$. Moreover, our lower bounds are novel for any $\Delta\geq 2$.

The precise quantitative expression in our lower bound is interesting also because the lower bounds we obtain are "sharp" in the sense that any asymptotic improvement would imply general set-multilinear circuit lower bounds via depth reduction results. 

In the setting of general set-multilinear formulas, a lower bound of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ was already obtained by Raz (J. ACM 2009) for the more general model of multilinear formulas. The techniques of LST (which extend the techniques of the same authors in (FOCS 2021)) give a different route to set-multilinear formula lower bounds, and allow them to obtain a lower bound of the form $(\log n)^{\Omega(\log n)}$ for the size of general set-multilinear formulas computing the IMM polynomial. Our proof techniques are another variation on those of LST, and enable us to show an improved lower bound (matching that of Raz) of the form $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$, albeit for the same polynomial $f$ in VNP (the NW polynomial). As observed by LST, if the same $n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size lower bounds for unbounded-depth set-multilinear formulas could be obtained for the IMM polynomial, then using the self-reducibility of IMM and using hardness escalation results, this would imply super-polynomial lower bounds for general algebraic formulas.</div>

Multivariate multipoint evaluation is the problem of evaluating a multivariate polynomial, given as a coefficient vector, simultaneously at multiple evaluation points. In this work, we show that there exists a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$ that outputs the evaluations of an $m$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable at $N$ points in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log|\F|)
\]
for all $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$.

A previous work of Kedlaya and Umans (FOCS 2008, SICOMP 2011) achieved the same time complexity when the number of variables $m$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ and had left the problem of removing this condition as an open problem. A recent work of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra (STOC 2022) answered this question when the underlying field is not too large  and has characteristic less than $d^{o(1)}$. In this work, we remove this constraint on the number of variables over all finite fields, thereby answering the question of Kedlaya and Umans over all finite fields. 

Our algorithm relies on a non-trivial combination of ideas from three seemingly different previously known algorithms for multivariate multipoint evaluation, namely the algorithms of Kedlaya and Umans, that of  Bj\"orklund, Kaski and Williams (IPEC 2017, Algorithmica 2019), and that of Bhargava, Ghosh, Kumar and Mohapatra, together with a result of Bombieri and Vinogradov from analytic number theory about the distribution of primes in an arithmetic progression. 

We also present a second algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation that is completely elementary and in particular, avoids the use of the Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. However, it requires a mild assumption that the field size is bounded by an exponential-tower in $d$ of bounded height. More specifically, our second algorithm solves the multivariate multipoint evaluation problem over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ in time 
\[
(d^m+N)^{1+o(1)}\cdot poly(m,d,\log |\mathbb{F}|)\]
for all $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and all sufficiently large $d\in \mathbb{N}$, provided that the size of the finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed.</div>

<p>This blog post is a book review of sorts for the following two books:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explain-World-Discovery-Modern-Science/dp/0062346660">To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science</a> by Steven Weinberg (2016)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Machine-Irrationality-Created-Science/dp/1631491377/">The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science</a> by Michael Strevens (2020).</p>



<p>Both books cover (in different proportions) the history and philosophy of science. By the end of this post, I will also discuss my thoughts. <em>Trigger warning:</em> I will end up comparing science to the blockchain and finding positive aspects of the dreaded “reviewer 2”.</p>



<p>Both books attempt to answer the question of <strong>“why and how did the scientific revolution happen?”</strong>. Strevens describes this conundrum as follows:</p>



<p><em>“[If you were a citizen of ancient Greece], you could enjoy just about every cultural invention that makes life worth living today. You could delight in the poetry of Homer and Sappho, visit the theater to relish Oedipus Rex and other masterpieces of ancient drama… You could live in cities regulated by law and a system of courts shaped by the architects and sculptors who built some of the seven wonders of the world and governed in accordance with political models that have lasted to this day: monarchy, oligarchy, sweet democracy.”</em></p>



<p>The point Strevens makes is that while obviously, a lot has changed in culture and society since 300 BC, the change has not been so drastic as to make life unrecognizably different. In contrast, science and technology have undergone drastic changes in the same period, with most changes occurring in the last few centuries. Weinberg quotes the historian Herbert Butterfield, who claimed that the scientific revolution <em>“outshines everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and Reformation to the rank of mere episodes.”</em></p>



<p>If you are the type of person who prefers data to quotes from historians, there is no shortage of graphs demonstrating this point, including the following:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DMx0_KjPGixzzYdBleMYRX2Xx_sf0ubgbU04kyluA_vMugVbJhnRnI_I8lY7u8h2qYfHVxjnKltPKG8V94LrNYMGAeUPvV8I-h8JPFL00rC8FCReH0E-aavJsV7gnxpwXSRv43RH0tRF_ES8uA" alt="" /></figure>



<p>(The right graph is adapted from Terry Tao’s excellent <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/10/the-cosmic-distance-ladder-ver-4-1/">cosmic distance ladder</a> presentation; I was happy to hear Tao is planning to turn it into a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/10/10/climbing-the-cosmic-distance-ladder-book-announcement/">popular science book</a>.)</p>



<p>One distinguishing property of science (compared to activities such as religion, philosophy, art, political thought, sports etc.) is that it simultaneously satisfies the following three properties:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Consensus:</strong> While scientists don’t agree about everything, they generally agree on much, and the scientific literature does seem to converge toward consensus in the long run. Perhaps most importantly, even when scientists disagree on interpreting facts, they agree on what these facts are and agree on the forum where these should be discussed. In contrast, there is much less consensus in other spheres of human activities. Often, there isn’t even a consensus on what forum to hold the debate or even if to hold it at all. As far as I know, there isn’t a <em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em> journal of theology where clergypersons of all faiths debate with one another. Indeed, with the polarized media these days, there are fewer and fewer forums where Democrats and Republicans debate with one another.<br /></li><li><strong>Change:</strong> The consensus is not just frozen in time but instead evolves. Scientists today generally agree with one another, but their views have radically changed over time. While, as Strevens notes, in art and religion, millennia-old texts are still very much relevant, in Machine Learning, when I recommend my students “read the classics,” I mean papers written before 2018 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /><br /></li><li><strong>Correlation with reality:</strong> Science does not merely change but also <em>progresses</em>, in the sense that with time we gain a better understanding of nature. While some radical subjectivists might dispute that external reality exists or that science gets to know more of it, most people who have ever flown in a plane, were administered a vaccine, or read a blog post over the Internet, will agree that science did advance. Science’s path may be a random walk, but that walk is biased towards progress.</li></ul>



<p>Science did not always possess the above properties, and the distinction between science and philosophy was much murkier in the past. Both Strevens and Weinberg trace the birth of modern science to the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Both books describe the history of science and attempt to answer what changed since ancient times and why.</p>



<p><strong>Strevens: Modern Science as a result of Newton and the “Iron Rule”:</strong></p>



<p>Strevens begins by explaining the philosophies of Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. I found this part very informative since I have never read a proper philosophy of science book.  (He also describes their fascinating personal histories.)</p>



<p>For Popper, progress in science happens via <em>refutations</em>. At a given point in time, there is a collection of hypotheses H₁,…,Hₖ that are currently consistent with known experiments. Then an experiment happens which refutes some of these, narrowing down the set of potentially feasible theories.</p>



<p>According to Strevens, Popper is an absolutist. Once a theory has been falsified, it’s dead, and all theories that have not been yet falsified will <em>“forever remain … conjectures”</em>. That is, Popper was not a Bayesian and did not assign any likelihood to theories based on how many true predictions they made. The only question was whether they still survive or have been refuted.</p>



<p>Popper is said to have been inspired by Einstein, who was willing to put his theory to the test and said, <em>“if the redshift of spectral lines due to the gravitational potential should not exist, then [my] general theory of relativity will be untenable.” </em> Indeed, a classical story of testing a theory via refutation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_experiment">Eddington’s expedition</a> to check Einstein’s predictions during the 1919 total solar eclipse. Specifically, due to the curvature of space, the effect of the sun’s gravity on the light shining from stars would be double the effect predicted by Newton’s theory. </p>



<p>A priori, the Eddington expedition seems like a textbook Popperian refutation: an experiment is set out to test conflicting predictions of two theories, after which only one of them will survive. However, as Strevens points out, the truth is murkier. The expedition took three measurements: one on the island of Principe, off the coast of West Africa, and two in Brazil. The weather in Principe was cloudy, and the resulting photos were blurry. In Brazil weather was good, but the measurements were taken using two different telescopes that gave conflicting results. Concretely, one of the Brazil telescopes’ measurements conformed with Einstein’s predictions, while the other conformed with the Newtonian theory. Eddington argued that the second Brazil telescope had a systematic error, and hence Einstein’s theory was confirmed. This was accepted by the Royal Society and made big headlines at the time. While Eddington probably <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01172-z">made the best conclusion given the data</a>, Strevens claims that he also had extra-scientific motivations to endorse Einstein’s theory: a desire to unite British and German science after WW-I. Einstein’s response to the experiment was also famously non-Popperian: When asked what he would have done if the investigation had the opposing results, he said, <em>“Then I would feel sorry for the dear Lord. The theory is correct anyway.”</em></p>



<p>Thomas Kuhn famously saw scientific progress as not so much a process of incremental refutation as periodic revolutions and paradigm shifts. A paradigm consists not just of mere factual predictions but also ways of thinking and determining truth. As such, paradigms are internally self-consistent, and one cannot “refute” them as much as step away from them, when they outlive their usefulness and cannot handle “anomalies”. Geo-centrism is a good example. While Strevens doesn’t say this, it is impossible to refute a geocentric point of the world (we can always say that the sun rotates around the earth but just does it in a very complex path). And of course, as Earth-based scientists, making it the center of the universe is a very natural prior assumption. Therefore, Helio-centrism did not arise from refuting geo-centrism but through switching to a different paradigm. </p>



<p>For Popper, scientific theories die in a duel with one another. For Kuhn, they die of old age. As scientists struggle ever more to get useful results out of their current paradigm (maybe fine-tuning it more and more to fit the data), they get the sinking feeling that it’s a dead end, and are ready to accept a new paradigm.  While some of Kuhn’s radical followers believed there is no such thing as scientific progress and all paradigms are equally valid, Strevens says that (at least later in life)  Kuhn did not agree with this view. Thus, for Kuhn, while switching paradigms is not as much a rational deliberation as a “leap of faith,” it typically results in improved understanding and predictive power. </p>



<p>If the Popperian scientist is a refutation machine, according to Kuhn, the vast majority of scientists are confirmation machines. They cannot see beyond the current paradigm, but rather because of their belief in it, they continue to push it forward, accumulating more and more data until its natural demise. Popper thought of scientists as always keeping an open mind and never believing in anything not proven. Kuhn thought that blind faith (and the pleasure of “puzzle-solving”) keeps scientists going in what 99% of the time is a slog to do more experiments and produce more data.</p>



<p>Strevens has his own view on the philosophy of science. In particular, he pinpoints the beginning of the Scientific Revolution to a single person – Isaac Newton. To Strevens, Newton’s theory was so different from what came before because it gives precise predictions without claiming to explain the deeper reasons. Newton gave the equation for gravity without explaining why objects can act on each other at a distance. In his postscript to the Principia, Newton said,</p>



<p> <em>“I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reasons for these properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena … [has] no place in experimental philosophy. … It is enough that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth and is sufficient to explain all the motions of the heavenly bodies and of our sea.” </em></p>



<p>In other words, Strevens sees Newton as saying, “shut up and calculate,” and indeed believes that Newton would have had no trouble with quantum mechanics’ famous “measurement problem.”  </p>



<p>Strevens sees this as key to modern science: giving up on deeper explanation and focusing only on empirical predictions. He admits scientists take other considerations, including the beauty of theories, into account in their motivations. But he claims that the “rules of engagement” are that all scientific disputes should be settled based on empirical evidence alone and within the domain of the formal scientific literature. He calls this the “Iron Rule of Explanations.” Strevens also sees Newton as science personified, in the sense in which Newton was an archetype of the modern scientific professionalism, formalism, and compartmentalization of thought. While Newton was very interested in both alchemy and biblical studies, unlike prior philosophers, he completely separated those interests from his work on physics. In that, Strevens says, Newton anticipated the modern universities, with its focus on specialization. </p>



<p>“Breaking down silos” is a common slogan these days, but Strevens argues that specialization and compartmentalization were crucial to science’s success. He says that  <em>“whatever is lost through detachment and disregard for the grand view of life is more than recompensed by the narrow, tightly focused beam that searches out the diminutive but telling fact.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Weinberg: Science history through modern eyes</strong></p>



<p>Weinberg’s is a gem of a book. Weinberg does not merely describe the works of ancient scientists, but he redoes their calculations, explaining what they got right, what they got wrong, and whether or not they could have done better with the data available. The book contains 35 technical notes, including everything from reworking Aristarchus’ derivations of the sizes and distances of the sun and the moon, through Descartes’ derivation of the law of refraction, to Newton’s calculations showing that the moon’s motion can be explained by the same gravitational force we see here on earth.</p>



<p>Weinberg places the beginning of the scientific revolution with Copernicus. While the choice of starting point might seem immaterial, this betrays a nearly opposite philosophical stance to Strevens’. While Strevens sees the reduction of science’s goal to empirical predictions as key, Copernicus’ heliocentric theory was actually a <em>step back</em> in terms of predictive power. The theory fitted the data worse than the prior geocentric theory of Ptolemy. Ptolemy introduced <em>epicycles</em> to adjust Aristotle’s clean but wrong geocentric theory to fit the data better. Today we know that epicycles correspond to the Fourier decomposition, and hence with enough of them, one can fit any periodic function. So, Ptolemy’s theory was the quintessential “shut up and calculate” theory: a good fit with observed data, but ugly and with several “fine-tuned” aspects that didn’t have any explanations. This has troubled astronomers for ages. The following words of the 12th-century Muslim scholar Ibn Rushd about Ptolemy’s theory could have been written about quantum mechanics today: <em>“The astronomical science of our days surely offers nothing from which one can derive an existing reality. The model that has been developed in the time in which we live accords with the computations, not with existence.” </em>[A side note is that quantum mechanics is very different from Ptolemy’s theory in the sense that while it does not offer a satisfactory story about reality, it is not “fine-tuned” and has its own sense of beauty, even if seeing this beauty is an “acquired taste”.]</p>



<p>Thus Copernicus’ contribution was not to find a more predictive theory, but rather a more beautiful one. As Weinberg says, this theory <em>“provides a classic example of how a theory can be selected on aesthetic criteria, with no experimental evidence that factors it over other theories… [this is] a recurrent theme in the history of physical science: a simple and beautiful theory that agrees pretty well with observation is often closer to the truth than a complicated ugly theory that agrees better with observation.”</em> [This might be a point to make a side note: while Popper, Kuhn, and (to some extent) Strevens often consider experiments as having discrete or logical outcomes – either true or false – for Weinberg quantities are always continuous or approximate, and every experiment always has a measure of uncertainty.]</p>



<p>Not surprisingly, while Strevens calls Francis Bacon’s extreme-empiricist book “one of the most significant books ever written on scientific inquiry”, Weinberg says that Bacon is one of the individuals “whose importance in the scientific revolution is most overrated” and that “it is not clear to me that anyone’s scientific work was actually changed for the better by Bacon’s writing.”</p>



<p>That is, as far as Weinberg is concerned, the novel parts of Bacon’s writing– the extreme empiricism– are false, and the true parts— plain-old experimentalism— are not novel and were known to scientists before Bacon’s time.</p>



<p>However, both Strevens and Weinberg agree on the significance of Newton. Newton’s innovation was not showing that gravity induces a uniform acceleration on objects. As Weinberg describes, already in 1603 Galileo did experiments showing that an object in free fall undergoes uniform acceleration, and showed that the distance it undergoes under gravity is proportional to the square of the time. Newton’s crucial insight was that the same relation is enough to explain the motion of the moon around the earth. He then saw that the ratio between the gravitational acceleration on earth and the one applied on the moon corresponds to the square of the distance between the two objects, and so (through Kepler’s law and his own invention of calculus) used this relation to explain the motion of all planets around the sun. </p>



<p>This was an astounding achievement. Not because Newton dared use a calculation without understanding the underlying mechanism: that was already done thousands of years before by Ptolemy and many others. Rather the impressive feat was that Newton formulated a simple law that works equally well on falling apples here on earth as well as moving stars in space. By doing this, Newton gave us the reason to hope that there are simple mathematical laws that govern all objects in the universe, and truly initiated modern science.</p>



<p><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></p>



<p>I enjoyed reading both books and highly recommend them.  Personally, I am more inclined toward Weinberg’s view than Strevens’. I think the history of science is fascinating and can teach us a lot about science even today. The philosophy of science, whether Bacon’s, Popper’s, Kuhn’s, or Strevens’, is nice to know but is of second-order importance. That said, I think Strevens does make an essential point that the scientific “rules of engagement” may well have been key to maintaining the balance between progress and consensus that made science so successful. In particular, he believes that much of science’s success can be explained by its emphasis on formal publications, with their insistence on a “sterile language” and spelling out all details of experiments or calculations, maintained through the peer review process and generations of “reviewers 2”. This might be something to keep in mind in our era, where social media, including blogs, Twitter, and company websites, sometimes replace formal venues as the main medium for conveying scientific results. </p>



<p>My own view is that truth in science is not settled as much by debates as by momentum.  Whether the scientific consensus is X is not determined by some committee of experts, but rather by scientists, and especially students, “voting with their feet”. It is not so much a result of a debate between two distinguished scientists, but a result of a new generation of students abandoning what they think of as dead ends. (This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle">Planck’s Principle</a>, sometimes grimly expressed as “science progresses one funeral at a time”.) For example,  in Computer Science, scores of papers and Ph.D. dissertations would be rendered meaningless if P=NP. This is stronger proof that the consensus is P≠NP than any poll of Turing laureates. </p>



<p>In that sense, science reminds me of the <em>blockchain</em> of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is a history of transactions of the form “User A paid X amount to user B”. User B will only be able to use this amount if there is <em>consensus</em> on this history. The blockchain is decentralized, and so several “forks” of it can exist simultaneously, but if users work on a “dead-end fork” that will not end up as part of the consensus history then their work will be for nothing. This motivates users to ensure that they are on the “right side of history” and only work on extensions of the chains that they believe will be part of the future consensus. This also means that we have more assurance of the veracity of an entry in the blockchain the further back it is, since there has been more work done that is built on this entry.</p>



<p>Similarly, scientists can be said to mine natural and artificial reality for scientific credit (not credit in the crass CV-padding or citation-counting way, but in terms of impact on the long-term direction of the field). But they will not get any such credit if their assumptions are eventually invalidated. Hence scientists are incentivized to ensure that they are always on the “right side of history”. They don’t want to work on a “dead-end fork” that will never get “merged” into the future main scientific discourse. <strong>A corollary is that if the truth of a particular proposition P is irrelevant to the way people do science then science will never need to form a consensus on whether P  is true or false. </strong>For example, as long as the choice of interpretation of quantum mechanics remains irrelevant to actual papers, debates between the Many-Worlds, Bohm and other interpretations will continue to take place in “cheap talk” outside the formal literature (whether over beer, in blog comments, or the popular press) and science will not need to form a consensus on which interpretation is correct. In particular, I don’t think science will ever need to form a consensus on whether any view of the philosophy of science, including my own, is the true one.</p>

A superredundant clause is a clause that is redundant in the resolution closure of a formula. The converse concept of superirredundancy ensures membership of the clause in all minimal CNF formulae that are equivalent to the given one. This allows for building formulae where some clauses are fixed when minimizing size. An example are proofs of complexity hardness of the problems of minimal formula size. Others are proofs of size when forgetting variables or revising a formula. Most clauses can be made superirredundant by splitting them over a new variable.</div>

Della Dumbaugh is a professor of mathematics at the University of Richmond. Her research is in the history of algebra and number theory. She says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When Mark Warner was governor of Virginia he asked, “what do historians of mathematics study?” That is a great question. We study mathematics, the people who create mathematics, the institutions that support mathematics, the false starts in particular areas of mathematics, the politics that influence the development of mathematics, and how the larger cultural context impinges on the development of mathematics. This discipline combines technical questions in mathematics with appropriate historical questions to yield a rich perspective on both mathematics and history. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I must say that I wish I knew more about the history of math. When trying to add to the collection of theorems that are known to be true, it would definitely have helped to be more aware of their history. </p>

Dumbaugh was <a href="https://news.richmond.edu/releases/article/-/19943/ur-mathematics-professor-della-dumbaugh-named-editor-in-chief-of-american-mathematical-monthly.html">named</a> the editor-in-chief of <em>American Mathematical Monthly</em>, starting in January 2022. The <em>Monthly</em> has been published since 1894, and its editors mostly have served five-year terms. She is only the second woman to serve as editor, a figure that seems to be low, way low. Yet she is also the second consecutive female editor. Maybe that is the beginning of a streak.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Her View of the Monthly </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dumbaugh found the <em>Monthly</em> in a novel way: Here is a neat <a href="http://digitaleditions.walsworthprintgroup.com/publication/?i=704334&amp;article_id=4005794&amp;view=articleBrowser&amp;ver=html5">interview</a> with her that explains it. Check out the part on her relationship to the <em>Monthly</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I may be one of the few members of the mathematical community who did not meet the Monthly through the content on its pages. Instead, I met the journal through my PhD research on Leonard Dickson and his work in the theory of algebras. In particular, Dickson aimed to elevate the standard of American mathematics through quality journal publications and he served as an editor of the <em>Monthly</em> from 1903 to 1906. After I finished my dissertation, I turned my attention to a question about Dickson’s celebrated <b>History of the Theory of Numbers</b> and published that article in the <em>Monthly</em>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My View of the Monthly </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I found the <em>Monthly</em> in a more common way: as a high school student. I loved it from the beginning, have read it for decades, yet have never submitted to it. I still recall using my hard earned money, money from odd jobs, to pay for my subscription to the <em>Monthly</em>.</p>
<p>
I enjoyed the articles, but especially liked two features. The problem <a href="https://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~tauraso/AMM/amm.html">session</a> each issue and the reviews of other articles and books. Since this was decades before the Internet seeing these articles helped me learn about directions and areas of mathematics. </p>
<p>
I still recall seeing the 1962 <a href="https://maa.tandfonline.com/toc/uamm20/70/7?nav=tocList">Putnam</a> exam in the <em>Monthly</em>. It was the first that I ever saw. I later took the exam as an undergraduate and did poorly. Oh well. </p>
<p>
More recently, I was struck by the <a href="https://scholarship.claremont.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1497&amp;context=jhm">article</a>, “Calculating Intersections: The Crossroads of Mathematics and Literature in the Lives of Mother and Daughter” by a mother and daughter: Della Dumbaugh and Hannah Fenster. Read it for interesting comments about the mom and daughter relationship:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This article tells the stories of how we, Della (mom, mathematician) and Hannah (daughter, writing instructor and bookseller), arrived in our professional settings through the lens of mother and daughter. For us, the intersections of literature and mathematics inspired many of our pivotal moments. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/08/hilberts-irreducibility-theorem/">had</a> an <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00029890.2018.1448181">article</a> in the <em>Monthly</em> with Bill Gasarch and also Mark Villarino, who had <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2017.1416875">another</a> that same year. What I would think of as a good paper for the <em>Monthly</em> has a mixture of history, survey elements, and originality of approach to an entertaining problem, framed to be accessible to a high-school student. What topics might our readers suggest?</p>

We consider the $P$-CSP problem for $3$-ary predicates $P$ on satisfiable instances. We show that under certain conditions on $P$ and a $(1,s)$ integrality gap instance of the $P$-CSP problem, it can be translated into a dictatorship vs. quasirandomness test with perfect completeness and soundness $s+\varepsilon$, for every constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Compared to Ragahvendra's result [STOC, 2008], we do not lose perfect completeness. This is particularly interesting as this test implies new hardness results on satisfiable constraint satisfaction problems, assuming the Rich 2-to-1 Games Conjecture by Braverman, Khot, and Minzer [ITCS, 2021]. Our result can be seen as the first step of a potentially long-term challenging program of characterizing optimal inapproximability of every satisfiable $k$-ary  CSP.
	
	At the heart of the reduction is our main analytical lemma for a class of $3$-ary predicates, which is a generalization of a lemma by  Mossel [Geometric and Functional Analysis, 2010]. The lemma and a further generalization of it that we propose as a hypothesis may be of independent interest.</div>

<h3>Joshua Hinman proved Bárány’s conjecture.</h3>
<p>One of my first posts on this blog was a 2008 post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/five-open-problems-regarding-convex-polytopes/" rel="bookmark">Five Open Problems Regarding Convex Polytopes</a>, now 14 years later, I can tell you about the first problem on the list to get solved.</p>
<p>Imre Bárány posed in the late 1990s the following question:</p>
<p>For a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" />-dimensional polytope <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P" class="latex" /> and every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0+%5Cle+k+%5Cle+d-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="0 \le k \le d-1" class="latex" />,  is it true that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_k%28P%29+%5Cge+%5Cmin+%28f_0%28P%29%2Cf_%7Bd-1%7D%28P%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_k(P) \ge \min (f_0(P),f_{d-1}(P))" class="latex" />?</p>
<p>Now, Joshua Hinman settled the problem! In his paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02568">A Positive Answer to Bárány’s Question on Face Numbers of Polytopes</a> he actually proved even stronger linear relations. The abstract of Joshua’s paper starts with the very true assertion: “Despite a full characterization of the face vectors of simple and simplicial polytopes, the face numbers of general polytopes are poorly understood.” He moved on to describe his new inequalities:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Augmentation problems are a fundamental class of network design problems. They ask about the cheapest way to increase the (edge-)connectivity of a graph by adding edges among a given set of options. One of the most elementary and intensely studied augmentation problems is the (Weighted) Tree Augmentation Problem. Here, a spanning tree has to be augmented into a 2-edge-connected graph.</p>
<p>Classic techniques for network design yield 2-approximation algorithms for a wide class of augmentation problems. For the Unweighted Tree Augmentation Problem, better-than-2 approximations are known for more than 20 years. However, only recently the first better-than-2 approximations have been found for the more general Unweighted Connectivity Augmentation Problem and Weighted Tree Augmentation Problem. In this talk we will discuss these recent advances.</p></blockquote></div>

The Merlin-Arthur  class of languages MA is included into Arthur-Merlin  class AM, and into PP. For a  standard transformation of a given MA protocol with  Arthur's message (= random string) of length $a$ and Merlin's message of length $m$ to a PP machine, the latter needs  $O(ma)$ random bits. The same holds for simulating MA protocols by AM protocols: in the resulting AM protocol the length of Arthur's message (= random string) is $O(ma)$. And the same holds for simulating heuristic MA protocols by  heuristic  AM protocols as well. In the paper  [A. Knop, Circuit Lower Bounds for Average-Case MA, CSR 2015] it was conjectured that, in the transformation of heuristic MA protocols to heuristic AM protocols, $O(ma)$ can be replaced by a polynomial of $a$ only. A similar question can be asked for normal MA and AM protocols, and for the simulation of MA protocols by PP machines. In the present paper we show that, relative to an oracle,  both latter questions answer in the negative and Knop's conjecture is false. Moreover,  the same is true for simulation of MA protocols by AM protocols in which the  error probability is not bounded away from 1/2, the so called PP$\cdot$NP protocols. The latter protocols generalize both AM protocols and  PP machines.</div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>I was a contact person for the <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/12/03/an-alarming-trend-in-k-12-math-education/">open letter on K-12 math education</a>, and am in strong support of the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6389">recent letter on the role of data science in math education</a> (and would encourage readers that are faculty members in California to sign it). Since I tend to see the same questions and objections arise time and again, I thought it would be useful to write my responses to these. The following is my own opinions only, and does not reflect the views of any other contact person or signer of these letters. I also apologize in advance for the lack of links and references below. However, if you ask questions in the comments, I’d be happy to give more sources.</p>



<p><strong>Q: The status quo in US math education is terrible and doesn’t work for many children, especially students of color and low income students. Aren’t these letter writers just trying to protect a flawed system that worked well for them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>The US math education system is very complex, but I agree that it is largely failing a large chunk of our students. But that doesn’t mean that any change will necessarily be for the better. Just because a system is bad, doesn’t mean you can’t make it worse. We have a responsibility to “first do no harm” when we experiment on millions of children of our largest state, and the proposed changes are not based on any solid evidence, and in my opinion (and the opinion of many other experts) will make things worse. Indeed, there is no shortage of experiments in mathematics education that yielded no or even negative progress in terms of equity.</p>



<p>Also, not all change needs to be curricular change. The inequalities in the system were not created because of the math curriculum, and will not be fixed by it. Many top-performing countries use a fairly traditional math curriculum, some strongly influenced by the Soviet system.  The inequalities in the US arise from huge disparities in the resources at school, and a highly unequal society at large. I personally think that improving education is much more about support for students, resources, tutoring, teacher training, etc, than whether we teach logarithms using method X or method Y.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Shouldn’t CS and STEM faculty stay out of this debate, and leave it to the math education faculty that are the true subject matter experts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> The education system has many stakeholders, including students, parents, teachers, citizens, employers, and post-secondary educators, and they all should be heard. STEM careers and other quantitative fields are the fastest growing in opportunities and student interest in college. As such, one of the goals (though not the only one) of K-12 math education is to prepare students to have the option to major in STEM in college, if that is what they want to do. STEM faculty are the best equipped to <a href="https://mathematics.stanford.edu/news/submission-ca-math-framework-revision">say what is needed</a> for success in their field, and what they see is the impact of K-12 preparation. Math Ed and STEM faculty can and should be working together on the  K-12 curriculum. </p>



<p><strong>Q: But not all students will go to STEM in college. Shouldn’t the K-12 math education system also offer something for the students that are not interested in STEM?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>I agree that not all students will go to STEM and that (for example) not all high-school students should be forced to take calculus. However, if we are offering an option that is designed for students that are not interested in STEM then we should be honest about it. At the moment high-school data science courses are marketed as a way to “have your cake and eat it too” – courses that are on one hand easier than algebra and calculus and on the other hand give just as good or maybe even better preparation for a career in tech or data science. This is misinformation, and the students most likely to fall for it are the ones with the least resources. In addition, the type of thinking developed by rigorous math courses can benefit students throughout their lives and careers, regardless of the path they take.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Isn’t equity more important than giving students opportunities to advance in math? Shouldn’t mathematical education policy be focused on the kids that are struggling the most and facing most challenges, in particular students of color?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>I personally think equity and expanding access to mathematical education is absolutely crucial. This is why I was and am involved in initiatives including <a href="https://www.addiscoder.com/">AddisCoder</a>, <a href="https://jamcoders.org.jm/">JamCoders</a>, <a href="https://womenintheory.wordpress.com/">Women In Theory</a>, and <a href="https://boazbk.github.io/tcs-summerschool/">New Horizons in TCS</a>. But true equity is about actually educating students more, not about moving the goalposts and claiming success. This is doubly true in the context of the US education system. There will be many routes open to well-resourced students to bypass any limitations of the public system. These include private tutoring, courses such as Russian School of Math, Art of Problem Solving, or simply opting out of the public system altogether. Also, due to local control, wealthier districts are likely to opt out of any reforms that they perceive (correctly) as giving worse preparation for post-secondary success. </p>



<p>Hence changes such as the CMF will disproportionately harm low-income students and students of color, and make it less likely for them to succeed in STEM. Not coincidentally, many educators, researchers, and practitioners of color have signed both letters, while the CMF itself has no Black authors. There are efforts that actually do work to decrease educational gaps: these include Bob Moses’ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">Algebra Project</a>, Adrian Mims’ (contact person for one of the letters) <a href="https://thecalculusproject.org/">Calculus Project</a>,  <a href="https://www.theescalanteprogram.org/">Jaime Escalante</a>  (from “stand and deliver”) math program, and the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.3.3.158">Harlem Children’s Zone</a>. Notably, none of these projects involve lowering the bar. </p>



<p><strong>Q: Maybe the problem is with the STEM college curriculum as well? For example, why do students need calculus for a computer science degree when hardly any software engineer uses it? If colleges would make their curriculum more practically oriented then we wouldn’t need to teach high-school kids this hard math.</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> There is a narrow answer and a deeper answer to this question. The narrow answer is that the goal of K-12 education is to prepare students for success in the world as it exists now. If you want to fight these battles at the higher education level, then you should fight them and win them, and only later change the K-12 education to fit the new college curricula.</p>



<p>However, there is a deeper answer why university education has always been about more than just giving students the minimal vocational skills. We believe that our mission is not just to give students some tools that they’ll use in the first job out of school, but broader ways of thinking that will help them keep up with new developments throughout their careers. Computer Science is a great example of this. Fifteen years ago, most computer scientists didn’t need to know much about algebra, probability or calculus, but these days deep learning is fast expanding to every area of CS. The time between an academic paper to a real-world product is getting shorter and shorter, and one skill a computer scientist needs these days is the ability to read a complex technical text and not be afraid of learning new math. Foundational courses such as college calculus and linear algebra (which themselves build on high-school Algebra II and  pre-calculus) are crucial for this skill.</p>



<p><strong>Q: Aren’t you devaluing data science and saying it’s less important than Algebra or Calculus?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A: </strong>Absolutely not. I think literacy with data is an essential skill for any citizen in our modern society, and strongly support it being taught for every K-12 student. This does not mean that it can or should replace the basic math foundational skills. Data science can and be included in variety of courses, ranging from the computational and natural sciences to the social sciences and even humanities. (For example see the courses satisfying Harvard’s <a href="https://oue.fas.harvard.edu/quantitative-reasoning-data">quantitative reasoning with data requirement</a>.)</p>



<p>“Data science” is an evolving field and at the moment not very well defined, and as such there are data science courses of vastly different types. A high-school course or module in data proficiency can be extremely beneficial for students, but without prerequisites such as algebra, probability, and programming, there is a severe limit to the depth that it can go to. For students who will not go into STEM or data science, such a data literacy course would be highly recommended. Students who will take a deeper course later on are better served by foundational courses such as Algebra, Pre-calculus, and Calculus. </p>



<p>By the way, there is nothing about data science that makes it inherently easier than algebra or calculus. While (univariate) calculus is ultimately about functions you can draw on a paper and reason intuitively about their graphs, issues of correlations vs causation are highly subtle, and even experts could get it wrong. The skills and rigorous modes of thinking developed in courses such as Algebra II and beyond are required to develop a true understanding of data science. </p>



<p>There is another reason why a prerequisite-free data literacy course should not be considered as part of the math curriculum, which was eloquently put by <a href="https://blog.mathed.page/2019/10/14/freakonomics-radio-on-math-curriculum/">Henri Picciotto</a> (see also <a href="https://blog.mathed.page/2021/12/14/yet-more-on-the-california-framework-part-1/">this</a>): <em>“in math we should not teach black-box formulas and software packages that students cannot possibly understand thoroughly. We have been moving towards teaching math for understanding at all levels. There is no reason to use data analysis as an excuse to backtrack. Let science and social studies teachers use standard deviation, correlation coefficient, regression, confidence interval, and the like without understanding the underlying assumptions and the reasoning and calculations that lead to those. Math teachers should not. “</em></p>



<p><strong>Q: Isn’t the CMF an evidence-based proposal that is backed by a huge number of citations?</strong></p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> The short answer to this question is “No”. The medium answer is that the CMF contains many citations but often the research cited is <a href="https://notepad.michaelpershan.com/more-youcubed-research-that-is-difficult-to-explain/">sloppy</a>, or is cited incorrectly. (For example, they make plenty of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WO4gCR0fCHtlN8uN5lRztAsdqEGuRgKE/edit#bookmark=id.d8y5jr2fqobx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unsupported</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WO4gCR0fCHtlN8uN5lRztAsdqEGuRgKE/edit#bookmark=id.biqb9dlec448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims</a> on neuroscience ,whereas essentially all neuroscientists agree that our understanding of the brain is nowhere near the level that it could be used to guide curriculum development.) The long answer is out of scope for this blog post, but here are some links to analyses done by other people. I will update this blog as more are put out (this is a 900 page document after all), but some people that wrote about this include <a href="https://notepad.michaelpershan.com/what-is-happening-in-california-with-math-right-now/">Michael Pershan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/BethKellySF/status/1516875836573454338?s=20&amp;t=ewWPTA0FYdJBpJNDzeTjDw">Beth Kelly</a> (see also <a href="https://twitter.com/BethKellySF/status/1518991575526699008?s=20&amp;t=ewWPTA0FYdJBpJNDzeTjDw">this</a>). Brian Conrad has been working on fuller analysis of the CMF, and I will update this post (as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs">tweet</a> about it) as parts of it become available.</p></div>

<p><strong>Update (April 27):</strong> Boaz Barak—Harvard CS professor, longtime friend-of-the-blog, and coauthor of my previous guest post on this topic—has just written an <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/04/27/a-personal-faq-on-the-math-education-controversies/">awesome FAQ</a>, providing his personal answers to the most common questions about what I called our “campaign to defend serious math education.”  It directly addresses several issues that have already come up in the comments.  Check it out!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>As you might remember, last December I hosted a <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">guest post</a> about the “California Mathematics Framework” (CMF), which was set to cause radical changes to precollege math in California—e.g., eliminating 8th-grade algebra and making it nearly impossible to take AP Calculus.  I linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> setting out my and my colleagues’ concerns about the CMF.  That letter went on to receive more than 1700 signatures from STEM experts in industry and academia from around the US, including recipients of the Nobel Prize, Fields Medal, and Turing Award, as well as a lot of support from college-level instructors in California. </p>



<p>Following widespread pushback, a <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">new version of the CMF</a> appeared in mid-March.  I and others are gratified that the new version significantly softens the opposition to acceleration in high school math and to calculus as a central part of mathematics.  Nonetheless, we’re still concerned that the new version promotes a narrative about data science that’s a recipe for cutting kids off from any chance at earning a 4-year college degree in STEM fields (including, ironically, in data science itself).</p>



<p>To that end, some of my Californian colleagues have <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mathindatamatters/home"><strong>issued a new statement today</strong></a> on behalf of academic staff at 4-year colleges in California, aimed at clearing away the fog on how mathematics is related to data science.  I strongly encourage my readers on the academic staff at 4-year colleges in California to sign this commonsense statement, which has already been signed by over 250 people (including, notably, at least 50 from Stanford, home of two CMF authors).</p>



<p>As a public service announcement, I’d also like to bring to wider awareness <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/regulations/california/5-CCR-Sec-18533">Section 18533 of the California Education Code</a>, for submitting written statements to the California State Board of Education (SBE) about errors, objections, and concerns in curricular frameworks such as the CMF.  </p>



<p>The SBE is scheduled to vote on the CMF in mid-July, and their remaining meeting before then is on May 18-19 according to <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/st/index.asp">this site</a>, so it is really at the May meeting that concerns need to be aired.  Section 18533 requires submissions to be written (yes, snail mail) and postmarked at least 10 days before the SBE meeting.  So to make your voice heard by the SBE, please send your written concern by certified mail (for tracking, but <em>not</em> requiring signature for delivery), no later than Friday May 6, to State Board of Education, c/o Executive Secretary of the State Board of Education, 1430 N Street, Room 5111, Sacramento, CA 95814, complemented by an email submission to <a href="mailto:sbe@cde.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sbe@cde.ca.gov</a> and <a href="mailto:mathframework@cde.ca.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mathframework@cde.ca.gov</a>.</p></div>

<p>(This is a joint post with David and Tomas Harris.)</p><p><br /></p><p>In my an earlier post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-seq-problems-was-solved.html">here</a>) I discussed the MATH behind a problem that I worked on, with David and Tomas Harris, that we later found out had already been solved. In this post we discuss HOW this happened. </p><p>Recall that Bill Gasarch read a column of Oliver Roeder (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-number-any-number/">here</a>) on Nate Silvers' blog where he challenged his readers to the following:</p><p>Find the longest sequence using numbers from {1,...,100} such that every number is either a factor or multiple of the previous number. (A later column (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-bathroom-occupied/">here</a> ) revealed the answer to be 77 via a computer search, which we note is not a human-readable proof.)</p><p>Bill wrote a blog post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/09/a-problem-i-thought-was-interesting-now.html">here</a>) and an open problems column (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/nate.pdf">here</a> ) asking about the general case of {1,...,n}. Before doing this Bill DID try to check the literature to see what was known, but he didn't check very hard since this was not going to be a published paper. Also, he vaguely thought that if it was a known problem then one of his readers would tell him.</p><p>QUESTION: Is it appropriate to blog on things that you have not done a search of the literature on?</p><p>ANSWER: Yes, but you should SAY SO in the blog post.</p><p>As measured by comments, the post did not generate much interest- 10 comments. 2 were me (Gasarch) responding to comments.</p><p>David (who has a PhD from UMCP under Aravind Srinivasan) asked Bill to find a HS project for his son Tomas. Bill gave Tomas the sequence problem (as he called it) to look at- perhaps write a program to find what happens for {1,...,n} for small n, perhaps find human-readable proofs of weaker bound, for small n or for n=100.</p><p>David got interested in the MATH behind the problem so the project became three projects: Tomas would look at the programing aspects and the human-readable aspects, David would look at the Math, and Bill would...  hmmm, not clear what Bill would do, but he did write up a great deal of it and cleaned up some of the proofs.</p><p>David showed</p><p>Omega( n/( (log n)^{1.68} )  LE  L(n)  LE  O( n/( (log n)^{0.79} ). </p><p>Tomas and Bill obtained a human-readable proof that L(100) LE 83. (Comments on my blog sketched a proof that L(100) LE 83, and someone else that L(100) LE 80). See my previous post (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-seq-problems-was-solved.html">here</a>) for more on the known numbers for L. </p><p>At that point David did a brief literature search; however, he didn't know what to look for.</p><p>BILL still thought of this as a HS project so he didn't think much about a paper coming out of it, or if it was original. So he didn't do the due diligence of seeing what was already known.</p><p>David and Tomas were busy working on it, so they only did a few cursory checks of the literature.</p><div><div><br /></div><div>With the two results above,  we had a paper! David then looked much more carefully at the literature. He DID find some earlier papers -- he did a Google search for Roeder's puzzle, which mentioned another mathematician, who was quoted in a blog by another mathematician, who eventually mentioned Pomerance's old paper on the topic. Once he found a reference to an actual math paper it was easy to use Google Scholar to find forward/backward citations and find the current state of the art.</div><div><br /></div><div>His email had subject title</div><div><br /></div><div>                        SHUT IT ALL DOWN!!!</div><div><br /></div><div>Which made Bill think it involved a nuclear reactor undergoing The China Syndrome rather than just telling us that other people did had better and earlier results. </div><div><br /></div><div><p class="MsoNormal">In 1995 Gerald Tenenbaum showed, in a paper written in French,  that there exists a,b such that </p><p class="MsoNormal">                               n/(log n)^a LE L(n) LE n/(log n)^b (see <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/ASENS_1995_4_28_2_115_0/">here</a>). </p><p class="MsoNormal">More recently, in 2021, Saias showed, in a paper written in French, that </p><p class="MsoNormal">                                      L(n) GE (0.3 - o(1)) n/log n (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03855">here</a>). </p></div><div><br /></div><div>SO, why didn't Bill, David, Tomas find that it was already known until late in the process:</div><div><br /></div><div>1) They didn't know the right search term: <i>Divisor Graph</i></div><div><br /></div><div>2) The literature was in French so the right search term is <i>graphe divisoriel</i></div><div><br /></div><div>3) The transition from FUN HS PROJECT to SERIOUS MATH PAPER was somewhat abrupt and caught Bill by surprise.</div><div><br /></div><div>Was this a disappointment?</div><div><br /></div><div>1) We all learned some math from it, so that was nice.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) We were in a position to read and understand the paper since we knew all of the difficulties --- however, it was in French which I do not read. David reads some, Tomas does not read French.  I prefer to be scooped in English, but even then  I might not be able to read up on the problem since  math is... hard. When did math get so hard? see my blog on that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/when-did-math-get-so-hard.html">here</a>. When did CS theory get so hard? See my blog on that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/11/when-did-computer-science-theory-get-so.html">here</a>.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Could this happen again?</div><div><br /></div><div>1) Yes. Language barriers are hard to overcome. Though this is rare nowadays--- not much serious mathematics seems to be done outside English. French mathematicians seem to like to keep their language alive, although they probably know English as well. There may be a few other countries (China, perhaps), where English language skills are not advanced and researchers are cut off from the English literature.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) Yes. I've heard of cases where many people discovered the same theorem but were unaware of each others results since they were in different fields.</div><div><br /></div><div>3) Is it easier or harder to reprove a theorem now then it was X years ago?</div><div><br /></div></div><div>We have better search tools, but we also have more to search. </div><div><br /></div></div>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between form and meaning. Form is the physical structure of something, while meaning is the interpretation or concept that is attached to that form. For example, the form of a chair is its physical structure – four legs, a seat, and a back. The meaning of a chair is that it is something you can sit on.</p>



<p>This distinction is important when considering whether or not an AI system can be trained to learn semantic meaning. AI systems are capable of learning and understanding the form of data, but they are not able to attach meaning to that data. In other words, AI systems can learn to identify patterns, but they cannot understand the concepts behind those patterns.</p>



<p>For example, an AI system might be able to learn that a certain type of data is typically associated with the concept of “chair.” However, the AI system would not be able to understand what a chair is or why it is used. In this way, we can see that an AI system trained on form can never learn semantic meaning.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who asked whether I’m OK!  Yeah, I’ve been living, loving, learning, teaching, worrying, procrastinating, just not blogging.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Last week, Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry posted a preprint to the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">“Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure,”</a> that represents some of the most exciting progress in quantum complexity theory in years.  I wish I’d thought of it.  tl;dr they show that relative to a random oracle (!), there’s an NP search problem that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster than classical ones.  And yet this is 100% consistent with the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>A student brought my attention to <a href="https://deduckproject.github.io/quantle/">Quantle</a>, a variant of Wordle where you need to guess a true equation involving 1-qubit quantum states and unitary transformations.  It’s really well-done!  Possibly the best quantum game I’ve seen.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-has-demonstrated-the-underlying-physics-required-to-create-a-new-kind-of-qubit/">announced on the web</a> that it had achieved an experimental breakthrough in topological quantum computing: not <em>quite</em> the creation of a topological qubit, but some of the underlying physics required for that.  This followed their needing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z">retract</a> their previous claim of such a breakthrough, due to the criticisms of Sergey Frolov and others.  One imagines that they would’ve taken far greater care this time around.  Unfortunately, a research paper doesn’t seem to be available yet.  Anyone with further details is welcome to chime in.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Woohoo!  Maximum flow, maximum bipartite matching, matrix scaling, and isotonic regression on posets (among many others)—all algorithmic problems that I was familiar with way back in the 1990s—are now solvable in nearly-linear time, thanks to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671">breakthrough by Chen et al.</a>!  Many undergraduate algorithms courses will need to be updated.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>For those interested, Steve Hsu <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2022/04/scott-aaronson-quantum-computing.html">recorded a podcast with me</a> where I talk about quantum complexity theory.</p></div>
