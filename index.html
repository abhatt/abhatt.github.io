<div class="content">
Recently it was shown that  PLS is not contained in PPADS (ECCC report TR22-058). We show that this separation already implies that PLS is not contained in PPP. These separations are shown for the decision tree model of TFNP and imply similar separations in the type-2, relativized model.

Important note. This manuscript is based on an early preprint of report TR22-058, which did not contain the result that PLS is not contained in PPP. Our work is superseded by  the revised version of the report of 10 June 2022 which, independently, contains this result. The manuscript has not been edited to reflect this, and in particular references to the report are to the early version.</div>

In previous posts we showed that the classic Dolev-Strong broadcast protocol takes $O(n^3)$ words and $t+1$ rounds and that Dolev Reischuk show that $\Omega(n^2)$ is needed and it is also known that $t+1$ rounds are needed. So while the number of rounds is optimal, to this day it remains an...</div>

(QMC) problem using product states. A classical 0.498-approximation, using a
basic semidefinite programming relaxation, is known for QMC, paralleling the
celebrated 0.878-approximation for classical Max Cut. For Max Cut, improving
the 0.878-approximation is Unique-Games-hard (UG-hard), and one might expect
that improving the 0.498-approximation is UG-hard for QMC. In contrast, we give
a classical 1/2-approximation for QMC that is unconditionally optimal, since
simple examples exhibit a gap of 1/2 between the energies of an optimal product
state and general quantum state. Our result relies on a new nonlinear monogamy
of entanglement inequality on a triangle that is derived from the second level
of the quantum Lasserre hierarchy. This inequality also applies to the quantum
Heisenberg model, and our results generalize to instances of Max 2-Local
Hamiltonian where each term is positive and has no 1-local parts. Finally, we
give further evidence that product states are essential for approximations of
2-Local Hamiltonian.

twin-width. Inspired by the approach of Bonnet et al. [FOCS 2020], we introduce
a robust methodology of local types and describe their behavior in contraction
sequences -- the decomposition notion underlying twin-width. We showcase the
applicability of the methodology by proving the following two algorithmic
results. In both statements, we fix a first-order formula
$\varphi(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ and a constant $d$, and we assume that on input we
are given a graph $G$ together with a contraction sequence of width at most
$d$.
</p>
<p>(A) One can in time $O(n)$ construct a data structure that can answer the
following queries in time $O(\log \log n)$: given $w_1,\ldots,w_k$, decide
whether $\phi(w_1,\ldots,w_k)$ holds in $G$.
</p>
<p>(B) After $O(n)$-time preprocessing, one can enumerate all tuples
$w_1,\ldots,w_k$ that satisfy $\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ in $G$ with $O(1)$ delay.
</p>
<p>In the case of (A), the query time can be reduced to $O(1/\varepsilon)$ at
the expense of increasing the construction time to $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$, for
any fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Finally, we also apply our tools to prove the
following statement, which shows optimal bounds on the VC density of set
systems that are first-order definable in graphs of bounded twin-width.
</p>
<p>(C) Let $G$ be a graph of twin-width $d$, $A$ be a subset of vertices of $G$,
and $\varphi(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y_1,\ldots,y_l)$ be a first-order formula. Then the
number of different subsets of $A^k$ definable by $\phi$ using $l$-tuples of
vertices from $G$ as parameters, is bounded by $O(|A|^l)$.

a subgraph that satisfies certain properties and minimizes the total weight. We
assume here that the vertices correspond to points in a metric space and can
take any position in given uncertainty sets. Then, the cost function to be
minimized is the sum of the distances for the worst positions of the vertices
in their uncertainty sets. We propose two types of polynomial-time
approximation algorithms. The first one relies on solving a deterministic
counterpart of the problem where the uncertain distances are replaced with
maximum pairwise distances. We study in details the resulting approximation
ratio, which depends on the structure of the feasible subgraphs and whether the
metric space is Ptolemaic or not. The second algorithm is a fully-polynomial
time approximation scheme for the special case of $s-t$ paths.

neighbor regression. Our Active Nearest Neighbor Regressor (ANNR) relies on the
Voronoi-Delaunay framework from computational geometry to subdivide the space
into cells with constant estimated function value and select novel query points
in a way that takes the geometry of the function graph into account. We
consider the recent state-of-the-art active function approximator called DEFER,
which is based on incremental rectangular partitioning of the space, as the
main baseline. The ANNR addresses a number of limitations that arise from the
space subdivision strategy used in DEFER. We provide a computationally
efficient implementation of our method, as well as theoretical halting
guarantees. Empirical results show that ANNR outperforms the baseline for both
closed-form functions and real-world examples, such as gravitational wave
parameter inference and exploration of the latent space of a generative model.

a large number of applications. In particular, leverage scores, which relate
the columns of a matrix to the subspaces spanned by its leading singular
vectors, are helpful in revealing column subsets to approximately factorize a
matrix with quality guarantees. As such, they provide a solid foundation for a
variety of machine-learning methods. In this paper we extend the definition of
leverage scores to relate the columns of a matrix to arbitrary subsets of
singular vectors. We establish a precise connection between column and
singular-vector subsets, by relating the concepts of leverage scores and
principal angles between subspaces. We employ this result to design
approximation algorithms with provable guarantees for two well-known problems:
generalized column subset selection and sparse canonical correlation analysis.
We run numerical experiments to provide further insight on the proposed
methods. The novel bounds we derive improve our understanding of fundamental
concepts in matrix approximations. In addition, our insights may serve as
building blocks for further contributions.

technique that adapts to the local geometry of data. However, its applicability
has been so far limited to problems in two and three dimensions. This is
because Voronoi cells rapidly increase in complexity as dimensions grow, making
the necessary explicit computations infeasible. We define a variant of the VDE
deemed Compactified Voronoi Density Estimator (CVDE), suitable for higher
dimensions. We propose computationally efficient algorithms for numerical
approximation of the CVDE and formally prove convergence of the estimated
density to the original one. We implement and empirically validate the CVDE
through a comparison with the Kernel Density Estimator (KDE). Our results
indicate that the CVDE outperforms the KDE on sound and image data.

training sample of inputs. Several recent works have applied this approach to
problems in numerical linear algebra, obtaining significant empirical gains in
performance. However, no theoretical explanation for their success was known.
</p>
<p>In this work we prove generalization bounds for those algorithms, within the
PAC-learning framework for data-driven algorithm selection proposed by Gupta
and Roughgarden (SICOMP 2017). Our main results are closely matching upper and
lower bounds on the fat shattering dimension of the learning-based low rank
approximation algorithm of Indyk et al.~(NeurIPS 2019). Our techniques are
general, and provide generalization bounds for many other recently proposed
data-driven algorithms in numerical linear algebra, covering both
sketching-based and multigrid-based methods. This considerably broadens the
class of data-driven algorithms for which a PAC-learning analysis is available.

learning: given a stochastic binary classifier $f: X \to [0,1]$, sample a
deterministic classifier $\hat{f}: X \to \{0,1\}$ that approximates the output
of $f$ in aggregate over any data distribution. Recent work revealed how to
efficiently derandomize a stochastic classifier with strong output
approximation guarantees, but at the cost of individual fairness -- that is, if
$f$ treated similar inputs similarly, $\hat{f}$ did not. In this paper, we
initiate a systematic study of classifier derandomization with metric fairness
guarantees. We show that the prior derandomization approach is almost maximally
metric-unfair, and that a simple ``random threshold'' derandomization achieves
optimal fairness preservation but with weaker output approximation. We then
devise a derandomization procedure that provides an appealing tradeoff between
these two: if $f$ is $\alpha$-metric fair according to a metric $d$ with a
locality-sensitive hash (LSH) family, then our derandomized $\hat{f}$ is, with
high probability, $O(\alpha)$-metric fair and a close approximation of $f$. We
also prove generic results applicable to all (fair and unfair) classifier
derandomization procedures, including a bias-variance decomposition and
reductions between various notions of metric fairness.

<p><a href="https://ima.org.uk/19140/westward-ho-conway-concorde-and-curiously-curved-coins/">The Institute of Mathematics &amp; its Applications tells us</a> that applications of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle">Reuleaux triangle</a> include “the cross-section of some pencils that are thought to be more ergonomic than traditional hexagonal ones”. It it true?</p>

<p>It’s a bit difficult to tell, because there are many brands of triangular pencil and they don’t all come with easy-to-interpret cross-sections or dimensions. A true Reuleaux triangle pencil would have a cross section with rounded sides and 120° corners, making the same angle as the corners of a hexagonal pencil, as shown in the upper left cross-section of the figure below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/tri-pencils.svg" alt="Hypothetical cross-sections of triangular and hexagonal pencils: upper left, Reuleaux triangle; upper right, hexagon; lower left, flat triangle with rounded corners; lower-right, smooth three-lobed curve of constant width" /></p>

<p>Instead, all the ones I found online appear to fall into two other classes of shapes: flat-sided triangles with rounded-off corners (lower left of the figure) or smooth three-lobed shapes with no corners at all (lower right). Here are some:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The best image I could find of the Dixon Tri-Conderoga is <a href="https://woodclinched.com/2010/09/15/tri-conderoga/">this brief post by Woodclinched</a>. It appears to be a smooth three-lobed shape. Dixon also produce a “Tri-Write” triangular pencil, aimed at a lower-level market than the Tri-Conderoga; the <a href="https://dixonticonderogacompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021_Dixon-Prod-Catalog_04.21.pdf">2021 Dixon product catalog</a> shows both it and the Tri-Conderoga as having a cross-section with slightly rounded sides (flatter than a Reuleaux triangle but not completely flat) and rounded corners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Faber-Castell Grip 2001 is another three-sided pencil, with added bumps on its sides to make it grippier. If we ignore the bumps for the purpose of determining its shape, <a href="https://www.penciltalk.org/2008/10/faber-castell-grip-2001-and-jumbo-grip-in-alternate-finishes">Pencil Talk shows it as a flat triangle with rounded corners</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Koh-I-Noor Triograph, as shown in <a href="https://www.penciltalk.org/2007/09/koh-i-noor-hardmuth-triograph-1830-pencil">a review by Pencil Talk</a>, has rounded corners, and flat-enough sides to clearly print the brand name in large letters on it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Lyra Ferby is a German children’s brand with a smooth three-lobed shape.</p>

    <p>The Marco Grip-Rite appears, from <a href="https://polarpencilpusher.home.blog/2019/07/11/pencil-review-marco-grip-rite-2b-w-bonus-sharpener/">its review by Polar Pencil Pusher</a>, to have a smooth three-lobed cross-section, even though the review calls it a Reuleaux triangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://micador.com.au/products/micador-jr-colourush-jumbo-pencils-fsc-100">Micador ColouRush Jumbo Triangular Pencils</a> (an Asutralian branch of children’s pencils) have a cross-section image on the manufacturer website clearly showing a flat triangle with rounded corners.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PaperMate make several triangular writing tools under the “Handwriting” brand, including PaperMate Handwriting woodcase pencils, aimed at children. I couldn’t find a good image of a cross-section of one, but their mechanical pencil in the same branch is clearly a smooth three-lobed shape. <a href="https://www.pencilrevolution.com/2019/03/papermate-handwriting-pencil/">Pencil Revolution</a> appears to show a similar shape for the wood pencils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t know what brand of pencils the IMA used for the photo of their example, but it appears to be one with flat sides and rounded corners.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I also didn’t find pencils with flat-sided triangles (and non-rounded or only very lightly rounded corners) as their cross-sections. But if you search for “triangle pencil” you will find plenty of colorful plastic things with that shape that you can slide over your pencil to make it easier to hold.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you whether any of these are any good to write or draw with; for that, I prefer fountain pens. (I don’t have an <a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/229621-modern-pens-the-omas-360/">Omas 360</a>, but that one really does appear to be based on a Reuleaux triangle.) Beyond writing, if you’re hoping for a pencil that doubles as a constant-width roller for rolling your books smoothly across your desk, and don’t want boring circular pencils, the smooth three-lobed ones may be your best bet. The one I drew above really is a curve of constant width. It’s just not a Reuleaux triangle.</p>

<p>This has been yet another episode of “things that are not Reuleaux triangles”. See previously <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/27/study-triangular-bottle.html">a triangular bottle</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/15/linkage.html">the Kölntriangle</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/02/constant-width-involutes.html">rotors within rotors</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/08/30/linkage.html">a Polish football logo</a>, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/05/shape-wankel-rotor.html">Wankel engines, and many more</a>.</p>

By
this we mean zero entropy, stabilization of all orbits, trivial asymptotic
dynamics, etc. These are purely transient irreversible dynamics, but they
capture many examples from the literature. A rich zoo of properties is
presented and discussed: nilpotency and asymptotic, generic or mu-variants,
unique ergodicity, convergence, bounded-changeness, freezingness. They all
correspond to the 'cold dynamics' paradigm in some way, and we study their
links and differences by various examples and results from the literature.
Besides dynamical considerations, we also focus on computational aspects: we
show how such 'cold cellular automata' can still compute under their dynamical
constraint, and what are their computational limitation.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>I have some exciting news (for me, anyway).  Starting next week, I’ll be going on leave from UT Austin for one year, to work at <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>.  They’re the creators of the astonishing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E2</a>, which have not only endlessly entertained me and my kids, but recalibrated my understanding of what, for better and worse, the world is going to look like for the rest of our lives.  Working with an amazing team at OpenAI, including <a href="https://jan.leike.name/">Jan Leike</a>, <a href="http://joschu.net/">John Schulman</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever">Ilya Sutskever</a>, my job will be think about the theoretical foundations of AI safety and alignment.  What, if anything, can computational complexity contribute to a principled understanding of how to get an AI to do what we want and not do what we don’t want?</p>



<p>Yeah, I don’t know the answer either.  That’s why I’ve got a whole year to try to figure it out!  One thing I know for sure, though, is that I’m interested <em>both</em> in the short-term, where new ideas are now quickly testable, and where the misuse of AI for spambots, surveillance, propaganda, and other nefarious purposes is already a major societal concern, <em>and</em> the long-term, where one might worry about what happens once AIs surpass human abilities across nearly every domain.  (And all the points in between: we might be in for a long, wild ride.)  When you start reading about AI safety, it’s striking how there are two separate communities—the one mostly worried about machine learning perpetuating racial and gender biases, and the one mostly worried about superhuman AI turning the planet into goo—who not only don’t work together, but are <em>at each other’s throats</em>, with each accusing the other of totally missing the point.  I persist, however, in the possibly-naïve belief that these are merely two extremes along a single continuum of AI worries.  By figuring out how to align AI with human values today—constantly confronting our theoretical ideas with reality—we can develop knowledge that will give us a better shot at aligning it with human values tomorrow.</p>



<p>For family reasons, I’ll be doing this work mostly from home, in Texas, though traveling from time to time to OpenAI’s office in San Francisco.  I’ll <em>also</em> spend 30% of my time continuing to run the Quantum Information Center at UT Austin and working with my students and postdocs.  At the end of the year, I plan to go back to full-time teaching, writing, and thinking about quantum stuff, which remains my main intellectual love in life, even as AI—the field where I started, as a PhD student, before I switched to quantum computing—has been taking over the world in ways that none of us can ignore.</p>



<p>Maybe fittingly, this new direction in my career had its origins here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>.  Several commenters, including <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6288#comment-1928020">Max Ra</a> and <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6288#comment-1928039">Matt Putz</a>, asked me point-blank what it would take to induce me to work on AI alignment.  Treating it as an amusing hypothetical, I replied that it wasn’t mostly about money for me, and that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The central thing would be finding an actual <em>potentially-answerable technical question</em> around AI alignment, even just a small one, that piqued my interest and that I felt like I had an unusual angle on. In general, I have an absolutely terrible track record at working on topics because I abstractly feel like I “should” work on them. My entire scientific career has basically just been letting myself get nerd-sniped by one puzzle after the next.</p></blockquote>



<p>Anyway, Jan Leike at OpenAI saw this exchange and wrote to ask whether I was serious in my interest.  Oh shoot!  Was I?  After intensive conversations with Jan, others at OpenAI, and others in the broader AI safety world, I finally concluded that I was.</p>



<p>I’ve obviously got my work cut out for me, just to catch up to what’s already been done in the field.  I’ve actually been in the Bay Area all week, meeting with numerous AI safety people (<em>and</em>, of course, complexity and quantum people), carrying a stack of technical papers on AI safety everywhere I go.  I’ve been struck by how, when I talk to AI safety experts, they’re not only <em>not dismissive</em> about the potential relevance of complexity theory, they’re more gung-ho about it than I am!  They want to talk about whether, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_(complexity)">IP=PSPACE</a>, or <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/mip2.pdf">MIP=NEXP</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCP_theorem">PCP theorem</a> could provide key insights about how we could verify the behavior of a powerful AI.  (Short answer: maybe, on some level!  But, err, more work would need to be done.)</p>



<p>How did this complexitophilic state of affairs come about?  That brings me to another wrinkle in the story.  Traditionally, students follow in the footsteps of their professors.  But in trying to bring complexity theory into AI safety, I’m actually following in the footsteps of my student: <a href="https://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a>, one of the greatest undergrads I worked with in my nine years at MIT, the student whose course project turned into the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4740">Aaronson-Christiano quantum money paper</a>.  After MIT, Paul did a PhD in quantum computing at Berkeley, with my own former adviser Umesh Vazirani, while <em>also</em> working part-time on AI safety.  Paul then left quantum computing to work on AI safety full-time—indeed, along with others such as Dario Amodei, he helped start the safety group at OpenAI.  Paul has since left to found his own AI safety organization, the <a href="https://alignment.org/">Alignment Research Center (ARC)</a>, although he remains on good terms with the OpenAI folks.  Paul is largely responsible for bringing complexity theory intuitions and analogies into AI safety—for example, through the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899">“AI safety via debate” paper</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08575">Iterated Amplification paper</a>.  I’m grateful for Paul’s guidance and encouragement—as well as that of the others now working in this intersection, like Geoffrey Irving and Elizabeth Barnes—as I start this new chapter.</p>



<p>So, what projects will I actually work on at OpenAI?  Yeah, I’ve been spending the past week trying to figure that out.  I still don’t know, but a few possibilities have emerged.  First, I might work out a general theory of sample complexity and so forth for learning in dangerous environments—i.e., learning where making the wrong query might kill you.  Second, I might work on explainability and interpretability for machine learning: given a deep network that produced a particular output, what do we even mean by an “explanation” for “why” it produced that output?  What can we say about the computational complexity of finding that explanation?  Third, I might work on the ability of weaker agents to verify the behavior of stronger ones.  Of course, if P≠NP, then the gap between the difficulty of solving a problem and the difficulty of recognizing a solution can sometimes be enormous.  And indeed, even in empirical machine learing, there’s typically a gap between the difficulty of <em>generating</em> objects (say, cat pictures) and the difficulty of <em>discriminating</em> between them and other objects, the latter being easier.  But this gap typically isn’t exponential, as is conjectured for NP-complete problems: it’s much smaller than that.  And counterintuitively, we can then turn around and use the generators to improve the discriminators.  How can we understand this abstractly?  Are there model scenarios in complexity theory where we can prove that something similar happens?  How far can we amplify the generator/discriminator gap—for example, by using interactive protocols, or debates between competing AIs?</p>



<p>OpenAI, of course, has the word “open” right in its name, and a founding mission “to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”  But it’s also a for-profit enterprise, with investors and paying customers and serious competitors.  So throughout the year, don’t expect me to share any proprietary information—that’s not my interest anyway, even if I <em>hadn’t</em> signed an NDA.  But <em>do</em> expect me to blog my general thoughts about AI safety as they develop, and to solicit feedback from readers.</p>



<p>In the past, I’ve often been skeptical about the prospects for superintelligent AI becoming self-aware and destroying the world anytime soon (see, for example, my 2008 post <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=346">The Singularity Is Far</a>).  While I was aware since 2005 or so of the AI-risk community; and of its leader and prophet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>; and of Eliezer’s exhortations for people to drop everything else they’re doing and work on AI risk, as the biggest issue facing humanity, I … kept the whole thing at arms’ length.  Even <em>supposing</em> I agreed that this was a huge thing to worry about, I asked, what on earth do you want me to do about it today?  We know so little about a future superintelligent AI and how it would behave that any actions we took today would likely be useless or counterproductive.</p>



<p>Over the past 15 years, though, my and Eliezer’s views underwent a dramatic and ironic reversal.  If you read Eliezer’s <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities">“litany of doom”</a> from two weeks ago, you’ll see that he’s now resigned and fatalistic: because his early warnings weren’t heeded, he argues, humanity is almost certainly doomed and an unaligned AI will soon destroy the world.  He says that there are basically <em>no</em> promising directions in AI safety research: for any alignment strategy anyone points out, Eliezer can trivially refute it by explaining how (e.g.) the AI would be wise to the plan, and would pretend to go along with whatever we wanted from it while secretly plotting against us.</p>



<p>The weird part is, just as Eliezer became more and more pessimistic about the prospects for getting anywhere on AI alignment, I’ve become more and more <em>optimistic</em>.  Part of my optimism is because people like Paul Christiano have laid foundations for a meaty mathematical theory: much like the Web (or quantum computing theory) in 1992, it’s still in a ridiculously primitive stage, but even <em>my</em> limited imagination now suffices to see how much more could be built there.  An even greater part of my optimism is because we now live in a world with GPT-3, DALL-E2, and other systems that, while they clearly aren’t AGIs, are powerful enough that worrying about AGIs has come to seem more like prudence than like science fiction. And we can finally test our intuitions against the realities of these systems, which (outside of mathematics) is pretty much the only way human beings have ever succeeded at anything.</p>



<p>I didn’t predict that machine learning models this impressive would exist by 2022.  Most of you probably didn’t predict it.  For godsakes, <em>Eliezer Yudkowsky</em> didn’t predict it.  But it’s happened.  And to my mind, one of the defining virtues of science is that, when empirical reality gives you a clear shock, you update and adapt, rather than expending your intelligence to come up with clever reasons why it doesn’t matter or doesn’t count.</p>



<p>Anyway, so that’s the plan!  If I can figure out a way to save the galaxy, I will, but I’ve set my goals slightly lower, at learning some new things and doing some interesting research and writing some papers about it and enjoying a break from teaching.  Wish me a non-negligible success probability!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p><strong>Update (June 18):</strong> To respond to a couple criticisms that I’ve seen elsewhere on social media…</p>



<p><strong>Can the rationalists sneer at me for waiting to get involved with this subject until it had become sufficiently “respectable,” “mainstream,” and ”high-status”? </strong> I suppose they can, if that’s their inclination.  I suppose I should be grateful that so many of them chose to respond instead with messages of congratulations and encouragement.   Yes, I plead guilty to keeping this subject at arms-length until I could point to GPT-3 and DALL-E2 and the other dramatic advances of the past few years to justify the reality of the topic to anyone who might criticize me.  It <em>feels</em> internally like I had principled reasons for this: I can think of almost no examples of research programs that succeeded over decades even in the teeth of opposition from the scientific mainstream.  If so, then arguably the best time to get involved with a “fringe” scientific topic, is when and only when you can foresee a path to it <em>becoming</em> the scientific mainstream.  At any rate, that’s what I did with quantum computing, as a teenager in the mid-1990s.  It’s what many scientists of the 1930s did with the prospect of nuclear chain reactions.  And if I’d optimized for getting the right answer earlier, I might’ve had to weaken the filters and let in a bunch of dubious worries that would’ve paralyzed me.  But I admit the possibility of self-serving bias here.</p>



<p><strong>Should you worry that OpenAI is just hiring me to be able to say “look, we have Scott Aaronson working on the problem,” rather than actually caring about what its safety researchers come up with? </strong> I mean, I can’t prove that you <em>shouldn’t</em> worry about that.  In the end, whatever work I do on the topic will have to speak for itself.  For whatever it’s worth, though, I was impressed by the OpenAI folks’ detailed, open-ended engagement with these questions when I met them—sort of like how it might look if they actually believed what they said about wanting to get this right for the world.  I wouldn’t have gotten involved otherwise.</p></div>

<p>Apologies for not writing anything for awhile.  After <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine">Feb 24</a>, the <em>math </em>part of the “<em></em>” slogan lost a bit of relevance, while the actual events were stupefying to the point when I had nothing to say about the <em>life </em>part.  Now that the shock subsided, let me break the silence by telling an old personal story  which is neither relevant to anything happening right now nor a lesson to anyone.  Sometimes a story is just a story… </p>

<h4>My field</h4>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>As the readers of this blog know, I am a <em><strong></strong></em>.  Not a “proud one”.  Just “a combinatorialist”.  To paraphrase a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed">military slogan</a> “there are many fields like this one, but this one is mine”.  While I’ve been <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-ds">defending</a> my field <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-sq">for years</a>, writing about <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-ds">its struggles</a>, and often <a href="https://wp.me/p211iQ-bQ">defining it</a>, it’s not because this field is more important than others. Rather, because it’s so…</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>A day or two after publishing my <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary">TL;DR on Wordle algorithms</a>, I stumbled on a remarkable paper that neatly summarizes all the main ideas. The remarkable part is that the paper was written 50 years before Wordle was invented!</p>
<p>The paper is “<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6192">Information Theory and the Game of Jotto</a>,” issued in August of 1971 as Artificial Intelligence Memo No. 28 from the AI Lab at MIT. The author was Michael D. Beeler, known to me mainly as one of the three principal authors of <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6086/AIM-239.pdf">HAKMEM</a> (the others were Bill Gosper and Rich Schroeppel). Beeler later worked at Bolt, Baranek, and Newman, an MIT spinoff.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jotto">Wikipedia</a> tells me that Jotto was invented in 1955 by Morton M. Rosenfeld as a game for two players. As in Wordle, you try to discover a secret word by submitting guess words and getting feedback about how close you have come to the target. The big difference is that JOTTO’s feedback offers only a crude measure of closeness. You learn the number of letters in your guess word that match one of the letters in the target word. You get no indication of <em>which</em> letters match, or whether they are in the correct positions.</p>
<p>The unit of measure for closeness is the jot. Beeler gives the example of playing GLASS against SMILE, which earns a closeness score of two jots, since there are matches for the letter L and for one S. Unlike the Wordle feedback rule, this scoring scheme is symmetric: The score remains the same if you switch the roles of guess and target word.</p>
<p>A defect of the game, in my view, is that you can max out the score at five jots and still not know the target word. For example, when a five-jot score tells you that the letters of the target are {A, E, G, L, R}, the word could be GLARE, LAGER, LARGE, or REGAL. Your only way to pin down the answer is to guess them in sequence.</p>
<p>Beeler’s main topic is not how the game proceeds between human players but how a computer can be programmed to take the role of a player. He reports that “A JOTTO program has existed for a couple of years at MIT’s A.I. Lab,” meaning it was created sometime in the late 1960s. He says nothing about who wrote this program. I’m going to make the wild surmise that Beeler himself might have been the author, particularly given his intimate knowledge of the program’s innards.</p>
<p>Here’s the crucial passage, lifted directly from the memo:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Beeler-block-quote-on-JOTTO.png" height="217" width="640" alt="Beeler block quote on JOTTO" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>The strategy described here—maximizing the information gain from each guess—is exactly what’s recommended for Wordle. But where Wordle divvies up the potential target words into \(3^5 = 243\) subsets, the JOTTO scoring rule defines only six categories (0 through 5 jots). As a result, the maximum possible information gain is only about 2.6 bits in JOTTO, compared with almost 8 bits in Wordle. </p>
<p>Beeler also recognized a limitation of this “greedy” strategy. “It is conceivable that the test word with the highest expectation at the current point in the game has a good chance of getting us to a point where we will NOT have any particularly good test words available . . . I am indebted to Bill Gosper for pointing out this possibility; the computation required, however, is impractical, and besides, the program seems to do acceptably as is.”</p>
<p>The JOTTO program was written in the assembly language of the <a href="http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/_Books/Bell-ComputerEngineering.pdf">PDP-6 and PDP-10 family of machines</a> from the Digital Equipment Corporation, which were much loved in that era at MIT. (Beeler praises the instruction set as “very symmetrical, complete, powerful and easy to think in.”) But however elegant the architecture, physical resources were cramped, with a maximum memory capacity of about one megabyte. Nevertheless, Beeler found room for the program itself, for a dictionary of about 7,000 words, and for tables of precomputed responses to the first two or three guesses.</p>

    <p>From a face-up deck of cards, repeatedly deal off the number of cards showing on the top card (counting Jacks as 11, etc.). What’s the probability that you empty the deck by dealing out exactly the right number of cards in the last step? <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@christianp/108401164015456979">Christian Lawson-Perfect’s post</a> inspired a group discussion leading to the result that, for decks with large numbers of suits, the answer should tend to 1/7, and that for a standard 52-card deck it is approximately 0.1420342593977892.</p>

If the red vertical segment is to be an MST edge, the outer white lens needs to be empty of other points; this emptiness implies that the edge is part of the relative neighborhood graph. The emptiness of the light blue diameter circle inside the lens defines the Gabriel graph in the same way. The inner rhombus must not only be empty, but disjoint from the rhombi of other edges.</p>

We introduce and analyse an efficient decoder for the quantum Tanner codes that can correct adversarial errors of linear weight. Previous decoders for quantum low-density parity-check codes could only handle adversarial errors of weight $O(\sqrt{n \log n})$. We also work on the link between quantum Tanner codes and the Lifted Product codes of Panteleev and Kalachev, and show that our decoder can be adapted to the latter. The decoding algorithm alternates between sequential and parallel procedures and converges in linear time.</div>

<p>Infinite sets of points in the Euclidean plane, even discrete sets, do not always have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree">Euclidean minimum spanning trees</a>. For instance, consider the points with coordinates</p>

\[\left(i, \pm\left(1+\frac1i\right)\right),\]

<p>for positive <span style="white-space: nowrap;">integers \(i\).</span> You can connect the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">positive-\(y\)</span> points and the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">negative-\(y\)</span> points into two chains with edges of length less than two, but then you have to pick one edge of length greater than two to span from one chain to the other. Whichever edge you choose, the next edge along would always be a better choice. So a tree that minimizes the multiset of its edge weights (as finite minimum spanning trees do) does not exist for this example. And as the same example shows, the sum of edge weights may be infinite, so how can we use minimization of this sum to define a tree?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/ladder-no-mst.svg" alt="Discrete infinite set of points with no Euclidean minimum spanning tree" /></p>

<p>Despite that, here’s a construction that works for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space">compact set</a>, even one with infinitely many components, and that generalizes easily to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces. I think it deserves to be called the Euclidean minimum spanning tree. Given a compact <span style="white-space: nowrap;">set \(C\),</span> consider every partition \(C=A\cup (C\setminus A)\) of \(C\) into two disjoint nonempty compact subsets. For each such partition, find a line segment \(s_A\) of minimum length with endpoints in \(A\) <span style="white-space: nowrap;">and \(C\setminus A\),</span> breaking ties lexicographically by coordinates. By the assumed compactness of \(A\) <span style="white-space: nowrap;">and \(C\setminus A\),</span> such a line segment exists. Let \(T_C\) be the union of \(C\) itself and of all line segments obtained in this way. For example, the union of a triangle, square, and circle shown below has three partitions into two nonempty compact subsets, separating one of these three shapes from the other two. Two of these partitions choose the diagonal pink segment as their shortest connection, and the third partition chooses the horizontal pink segment. So in this case, \(T_C\) consists of the three blue given shapes and two pink segments.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/trisquircle.svg" alt="Minimum spanning tree of a circle, square, and triangle" /></p>

<p>When \(C\) is a finite point set, \(T_C\) is just a Euclidean minimum spanning tree. When \(C\) has finitely many connected components, like the example above, \(T_C\) is again a minimum spanning tree, for the component-component distances. In the general case, \(T_C\) still has many of the familiar properties of Euclidean minimum spanning trees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It consists of the input and a collection of line segments connecting pairs of input points, by construction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_space">connected set</a>. Topologically, this means that it cannot be covered by two disjoint open sets that both have a nonempty intersection with it. (This is different from being path-connected, a stronger property.) Any nontrivial open disjoint cover of \(C\) would be spanned by a line segment from one set to the other, and no new disjoint covers can separate these line segments from their endpoints.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For any added <span style="white-space: nowrap;">segment \(s_A\),</span> the intersection of two disks with that segment as radius (a “lune”) has no point of \(C\) in its interior. Any interior point would form one end of a shorter connecting segment between \(A\) <span style="white-space: nowrap;">and \(C\setminus A\),</span> with the other end at an endpoint <span style="white-space: nowrap;">of \(s_A\).</span> No two added segments can cross without violating the empty lune property.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/vesica.svg" alt="The empty lune of an edge" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For any added <span style="white-space: nowrap;">segment \(s_A\),</span> the open rhombus with angles \(60^\circ\) and \(120^\circ\) having \(s_A\) as its long diagonal is disjoint from the rhombi formed in the same way from the other segments. Any two overlapping rhombi would allow the longer of the two segments they come from to be replaced by a shorter segment crossing the same compact partition, on a three-segment path connecting its endpoints via the other segment endpoints. Because these non-overlapping rhombi cover a region of bounded area, the squared segment lengths have a bounded sum, and only finitely many segments can be longer than any given length threshold.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/ivy-rhombs.svg" alt="An infinite minimum spanning tree and its empty rhombi" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The union of \(C\) with any subset of added segments is compact. If \(p\) is a limit point of a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">sequence \(\sigma_i\)</span> of points in this union, it must either lie in the empty rhombus of a segment (in which case it can only be a point of the same segment), or it is a limit point of a sequence of points <span style="white-space: nowrap;">in \(C\),</span> obtained by replacing each point in \(\sigma_i\) that is interior to a segment by the nearest segment endpoint. This replacement only increases the distance from the replaced point to \(p\) by a constant factor, which does not affect convergence. By compactness the replaced sequence converges to a point <span style="white-space: nowrap;">in \(C\).</span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <span style="white-space: nowrap;">any \(i\),</span> the set \(T_i\) of the largest \(i\) added segments (with the same tie-breaking order) are edges of a minimum spanning tree for a family of \(i-1\) sets. To construct these sets, find the components of the union of \(C\) with all shorter segments, and intersect each component <span style="white-space: nowrap;">with \(C\).</span> None of these components can cross between \(A\) and \(C\setminus A\) for any <span style="white-space: nowrap;">edge \(s_A\in T_i\).</span> Because adding \(T_i\) connects all these components, there can be at most \(i-1\) components. Each edge in \(T_i\) is shortest (with a consistent tie-breaking rule) across some partition of the components, one of the ways of determining the edges in a finite minimum spanning tree. In particular, \(T_C\) is minimally connected: removing any edge \(s_A\in S_i\) separates some of the components from each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(T_C\) has the minimum sum of squared edge lengths of all collections of line segments between points of \(C\) that <span style="white-space: nowrap;">connect \(C\).</span> To see this, consider any other connecting set \(X\) of line segments with a finite sum of squared edge lengths. Truncate the sorted sequence of edges of \(T_C\) to a finite initial <span style="white-space: nowrap;">sequence \(T_i\)</span> such that the rest of the sequence has negligible sum of squares. Because \(T_i\) is a minimum spanning tree of its components, and \(X\) connects those same components (perhaps redundantly), the sequence of edge lengths in \(T_i\) is, step for step, less than or equal to the sorted sequence of lengths <span style="white-space: nowrap;">in \(X\).</span></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There may exist other sets of line segments that connect \(C\) with the same sum of squared edge lengths but they all are minimally connected, with the same sequence of edge lengths, the same empty lune and empty rhombus properties, and the same property that their initial sequences form finite minimum spanning trees of their components.</p>

Tony Hoare is also known informally as Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare. He has made key contributions to programming languages, algorithms, operating systems, formal verification, and concurrent computing. </p>
<p>
He won the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hoare_4622167.cfm">1980 Turing Award</a> for <i>“Fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages.”</i> </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Quicksort </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Hoare invented a new sorting algorithm in 1959. It was not later directly cited in his winning of the Turing Award—see above. Back then Hoare was a visiting student at Moscow State University. His student project at the time needed to sort words in Russian sentences before looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary, which was in alphabetical order on a magnetic tape. He tried insertion sort but it was too slow, and so he invented a new sorting algorithm—it is now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a>. Amazing. </p>
<p>
On his return to England, he was asked to write code for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort">Shellsort</a>. Hoare mentioned to his boss that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he did not. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Quicksort is well named—it is a winner.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> And Still Champion </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The most amazing thing to me—Ken writing this and the next section—-is that Quicksort has remained the champion sorter. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Mergesort</a> was earlier but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort">Heapsort</a> came five years later. No one has improved on Hoare’s idea to focus on <em>swaps</em> that improve the sortedness of two elements at once, both jumping over a guiding element called the <em>pivot</em>.</p>
<p>
Mergesort and Heapsort guarantee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" /> time to sort <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> items, whereas Quicksort does not. Yet careful implementations of Quicksort almost always evade slow outcomes. Then they beat Mergesort and Heapsort and all other sorting methods cleanly in terms of the constant under the “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O}" class="latex" />.” </p>
<p>
The algorithms-and-data-structures course I taught at UB this past term includes sorting algorithms. I have brought together and polished code instances I showed during the term to compare these three algorithms in one <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/DataStructures/Sorts.scala">code file</a>. It is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> programming language. The program has options described at the top, such as setting the “tradeoff point” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m}" class="latex" /> so that on recursive calls to sort pieces of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m}" class="latex" />, the code uses Insertion Sort instead. It counts comparisons and copies of items separately, as well as report the time in milliseconds. A swap counts as three not two copies. </p>
<p>
Here is an example run on the English <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/DataStructures/WarAndPeace.txt">text</a> of <em>War and Peace</em> using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+16%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m = 16}" class="latex" /> for both Quicksort and Mergesort. I wanted to salute Hoare’s application by using the original Russian text, but every file of it I found was densely footnoted. The Russian version doesn’t begin in Russian anyway. I’ve edited the output slightly.<br />

This used the strategy of selecting the median of three randomly sampled elements of the array piece to be sorted as the pivot. Quicksort runs quickest when the pivot is the median, but it takes too long to find the exact median at each level of recursion. My program has the option “<font size="+1"><tt>ninther</tt></font>” to select the median of three such median-of-3 samples, as <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/06/23/tukey-median-ninther/">proposed</a> by John Tukey. Try my code to see if <font size="+1"><tt>ninther</tt></font> works faster and with fewer comparisons on your system. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Empirical Testing and Proving </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The person whose 1975 PhD <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1975Quicksort.pdf">dissertation</a> studied the performance of Quicksort implementations with rigor and depth was none other than Bob Sedgewick, whose retirement party Dick recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/04/sedgewick-to-emeritus-status/">covered</a>. This led into Bob’s famous textbook <a href="https://sedgewick.io/books/algorithms/"><em>Algorithms</em></a>, which is now in its fourth edition with Kevin Wayne as co-author. Bob’s separate <a href="https://github.com/chrswt/algorithms-sedgewick/blob/master/notes/2.3-quicksort.md">notes</a> accompanying the book point out an aspect vital to running on inputs like <em>War and Peace</em> that have many identical (keys of) items. The simple partition for a pivot <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> into </p>
<p>
<code><br />
               [ elements &lt;= p ][ p ][ elements &gt;= p ]<br />
</code></p>
<p></p><p><br />
winds up doing many extra comparisons of keys equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" />. The extra initial effort to determine a 3-way partition</p>
<p>
<code><br />
               [ elements &lt; p ][ elements == p ][ elements &gt; p ]<br />
</code></p>
<p></p><p><br />
pays off in the recursion, which only needs to be on the outer two segments. Without this trick, Quicksort—on even a relatively high-entropy source like <em>War and Peace</em>—degrades to be worse than the other two algorithms. </p>
<p>
My code allows making all words distinct by setting the fifth bit. Then Quicksort makes more comparisons and copies than Mergesort. Yet it still runs almost 40% faster in my tests. As explained in general <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort-vs-merge-sort">here</a>, this is because the Quicksort gives better cache locality. Heapsort likewise runs in-place, but not with locality. </p>
<p>
The assertions itemized in this section are unimpeachable. But in what sense, and to what degree, are they <b>formally provable</b>? </p>
<p>
There is also a difference from the criterion of <b>reproducibility</b> in the sciences. The environmental conditions for reproducing an experiment are presumed to be closed and given. The primacy of Quicksort, however, applies to processing architectures that were unknown at the time of Sedgewick’s 1975 thesis, let alone Hoare’s 1959 concept. It is a more open-ended prediction that if you run mine or similar code on your system—in machine environments I may know nothing about—it will give much the same time performance.</p>
<p>
Now back to Dick, about Hoare’s take on formally proving properties of programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Hoare Logic </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Hoare invented a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">logic</a> for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs ten years later in 1969. It was directly counted toward his winning of the Turing Award. It was based on original ideas created by Robert Floyd, who had published a system for flowcharts. The logic is now known as Hoare logic—see <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/Hoare-CACM-69.pdf">this</a> for details. This is one of the most influential papers on the theory of programming. In this paper Hoare showed how to reason about program execution using logical specifications of statement behavior that has become known as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/654-sp09/notes/3-hoare-notes.pdf">Hoare triples</a>.</p>
<p>
A Hoare triple has three parts, a precondition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />, a program statement or series of statements <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />, and a postcondition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" />. It’s is usually written in the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5C%7BP%5C%7D+S+%5C%7BQ%5C%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \{P\} S \{Q\} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The meaning is “if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> is true before <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> is executed, and if the execution of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> terminates, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" /> is true afterwards”. Note that the triple does not assert that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> will terminate; that requires a separate proof. As a simple example: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5C%7Bx%2B1%3D43%5C%7Dy%3A%3Dx%2B1%5C%7By%3D43%5C%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \{x+1=43\}y:=x+1\{y=43\} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
A key motivation for Hoare Logic is to be able to prove the correctness of real systems with real programs. The fact that Hoare Logic is possible is clear. It is possible to use it to <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.1739&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">prove</a> Quicksort, for example. But it is less clear whether or not we will be able to apply formal methods to complex practical systems. This is a topic that I have thought about for decades. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Codex </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Saturday’s Washington Post has a tech <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/">article</a>, “The Google engineer who thinks the company’s AI has come to life.” This prompted us to visit a long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/magazine/ai-language.html">article</a> in the April 15 New York Times Magazine on Open AI’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> language engine. </p>
<p>
GPT-3 works by playing a game of <em>guess the next word</em> in a phrase. This is akin to <em>guess the next move</em> in chess and other games, and we will have more to say about it. For an example with wider context, suppose we fed it this post up before this section, and then gave it “<b>A Cod-</b>” as the partially completed section title. Since this comes at the end, GPT-3 might guess <b>coda</b>. Or since this is an addendum, maybe <b>codicil</b>. A <b>codex</b>, on the other hand, is a large manuscript book.</p>
<p>
In fact, we do mean <i>codex</i>, or rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex">Codex</a>, which is an offshoot of GPT-3 for generating code in a wide variety of programming languages. Its emergence creates a new riff on our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/10/discussion-about-proving-again/">discussion</a> on proving and how <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/">software</a> projects have stayed robust while growing far beyond the scale on which they can be formally proved. Now <a href="https://openai.com/blog/codex-apps/">Codex</a> ventures to write one’s software by gleaning the intent from one’s prose specification—by drawing on millions of available coding projects that give relatable specifications. </p>
<p>
Is program output from Codex <em>proven</em>—or <em>provable</em>? This will be a challenge. It may be more feasible to integrate Codex with projects like the <a href="https://vst.cs.princeton.edu/">Verified Software Toolchain</a> led Andrew Appel, Lennart Beringer, William Mansky, and Qinshi Wang. This is at any rate further grist for discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Take a look at <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">this</a> for comments about the recent Harry Lewis <a href="https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/2021/05/26/debate-that-changed-programming-living-history/">debate</a>. This was based on our <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a>. </p>

<p>… on Blake Lemoine, the Google engineer who <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/blake-lemoine-lamda-sentient-artificial-intelligence-google_n_62a5613ee4b06169ca8c0a2e?d_id=3887326&amp;ref=bffbhuffpost&amp;ncid_tag=fcbklnkushpmg00000063&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_campaign=us_main&amp;fbclid=IwAR0o5U4wv2cDP8o3XIAekj2Xh5wVPZVzVhyH696N8tnLv_m-YXtUDt0tFNU">became convinced</a> that a machine learning model had become sentient, contacted federal government agencies about it, and was then <s>fired</s> placed on administrative leave for violating Google’s confidentiality policies.</p>



<p>(1) I don’t think Lemoine is right that <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a> is at all sentient, but the <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917">transcript</a> is so mind-bogglingly impressive that I did have to stop and think for a second! Certainly, if you sent the transcript back in time to 1990 or whenever, even an expert reading it might say, yeah, it looks like by 2022 AGI has more likely been achieved than not (“but can I run my own tests?”).  Read it for yourself, if you haven’t yet.</p>



<p>(2) Reading Lemoine’s <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cajundiscordian">Twitter</a> this morning, he holds many views that I disagree with, not just about the sentience of LaMDA. Yet I’m touched and impressed by how principled he is, and I expect I’d hit it off with him if I met him. I wish that a solution could be found where Google wouldn’t fire him.</p></div>

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $d = o(\log \log n)$, we prove that there is a Boolean function $F$ on $n$ bits and a value $\gamma = 2^{-\Theta(d)}$ such that $F$ can be computed by a uniform depth-$(d + 1)$ $\text{AC}^0$ circuit with $O(n)$ wires, but $F$ cannot be computed by any depth-$d$ $\text{TC}^0$ circuit with $n^{1 + \gamma}$ wires. This bound matches the current state-of-the-art lower bounds for computing explicit functions by threshold circuits of depth $d &gt; 2$, which were previously known only for functions outside $\text{AC}^0$ such as the parity function. Furthermore, in our result, the $\text{AC}^0$ circuit computing $F$ is a monotone *read-once formula* (i.e., an AND-OR tree), and the lower bound holds even in the average-case setting with respect to advantage $n^{-\gamma}$.

Our proof builds on the *random projection* procedure of Håstad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan, which they used to prove the celebrated average-case depth hierarchy theorem for $\text{AC}^0$ (J. ACM, 2017). We show that under a modified version of their projection procedure, any depth-$d$ threshold circuit with $n^{1 + \gamma}$ wires simplifies to a near-trivial function, whereas an appropriately parameterized AND-OR tree of depth $d + 1$ maintains structure.</div>

<p>Thanks so much to everyone who sent messages of support following my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6444">last post</a>!  I vowed there that I’m going to stop letting online trolls and sneerers occupy so much space in my mental world.  Truthfully, though, while there <em>are</em> many trolls and sneerers who terrify me, there are also some who merely amuse me.  A good example of the latter came a few weeks ago, when an anonymous commenter calling themselves “String Theorist” submitted the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s honestly funny to me when you [Scott] call yourself a “nerd” or a “prodigy” or whatever <em>[I don’t recall ever calling myself a “prodigy,” which would indeed be cringe, though “nerd” certainly —SA]</em>, as if studying quantum computing, which is essentially nothing more than glorified linear algebra, is such an advanced intellectual achievement. For what it’s worth I’m a theoretical physicist, I’m in a completely different field, and I was still able to learn Shor’s algorithm in about half an hour, that’s how easy this stuff is. I took a look at some of your papers on arXiv and the math really doesn’t get any more advanced than linear algebra. To understand quantum circuits about the most advanced concept is a tensor product which is routinely covered in undergraduate linear algebra. Wheras in my field of string theory grasping, for instance, holographic dualities relating confirmal field theories and gravity requires vastly more expertise (years of advanced study). I actually find it pretty entertaining that you’ve said yourself you’re still struggling to understand QFT, which most people I’m working with in my research group were first exposed to in undergrad <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="😉" />  The truth is we’re in entirely different leagues of intelligence (“nerdiness”) and any of your qcomputing papers could easily be picked up by a first or second year math major. It’s just a joke that this is even a field (quantum complexity theory) with journals and faculty when the results in your papers that I’ve seen are pretty much trivial and don’t require anything more than undergraduate level maths.</p></blockquote>



<p>Why does this sort of trash-talk, reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubo%C5%A1_Motl">Luboš Motl</a>, no longer ruffle me?  Mostly because the boundaries between quantum computing theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity, which were never clear in the first place, have steadily gotten fuzzier.  Even in the 1990s, the field of quantum computing attracted amazing physicists—folks who definitely <em>do</em> know quantum field theory—such as Ed Farhi, John Preskill, and Ray Laflamme.  Decades later, it would be fair to say that the physicists have banged their heads against many of the same questions that we computer scientists have banged <em>our</em> heads against, oftentimes in collaboration with us.  And yes, there were cases where actual knowledge of particle physics gave physicists an advantage—with some famous examples being the algorithms of Farhi and collaborators (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation">adiabatic algorithm</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209131">quantum walk on conjoined trees</a>, the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=207">NAND-tree algorithm</a>).  There were other cases where computer scientists’ knowledge gave <em>them</em> an advantage: I wouldn’t know many details about that, but conceivably shadow tomography, BosonSampling, PostBQP=PP?  Overall, it’s been what you wish <em>every</em> indisciplinary collaboration could be.</p>



<p>What’s new, in the last decade, is that the scientific conversation centered around quantum information and computation has dramatically “metastasized,” to encompass not only a good fraction of all the experimentalists doing quantum optics and sensing and metrology and so forth, and not only a good fraction of all the condensed-matter theorists, but even many leading string theorists and quantum gravity theorists, including Susskind, Maldacena, Bousso, Hubeny, Harlow, and yes, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11965">Witten</a>.  And I don’t think it’s <em>just</em> that they’re too professional to trash-talk quantum information people the way commenter “String Theorist” does.  Rather it’s that, because of the intellectual success of “It from Qubit,” we’re increasingly participating in the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpzigpEJnU">conversations</a> and working on the same technical questions.  One particularly exciting such question, which I’ll have more to say about in a future post, is the truth or falsehood of the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis for observers who jump into black holes.</p>



<p>Not to psychoanalyze, but I’ve noticed a pattern wherein, the more secure a scientist is about their position within their own field, the readier they are to admit ignorance about the <em>neighboring</em> fields, to learn about those fields, and to reach out to the experts in them, to ask simple or (as it usually turns out) not-so-simple questions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>I can’t imagine any better illustration of these tendencies better than the 28th Solvay Conference on the Physics of Quantum Information, which I attended two weeks ago in Brussels on my 41st birthday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solvay.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="" src="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solvay-1024x578.jpg" class="wp-image-6466" height="578" /></a>As others pointed out, the proportion of women is not as high as we all wish, but it’s higher than in 1911, when there was exactly one: Madame Curie herself.</figure>



<p>It was my first trip out of the US since before COVID—indeed, I’m so out of practice that I nearly missed my flights in <em>both</em> directions, in part because of my lack of familiarity with the COVID protocols for transatlantic travel, as well as the immense lines caused by those protocols.  My former adviser Umesh Vazirani, who was also at the Solvay Conference, was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=40">proud</a>.</p>



<p>The Solvay Conference is the venue where, legendarily, the fundamentals of quantum mechanics got hashed out between 1911 and 1927, by the likes of Einstein, Bohr, Planck, and Curie.  (Einstein complained, in a letter, about being called away from his work on general relativity to attend a <a href="https://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2011/05/epn2011425p15.pdf">“witches’ sabbath.”</a>)  Remarkably, it’s still being held in Brussels every few years, and still funded by the same Solvay family that started it.  The once-every-few-years schedule has, we were constantly reminded, been interrupted only three times in its 110-year history: once for WWI, once for WWII, and now once for COVID (this year’s conference was supposed to be in 2020).</p>



<p>This was the first ever Solvay conference organized around the theme of quantum information, and apparently, the first ever that counted computer scientists among its participants (me, Umesh Vazirani, Dorit Aharonov, Urmila Mahadev, and Thomas Vidick).  There were four topics: (1) many-body physics, (2) quantum gravity, (3) quantum computing hardware, and (4) quantum algorithms.  The structure, apparently unchanged since the conference’s founding, is this: everyone attends every session, without exception.  They sit around facing each other the whole time; no one ever stands to lecture.  For each topic, two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapporteur">“rapporteurs”</a> introduce the topic with half-hour prepared talks; then there are short prepared response talks as well as an hour or more of unstructured discussion.  Everything everyone says is recorded in order to be published later.</p>

<p>Daniel Gottesman and I were the two rapporteurs for quantum algorithms: Daniel spoke about quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, and I spoke about <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/aar-solvay.ppt">“How Much Structure Is Needed for Huge Quantum Speedups?”</a>  The link goes to my PowerPoint slides, if you’d like to check them out.  I tried to survey 30 years of history of that question, from Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, to huge speedups in quantum query complexity (e.g., glued trees and Forrelation), to the recent quantum supremacy experiments based on BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, all the way to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">breakthrough</a> by Yamakawa and Zhandry a couple months ago.  The last slide hypothesizes a “Law of Conservation of Weirdness,” which after all these decades still remains to be undermined: “For every problem that admits an exponential quantum speedup, there must be some weirdness in its detailed statement, which the quantum algorithm exploits to focus amplitude on the rare right answers.”  My title slide also shows <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E2</a>‘s impressionistic take on the title question, “how much structure is needed for huge quantum speedups?”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/speedups.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="" src="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/speedups-1024x418.jpg" class="wp-image-6474" height="418" /></a></figure>



<p>The discussion following my talk was largely a debate between me and Ed Farhi, reprising many debates he and I have had over the past 20 years: Farhi urged optimism about the prospect for large, practical quantum speedups via algorithms like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028">QAOA</a>, pointing out his group’s past successes and explaining how they wouldn’t have been possible without an optimistic attitude.  For my part, I praised the past successes and said that optimism is well and good, but at the same time, companies, venture capitalists, and government agencies are right now pouring billions into quantum computing, in many cases—as I know from talking to them—because of a mistaken impression that QCs are <em>already known</em> to be able to revolutionize machine learning, finance, supply-chain optimization, or whatever other application domains they care about, and to do so <em>soon</em>.  They’re genuinely surprised to learn that the consensus of QC experts is in a totally different place.  And to be clear: among quantum computing theorists, I’m not at all unusually pessimistic or skeptical, just unusually willing to say in public what others say in private.</p>



<p>Afterwards, one of the string theorists said that Farhi’s arguments with me had been a highlight … and I agreed.  What’s the point of a friggin’ Solvay Conference if everyone’s just going to <em>agree</em> with each other?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Besides quantum algorithms, there was naturally lots of animated discussion about the practical prospects for building scalable quantum computers.  While I’d hoped that this discussion might change the impressions I’d come with, it mostly confirmed them.  Yes, the problem is staggeringly hard.  Recent ideas for fault-tolerance, including the use of LDPC codes and bosonic codes, might help.  Gottesman’s talk gave me the insight that, at its core, quantum fault-tolerance is all about <em>testing</em>, <em>isolation</em>, and <em>contact-tracing</em>, just for bit-flip and phase-flip errors rather than viruses.  Alas, we don’t yet have the quantum fault-tolerance analogue of a vaccine!</p>



<p>At one point, I asked the trapped-ion experts in open session if they’d comment on the startup company <a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a>, whose stock price recently fell precipitously in the wake of a scathing analyst report.  Alas, none of them took the bait.</p>



<p>On a different note, I was tremendously excited by the quantum gravity session.  Netta Engelhardt spoke about her and others’ <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/netta-engelhardt-has-escaped-hawkings-black-hole-paradox-20210823/">celebrated recent work</a> explaining the Page curve of an evaporating black hole using Euclidean path integrals—and by questioning her and others during coffee breaks, I finally got a handwavy intuition for how it works.  There was also lots of debate, again at coffee breaks, about Susskind’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpzigpEJnU">recent speculations</a> on observers jumping into black holes and the quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis.  One of my main takeaways from the conference was a dramatically better understanding of the issues involved there—but that’s a big enough topic that it will need its own post.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the quantum gravity session, the experimentalist John Martinis innocently asked what actual experiments, or at least thought experiments, had been at issue for the past several hours.  I got a laugh by explaining to him that, while the gravity experts considered this too obvious to point out, the thought experiments in question all involve forming a black hole in a known quantum pure state, with total control over all the Planck-scale degrees of freedom; then waiting outside the black hole for ~10<sup>70</sup> years; collecting every last photon of Hawking radiation that comes out and routing them all into a quantum computer; doing a quantum computation that might actually require exponential time; <em>and then</em> jumping into the black hole, whereupon you might either die immediately at the event horizon, or else learn something in your last seconds before hitting the singularity, which you could then never communicate to anyone outside the black hole.  Martinis thanked me for clarifying.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Anyway, I had a total blast.  Here I am amusing some of the world’s great physicists by letting them mess around with GPT-3.</p>

<p>I also had the following exchange at my birthday dinner:</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> So I don’t get this, Scott. Are you a physicist who studied computer science, or a computer scientist who studied physics?</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> I’m a computer scientist who studied computer science.</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> But then you…</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, at some point I learned what a boson was, in order to invent BosonSampling.</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> And your courses in physics…</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> They ended at thermodynamics. I couldn’t handle PDEs.</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> What are the units of h-bar?</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Uhh, well, it’s a conversion factor between energy and time. (*)</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> Good.  What’s the radius of the hydrogen atom?</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Uhh … not sure … maybe something like 10<sup>-15</sup> meters?</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> OK fine, he’s not one of us.</p>



<p>(The answer, it turns out, is more like 10<sup>-10</sup> meters. I’d stupidly substituted the radius of the <em>nucleus</em>—or, y’know, a positively-charged hydrogen <em>ion</em>, i.e. proton. In my partial defense, I was massively jetlagged and at most 10% conscious.)</p>



<p>(*) Actually h-bar is a conversion factor between energy and <em>1/time</em>, i.e. frequency, but the physicist accepted this answer.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Anyway, I look forward to attending more workshops this summer, seeing more colleagues who I hadn’t seen since before COVID, and talking more science … including branching out in some new directions that I’ll blog about soon.  It does beat worrying about online trolls.</p></div>

<h3 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>



<p>A central goal of algorithmic fairness is to build systems with fairness properties that compose gracefully. A major effort towards this goal in fair machine learning has been the development of <em>fair representations</em> which guarantee demographic parity under sequential composition by removing group membership information from the data (i.e. by imposing a <em>demographic secrecy</em> constraint). This approach models all data consumers as utterly malicious adversaries whose sole objective is to be as unfair as possible (i.e. maximally violate demographic parity)—any other possible objective (i.e. incentive) that a data consumer may have is dismissed and ignored. In this talk, I describe joint work with Augustin Chaintreau, in which we elucidate limitations of demographically secret fair representations and propose a fresh approach to potentially overcome them by incorporating information about parties’ incentives into fairness interventions. We show that in a stylized model, it is possible to relax demographic secrecy to obtain <em>incentive-compatible representations</em>, where rational parties obtain exponentially greater utilities vis-à-vis any demographically secret representation and satisfy demographic parity. These substantial gains are recovered not from the well-known <em>cost of fairness</em>, but rather from a <em>cost of demographic secrecy</em> which we formalize and quantify for the first time. We further show that the sequential composition property of demographically secret representations is not robust to aggregation. Our results contribute to further understanding the challenges of fair composition while simultaneously suggesting that incentives may be an important and flexible tool for addressing or even overcoming those challenges.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In a recent work, Fan, Li, and Yang (STOC 2022) constructed a family of almost-universal hash functions such that each function in the family is computable by $(2n + o(n))$-gate circuits of fan-in $2$ over the $B_2$ basis. Applying this family, they established the existence of pseudorandom functions computable by circuits of the same complexity, under the standard assumption that OWFs exist. However, a major disadvantage of the hash family construction by Fan, Li, and Yang (STOC 2022) is that it requires a seed length of $\text{poly}(n)$, which limits its potential applications. 
        
We address this issue by giving an improved construction of almost-universal hash functions with seed length $\text{polylog}(n)$, such that each function in the family is computable with $\text{POLYLOGTIME}$-uniform $(2n + o(n))$-gate circuits. Our new construction has the following applications in both complexity theory and cryptography.
        
* ($\textbf{Hardness magnification}$). Let $\alpha : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be any function such that $\alpha(n) \leq \log n / \log \log n$. We show that if there is an $n^{\alpha(n)}$-sparse $\textbf{NP}$ language that does not have probabilistic circuits of $2n + O(n/\log\log n)$ gates, then we have (1) $\textbf{NTIME}[2^n] \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE} \left[2^{n^{1/5}}\right]$ and (2) $\textbf{NP} \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE}[n^k]$ for every constant $k$. Complementing this magnification phenomenon, we present an $O(n)$-sparse language in $\textbf{P}$ which requires probabilistic circuits of size at least $2n - 2$. This is the first result in hardness magnification showing that even a \emph{sub-linear additive} improvement on known circuit size lower bounds would imply $\textbf{NEXP} \not\subseteq \textbf{P}_{/\text{poly}}$. 

Following Chen, Jin, and Williams (STOC 2020), we also establish a sharp threshold for \textbf{explicit obstructions}: we give an explict obstruction against $(2n-2)$-size circuits, and prove that a sub-linear additive improvement on the circuit size would imply (1) $\textbf{DTIME}[2^n] \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE} \left[2^{n^{1/5}}\right]$ and (2) $\textbf{P} \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE}[n^k]$ for every constant $k$.

* ($\textbf{Extremely efficient construction of pseudorandom functions}$). Assuming that one of integer factoring, decisional Diffie-Hellman, or ring learning-with-errors is sub-exponentially hard, we show the existence of pseudorandom functions computable by $\text{POLYLOGTIME}$-uniform $\textbf{AC}^0[2]$ circuits with $2n + o(n)$ wires, with key length $\text{polylog}(n)$. We also show that PRFs computable by $\text{POLYLOGTIME}$-uniform $B_2$ circuits of $2n + o(n)$ gates follows from the existence of sub-exponentially secure one-way functions.</div>

A monotone Boolean circuit is a restriction of a Boolean circuit
  allowing for the use of disjunctions, conjunctions, the Boolean
  constants, and the input variables.  A monotone Boolean circuit is
  multilinear if for any AND gate the two input functions have no
  variable in common.  We show that the known lower bounds on the size
  of monotone arithmetic circuits for multivariate polynomials that
  are sums of monomials consisting of $k$ distinct variables yield the
  analogous lower bounds divided by $O(k^2)$ on the size of monotone
  multilinear Boolean circuits computing the Boolean functions

<p>Codes! Distributed computing! Probability distributions!</p>



<p><strong>Improved local testing for multiplicity codes</strong>, by Dan Karliner and Amnon Ta-Shma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14137">ECCC</a>). Take the Reed–Muller code with parameters \(m, d\), whose codewords are the evaluation tables of all degree-\(m\) polynomials over \(\mathbb{F}^d\). RM codes are great, they are everywhere, and they are<em> locally testable</em>: one can test whether a given input \(x\) is a valid codeword (or far from every codeword) with only very few queries to \(x\). Now, take the <em>multiplicity code</em>: instead of just the evaluation table of the polynomial themselves, a codeword includes the evaluations of all its derivatives, up to order \(s\). These beasts generalize RM codes: are they <em>also</em> locally testable? Yes they are! And this work improves on our understanding of this aspect, by providing better bounds on the locality (how few queries are necessary to test), and simplifies the argument from previous work by Karliner, Salama, and Ta-Shma (2022).</p>



<p><strong>Overcoming Congestion in Distributed Coloring,</strong> by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Alexandre Nolin, Tigran Tonoyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14478">arXiv</a>). Two of the main distributed computing models, LOCAL and CONGEST, differ in how they model the bandwidth constraints. In the former, nodes can send messages of arbitrary size, and the limiting quantity is the number of rounds of communications; while in the latter, each node can only send a logarithmic number of bits at each round. This paper introduces a new technique that allows for communication-efficient distributed (coordinated) sampling, which as a direct applications enables porting several LOCAL algorithms to the CONGEST model at a small cost: for instance, \((\Delta+1)\)-List Coloring. This new technique also has applications beyond these distributed models, to graph property testing – in a slightly non-standard setting where we define farness from the property in a “local” sense (detect vertices or edges which contribute to many violations, i.e., are “locally far” from the property considered).</p>



<p><strong>Robust Testing in High-Dimensional Sparse Models,</strong> by Anand Jerry George and Clément L. Canonne (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07488">arXiv</a>). In the Gaussian mean testing problem, you are given samples from a high-dimensional Gaussian \(N(\mu, I_d)\), where \(\mu\) is either zero or has \(\ell_2\) norm greater than \(\varepsilon\), and you want to decide which of the two holds. This “mean testing” equivalent (due to, erm, “standard facts”) to testing in total variation distance, and captures the setting where one wantss to figure out whether an underlying signal \(\mu\), subject to white noise, is null or significant. Now, what if this $\mu$ was promised to be \(s\)-sparse? Can we test more efficiently? But what if a small fraction of the samples were arbitrarily corrupted — how much harder does the testing task become? For some related tasks, it is known that being robust against adversarial corruptions makes testing as hard as learning… This paper addresses this “robust sparse mean testing” question, providing matching upper and lower bounds; as well as the related question of (robust, sparse) linear regression.</p>



<p><strong>Sequential algorithms for testing identity and closeness of distributions,</strong> by Omar Fawzi, Nicolas Flammarion, Aurélien Garivier, and Aadil Oufkir (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06069">arXiv</a>). Consider the two “usual suspects” of distribution testing, <em>identity</em> and <em>closeness</em> testing, where we must test if an unknown distribution is equal to some reference one or \(\varepsilon\)-far (in total variation distance) from it; or, the same thing, but with two unknown distributions (no reference one). These are, by now, quite well understood… but the algorithms for them take a worst-case number of samples, function of the distance parameter \(\varepsilon\). But if the two distributions are much further apart than \(\varepsilon\), fewer samples should be required! This is the focus of this paper, showing that with a sequential test one can achieve this type of guarantees: a number of samples which, in the “far” case, depends on the actual distance, not on its worst-case lower bound \(\varepsilon\). One could achieve this by combining known algorithms with a “doubling search;” however, this still would lose some constant factors in the sample complexity. The authors provide sequential tests which improve on this “doubling search technique” by constant factors, and back this up with empirical evaluations of their algorithms.</p>



<p><strong>Estimation of Entropy in Constant Space with Improved Sample Complexity,</strong> by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Andrew McGregor, Jelani Nelson, and Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09804">arXiv</a>). Suppose that, given samples from an unknown distribution \(p\) over \(n\) elements, your task is to estimate its (Shannon) entropy \(H(p)\) up to \(\pm\Delta\). You’re in luck! We know that \(\Theta(n/(\Delta\log n)+ (\log^2 n)/\Delta^2)\) samples are necessary and efficient. <em>But what if you had to do that under strict memory constraints? </em>Say, using only a <em>constant</em> number of words of memory? Previous work by Acharya, Bhadane, Indyk, and Sun (2019) shows that it is still possible, but the number of samples required shoots up, with their algorithm now requiring (up to polylog factors) \(n/\Delta^3\) samples. This works improves upon the dependence on \(\Delta\), providing a constant-memory algorithm with sample complexity \(O(n/\Delta^2 \cdot \log^4(1/\Delta))\); they further conjecture this to be optimal, up to the polylog factors.</p></div>
