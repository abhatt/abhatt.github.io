<p> Because of COVID  (my spellecheck says covid and Covid are not works, but COVID is) various schools have done various things to make school less traumatic. Students already have problems, either getting COVID or having their friends got family get it (I've had four relatives get it, and one died) . Some do not adjust to learning online.  Some do not have good computer connection to learn on line. So what is a good policy? Here are some things I have either seen schools do or heard that they might do.</p><p><br /></p><p>1) Be more generous with Tuition-Refunds if a student has to withdraw. </p><p>2) Be more generous with Housing-Refunds if a students comes to campus thinking it will be courses on campus and there are no courses on campus. Or if a student has to withdraw. </p><p>3) Make the deadlines for dropping-without-a-W, or taking-it-pass-fail, later in the semester. </p><p>4) Tell the teachers to `just teach them the bare min they need for the next course.'</p><p>5) Allow students to take courses P/F in their major and still allow them to count, so a student might get a D in Discrete Math and be able to go on in the major. </p><p>6) How far to extend deadlines? How is this: extend deadline to make it P/F until the last day of classes (but before the final) and then after the final is given, the school changes its mind and says - OH, you can change to P/F now if you want to.</p><p>7) Allow either an absolute number (say 7) or a fraction (say 1/3) of the courses to be changed to P/F by the last day of class.</p><p>8) Combine 6 or 7 with saying NO- a D is an F for a P/F course. Perhaps only if its in the major, but that maybe hard to work out. since majors can change. Some schools do A-B-C-NO CREDIT, where the NC grade does not go into the GPA.</p><p>9) Give standard letter grades and tell the students to tough it out. Recall the following inspirational quotes</p><p>When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping</p><p>When the going gets tough, the tough take a nap</p><p>If at first you don't succeed, quit. Why make a damn fool of yourself. </p><p>If at first you don't succeed, then skydiving is not for you. </p><p>10) Decide later in the term what to do depending on who yells the loudest. </p><p>11) Any combination of the above that makes sense, and even some that don't. </p><p><br /></p><p>On the one hand, there are students who are going through very hard times because of covid and should be given a break. On the other hand, we want to give people a good education and give grades that are meaningful (the logic of how to give grades in normal times is another issue for another blog post). </p><p>What is your school doing? Is it working? What does it mean to be working?</p><p>The problems I am talking about are first-world problems or even champagne-problems. I know there are people who have far worse problems then getting a bad grade or dropping courses.</p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>These are rough notes for the first lecture in <a href="https://boazbk.github.io/mltheoryseminar/cs229br.html#plan">my adanced topics in machine learning seminar</a>. See the <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2021/01/15/ml-theory-with-bad-drawings/">previous post</a> for the introduction.</p>



<p>This lecture’s focus was on <strong>“classical” learing theory</strong>. The distinction between “classical learning” and “deep learning” is semantic/philosophical, and doesn’t matter much for this seminar. I personally view this difference as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/dzDbio7.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>That is, deep learning is a framework that allows you to translate more resources (data and computation) into bettter performance. “Classical” methods often have a “threshold effect” where a certain amount of data and computation is needed, and more would not really help. For example, in parametric methods there will typically be a sharp threshold for the amount of data required for saturating the potential performance. Even in non-parametric models such as nearest neighbors or kernel methods, the computational cost is fixed for a fixed amount of data, and there is no way to profitably trade more computation for better performance.</p>



<p>In contrast, for deep learning, we often can get better performance using the same data by using bigger models or more computation. For example, I doubt this <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/">story of Andrej Karpathy</a> could have happened with a non deep-learning method:</p>



<p><em>“One time I accidentally left a model training during the winter break and when I got back in January it was SOTA (“state of the art”).”</em></p>



<h2>Leaky pipelines</h2>



<p>We can view machine learning (deep or not) as a series of “leaky pipelines”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0dpRqYa.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>We want to create an adaptive system that performs well in the wild, but to do so, we:</p>



<ol><li>Set up a benchmark of a test distribution, so we have some way to compare different systems.</li><li>We typically can’t optimize directly on the benchmark, both because losses like accuracy are not differentiable and because we don’t have access to an unbounded number of samples from the distribution. (Though there are exceptions, such as when optimizing for playing video games.) Hence we set up the task of optimizing some proxy loss function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{L}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{L}" /> on some finite samples of training data.</li><li>We then run an optimization algorithm whose ostensible goal is to find the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f \in \mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="f \in \mathcal{F}" /> that minimizes the loss function over the training data. (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}" /> is a set of models, sometimes known as <em>architecture</em>, and sometimes we also add other restrictions such norms of weights, which is known as <em>regularization</em>)</li></ol>



<p>All these steps are typically “leaky.” Test performance on benchmarks is not the same as real-world performance. Minimizing the loss over the training set is not the same as test performance. Moreover, we typically can’t solve the loss minimization task optimally, and there isn’t a unique minimizer, so the choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> depends on the algorithm.</p>



<p>Much of machine learning theory is about obtaining guarantees bounding the “leakiness” of the various steps. These are often easier to do in “classical” contexts of statistical learning theory than for deep learning. In this lecture, we will make a short blitz through classical learning theory. This material is covered in several sources, including the excellent book <a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/">understanding machine learning</a> and the upcoming Hardt-Recht text.</p>



<p>We will be very rough, using proofs by picture and making some simplifications (e.g., working in one dimension, assuming functions are always differentiable, etc.)</p>



<h2>Convexity</h2>



<p>A (nice) function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> is (strongly) <em>convex</em> if it satisfies one of the following three equivalent conditions:</p>



<ol><li>For every two points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x,y" class="latex" title="x,y" />, the line between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cf%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,f(x))" class="latex" title="(x,f(x))" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y%2Cf%28y%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(y,f(y))" class="latex" title="(y,f(y))" /> is above the curve of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" />.</li><li>For every point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />, the tangent line at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cf%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,f(x))" class="latex" title="(x,f(x))" /> with slope <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f'(x)" class="latex" title="f'(x)" /> is below the curve of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" />.</li><li>For every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%27%28x%29%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f''(x)&gt;0" class="latex" title="f''(x)&gt;0" />.</li></ol>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0p5cY35.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>To see that for example, 2 implies 3, we can use the contrapositive. If 3 does not hold and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> is such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%27%28x%29+%3C+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f''(x) &lt; 0" class="latex" title="f''(x) &lt; 0" /> (should really assume <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%27%28x%29+%5Cleq+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f''(x) \leq 0" class="latex" title="f''(x) \leq 0" /> but we’re being rough) then by Taylor, around <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> we get</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x+%2B+%5Cdelta%29+%3D+f%28x%29+%2B+%5Cdelta+f%27%28x%29+%2B+%5Cdelta%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29+%2F2+%2B+O%28%5Cdelta%5E3%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x + \delta) = f(x) + \delta f'(x) + \delta^2 f''(x) /2 + O(\delta^3)" class="latex" title="f(x + \delta) = f(x) + \delta f'(x) + \delta^2 f''(x) /2 + O(\delta^3)" /></p>



<p>For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\delta" class="latex" title="\delta" /> small enough, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28%5Cdelta%5E3%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(\delta^3)" class="latex" title="O(\delta^3)" /> is negligible and so we see that the curve of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> near <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> equals the tangent line <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%2B+%5Cdelta+f%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x) + \delta f'(x)" class="latex" title="f(x) + \delta f'(x)" /> plus a negative term, and hence it is below the line, contradicting 2.</p>



<p>To show that 2 implies 1, we can again use the contrapositive and show by a “proof by picture” that if there is some point in which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> is above the line between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cf%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,f(x))" class="latex" title="(x,f(x))" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28y%2Cf%28y%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(y,f(y))" class="latex" title="(y,f(y))" />, then there must be a point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="z" class="latex" title="z" /> in which the tangent line at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28z%2Cf%28z%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(z,f(z))" class="latex" title="(z,f(z))" /> is above <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" />.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/84qFxfN.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Some tips on convexity:</p>



<ol><li>The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3Dx%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x)=x^2" class="latex" title="f(x)=x^2" /> is convex (proof: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=plot+x%5E2&amp;oq=plot+x%5E2">Google</a>)</li><li>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ek+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="f:\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> is convex and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k" class="latex" title="L:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k" /> is linear then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cmapsto+f%28L%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x \mapsto f(L(x))" class="latex" title="x \mapsto f(L(x))" /> (lines are still lines).</li><li>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> is convex and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" /> is convex then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5Ccdot+f+%2B+b+%5Ccdot+g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a\cdot f + b \cdot g" class="latex" title="a\cdot f + b \cdot g" /> is convex for every positive <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Cb&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a,b" class="latex" title="a,b" />.</li></ol>



<h2>Gradient descent</h2>



<p>The gradient descent algorithm minimizes a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> by starting at some point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_0" class="latex" title="x_0" /> and repeating the following operation:</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+x_t+-+%5Ceta+%5Ccdot+f%27%28x_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta \cdot f'(x_t)" class="latex" title="x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta \cdot f'(x_t)" /></p>



<p>for some small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta&gt;0" class="latex" title="\eta&gt;0" />.</p>



<p>By Taylor, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%2B%5Cdelta%29+%5Capprox+f%28x%29+%2B+%5Cdelta+%5Ccdot+f%27%28x%29+%2B+%5Cdelta%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x+\delta) \approx f(x) + \delta \cdot f'(x) + \delta^2 f''(x)/2" class="latex" title="f(x+\delta) \approx f(x) + \delta \cdot f'(x) + \delta^2 f''(x)/2" />, and so setting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3D+-%5Ceta+%5Ccdot+f%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\delta = -\eta \cdot f'(x)" class="latex" title="\delta = -\eta \cdot f'(x)" />, we can see that</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x_%7Bt%2B1%7D%29+-+f%28x_t%29+%5Capprox+-%5Ceta+f%27%28x%29%5E2+%2B+%5Ceta%5E2+f%27%28x%29%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29%2F2+%3D+-%5Ceta+f%27%28x%29%5E2+%5Cleft%5B+1+-+%5Ceta+f%27%27%28x%29%2F2+%5Cright%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t) \approx -\eta f'(x)^2 + \eta^2 f'(x)^2 f''(x)/2 = -\eta f'(x)^2 \left[ 1 - \eta f''(x)/2 \right]" class="latex" title="f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t) \approx -\eta f'(x)^2 + \eta^2 f'(x)^2 f''(x)/2 = -\eta f'(x)^2 \left[ 1 - \eta f''(x)/2 \right]" /></p>



<p>Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%27%28x%29%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f''(x)&gt;0" class="latex" title="f''(x)&gt;0" />, we see that as long as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta+%3C+2%2F+f%27%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta &lt; 2/ f''(x)" class="latex" title="\eta &lt; 2/ f''(x)" /> we make progress. If we set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta+%5Csim+const+%5Ccdot+f%27%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta \sim const \cdot f''(x)" class="latex" title="\eta \sim const \cdot f''(x)" /> then we reduce in each step the value of the function by roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%28x%29%5E2%2Ff%27%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f'(x)^2/f''(x)" class="latex" title="f'(x)^2/f''(x)" />.</p>



<p>In the high dimensional case, we replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f'(x)" class="latex" title="f'(x)" /> with the gradient <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28x%29+%3D+%28+df%28x%29%2Fdx_1+%2C+%5Cldots%2C+df%28x%29%2Fdx_d%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\nabla f(x) = ( df(x)/dx_1 , \ldots, df(x)/dx_d)" class="latex" title="\nabla f(x) = ( df(x)/dx_1 , \ldots, df(x)/dx_d)" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%27%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f''(x)" class="latex" title="f''(x)" /> with the Hessian which is the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28df%28x%29%2Fdx_i+dx_j%29_%7Bi%2Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(df(x)/dx_i dx_j)_{i,j}" class="latex" title="(df(x)/dx_i dx_j)_{i,j}" />. The progress we can make is controlled by the ratio of the smallest to largest eigenvalues of the Hessian, which is one over its _condition number.</p>



<p>In <strong>stochastic gradient descent</strong>, instead of performing the step <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+%3D+x_t+-+%5Ceta+f%27%28x_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta f'(x_t)" class="latex" title="x_{t+1} = x_t - \eta f'(x_t)" /> we use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_%7Bt%2B1%7D+-+%5Ceta+%5Chat%7Bf%27%7D%28x_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_{t+1} - \eta \hat{f'}(x_t)" class="latex" title="x_{t+1} - \eta \hat{f'}(x_t)" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7Bf%27%7D%28x_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{f'}(x_t)" class="latex" title="\hat{f'}(x_t)" /> is a random variable satisfying:</p>

<p>Let’s define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_t+%3D+%5Chat%7Bf%27%7D%28x_t%29-+f%27%28x_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N_t = \hat{f'}(x_t)- f'(x_t)" class="latex" title="N_t = \hat{f'}(x_t)- f'(x_t)" />. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N_t" class="latex" title="N_t" /> is a mean zero and variance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csigma%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sigma^2" class="latex" title="\sigma^2" /> random variable, and let’s heuristically imagine that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_1%2CN_2%2C%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N_1,N_2,\ldots" class="latex" title="N_1,N_2,\ldots" /> are independent. If we plug in this into the Taylor approximation, then since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D+N_t+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{E} N_t = 0" class="latex" title="\mathbb{E} N_t = 0" />, only the terms with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_t%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N_t^2" class="latex" title="N_t^2" /> survive.</p>



<p>So by plugging <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta+%3D+%5Ceta+%28f%27%28x%29+%2B+N_t%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\delta = \eta (f'(x) + N_t)" class="latex" title="\delta = \eta (f'(x) + N_t)" /> to the Taylor approximation, we get that in expectation</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x_%7Bt%2B1%7D%29+-+f%28x_t%29+%5Capprox+-%5Ceta+f%27%28x%29%5E2+%2B+%5Ceta%5E2+f%27%28x%29%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29%2F2+%2B+%5Ceta%5E2+%5Csigma%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29%5E2+%3D+-%5Ceta+f%27%28x%29%5E2+%5Cleft%5B+1+-+%5Ceta+f%27%27%28x%29%2F2+%5Cright%5D+%2B+%5Ceta%5E2+%5Csigma%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t) \approx -\eta f'(x)^2 + \eta^2 f'(x)^2 f''(x)/2 + \eta^2 \sigma^2 f''(x)^2 = -\eta f'(x)^2 \left[ 1 - \eta f''(x)/2 \right] + \eta^2 \sigma^2 f''(x)^2" class="latex" title="f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t) \approx -\eta f'(x)^2 + \eta^2 f'(x)^2 f''(x)/2 + \eta^2 \sigma^2 f''(x)^2 = -\eta f'(x)^2 \left[ 1 - \eta f''(x)/2 \right] + \eta^2 \sigma^2 f''(x)^2" /></p>



<p>We see that now to make progress, we need to ensure that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta" class="latex" title="\eta" /> is sufficiently smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%28x%29%5E2%2F%28%5Csigma%5E2+f%27%27%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f'(x)^2/(\sigma^2 f''(x))" class="latex" title="f'(x)^2/(\sigma^2 f''(x))" />. We note that in the beginning, when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%27%28x%29%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f'(x)^2" class="latex" title="f'(x)^2" /> is large, we can use a larger learning rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta" class="latex" title="\eta" />, while when we get closer to the optimum, then we need to use a smaller learning rate.</p>



<h2>Generalization bounds</h2>



<p>The <em>supervised learning problem</em> is the task, given labeled training inputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%3D+%7B+%28x_1%2Cy_1%29%2C%5Cldots%2C%28x_n%2Cy_n%29+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S = { (x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n) }" class="latex" title="S = { (x_1,y_1),\ldots,(x_n,y_n) }" /> of obtaining a classifier/regressor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> that will satisfy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29+%5Capprox+y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x) \approx y" class="latex" title="f(x) \approx y" /> for future samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,y)" class="latex" title="(x,y)" /> from the same distribution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZVTtBmW.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Let’s assume that our goal is to minimize some quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=LOSS%28f%29%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7Bx%2Cy%7D+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28y%2Cf%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="LOSS(f)= \mathbb{E}{x,y} \mathcal{L}(y,f(x))" class="latex" title="LOSS(f)= \mathbb{E}{x,y} \mathcal{L}(y,f(x))" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{L}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{L}" /> is a _loss function (that we will normalize to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5B0%2C1%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[0,1]" class="latex" title="[0,1]" /> for convenience). We call the quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=LOSS&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="LOSS" class="latex" title="LOSS" /> the population loss (and abuse notation by denoting it as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28f%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{L}(f)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{L}(f)" />) and the corresponding quantity over the training set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D_S%28f%29+%3D+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Csum%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28y_i%2Cf%28x_i%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\hat{\mathcal{L}}_S(f) = \tfrac{1}{n}\sum{i=1}^n \mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i))" class="latex" title="\hat{\mathcal{L}}_S(f) = \tfrac{1}{n}\sum{i=1}^n \mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i))" /> the empirical loss.</p>



<p>The <strong>generalization gap</strong> is the difference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D%7Bx%2Cy%7D+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28y%2Cf%28x%29%29+-+%5Ctfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%5Csum%7Bi%3D1%7D%5En+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28y_i%2Cf%28x_i%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{E}{x,y} \mathcal{L}(y,f(x)) - \tfrac{1}{n}\sum{i=1}^n \mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i))" class="latex" title="\mathbb{E}{x,y} \mathcal{L}(y,f(x)) - \tfrac{1}{n}\sum{i=1}^n \mathcal{L}(y_i,f(x_i))" /> between the population and empirical losses. (We could add an absolute value though we expect that the loss over the training set would be smaller than the population loss; the population loss can be approximated by the “test loss” and so these terms are sometimes used interchangibly.)</p>



<p><strong>Why care about the generalization gap?</strong> You might argue that we only care about the population loss and not the gap between population and empirical loss. However, as mentioned before, we don’t even care about the population loss but about a more nebulous notion of “real-world performance.” We want the relations between our different abstractions to be as minimally “leaky” as possible and so bound the difference between train and test performance.</p>



<h3>Bias-variance tradeoff</h3>



<p>Suppose that our algorithm performs <em>empirical risk minimization (ERM)</em> which means that on input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />, we output <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f+%3D+%5Carg%5Cmin_%7Bf+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7D+%5Chat%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D_S%28f%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \hat{\mathcal{L}}_S(f)" class="latex" title="f = \arg\min_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \hat{\mathcal{L}}_S(f)" />.

<p>The ERM algorithm outputs the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_i" class="latex" title="f_i" /> which minimizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28f_i%29+%2B+N_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{L}(f_i) + N_i" class="latex" title="\mathcal{L}(f_i) + N_i" />.

<h3>Counting generalization gap</h3>



<p>The most basic generalization gap is the following:</p>



<p><strong>Thm (counting gap):</strong> With high probability over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cin+%28X%2CY%29%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S \in (X,Y)^n" class="latex" title="S \in (X,Y)^n" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmax_%7Bf+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7D%5Cleft%7C+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28f%29+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D_S%28f%29+%5Cright%7C+%5Cleq+O%5Cleft%28+%5Csqrt%7B%5Ctfrac%7B%5Clog+%7C%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D%7C%7D%7Bn%7D%7D%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\max_{f \in \mathcal{F}}\left| \mathcal{L}(f) - \hat{\mathcal{L}}_S(f) \right| \leq O\left( \sqrt{\tfrac{\log |\mathcal{F}|}{n}}\right)" class="latex" title="\max_{f \in \mathcal{F}}\left| \mathcal{L}(f) - \hat{\mathcal{L}}_S(f) \right| \leq O\left( \sqrt{\tfrac{\log |\mathcal{F}|}{n}}\right)" />.</p>

<p>One way to count the number of classifiers in a family <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}" /> is by the bits to represent a member of the family– there are at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^k" class="latex" title="2^k" /> functions that can be represented using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> bits. But this bound can be quite loose – for example, it can make a big difference if we use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=32&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="32" class="latex" title="32" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=64&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="64" class="latex" title="64" /> bits to specify numbers, and some natural families (e.g., linear functions) are <em>infinite</em>. There are many bounds in the literature of the form</p>

Some examples (very roughly stated) include:</p>

<p>A recent empirical study of generalization bounds is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02178">“fantastic generalization measures and where to find them”</a>by Jiang, Neyshabur, Mobahi, Krishnan, and Bengio, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11924">“In Search of Robust Measures of Generalization”</a> by Dziugaite,  Drouin, Neal, Rajkumar, Caballero, Wang, Mitliagkas, and Roy.</p>



<h2>Limitations of generalization bounds</h2>



<p>The generalization gap <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BE%7D_%7Bf%3DA%28S%29%7D%5Cleft%5B+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28f%29+-+%5Chat%7B%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%7D%28f%29+%5Cright%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{E}_{f=A(S)}\left[ \mathcal{L}(f) - \hat{\mathcal{L}}(f) \right]" class="latex" title="\mathbb{E}_{f=A(S)}\left[ \mathcal{L}(f) - \hat{\mathcal{L}}(f) \right]" /> depends on several quantities:</p>



<ul><li>The family <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{F}" /> of functions.</li><li>The algorithm <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> used to map the training set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%5Cin%5Cmathcal%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f\in\mathcal{F}" class="latex" title="f\in\mathcal{F}" />.</li><li>The distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" /> of datapoints</li><li>The distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%7CX&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y|X" class="latex" title="Y|X" /> of labels.</li></ul>



<p>A <strong>generalization bound</strong> is an upper bound on the gap that only depends on some of these quantities. In an influential paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">Zhang, Bengio, Hardt, Recht, Vinyals</a> showed significant barriers to obtaining such results that are meaningful for practical deep networks. They showed that in many natural settings, we cannot get such bounds even if we allow them to be based arbitrarily on the first three factors. That is, they showed that for natural families of functions (modern deep nets), natural algorithms (gradient descent on the empirical loss), natural distributions (CIFAR 10 and ImageNet), if we replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> by the uniform distribution, then we can get arbitrarily large generalization gap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QqP2qnc.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>We can also interpolate between the Zhang et al. experiment and the plain CIFAR-10 distribution. If we consider a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28X%2C%5Ctilde%7BY%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(X,\tilde{Y})" class="latex" title="(X,\tilde{Y})" /> where we take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28X%2CY%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(X,Y)" class="latex" title="(X,Y)" /> from CIFAR-10 with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> we replace the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> with a random label (one of the 10 CIFAR-10 classes) then the test/population performance (fraction of correct classifications) will be at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-p%29+%2B+p%2F10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(1-p) + p/10" class="latex" title="(1-p) + p/10" /> (not surprising), but the training/empirical accuracy will remain at roughly 100%. The left-hand side of the gif below demonstrates this (this comes from <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/10/18/understanding-generalization-requires-rethinking-deep-learning/">this paper with Bansal and Kaplun</a> which shows that, as the right side demonstrates, certain self-supervised learning algorithms do not suffer from this phenomenon; here the noise level is the fraction of wrong labels so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0.9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="0.9" class="latex" title="0.9" /> is perfect noise):</p>

<h2>“Double descent.”</h2>



<p>While classical learning theory predicts a “bias-variance tradeoff” whereby as we increase the model class size, we get worse and worse performance, this is not what happens in modern deep learning systems. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin, Hsu, Ma, and Mandal</a> posited that such systems undergo a “double descent” whereby performance behaves according to the classical bias/variance curve up to the point in which we achieve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Capprox+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\approx 0" class="latex" title="\approx 0" /> training error and then starts improving again. This <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/12/05/deep-double-descent/">actually happens</a> in real deep networks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PpyW6HW.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>To get some intuition for the double descent phenomenon, consider the case of fitting a univariate polynomial of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d^0" class="latex" title="d^0" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3E+d%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n &gt; d^0" class="latex" title="n &gt; d^0" /> samples of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cf%28x%29%2Bnoise%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,f(x)+noise)" class="latex" title="(x,f(x)+noise)" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> is a degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> polynomial. When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3Cd%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d&lt;d^0" class="latex" title="d&lt;d^0" /> we are “under-fitting” and will not get good performance. As <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> trends between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%5E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d^0" class="latex" title="d^0" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, we fit more and more of the noise, until for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%3Dn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d=n" class="latex" title="d=n" /> we have a perfect interpolating polynomial that will have perfect train but very poor test performance. When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> grows beyond <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, more than one polynomial can fit the data, and SGD will select for the minimal norm one, which will make the interpolation smoother and smoother and actually result in better performance.</p>

<h2>Approximation and representation</h2>



<p>Consider the task of distinguishing between the speech of an adult and a child. In the time domain, this may be hard, but by switching to representation in the Fourier domain, the task becomes much easier. (See this cartoon)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8SKSB9q.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>The Fourier transform is based on the following theorem: for every continuous <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5B0%2C1%5D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" />, we can arbitrarily well approximate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> as a linear combination of functions of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7B2%5Cpi+i+%5Calpha+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="e^{2\pi i \alpha x}" class="latex" title="e^{2\pi i \alpha x}" />. Another way to say it is that if we use the embedding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N" class="latex" title="\varphi:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N" /> which maps <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> into (sufficiently large) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> coordinates of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%5E%7B2+%5Cpi+i+%5Calpha_j+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="e^{2 \pi i \alpha_j x}" class="latex" title="e^{2 \pi i \alpha_j x}" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> becomes linear.</p>



<p>The wave functions are not the only ones that can approximate an arbitrary function. A <em>ReLU</em> is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="r:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%28x%29+%3D+max+%7B+w+%5Ccdot+x+%2B+b+%2C+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r(x) = max { w \cdot x + b , 0}" class="latex" title="r(x) = max { w \cdot x + b , 0}" />. We can approximate every continuous function arbitrarily well as a combination of ReLUs:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> For every continous <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5B0%2C1%5D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:[0,1]^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="f:[0,1]^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\epsilon&gt;0" class="latex" title="\epsilon&gt;0" /> there is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g%3A%5B0%2C1%5D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g:[0,1]^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="g:[0,1]^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" /> is a linear combination of ReLUs and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cint+%7Cf-g%7C+%3C+%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\int |f-g| &lt; \epsilon" class="latex" title="\int |f-g| &lt; \epsilon" />.</p>



<p>In one dimension, this follows from the facts that:</p>



<ul><li>ReLUs can give an arbitrarily good approximation to bump functions of the form<br /><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=I_%7Ba%2Cb%7D%28x%29+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+1+%26+a+%5Cleq+x+%5Cleq+b+%5C%5C+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="I_{a,b}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; a \leq x \leq b \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}" class="latex" title="I_{a,b}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; a \leq x \leq b \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}" /></li><li>Every continuous function on a bounded domain can be arbitrarily well approximated by the sum of bump functions.</li></ul>



<p>The second fact is well known, and here is a “proof by picture” for the first one:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sKhHEap.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>For higher dimensions, we need to create higher dimension bump functions. For example, in two dimensions, we can create a “noisy circle” by summing over all rotations of our bump. We can then add many such circles to create a two-dimensional bump. The same construction extends to an arbitrary number of dimensions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/V8Wm5X1.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p><strong>How many ReLUs?</strong> The above shows that a linear combination of ReLUs can approximate every function on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> variables, but how many ReLUs are needed? Every ReLU <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="r:\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> is specified by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" /> numbers for the weights and bias. Intuitively, we could discretize each coordinate to a constant number of choices, and so there would be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%29%5Ed+%3D+2%5E%7BO%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(1)^d = 2^{O(d)}" class="latex" title="O(1)^d = 2^{O(d)}" /> choices for such ReLUs. Indeed, it can be shown that every continuous function can be approximated by a linear combination of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7BO%28d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2^{O(d)}" class="latex" title="2^{O(d)}" /> ReLUs. It turns out that some functions <em>require</em> an exponential number of ReLUS.</p>



<p>The above discussion doesn’t apply just for ReLUs but virtually any non-linear function.</p>



<h3>Representation summary</h3>



<p>By embedding our input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x\in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" title="x\in \mathbb{R}^d" /> as a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^N" class="latex" title="\varphi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^N" />, we can often make many “interesting” functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> become much simpler to compute (e.g., linear). In learning, we typically search for an <em>embedding</em> or <em>representation</em> that is “good” in one or more of the following senses:</p>



<ul><li>The dimension of embedding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> is not too large for many “interesting” functions.</li><li>Two inputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%2Cy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x,y" class="latex" title="x,y" /> are “semantically similar” if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x)" class="latex" title="\varphi(x)" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(y)" class="latex" title="\varphi(y)" /> are correlated (e.g., <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cvarphi%28x%29%2C%5Cvarphi%28y%29+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle \varphi(x),\varphi(y) \rangle" class="latex" title="\langle \varphi(x),\varphi(y) \rangle" /> is large).</li><li>We can efficiently compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x)" class="latex" title="\varphi(x)" /> and (sometimes) can compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cvarphi%28x%29%2C+%5Cvarphi%28y%29+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle \varphi(x), \varphi(y) \rangle" class="latex" title="\langle \varphi(x), \varphi(y) \rangle" /> without needing to explicitly compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x%29%2C%5Cvarphi%28y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x),\varphi(y)" class="latex" title="\varphi(x),\varphi(y)" />.</li><li>For “interesting” functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x)" class="latex" title="f(x)" /> can be approximated by a linear function in the embedding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x)" class="latex" title="\varphi(x)" /> with “structured” coefficients (for example, sparse combination, or combination of coefficients of certain types, such as low frequency coefficients in Fourier domain)</li><li>…</li></ul>



<h2>Kernels and nearest neighbors</h2>



<p>Suppose that we have some notion <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K" class="latex" title="K" /> of “similarity” between inputs, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K(x,y)" class="latex" title="K(x,y)" /> being large means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> is “close” to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" title="y" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K(x,y)" class="latex" title="K(x,y)" /> being small means that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> is “far” from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y" class="latex" title="y" />.</p>



<p>This suggests that we can use one of the following methods approximating a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> given inputs of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_i%2C+y_i+%5Capprox+f%28x_i%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(x_i, y_i \approx f(x_i))}" class="latex" title="{(x_i, y_i \approx f(x_i))}" />. On input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />, any of the following can be reasonable approximations to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x)" class="latex" title="f(x)" /> depending on context:</p>



<ul><li><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y_i" class="latex" title="y_i" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" /> is the closest to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B+x_1%2C%5Cldots%2C+x_n+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{ x_1,\ldots, x_n }" class="latex" title="{ x_1,\ldots, x_n }" />. (This is known as the <em>nearest neighbor</em> algorithm.)</li><li>The mean (or other combining function) of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_%7Bi_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2C+y_%7Bi_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y_{i_1},\ldots, y_{i_k}" class="latex" title="y_{i_1},\ldots, y_{i_k}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B+x_%7Bi_1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2C+x_%7Bi_k%7D+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{ x_{i_1},\ldots, x_{i_k} }" class="latex" title="{ x_{i_1},\ldots, x_{i_k} }" /> are the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> nearest inputs to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />. (This is known as the <em><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> nearest neighbor</em> algorithm.)</li><li>Some linear combination of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="y_i" class="latex" title="y_i" /> where the coefficients depend on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%28x%2Cx_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K(x,x_i)" class="latex" title="K(x,x_i)" />. (This is known as the <em>kernel</em> algorithm.)</li></ul>



<p>All of these algorithms are _ non-parametric methods_ in the sense that the final regressor/classifier is specified by the full training set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B+%28x_i%2Cy_i%29+%7D_%7Bi%3D1..n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{ (x_i,y_i) }_{i=1..n}" class="latex" title="{ (x_i,y_i) }_{i=1..n}" />.</p>



<p><strong>Kernel algorithms</strong> can also be described as follows. Given some embedding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%3A%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N" class="latex" title="\varphi:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{X}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{X}" /> is our input space, a Kernel regression approximates a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%3A%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> by a linear function in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x)" class="latex" title="\varphi(x)" />.</p>



<p>The key observation is that to solve linear equations or least-square minimization in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w \in \mathbb{R}^N" class="latex" title="w \in \mathbb{R}^N" /> of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cvarphi%28x_i%29+%2C+w+%5Crangle+%5Capprox+y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle \varphi(x_i) , w \rangle \approx y_i" class="latex" title="\langle \varphi(x_i) , w \rangle \approx y_i" />, we don’t need to know the vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi%28x_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi(x_i)" class="latex" title="\varphi(x_i)" />. Rather, it is enough to know the inner products <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cvarphi%28x_i%29%2C+%5Cvarphi%28x_j%29+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle \varphi(x_i), \varphi(x_j) \rangle" class="latex" title="\langle \varphi(x_i), \varphi(x_j) \rangle" />. In Kernel methods we are often not given the embedding explicitly (indeed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> might even be infinite) but rather the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%3A%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D+%5Ctimes+%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" class="latex" title="K:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K%28x_i%2Cx_j%29+%3D+%5Clangle+%5Cvarphi%28x_i%29%2C%5Cvarphi%28x_j%29+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K(x_i,x_j) = \langle \varphi(x_i),\varphi(x_j) \rangle" class="latex" title="K(x_i,x_j) = \langle \varphi(x_i),\varphi(x_j) \rangle" />. The only thing to verify is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K" class="latex" title="K" /> actually defines an inner product by checking that the matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28+K%28x_i%2Cx_j%29%29_%7Bi%2Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="( K(x_i,x_j))_{i,j}" class="latex" title="( K(x_i,x_j))_{i,j}" /> is positive semi-definite.</p>



<p>In general, Kernels and neural networks look quite similar – both ultimately involve composing a linear function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="L" class="latex" title="L" /> on top of a non-linear embedding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi" class="latex" title="\varphi" />. It is not always clear cut whether an algorithm is a kernel or deep neural net method. Some characteristics of kernels are:</p>



<ul><li>The embedding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi" class="latex" title="\varphi" /> is not learned from the data. However, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cvarphi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\varphi" class="latex" title="\varphi" /> was learned from some other data, or was inspired by representations that were learned from data, then it becomes a fuzzier distinction.</li><li>There is a “shortcut” to compute the inner product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clangle+%5Cvarphi%28x%29%2C%5Cvarphi%28y%29+%5Crangle&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\langle \varphi(x),\varphi(y) \rangle" class="latex" title="\langle \varphi(x),\varphi(y) \rangle" /> using significantly smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> steps.</li></ul>



<p>Generally, the distinction between a kernel and deep nets depends on the application (is it to apply some analysis such as generalization bounds for kernels? is it to use kernel methods with shortcuts for the inner product?) and is more a spectrum than a binary partition.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The above was a very condensed and rough survey of generalization, representation, approximation, and kernel methods. All of these are covered much better in the understanding machine learning book and the upcoming Hardt and Recht book.</p>



<p>In the next lecture, we will discuss the algorithmic bias of gradient descent, including the cases of linear regression and deep linear networks. We will discuss the “simplicity bias” of SGD and what can we say about what is learned at different layers of a deep network.</p></div>

The erratic
behavior of internet traffic forces data centers to maintain excess capacity in
the form of idle servers in case the workload suddenly increases. As an idle
server still consumes a significant fraction of the peak energy, data center
operators have heavily invested in capacity scaling solutions. In simple terms,
these aim to deactivate servers if the demand is low and to activate them again
when the workload increases. To do so, an algorithm needs to strike a delicate
balance between power consumption, flow-time, and switching costs. Over the
last decade, the research community has developed competitive online algorithms
with worst-case guarantees. In the presence of historic data patterns,
prescription from Machine Learning (ML) predictions typically outperform such
competitive algorithms. This, however, comes at the cost of sacrificing the
robustness of performance, since unpredictable surges in the workload are not
uncommon. The current work builds on the emerging paradigm of augmenting
unreliable ML predictions with online algorithms to develop novel robust
algorithms that enjoy the benefits of both worlds.
</p>
<p>We analyze a continuous-time model for capacity scaling, where the goal is to
minimize the weighted sum of flow-time, switching cost, and power consumption
in an online fashion. We propose a novel algorithm, called Adaptive Balanced
Capacity Scaling (ABCS), that has access to black-box ML predictions, but is
completely oblivious to the accuracy of these predictions. In particular, if
the predictions turn out to be accurate in hindsight, we prove that ABCS is
$(1+\varepsilon)$-competitive. Moreover, even when the predictions are
inaccurate, ABCS guarantees a bounded competitive ratio. The performance of the
ABCS algorithm on a real-world dataset positively support the theoretical
results.

conjunctions and disjunctions of inequality. Specifically, we provide the first
non-trivial algorithms for the problem of ranked enumeration where the query
results are returned incrementally in an order dictated by a given ranking
function. Our approach offers strong data-complexity guarantees in the standard
RAM model of computation that are surprisingly close to those of equi-joins.
Given an acyclic inequality join between tables of size $n$, it returns the
join answers in order and guarantees that for every value of $k$, the $k$
top-ranked answers are returned in $\mathcal{O}(n \operatorname{polylog} n + k
\operatorname{log} k)$ time. This matches the best-known guarantee for
equi-joins up to a polylogarithmic factor. The key ingredient is an
$\mathcal{O}(n \operatorname{polylog} n)$-size factorized representation of all
query results that is constructed in a preprocessing step. As a side benefit,
our techniques are also applicable to the easier task of unranked enumeration
(i.e., without an output ordering) where we are able to return $k$ join results
in $\mathcal{O}(n \operatorname{polylog} n + k)$. This guarantee is
asymptotically superior to any known alternative for large values of $k$. In an
experimental study, we show that our ranked enumeration approach is not only
theoretically interesting, but also fast and memory-efficient in practice.

eluded unifying and simple convergence arguments in first-order optimization,
so far primarily reserved for other convergence criteria, such as reducing the
optimality gap. We introduce a novel potential function-based framework to
study the convergence of standard methods for making the gradients small in
smooth convex optimization and convex-concave min-max optimization. Our
framework is intuitive and it provides a lens for viewing algorithms that make
the gradients small as being driven by a trade-off between reducing either the
gradient norm or a certain notion of an optimality gap. On the lower bounds
side, we discuss tightness of the obtained convergence results for the convex
setup and provide a new lower bound for minimizing norm of cocoercive operators
that allows us to argue about optimality of methods in the min-max setup.

claim to possess free will? Compatibilists argue that the answer is yes, and
that free will is compatible with complete determinism. Previously, it has been
suggested that the notion of computational irreducibility can shed light on
this relation: it implies that there cannot in general be "shortcuts" to the
decisions of agents, explaining why deterministic agents often appear to have
free will. In this paper, we introduce a variant of computational
irreducibility that intends to capture more accurately aspects of actual (as
opposed to apparent) free will: computational sourcehood, i.e. the phenomenon
that the successful prediction of a process' outputs must typically involve an
almost-exact representation of the relevant features of that process,
regardless of the time it takes to arrive at the prediction. We conjecture that
many processes have this property, and we study different possibilities for how
to formalize this conjecture in terms of universal Turing machines. While we
are not able to settle the conjecture, we give several results and
constructions that shed light on the quest for its correct formulation.

multiple fields such as computer vision and biology. Recently, there has been a
plethora of work studying efficient algorithms for graph matching under

improves the condition $\alpha \le 1 / (\log n)^C$ achieved in previous work.

achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale image classification,
object detection and natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we
consider noisy binary neural networks, where each neuron has a non-zero
probability of producing an incorrect output. These noisy models may arise from
biological, physical and electronic contexts and constitute an important class
of models that are relevant to the physical world. Intuitively, the number of
neurons in such systems has to grow to compensate for the noise while
maintaining the same level of expressive power and computation reliability. Our
key finding is a lower bound for the required number of neurons in noisy neural
networks, which is first of its kind. To prove this lower bound, we take an
information theoretic approach and obtain a novel strong data processing
inequality (SDPI), which not only generalizes the Evans-Schulman results for
binary symmetric channels to general channels, but also improves the tightness
drastically when applied to estimate end-to-end information contraction in
networks. Our SDPI can be applied to various information processing systems,
including neural networks and cellular automata. Applying the SPDI in noisy
binary neural networks, we obtain our key lower bound and investigate its
implications on network depth-width trade-offs, our results suggest a
depth-width trade-off for noisy neural networks that is very different from the
established understanding regarding noiseless neural networks. Furthermore, we
apply the SDPI to study fault-tolerant cellular automata and obtain bounds on
the error correction overheads and the relaxation time. This paper offers new
understanding of noisy information processing systems through the lens of
information theory.

Mediated Queries (OMQs) based on Guarded TGDs (GTGDs) and Unions of Conjunctive
Queries (UCQs), in the setting where relational symbols might have unbounded
arity and where the parameter is the size of the OMQ. It establishes exact
criteria for fixed-parameter tractability (fpt) evaluation of recursively
enumerable classes of such OMQs (under the widely held Exponential Time
Hypothesis). One of the main technical tools introduced in the paper is an
fpt-reduction from deciding parameterized uniform CSPs to parameterized OMQ
evaluation. A fundamental feature of the reduction is preservation of measures
which are known to be essential for classifying classes of parameterized
uniform CSPs: submodular width (according to the well known result of Marx for
unbounded-arity schemas) and treewidth (according to the well known result of
Grohe for bounded-arity schemas). As such, the reduction can be employed to
obtain hardness results for evaluation of classes of parameterized OMQs both in
the unbounded and in the bounded arity case. Previously, in the case of bounded
arity schemas, this has been tackled using a technique requiring full
introspection into the construction employed by Grohe.

Consider the family of bounded degree graphs in any minor-closed family (such as planar graphs). Let d be the degree bound and n be the number of vertices of such a graph. Graphs in these classes have hyperfinite decompositions, where, for a sufficiently small ? &gt; 0, one removes
?dn edges to get connected components of size independent of n. An important tool for sublinear
algorithms and property testing for such classes is the partition oracle, introduced by the seminal
work of Hassidim-Kelner-Nguyen-Onak (FOCS 2009). A partition oracle is a local procedure
that gives consistent access to a hyperfinite decomposition, without any preprocessing. Given a
query vertex v, the partition oracle outputs the component containing v in time independent of
n. All the answers are consistent with a single hyperfinite decomposition.
The partition oracle of Hassidim et al. runs in time d^poly(d/?)-per query. They pose the
open problem of whether poly(d/?)-time partition oracles exist. Levi-Ron (ICALP 2013) give
a refinement of the previous approach, to get a partition oracle that runs in time d^log(d/?)-per
query.
In this paper, we resolve this open problem and give poly(d/?)-time partition oracles for
bounded degree graphs in any minor-closed family. Unlike the previous line of work based on
combinatorial methods, we employ techniques from spectral graph theory. We build on a recent
spectral graph theoretical toolkit for minor-closed graph families, introduced by the authors to
develop efficient property testers. A consequence of our result is a poly(d/?)-query tester for
any property of minor-closed families (such as bipartite planar graphs). Our result also gives
poly(d/?)-query algorithms for additive ?n-approximations for problems such as maximum
matching, minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, and minimum dominating set for
these graph families.</div>

<p>This month <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/home.html">Robin Hanson</a>, the famous and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3766">controversy-prone</a> George Mason University economics professor who I’ve known since 2004, was visiting economists here in Austin for a few weeks.  So, while my fear of covid considerably exceeds Robin’s, I met with him a few times in the mild Texas winter in an outdoor, socially-distanced way.  It took only a few minutes for me to remember why I enjoy talking to Robin so much.</p>



<p>See, while I’d been moping around depressed about covid, the vaccine rollout, the insurrection, my inability to focus on work, and a dozen other things, Robin was bubbling with excitement about a brand-new mathematical model he was working on to understand the growth of civilizations across the universe—a model that, Robin said, explained lots of cosmic mysteries in one fell swoop and also made striking predictions.  My cloth facemask was, I confess, unable to protect me from Robin’s infectious enthusiasm.</p>



<p>As I listened, I went through the classic stages of reaction to a new Hansonian proposal: first, bemusement over the sheer weirdness of what I was being asked to entertain, as well as Robin’s failure to acknowledge that weirdness in any way whatsoever; then, confusion about the unstated steps in his radically-condensed logic; next, the raising by me of numerous objections (each of which, it turned out, Robin had already thought through at length); finally, the feeling that I <em>must have</em> seen it this way all along, because isn’t it kind of obvious?</p>



<p>Robin has been explaining his model in a <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/12/how-far-aggressive-aliens.html">sequence</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/12/how-far-aggressive-aliens-part-2.html">of</a> <em><a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/12/the-long-term-future-of-history.html">Overcoming</a> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/01/try-menu-combo-filter-steps.html">Bias</a></em> <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2021/01/why-we-cant-see-grabby-aliens.html">posts</a>, and will apparently have a paper out about the model soon.  In this post, I’d like to offer my own take on what Robin taught me.  Blame for anything I mangle lies with me alone.</p>



<p>To cut to the chase, Robin is trying to explain the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>: why, after 60+ years of looking, and despite the periodic excitement around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby%27s_Star">Tabby’s star</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua">‘Oumuamua</a> and the like, have we not seen a single undisputed sign of an extraterrestrial civilization?  Why all this nothing, even though the observable universe is vast, even though (as we now know) organic molecules and planets in Goldilocks zones are everywhere, and even though there have been billions of years for aliens someplace to get a technological head start on us, expanding across a galaxy to the point where they’re easily seen?</p>



<p>Traditional answers to this mystery include: maybe the extraterrestrials quickly annihilate themselves in nuclear wars or environmental cataclysms, just like we soon will; maybe the extraterrestrials don’t <em>want</em> to be found (whether out of self-defense or a cosmic Prime Directive); maybe they spend all their time playing video games.  Crucially, though, all answers of that sort founder against the realization that, given a million alien civilizations, each perhaps more different from the others than kangaroos are from squid, <em>it would only take one</em>, spreading across a billion light-years and transforming everything to its liking, for us to have noticed it.</p>



<p>Robin’s answer to the puzzle is as simple as it is terrifying.  Such civilizations might well exist, he says, but if so, by the time we noticed one, it would already be nearly too late.  Robin proposes, plausibly I think, that if you give a technological civilization 10 million or so years—i.e., an eyeblink on cosmological timescales—then <em>either</em></p>



<ol><li>the civilization wipes itself out, <em>or else</em></li><li>it reaches some relatively quiet steady state, <em>or else</em></li><li>if it’s serious about spreading widely, then it “maxes out” the technology with which to do so, approaching the limits set by physical law.</li></ol>



<p>In cases 1 or 2, the civilization will of course be hard for us to detect, unless it happens to be close by.  But what about case 3?  There, Robin says, the “civilization” should look from the outside like a sphere expanding at nearly the speed of light, transforming everything in its path.</p>



<p>Now think about it: when could we, on earth, detect such a sphere with our telescopes?  Only when the sphere’s thin outer shell had reached the earth—perhaps carrying radio signals from the extraterrestrials’ early history, <em>before</em> their rapid expansion started.  By that point, though, the expanding sphere itself would be nearly upon us!</p>



<p>What would happen to us once we were inside the sphere?  Who knows?  The expanding civilization might obliterate us, it might preserve us as zoo animals, it might merge us into its hive-mind, it might do something else that we can’t imagine, but in any case, <em>detecting</em> the civilization would presumably no longer be the relevant concern!</p>



<p>(Of course, one could also wonder what happens when two of these spheres collide: do they fight it out?  do they reach some agreement?  do they merge?  Whatever the answer, though, it doesn’t matter for Robin’s argument.)</p>



<p>On the view described, there’s only a tiny cosmic window in which a SETI program could be expected to succeed: namely, when the thin surface of the first of these expanding bubbles has just hit us, and when that surface hasn’t yet passed us by.  So, given our “selection bias”—meaning, the fact that we apparently <em>haven’t</em> yet been swallowed up by one of the bubbles—it’s no surprise if we don’t right now happen to find ourselves in the tiny detection window!</p>



<p>This basic proposal, it turns out, is not original to Robin.  Indeed, an <em>Overcoming Bias</em> reader named Daniel X. Varga <a href="http://disq.us/p/2eczhce">pointed out to Robin</a> that he (Daniel) <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=334#comment-10766">shared the same idea right here</a>—in a <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> comment thread—back in 2008!  I must have read Daniel Varga’s comment then, but (embarrassingly) it didn’t make enough of an impression for me to have remembered it.  I probably thought the same as <em>you</em> probably thought while reading this post:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Sure, whatever.  This is an amusing speculation that could make for a fun science-fiction story.  Alas, like with virtually <em>every</em> story about extraterrestrials, there’s no good reason to favor this over a hundred other stories that a fertile imagination could just as easily spin.  Who the hell knows?”</p></blockquote>



<p>This is where Robin claims to take things further.  Robin would say that he takes them further by developing a mathematical model, and fitting the parameters of the model to the known facts of cosmic history.  Read <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/">Overcoming Bias</a>, or Robin’s forthcoming paper, if you want to know the details of his model.  Personally, I confess I’m less interested in those details than I am in the qualitative points, which (unless I’m mistaken) are easy enough to explain in words.</p>



<p>The key realization is this: when we contemplate the Fermi Paradox, we know more than the mere fact that we look and look and we don’t see any aliens.  There are other relevant data points to fit, having to do with the one sample of a technological civilization that we <em>do</em> have.</p>



<p>For starters, there’s the fact that life on earth has been evolving for at least ~3.5 billion years—for most of the time the earth has existed—<em>but</em> life has a mere billion more years to go, until the expanding sun boils away the oceans and makes the earth barely habitable.  In other words, at least on <em>this</em> planet, we’re already relatively close to the end.  Why should that be?</p>



<p>It’s an excellent fit, Robin says, to a model wherein there are a few incredibly difficult, improbable steps along the way to a technological civilization like ours—steps that might include the origin of life, of multicellular life, of consciousness, of language, of something else—and wherein, having achieved some step, evolution basically just does a random search until it either stumbles onto the next step or else runs out of time.</p>



<p>Of course, given that we’re here to talk about it, we necessarily find ourselves on a planet where all the steps necessary for blog-capable life happen to have succeeded.  There might be vastly more planets where evolution got stuck on some earlier step.</p>



<p>But here’s the interesting part: conditioned on all the steps having succeeded, we <em>should</em> find ourselves near the end of the useful lifetime of our planet’s star—simply because the more time is available on a given planet, the better the odds there.  I.e., look around the universe and you should find that, on <em>most</em> of the planets where evolution achieves all the steps, it nearly runs out the planet’s clock in doing so.  Also, as we look back, we should find the hard steps roughly evenly spaced out, with each one having taken a good fraction of the whole available time.  All this is an excellent match for what we see.</p>



<p>OK, but it leads to a second puzzle.  Life on earth is at least ~3.5 billion years old, while the observable universe is ~13.7 billion years old.  Forget for a moment about the oft-stressed enormity of these two timescales and concentrate on their <em>ratio</em>, which is merely ~4. <em> </em><strong>Life on earth stretches a full quarter of the way back in time to the Big Bang.</strong>  Even as an adolescent, I remember finding that striking, and not at all what I would’ve guessed <em>a priori</em>.  It seemed like obviously a clue to <em>something</em>, if I could only figure out what.</p>



<p>The puzzle is compounded once you realize that, even though the sun will boil the oceans in a billion years (and then die in a few billion more), other stars, primarily dwarf stars, will continue shining brightly for <em>trillions</em> more years.  Granted, the dwarf stars don’t seem quite as hospitable to life as sun-like stars, but they do seem <em>somewhat</em> hospitable, and there will be <em>lots</em> of them—indeed, more than of sun-like stars.  And they’ll last orders of magnitude longer.</p>



<p>To sum up, our temporal position relative to the lifetime of the sun makes it look as though life on earth was just a lucky draw from a gigantic cosmic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_point_process">Poisson process</a>.  By contrast, our position relative to the lifetime of <em>all</em> the stars makes it look as though we arrived crazily, freakishly early—not at all what you’d expect under a random model.  So what gives?</p>



<p>Robin contends that <em>all</em> of these facts are explained under his bubble scenario.  If we’re to have an experience remotely like the human one, he says, then we <em>have to be</em> relatively close to the beginning of time—since hundreds of billions of years from now, the universe will likely be dominated by near-light-speed expanding spheres of intelligence, and a little upstart civilization like ours would no longer stand a chance.  I.e., even though our existence is down to some lucky accidents, and even though those same accidents probably recur throughout the cosmos, we shouldn’t yet <em>see</em> any of the other accidents, since if we did see them, it would already be nearly too late for us.</p>



<p>Robin admits that his account leaves a huge question open: namely, why should our experience have been a “merely human,” “pre-bubble” experience at all?  If you buy that these expanding bubbles are coming, it seems likely that there will be trillions of times more sentient experiences inside them than outside.  So experiences like ours would be rare and anomalous—like finding yourself at the dawn of human history, with Hammurabi et al., and realizing that almost every interesting thing that will ever happen is still to the future.  So Robin simply takes as a brute fact that our experience is “earth-like” or “human-like”; he then tries to explain the other observations from that starting point.</p>



<p>Notice that, in Robin’s scenario, the present epoch of the universe is extremely special: it’s when civilizations are just forming, when perhaps a few of them will achieve technological liftoff, but <em>before</em> one or more of the civilizations has remade the whole of creation for its own purposes.  Now is the time when the early intelligent beings like us can still look out and see quadrillions of stars shining to no apparent purpose, just <em>wasting</em> all that nuclear fuel in a near-empty cosmos, waiting for someone to come along and put the energy to good use.  In that respect, we’re sort of like the Maoris having just landed in New Zealand, or Bill Gates surveying the microcomputer software industry in 1975.  We’re ridiculously lucky.  The situation is way out of equilibrium.  The golden opportunity in front of us can’t possibly last forever.</p>



<p>If we accept the above, then a major question I had was the role of cosmology.  In 1998, astronomers discovered that the present cosmological epoch is special for a completely<em> different</em> reason than the one Robin talks about.  Namely, right now is when matter and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy">dark energy</a> contribute roughly similarly to the universe’s energy budget, with ~30% the former and ~70% the latter.  Billions of years hence, the universe will become more and more dominated by dark energy.  Our observable region will get sparser and sparser, as the dark energy pushes the galaxies further and further away from each other and from us, with more and more galaxies receding past the horizon where we could receive signals from them at the speed of light.  (Which means, in particular, that if you want to visit a galaxy a few billion light-years from here, you’d better start out while you still can!)</p>



<p>So here’s my question: is it just a coincidence that the time—right now—when the universe is “there for the taking,” potentially poised between competing spacefaring civilizations, is <em>also</em> the time when it’s poised between matter and dark energy?  Note that, in 2007, Bousso et al. tried to give a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0702115">sophisticated anthropic argument</a> for the value of the cosmological constant Λ, which measures the density of dark energy, and hence the eventual size of the observable universe.  <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=328">See here</a> for my blog post on what they did (“The array size of the universe”).  Long story short, for reasons that I explain in the post, it turns out to be essential to their anthropic explanation for Λ that civilizations flourish <em>only</em> (or mainly) in the present epoch, rather than trillions of years in the future.  If we had to count civilizations that far into the future, then the calculations would favor values of Λ much smaller than what we actually observe.  This, of course, seems to dovetail nicely with Robin’s account.</p>



<p>Let me end with some “practical” consequences of Robin’s scenario, supposing as usual that we take it seriously.  The most immediate consequence is that the prospects for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence">SETI</a> are dimmer than you might’ve thought before you’d internalized all this.  (Even <em>after</em> having interalized it, I’d still like at least an order of magnitude more resources devoted to SETI than what our civilization currently spares.  Robin’s assumptions might be wrong!)</p>



<p>But a second consequence is that, if we want human-originated sentience to spread across the universe, then the sooner we get started the better!  Just like Bill Gates in 1975, we should expect that there will soon be competitors out there.  Indeed, there are likely competitors out there “already” (where “already” means, let’s say, in the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background)—it’s just that the light from them hasn’t yet reached us.  So if we want to determine our own cosmic destiny, rather than having post-singularity extraterrestrials determine it for us, then it’s way past time to get our act together as a species.  We might have only a few hundred million more years to do so.</p>

I especially liked a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/l8l4np/once_we_can_see_them_its_too_late/glel0lq/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">beautiful comment by “Njordsier,”</a> which fills in some important context for the arguments in this post:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Suppose you’re an alien anthropologist that sent a probe to Earth a million years ago, and that probe can send back one high-resolution image of the Earth every hundred years. You’d barely notice humans at first, though they’re there. Then, circa 10,000 years ago (99% of the way into the stream) you begin to see plots of land turned into farms. Houses, then cities, first in a few isolated places in river valleys, then exploding across five or six continents. Walls, roads, aqueducts, castles, fortresses. Four frames before the end of the stream, the collapse of the population on two of the continents as invaders from another continent bring disease. At T-minus three frames, a sudden appearance of farmland and cities on the coasts those continents. At T-minus two frames, half the continent. At the second to last frame, a roaring interconnected network of roads, cities, farms, including skyscrapers in the cities that were just trying villas three frames ago. And in the last frame, nearly 80 percent of all wilderness converted to some kind of artifice, and the sky is streaked with the trails of flying machines all over the world.</p><p>Civilizations rose and fell, cultures evolved and clashed, and great and terrible men and women performed awesome deeds. But what the alien anthropologist sees is a consistent, rapid, exponential explosion of a species bulldozing everything in its path.</p><p>That’s what we’re doing when we talk about the far future, or about hypothetical expansionist aliens, on long time scales.

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Jan. 31):</span></strong> Reading the reactions here, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25972111">on Hacker News</a>, and elsewhere underscored for me that a lot of people get off Robin’s train well before it’s even left the station.  Such people think of extraterrestrial civilizations as things that you either <em>find</em> or, if you haven’t found one, you just <em>speculate</em> or <em>invent stories</em> about.  They’re not even in the category of things that you have any serious hope to <em>reason</em> about.  For myself, I’d simply observe that trying to reason about matters far beyond current human experience, based on the microscopic shreds of fact available to us (e.g., about the earth’s spatial and temporal position within the universe), has led to some of our species’ embarrassing failures but also to some of its greatest triumphs.  Since even the failures tend to be relatively cheap, I feel like we ought to be “venture capitalists” about such efforts to reason beyond our station, encouraging them collegially and mocking them only gently.</p></div>

<p>
Alan Selman, my longtime friend and colleague, passed away last Friday, from the one illness that is most cruel for someone who has excelled by brainpower and effervescent <em>joie de vivre</em> alike.</p>
<p>
Today, Dick and I join others in mourning and also in appreciation.</p>
<p>
I last saw Alan with his wife Sharon in May 2019 at the dinner for the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/18-19/NP50">NP50</a> celebration of Steve Cook in Toronto. There were inklings of his affliction but nothing that kept him from engaging in dinner talk about how our field has progressed, about reunited friends, about the convivial atmosphere and culture on display during the celebration, and even my own goings-on with chess and quantum complexity and all our grown children. Alan was still going out to concerts last March until the pandemic stopped all that kind of activity. </p>
<p>
I’ve known Alan in person for almost 40 years, starting a decade before he became my Chair for 6 years and colleague for 18 years more of them before his retirement and move to New Jersey. This was all through my graduate study at Oxford. It began at ICALP 1982 in Aarhus after my first year. During a December 1983 workshop at Brooklyn College he shared a problem with me whose story I told <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/14/it-dont-come-easy/">here</a>. He visited me in Oxford in early 1986 accompanied by his son Jeffrey, whose eulogy in this past Sunday’s burial <a href="https://www.facebook.com/162731740423576/videos/756739685268316">service</a> was especially moving. Alan gave me other helps in 1985–86 that aided my “repatriation,” so to speak. My point is that he took great interest in builders of complexity theory even as students—Uwe Schöning noted that he visited him in 1982 while he was a student as well. My 2014 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/05/13/nexp-and-the-next-generation/">post</a> on Alan’s retirement party expressed how this continued throughout. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> P NE NP </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As others have remarked, Alan’s cars had a license plate that declared <b>P NE NP</b>. Over a quarter century I regularly saw it in the parking lot serving Bell Hall, and after 2012, the same lot for our department’s new digs in Davis Hall. My colleague Sargur Srihari relates seeing someone approach Alan in the lot and say, “Yes, but can you prove it?”—adding that it was “probably the only thing in complexity that Alan couldn’t do.” An irony I will say here now is that the Dean of Engineering and Applied Sciences whom Alan worked with during much of his time as Chair, Mark Karwan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00353">claims</a> the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03549">opposite</a>. It would have been fun to see a dueling license plate saying <b>P EQ NP</b>.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/01/29/alan-selman-1941-2021/license_20210126153121_34106/" rel="attachment wp-att-18044"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/license_20210126153121_34106.jpg?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18044" /></a></p>
<p>
Long followers of this blog know that Dick and I have embodied this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/our-thoughts-on-pnp/">duel</a> between ourselves. Only recently has Dick <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/12/08/pnp-perhaps-i-change-my-mind/">swung</a> toward <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/16/pnp/">P <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" /> NP</a>, while <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2018/02/16/i-believe-pnp/">some</a> have <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858">moved</a> the other <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/comp409/pvnp10.pdf">way</a>. </p>
<p>
But what we think everyone would agree on is that we cannot point to any definite progress in the past dozen-plus years, at least not directly on the question. This struck me particularly from the Cook workshop, and this would have been the lead theme of a post on it, had I not been sprinting toward an effective June deadline to complete a major upgrade to my statistical chess model which I <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/predicting-chess-and-horses/">achieved</a> two months later. No one attested real progress in comments to our P=NP status <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/our-thoughts-on-pnp/">post</a> a year ago. I wrote to Sharon two weeks ago that I wished I could tell Alan of progress but no.</p>
<p>
Where Alan, Dick, I, and many of us are completely aligned is on these two points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The importance of unwavering focus on P versus NP and other fundamental questions about computational problems, despite our field’s lack of scientific achievement in classifying them. <p></p>
</li><li>
Emphasis on what our field has positively, scientifically, and perhaps surprisingly achieved, which is showing deep and crisp mathematical relations among thousands of diverse problems. These relations can be phrased not only in the common term <em>reductions</em> but in terms that arose in structural complexity, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berman-Hartmanis_conjecture">isomorphisms</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-table_reduction">(non-)adaptivity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimonious_reduction">parsinomiousness</a>, and <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/insep.pdf">(in-)separability</a>.
</li></ol>
<p>
We put in the mouth of a fictional <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/stoc-1500/">STOC 1500</a> keynote the position that relations between problems should be the field’s fundamental objects. There is incredible beauty in these objects, as was the theme of Lane Hemaspaandra’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.4106.pdf">tribute</a> to Alan on his retirement surveying gems of Alan’s work, and it was my elation to be captivated by them beginning in my graduate years of the 1980s.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Elijah </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Alan’s Hebrew name was <em>Eliyahu</em>, Elijah. In the Bible, Elijah is a traveling prophet: he not only goes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarepta">Zarephath</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beersheba">Beersheba</a> but all the way south to Mount Sinai, where he is commanded to return all the way north to Damascus. The mission from Sinai is conveyed not in cloud and fire as with Moses, nor in wind or earthquake, but <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+19:9-16&amp;version=KJV">famously</a> in a still small voice. </p>
<p>
That was the kind of voice in which Alan during his many travels spread the love of complexity theory. I was glad to experience his kindness, good crisp advice, and also the giving of freedom to pursue things with zeal—a trait that Elijah had and recognized. I was not so fast to recognize good food and fine culture. I remember once when Alan was especially happy about securing tickets to see the 86-year-old legendary jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli perform in Buffalo and I did not know who that was. I was, however, able to reply that I’d once seen Chet Baker live while standing in a small room in London. He and Sharon and my wife Debbie and I shared other musical interests. All of what I implied about whole-person education in my <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2021/01/01/peter-m-neumann-1940-2020/">memorial</a> for Peter Neumann applies to Alan. In Bell Hall we had only a mid-size seminar room for gatherings, yet Alan right away recognized the importance of making it like Oxford’s Mathematical Institute tea room—but with wine included—in weekly Friday afternoon “TGIF” gatherings open to faculty and graduate students, for which I did the shopping those mornings at Wegmans.</p>
<p>
Elijah is also known as a keeper of promises. I won’t go into the gruesome biblical details here, but rather note that Alan shepherded a promise of a different kind: the notion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promise_problem">promise problem</a>, following on from his famous 1984 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001999588480056X">paper</a> with Shimon Even and Yacov Yacobi. This is a structural complexity concept whose usage has grown, besides the original technical challenges which I recounted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/14/it-dont-come-easy/">here</a>. I’ve sometimes felt that wider uses have run risk of getting burned by inexactitudes, such as in the notion of promise-completeness.  Alan’s exactness was one trait that made me feel at home.</p>
<p>
Elijah also founds a school <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+2:1-9&amp;version=KJV">called</a> the “sons of the prophets,” passing his mantle to Elisha before being taken up in a chariot of fire. It is not for me to say who might pick up Alan’s mantle in structural complexity. But many in his train have said wonderful things in tribute over the weekend, and I wish to pass along some of them, with quotes from those who have given permission or have already written in public, in particular as comments to Lance Fortnow’s <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/alan-selman-1941-2021.html">tribute</a> to Alan.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Tributes From Colleagues </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The news was passed around our department in Buffalo. Our Chair, <b>Chunming Qiao</b>, mourned the loss of a great colleague, a former Chair, and a respected scholar. <b>Sargur Srihari</b> told the parking lot story above and and noted how Alan recruited a star to the department in the person of Jin-Yi Cai. <b>Stuart Shapiro</b>, who preceded and succeeded Alan as Chair, noted Alan’s higher personal standards for research and publishing. <b>Russ Miller</b>, writing earlier this month when we had news of Alan’s being in hospice care, hailed him as “a terrific person,” meeting the standard of a “true gentleman and scholar,” and hailed his communication skills with colleagues and the university administration alike. <b>Jinhui Xu</b> expressed thanks for Alan’s thoughtfulness and role as a mentor. I can say all this from my own experience. Many of us also took part in the earlier outpouring of affection, including photos and memories of Alan’s time in Buffalo, that was communicated to Sharon. </p>
<p>
<b>Mark Karwan</b> adds, “Alan continued to win awards and accolades throughout my 12 years as Dean which ended in 2006. All of his professional accomplishments provided a great sense of pride and international recognition for UB. Alan was truly a senior leader and mentor for so many. He spoke to me as an advocate for his department and for the young rising faculty and the need to nourish and retain them. His wise counsel was always given in the most gentlemanly manner. When I picture Alan today, I see the twinkle in his eyes and his contagious joy of life. I only started working relatively recently with a colleague in our field of Operations Research on matters in complexity with implications to support P = NP. It would have been such fun to bring Alan into our conversations! We will all miss Alan and will always appreciate the great legacy he created here at UB.” </p>
<p>
<b>Jin-Yi</b>, of course, is well known to all who knew Alan in the theory community and readers of this blog. He called Alan a great structural complexity theorist, and wrote in one of many e-mails I’ve been copied on: “Alan [was] a wonderful colleague of mine, and had a lifetime contribution to complexity theory that will certainly live on. He had a dry wit, enigmatic smile, and most of all, a truly kind heart. We will always remember him in our fond memory.”</p>
<p>
<b>Atri Rudra</b> worked with Alan on many projects including organizing and securing funding for the Eastern Great Lakes (EaGL) Theory Workshops along with Bobby Kleinberg of Cornell. Here are two photos from the first one in 2008:</p>

Atri writes, “I still remember being taken directly from the airport to Alan’s favorite restaurant, Trattoria Aroma, during my interview at Buffalo. I was a bit intimidated by Alan during the dinner but we bonded over the fact that we were both married to epidemiologists. After I joined Buffalo, Alan’s sage advice helped me throughout my tenure process. Alan was a giant in the department and having him in my corner did not hurt. [H]e had a wicked sense of humor as well.”</p>
<p>
<b>Mitsunori Ogihara</b> succeeded Alan as Editor-in-Chief of the <a href="https://www.springer.com/journal/224">journal</a> <em>Theory of Computer Systems</em> and blossomed from being a postdoc recruited by Alan at UB to being Chair of Computer Science at the University of Rochester in a few short years. The story of my taking Mitsu from the airport on a snowy night will be told another time. He is writing his own tribute to appear in the journal, from which I quote just a few words: “While being a scholar of uncanny vision and incredible ingenuity, Alan was a lovely human being. He was generous with his time for his students and colleagues, always willing to offer consultation and advice. The field of theoretical computer science has lost its giant. Alan is no longer here to lead us, but his legacy will live.”</p>
<p>
<b>Lane Hemaspaandra</b>, Mitsu’s colleague at UR, writes: “Very briefly put, Alan’s research handiwork and vision is ingrained in the shape of the field. I was lucky enough to through his generosity know Alan across decades: we co-edited a book, wrote two research papers together, even wrote—Alan had a real love of writing and language—a note on writing in theoretical computer science, and had a long tradition of research seminars and theory days that brought together the University at Buffalo, RIT, and University of Rochester theory groups. Alan was also my wife’s wonderful postdoctoral advisor. And, throughout all that, and coexisting with Alan’s technical artistry and amazing taste in theory research, Alan’s love of and expertise in the ‘real’ world was quiet yet luminous. Alan loved the theater, and spoke warmly of his beloved Shaw Festival at Niagara-on-the-Lake. He loved and knew food; any restaurant commended by Alan was going to be an experience.”</p>
<p>
<b>Ashish Naik</b> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/alan-selman-1941-2021.html?showComment=1611460983996#c8100240511053878034">noted</a> that he was Alan’s first student in Buffalo: “[I] still remember going to his office to ask if he would take me as a student, somewhat intimidated because of his stature in the field. Alan he put me at ease immediately with his sense of humor (I still remember the cartoon clippings on his office door) and his generosity. Despite a busy schedule as the Chair, Alan always had time for me — introducing me to the field, sharing interesting problems and his ideas, and teaching me how to write well and asking the right questions, skills that have stayed with me forever.”</p>
<p>
<b>D. Sivakumar</b> was my student at the same time as Ashish, and began his own <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/alan-selman-1941-2021.html?showComment=1611529242421#c422919304502293363">comment</a> in Lance’s tribute by noting how Alan’s early work with Neil Jones on a logical characterization of nondeterministic exponential time was a precursor to Ron Fagin’s 1974 <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-fagin/genspec.pdf">characterization</a> of NP. He continued how at the end of his first year in Buffalo, “Alan encouraged us students to attend the Structures conference in Boston even though only one of us a theory-committed student. Alan drummed up some money to pay our registration, and we rented a car and stayed with friends in Boston. Structures’92 was magical for me—my first academic conference—everything about the atmosphere, the ideas, the people was fascinating and I decided to work in that field. All the work in my thesis (sparse sets, measure theory,…) were on topics I heard about for the first time at Structures’92—without Alan’s nudge, my life would likely have taken an entirely different trajectory. … Alan’s wit, dry humor, and his generosity are the things I’ll remember forever.”</p>
<p>
<b>Pavan Aduri</b> was also Alan’s student in the 1990s and, speaking during a <em>shiv’ah</em> service with the family on Monday (via Zoom), noted Alan’s quest for <em>simplicity</em> in complexity theory. “Whenever I started to present a proof, Alan would ask, ‘Can you simplify the proof?’ ” Now at Iowa State, he recalled that he would frequently reach out to Alan for advice on various matters, even on what would be a more appropriate title for a research proposal. “Alan was always very generous with his time and advice.” <b>Frederic Green</b> related at the <em>shiv’ah</em> how Alan helped him migrate from physics to complexity and once reviewed every single step of four pages of notes on a complicated proof to optimize it for presentation. <b>Steve Fenner</b> told of Alan’s hosting him in Buffalo right after Steve’s PhD and putting him at ease with small talk about the permanently temporary quarters in Bell Hall. <b>Steve Homer</b> and his wife told of being travel partners exploring castles and flower markets, and the long gestation of the Homer-Selman <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461406815">textbook</a>, <em>Computability and Complexity Theory</em>.</p>
<p>
<b>Harry Buhrman</b> writes: “Alan has been an inspiration for me from the time I started working as a PhD student in complexity theory. My first encounter was his beautiful work on reductions and P-selective sets. I jokingly used to call them P-Selman-sets. I consider myself very lucky that he came over to my PhD defense in 1993 in Amsterdam. It was a joyous gathering.” I remember the photos Alan showed of that defence as well as Edith Hemaspaandra’s: grand pageantry on a scale I did not see even at Oxford, and led by Harry’s co-advisor <b>Peter van Emde Boas</b>, whose <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/alan-selman-1941-2021.html?showComment=1611483268043#c1171975184441035945">note</a> in Lance’s tribute recalled the genesis of the “Structures” conferences in 1985–86 and the 1994 edition in Amsterdam and both hosting and visiting Alan and Sharon for dinners.</p>
<p>
My retired colleague <b>Mike Buckley</b> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/alan-selman-1941-2021.html?showComment=1611419108397#c7225101539941877122">wrote</a>, “I taught with Alan at UB, and he taught me how to teach. Students sought him out until the day he left. He put as much into the undergrads as the PhDs. His presence at faculty meetings meant that no decision was made until he had his last comment. He was a giant in the field, but also the world’s nicest man. I kept in touch and we talked stereos and jazz. I miss him already.”</p>
<p>
<b>Arnold Rosenberg</b> and <b>Paul Spirakis</b> hailed Alan as “a true pioneer and leader in the area of logic-based CS” and noted their long cooperation on the editorial board of the <em>Theory of Computing Systems</em> journal. Arnold continued: “He played vital roles in both research and education in CS. He approached every professional challenge with vision and unswerving devotion to the highest standards of our field. Our journal and our field have lost a great person.” <b>Rod Downey</b> included special thanks for Alan’s early support of parameterized complexity and the journal’s support, for instance in special issues.</p>

Today I want to wish him also a happy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbirthday">un-birthday</a>.</p>
<p>
Recall an un-birthday is celebrated on any day that is not your birthday. It was created by Lewis Carroll in his 1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass. </p>
<p>I aways liked the concept of un-birthdays. Probably only a mathematician like Carroll could think of this—every set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> has a complement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7BS%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{S}}" class="latex" title="{\bar{S}}" />.</p>

<p></p><h2> Quest for Correctness </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Rich and I started our work together over four decades ago. A central theme of our work was <i>correctness</i>. We were concerned That programs might not work as planned. At the time it was not obvious that this was a major theme of our joint work. But looking back now I can see that it was. </p>
<p>
We wrote several papers on correctness, from various angles.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Our work on practical approaches to program testing. The main paper was <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1646911">Hints on test data selection: Help for the practicing programmer</a> by Rich DeMillo, Fred Sayward in 1978. This was part of our work on the mutation program testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">method</a>. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Our <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-69053-0_4">On the importance of checking cryptographic protocols for faults</a> by Dan Boneh, Rich DeMillo in 1997. This showed that incorrect crypto systems could be attacked much easier than correct ones. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Our <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">Social processes and proofs of theorems and programs</a> by Rich DeMillo, Alan Perlis. This was paper argued against verification technology as the main way to make programs correct. Was attacked as wrong then, and probably still viewed as wrong by many. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Our <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA050745.pdf">Probabilistic Remark on Algebraic Program Testing</a> 1977 By Rich DeMillo. And in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0020019078900674">Information Processing Letters</a>. See how we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">missed the boat</a> on this important result. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Quests </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Rich has done much besides his research, that covered much more than just the above papers. He has had a long successful career that has two paths. He was a leader in industry and in government. At Hewlett-Packard Company he served as the company’s first Chief Technology Officer. He also held executive positions with Telcordia Technologies (formerly known as Bell Communications Research) and the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>
He was and still is a leader in academia. He is currently Distinguished Professor of Computing and Professor of Management at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He was the John P. Imlay Dean of Computing at Georgia Tech for six years. He is now the Chair of the new School of Cybersecurity and Privacy in the College of Computing.</p>

The project began in January 2009 on Timothy Gowers’s blog when he posted a problem and asked his readers to post partial ideas and partial progress toward a solution. This experiment resulted in a new answer to a difficult problem, and since then the Polymath Project has grown to describe a particular process of using an online collaboration to solve any math problem.</p>



<p>After the success of Polymath1 and the launching of Polymath3 and Polymath4, Tim Gowers wrote a blog post <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/possible-future-polymath-projects">“Possible future Polymath projects”</a> for planning the next polymath project on his blog. The post mentioned 9 possible projects. (Three of them later turned  to polymath projects, and one turned into a project of a different nature.) Following the post and separate posts describing some of the proposed projects, a few polls were taken and a problem – the Erdős discrepancy problem, was selected for the next project polymath5. </p>
<p>One of our next posts will have the same title and similar purpose as Tim’s 2009 post.  I will describe several possibilities for my next polymath project. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>(A quick rather vague and tentative preview can be found at the end of this post.</strong></span>) Today we go back to Tim’s 2009 post and the problems posed there.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"> Comments on the 2009 proposed projects, the new proposed projects, other proposed projects, and on the polymath endeavor, are most welcome. (At the end of the post I also mention a few “meta” questions.)</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me also mention <a href="https://polytcs.wordpress.com/" rel="home">The PolyTCS Project</a> aimed for proposing projects in theoretical computer science. There are so far three very interesting proposals there, and the first proposal is the Friedgut-Kalai <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/08/16/gil-kalai-the-entropyinfluence-conjecture/">Entropy/Influence conjecture</a>. For various proposals, see also <a href="http://polymathprojects.org/">the polymath blog</a> administered by Tim Gowers, Michael Nielsen, Terry Tao, and me, and <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/219638/proposals-for-polymath-projects">this MO question</a>.</p>
<h2>The proposed projects in Gowers’s 2009 post and updates regarding these projects.</h2>
<p><strong>1. Littlewood’s conjecture and related problems.</strong></p>
<p>The conjecture states that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\alpha" class="latex" title="\alpha" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\beta" class="latex" title="\beta" /> are any two real numbers, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" style="padding: 0; border: none; vertical-align: middle; color: #333333; font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.6px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0; white-space: normal;" class="latex" alt="\epsilon&gt;0" title="\epsilon&gt;0" />, then there exists a positive integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%7C%5Calpha+n%7C%7C%5C%2C%7C%7C%5Cbeta+n%7C%7C%5Cleq%5Cepsilon%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="||\alpha n||\,||\beta n||\leq\epsilon/n" class="latex" title="||\alpha n||\,||\beta n||\leq\epsilon/n" />. Famously, Einsiedler, Katok and Lindenstrauss proved that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of counterexamples to the conjecture is zero. Gowers had ideas for an elementary approach, and his ideas  <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/11/17/problems-related-to-littlewoods-conjecture-2/">are described in this later post.</a> This project was not launched and I am also not aware of progress related to the problem (but I am not an expert). </p>
<p><strong>2. A DHJ-related project.</strong></p>
<p>DHJ stands for “density Hales Jewett” which was the topic of polymath1. The second proposed project was to build on the success of polymath1 and at<a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/11/14/the-first-unknown-case-of-polynomial-dhj/"> a later post</a> the following problem was proposed.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:  </strong><em>For every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" style="padding: 0; border: none; vertical-align: middle;" class="latex" alt="\delta&gt;0" title="\delta&gt;0" /> and every positive integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> there exists <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> such that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> is any subset of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bk%5D%5E%7B%5Bn%5D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[k]^{[n]^2}" class="latex" title="[k]^{[n]^2}" /> of density at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\delta" class="latex" title="\delta" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> contains a <a href="http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Combinatorial_line">combinatorial line</a> such that the wildcard set is of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Ctimes+X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X\times X" class="latex" title="X\times X" /> for some subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csubset%5Bn%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X\subset[n]" class="latex" title="X\subset[n]" />.</em></p>
<p>As far as I know, this conjecture is still open.</p>
<p>Both questions “what kind of forbidden patters in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bk%5D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[k]^n" class="latex" title="[k]^n" /> force exponentially small density” and “what kind of forbidden patters in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bk%5D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[k]^n" class="latex" title="[k]^n" /> force vanishing density” are fascinating. Let me recommend again the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/05/18/the-cap-set-problem-and-frankl-rodl-theorem-c/">Frankl-Rodl theorem</a> and its proof as a role model.</p>
<p><strong>3. Four Erdős-style combinatorial problems.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3a. Erdős’s discrepancy problem</strong></p>
<p>This was the problem that was eventually chosen for <strong>polymath5</strong>. This was a very nice story. The problem was presented<a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/erdoss-discrepancy-problem/"> in this blog post</a> and selected as polymath5 after some polls among readers. The <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/polymath5/">polymath project</a> was the longest in polymath history. There were six preliminary discussion posts with more than 600 comments followed by 21 official posts EDP1-EDP21. There was some short revival of the project (EDP22-EDP27) in 2012 where I contributed three posts. Famously, in 2015 Terry Tao solved the problem. The paper <a href="https://discreteanalysisjournal.com/article/609">appeared in the journal Discrete Analysis</a>. Tao’s solution relies on some insights from the polymath project including a crucial reduction that Terry himself contributed. It also crucially relied on a (then) new theory by Kaisa Matomaki and Maksym Radziwill. The solution was triggered  by a blog comment by Uwe Stroinski who pointed to a possible connection to EDP, and a subsequent one by Kodlu who seconded Uwe’s suggestion. This is reported in <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2015/09/20/edp28-problem-solved-by-terence-tao/">EDP28</a>, and here on my blog we celebrated the solution in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/edp-reflections-and-celebrations/">this post</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>3b. The Erdős-Hajnal conjecture.</strong></p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> be a positive integer and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> be a graph. Erdös and Hajnal conjectured that there is a constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3DC%28H%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C=C(H)" class="latex" title="C=C(H)" /> such that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> is any graph with at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5EC&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k^C" class="latex" title="k^C" /> vertices that does not contain any induced copy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />, then either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%5Ec&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G^c" class="latex" title="G^c" /> contain a clique of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />.</p>
<p>Tim asserted that the simplest open case is where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> is a pentagon. This special case was recently settled by Maria Chudnovsky<span class="d2edcug0 hpfvmrgz qv66sw1b c1et5uql rrkovp55 a8c37x1j keod5gw0 nxhoafnm aigsh9s9 d3f4x2em fe6kdd0r mau55g9w c8b282yb iv3no6db jq4qci2q a3bd9o3v knj5qynh oo9gr5id hzawbc8m" dir="auto">, </span>Alex Scott<span class="d2edcug0 hpfvmrgz qv66sw1b c1et5uql rrkovp55 a8c37x1j keod5gw0 nxhoafnm aigsh9s9 d3f4x2em fe6kdd0r mau55g9w c8b282yb iv3no6db jq4qci2q a3bd9o3v knj5qynh oo9gr5id hzawbc8m" dir="auto">, Paul Seymour and Sophie Spirkl. They rely on recent results by </span>Janos Pach and Istvan Tomon. See <a href="https://youtu.be/nz-fnYvsuN8">this videotaped lecture</a> by Paul Seymour at IBS Discrete Mathematics Group, South Korea.</p>
<p><strong>3c. Frankl’s union-closed conjecture.</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-20946"></span>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{A}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{A}" /> be a collection of sets that is closed under taking unions. Must there be an element that is contained in at least half the sets?</p>
<p>Tim wrote:<em> This is a notorious question, and possibly the least likely to yield to a Polymath approach (it feels as though there might be a burst of ideas, none of which would work, followed by disillusionment, or else, if we were very lucky, a single bright idea from one person that essentially solved the problem, but I could be wrong).</em></p>
<p><a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/polymath11/"><strong>Polymath11</strong></a> on Tim Gowers’s blog (Launched January, 2016) was devoted to Frankl’s conjecture. The problem is still open.</p>
<p><strong>3d. The delta-systems problem.</strong></p>
<p>This question is due to Erdős and Rado. A <em>delta system</em> is a collection of sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C%5Cdots%2CA_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_1,\dots,A_m" class="latex" title="A_1,\dots,A_m" /> such that all the sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_i%5Ccap+A_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_i\cap A_j" class="latex" title="A_i\cap A_j" /> (with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i%5Cne+j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i\ne j" class="latex" title="i\ne j" />) are equal. Equivalently, there exists some set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csubset+A_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X\subset A_i" class="latex" title="X\subset A_i" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />, and the sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_i%5Csetminus+X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_i\setminus X" class="latex" title="A_i\setminus X" /> are disjoint.</p>
<p>Erdös offered 1000 dollars for a solution to the following problem: does there exist a constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" /> such that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> and every system of at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C^k" class="latex" title="C^k" /> sets of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />, there must exist three of them that form a delta system?</p>
<p>I devoted <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/category/polymath10/"><strong>polymath10</strong></a> to this problem. I tried to promote certain  homological approach. This has not led to progress but did lead to some interesting observations on the problem and also some refinement and better understanding of my approach.</p>
<p>While still open since 2009, there were major breakthroughs regarding the problem that we described <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/">here</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/17/polymath-10-emergency-post-5-the-erdos-szemeredi-sunflower-conjecture-is-now-proven/">here,</a> most notably the problem was <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/amazing-ryan-alweiss-shachar-lovett-kewen-wu-jiapeng-zhang-made-dramatic-progress-on-the-sunflower-conjecture/"><strong>nearly solved</strong> by Ryan Alweiss, Shachar Lovett, Kewen Wu,  and Jiapeng Zhang</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. Non-mathematical projects.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4a. Developing a new type of chess-playing program.</strong></p>
<p>The precise formulation was: “how good a chess-playing program is possible if the amount of memory space allowed is very restricted, and the amount of calculation is also limited?” In <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/possible-future-polymath-projects/#comment-4000">a comment</a>, Tim explained that one would like to find a method of programming that applied to all games of a certain type (things like Othello, Go, etc.) and not just chess. And this could be taken as the aim. </p>
<p><a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/possible-future-polymath-projects/#comment-4006">One comment</a> mentioned the then very recent computer programs for playing Go (based on machine learning). Let me mention that deep learning led to a revolution in this area around 2015.  (And also that we had <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/06/25/amir-ban-on-deep-junior/">a guest post by Amir Ban</a> on chess playing computer programs.)</p>
<p><strong>4b. The origin of life.</strong></p>
<p>This rather tentative suggestion, was to try to come up with a model that would show convincingly how life could emerge from non-life by purely naturalistic processes. <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/11/07/polymath-and-the-origin-of-life/">It was further discussed in this post.</a> There was a lot of excitement around it but it did not lead to a polymath project, and I am not sure about related progress after 2009.</p>
<p>As an aside let me mention that Aubrey de Gray, who famously improved the lower bound on the chromatic number of the plane (that led to <a href="https://dustingmixon.wordpress.com/2018/04/14/polymath16-first-thread-simplifying-de-greys-graph/">polymath16</a>), is very famous for his works and ideas on aging. I suggested to Aubrey, that he should have a “polymath style” project on the issue of aging and his approach to the problem. However Aubrey’s response was that  various attempts to do things like that have failed over the years, across many biological fields. </p>
<p><strong>5. A tentative approach to complexity lower bounds.</strong></p>
<p>This turned into a series of posts (<a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/09/22/a-conversation-about-complexity-lower-bounds/">first one here</a>, <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/complexity/">whole “complexity category” here</a>) where Tim tried to develop several ideas related to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=NP+%5Cne+P&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="NP \ne P" class="latex" title="NP \ne P" /> problem.</p>
<p>________</p>
<p>OK, let me now briefly and tentatively preview some suggestions for my future polymath project. </p>
<h2>Possible future Polymath projects (2021)  </h2>
<p>1. <strong><a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/open-problem-session-of-huji-combsem-problem-5-gil-kalai-the-3%e1%b5%88-problem/">The  3ᵈ conjecture</a> and the flag conjecture for centrally symmetric polytopes</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>2. Mathematical questions regarding social welfare functions. </strong> Here is a  <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/social-choice-preview/">related 2009 post</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10352">a survey by Elchanan Mossel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Developing a theory polymath-style</strong></p>



<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can a polymath project be used to develop a theory rather than solving a problem? </span>This question was raised by <strong>Peter Sarnak</strong> in a <a href="https://polymathprojects.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/polymathias.jpg">2010 IAS debate about polymath projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3.a A theory of convex hulls of real algebraic varieties</strong>.  One project in this spirit that <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/2014/01/20/two-polymath-of-a-sort-proposed-projects/">I already proposed</a> is to try to develop polymathly a theory of convex hulls of real algebraic varieties.</p>
<p><strong>3.b  Extending algebraic shifting to a wide variety of combinatorial structures.</strong> This is a project with Hélène Barcelo from the mid 90s that at the time did not get off the ground and it could be very nice to explore it collectively.</p>
<p>What  other theories would you like to see developed openly and collectively?<span style="color: #ff0000;">*</span></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Touching non overlapping simplices – <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/08/27/touching-simplices-and-polytopes-perles-argument/">the 2ᵈ-conjecture</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong>  <strong>Erdős-style combinatorial problems.</strong> Two possibilities are</p>
<p><strong>5.a</strong> <strong>Simonyi’s conjecture;</strong> and  <strong>5.b</strong> <strong>Chvatal’s conjecture</strong>.</p>
<p>Both can be found at the end of <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/09/28/extremal-combinatorics-iii-some-basic-theorems/">this post</a>.

<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Enumeration – weights to the rescue  </strong>(sorry for being vague)</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Mathematics with computers </strong>(this is even more vague for now; but see this <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/12085/experimental-mathematics-leading-to-major-advances">MO question; </a>  Here I am thinking about an experimental project. Most of the other projects may have large ingredients of computer experimentation.)</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Meta questions</span></h3>
<p>There are many meta questions regarding polymath projects: </p>
<ol>
<li>One important one is: What is the ideal platform for a polymath project?</li>
<li>Could a polymath project be moderated by a computer?</li>
<li> What are the potential of polymath projects? The limitations? Are polymath projects a good way to do mathematics.</li>
<li>What are the incentives to participate?</li>
<li>Are polymath projects inviting in terms of diversity of participants?  </li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">*</span> I wonder if a question “What mathematical theory would you like to see developed” on Math Overflow could stay alive and whether it may lead to nice responses. (There was a nice question about <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/53036/books-you-would-like-to-read-if-somebody-would-just-write-them">what book would you like to see written.</a>) </p>

<p>Joe Biden's <a href="https://joebiden.com/immigration/">immigration policy</a> has some interesting policies for PhDs. </p><p></p><blockquote>Biden will exempt from any cap recent graduates of PhD programs in STEM fields in the U.S. who are poised to make some of the most important contributions to the world economy. Biden believes that foreign graduates of a U.S. doctoral program should be given a green card with their degree and that losing these highly trained workers to foreign economies is a disservice to our own economic competitiveness. </blockquote><p>Biden will submit an immigration plan to congress soon but it is not clear if the above will be in the bill, whether it will survive negotiations or even whether an immigration bill will be passed at all. </p><p>Nevertheless I worry about the unintended consequences of this policy. It will encourage students to apply and come for a PhD who have no interest in research, but want the green card. It gives too much power to professors who may abuse their students who need the PhD. Conversely it will pressure professors and thesis committees to grant PhDs because there would be a big difference between graduating with a PhD and leaving early with a Masters. By making the PhD so valuable, we may devalue it.</p><p>The solution is to give green cards to Masters students as well. We shouldn't limit talented researchers and developers who can help the United States keep its technology edge. They don't take jobs away from Americans, but instead help create new ones.</p><p></p></div>

<p>At age 39, I already feel more often than not like a washed-up has-been in complexity theory and quantum computing research.  It’s not intelligence that I feel like I’ve lost, so much as two other necessary ingredients: <em>burning motivation</em> and <em>time</em>.  But all is not lost: I still have students and postdocs to guide and inspire!  I still have the people who email me every day—journalists, high-school kids, colleagues—asking this and that!  Finally, I still have this blog, with which to talk about all the exciting research that <em>others</em> are doing!</p>



<p>Speaking of blogging about research: I know I ought to do more of it, so let me start right now.</p>



<ul><li>Last night, Renou et al. posted a striking paper on the arXiv entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10873.pdf">Quantum physics needs complex numbers</a>.  One’s immediate reaction to the title might be “well duh … who ever thought it didn’t?”  (See <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4021">this post of mine</a> for a survey of explanations for why quantum mechanics “should have” involved complex numbers.)  Renou et al., however, are interested in ruling out a subtler possibility: namely, that our universe is secretly based on a version of quantum mechanics with real amplitudes only, and that it uses extra Hilbert space dimensions that we don’t see in order to <em>simulate</em> complex quantum mechanics.  Strictly speaking, such a possibility can <em>never</em> be ruled out, any more than one can rule out the possibility that the universe is a classical computer that simulates quantum mechanics.  In the latter case, though, the whole point of Bell’s Theorem is to show that <em>if</em> the universe is secretly classical, then it also needs to be radically nonlocal (relying on faster-than-light communication to coordinate measurement outcomes).  Renou et al. claim to show something analogous about real quantum mechanics: there’s an experiment—as it happens, one involving three players and two entangled pairs—for which conventional QM predicts an outcome that can’t be explained using any variant of QM that’s both local and secretly based on real amplitudes.  Their experiment seems eminently doable, and I imagine it will be done in short order.</li></ul>



<ul><li>A bunch of people from PsiQuantum posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09310.pdf">paper on the arXiv</a> introducing “fusion-based quantum computation” (FBQC), a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_quantum_computer">measurement-based quantum computation</a> (MBQC) and apparently a new approach to fault-tolerance, which the authors say can handle a ~10% rate of lost photons.  PsiQuantum is the large, Palo-Alto-based startup trying to build scalable quantum computers based on photonics.  They’ve been notoriously secretive, to the point of not having a website.  I’m delighted that they’re sharing details of the sort of thing they hope to build; I hope and expect that the FBQC proposal will be evaluated by people more qualified than me.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Since this is already on social media: apparently, Marc Lackenby from Oxford will be <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/research/seminars/?talk_id=6082">giving a Zoom talk at UC Davis next week</a>, about a quasipolynomial-time algorithm to decide whether a given knot is the unknot.  A preprint doesn’t seem to be available yet, but this is a big deal if correct, on par with Babai’s quasipolynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism from four years ago (see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2521">this post</a>).  I can’t wait to see details!  (Not that I’ll understand them well.)</li></ul>

<p>My latest preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09918">arXiv:2101.09918</a> with Sid Gupta and Elham Havvaei, has a mouthful of a title: “Parameterized complexity of finding subgraphs with hereditary properties on hereditary graph classes”. It’s about finding large induced subgraphs with a given property within a larger graph, such as in an earlier paper I wrote on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2014/08/26/planarization-by-vertex.html">finding large planar induced subgraphs</a>.</p>

<p>Since we’re looking for induced subgraphs, it makes sense to restrict attention to properties that behave nicely under induced subgraphs; these are called hereditary properties. And if there’s no restriction on what kind of graph the larger graph can be, then the parameterized complexity of this induced subgraph problem (parameterized by the number of vertices in the subgraph) is completely settled by a paper by Khot and Raman, “Parameterized complexity of finding subgraphs with hereditary properties” (<em>Theor. Comput. Sci.</em> 2002). The result depends only on whether the subgraphs you’re looking for include arbitrary large cliques or arbitrarily large independent sets. If both, then the answer to “is there a \(k\)-vertex induced subgraph with the property” is (for all sufficiently large inputs) yes, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey's_theorem">Ramsey’s theorem</a>, so the algorithmic problem is easy. If neither, then again Ramsey’s theorem says that (for all sufficiently large \(k\)) the answer is no, so again the problem is easy. And in all remaining cases, when the property includes large cliques but not large independent sets or vice versa, Khot and Raman show that the problem is hard for parameterized computation.</p>

<p>But what if the input is not allowed to be an arbitrary graph, but is restricted to another hereditary class of graphs? An example we consider is the problem of finding large planar induced subgraphs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disk_graph">unit disk graphs</a>. Planar graphs fall into the hard side of Khot and Raman’s dichotomy, but their hardness proof uses graphs that might not be unit disk graphs. Our results involve more case analysis based on cliques and independent sets, but for the input graph class as well as for the target subgraph class, so there are many more cases to consider. Again, Ramsey theory clears away many of them, either by saying that all sufficiently large inputs contain big subgraphs in the target class, or by limiting the number of subgraphs we need to consider to a finite set.</p>

<p>The case analysis from our paper focuses attention on one remaining case, where Ramsey-like arguments do not prevail. This is the case where the target subgraph class is one of the types that is hard for Khot and Raman’s dichotomy (such as finding induced planar subgraphs), and where the input subgraph class can contain both large cliques and large independent sets (as is true for the unit disk graphs). It would be nice to say that in this case everything is hard, providing a nice clean dichotomy, but some problems like this are not hard. For instance, when the input is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_graph">cluster graph</a>, a disjoint union of cliques, the largest induced planar subgraph is obtained by taking at most four vertices from each clique, and many other induced subgraph problems on cluster graphs are equally easy. We were at least able to find a couple of general hardness reductions that apply in many cases, including in the planar-in-unit-disk case. But the question of whether all problems in this case are either easy (fixed-parameter tractable) or hard, and if so whether there is an easy way of determining which side of the dichotomy any particular subgraph-searching problem falls into, remains open.</p>

<p>Is there anything in this world which works well, which is not a series of time-consuming, useless steps inherited from the before-Internet era, of endless waits to speak to someone who behaves like a robot in none of the good ways and all the bad?</p>



<p>I hear <em>linear algebra</em>.</p>



<p>Yes, I think that’s as good as it gets.</p>



<p>If I had one penny for every time I said “V like Victor” over the phone… A game-changing innovation of the unfolding millennium will be a button which, upon pressure, instantly releases all your information to wh(o/at)ever needs to know it. Instead, they now do us the favor of “safeguarding our privacy” by forcing us to enter and re-enter and re-re-renter our information; us who don’t have someone who does it in our stead.</p>



<p>In yet another example of adding insult to injury, much of this is cloaked under “Consumer protection.”  While in fact its effect is precisely the opposite: it is to cut the consumer off the market.  For example, there’s a rule that you must wait three days to close on a loan.  This is supposed to help you sleep over it and think if you really want to go for it and if you can afford it.  How nice of them to help us avoid rushed decisions!  Obviously, sellers don’t want to deal with people subject to such delays.  If one really wanted to help, the rule should be that <em>everybody</em> has to wait three days to complete a transaction, regardless if it’s cash or financed, so that those for whom the transaction is more significant than drinking a tea can indeed sleep over it.</p>



<p>More absurdities.  Person A currently has loan with interest rate X.  Now interests have been set to Y &lt; X.  However, A cannot refinance their loan because A does not have enough cash reserves (or some other suspicious condition).  So A will be forbidden from refinancing and will be forced to keep their loan at old, unfavorable interest rate X &gt; Y.</p>



<p>Question: Under which interest rate is A more likely to default?</p>



<p>The only possible deduction is that the lender wants A to default.  You can’t say that by refinancing the lender will take a greater risk.  They are just using this loophole to make more money.  Wasn’t this supposed to help citizens?  This situation has another name as well.</p>



<p>Special torture awaits serial debtors.  Another loan in effect can delay processing by… <em>months</em>.  In the meanwhile, the documents for the new loan will expire, and re-expire, and re-re-expire yet again, while the hapless debtor will be forced to continuously work to keep them up to date — similar to what happens to Sisyphus or the Danaides, but the classics weren’t perverse enough to conceive the endless task of collecting documents from disconnected websites, each with its own distinctive and rapidly-mutating user interface, each requiring a new password or dual-factor authentication at each download, each in turn disappearing and being replaced by yet another system hosted by yet another party which will require yet another type of authentication, and so on forever — do you want this money or not?</p>



<p>There is a (probably well-known) quote which I read in <em>The Instinct for Cooperation : A Graphic Novel Conversation with Noam Chomsky</em> (not a terrible read — I fittingly found it in a free exchange library and returned it to another) which stuck with me.  I don’t recall it exactly (see, I shouldn’t have returned it), and I can’t find it online precisely, but it basically says that “<strong>The role of the government is to protect property from those who don’t have it.</strong>” (An online search seems to reveal that something along these lines was expressed by James Madison.)  Regardless of whether it was said or not, and regardless of whether you agree with it or not, it is quite useful to keep this quote in mind, because it explains much of the world we live in.</p></div>

<p><br /></p><p>I posted a presidential quiz (that is, a quiz about presidents, not a quiz that is so majestic it can be called presidential) on Thursday Jan 21.</p><p>Here is the link to the post: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/01/presidential-quiz-three-ways-to-take-it.html">The Post </a></p><p>Here is the link to the quiz:<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/prezquiz.pdf">The Prez Quiz</a></p><p> I now post the answers here: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/prezquizsol.pdf">The Prez Quiz Answers</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Looking back at the quiz and some prior ones I realize that some questions are TRIVIA while others are not- that is- they tell us something interesting beyond the answer. Some thoughts on that: </p><p><br /></p><p>a) Asking who the oldest prez ever has to be better defined. But however you define it, the answer is Joltin Joe. I will ask it as Age-when-sworn-in, which for Joltin Joe is 78. Second is Trump who was 70 when sworn in.  INFO: Presidents seem to be getting older. Is this a trend or will 2024 and 2028 feature younger folks? I note that both VP's are in their 50's. </p><p>b) Presidential first via xkcd; <a href="https://xkcd.com/2383/">here</a></p><p>c) Between Nixon-Kennedy 1960 and Bush-Kerry 2004 EVERY election had one of he candidates being either a former or current Prez or Vice Prez.  (This was a question on the 2008 quiz, but since the streak is broken it is no longer as interesting.) INFO: It was hard to break into the prez business unless you were already somewhat known. Having said that, note that some of the non-VPs and non-Prezs DID win. </p><p>d) Between 1948 and 2008 at least one of the candidates for Prez had served in the Military. How did they do? In many cases both served so I am not going to to a chart of how well the Military ones did. (This was a question on the 2012 quiz, but since the streak is broken it is no longer interesting.) INFO: At one time a lot of people were in the military. At one time a lot of people knew someone in the military. Now it seems like the military is rather far removed from civilians. </p><p>e) Kennedy was our first Catholic Prez in 1960. Biden is our second one in 2020. My impression is that it was an issue for the Kennedy Campaign but not for the Biden campaign. Romney being a Mormon seems to have not been an issue in the General election, but some of the other candidates brought it up in the primaries. INFO: Religious bigotry within different denominations of Christianity is declining. </p><p>f) Reagan was our first divorced Prez, in 1980. Trump was our second in 2016. It don't think it was  an issue for either one. INFO: We need to couple this with Rockefellers divorce being a problem for him getting the nomination in 1964. Peoples attitude on divorce has changed A LOT. </p><p><br /></p><p>Contrast: Knowing which president had a fictional street gang named after him  does not tell us anything about History .I will remove that question when I do the quiz in 2025. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>A bookshelf or other structure made only of vertical and horizontal beams will easily fall over unless its joints are very strong, because axis-parallel structures are not inherently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_rigidity">rigid</a>. The vertical beams can tilt away from being perpendicular to the horizontals, without changing the relative spacing of the joints, and that can lead to books all over the floor. Here’s an example <a href="https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/photos/earthquake-damage-botany-library">from a 2011 earthquake at the Smithsonian</a> that didn’t get quite that far, but did damage some shelves beyond repair:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="65%" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" alt="Damaged bookshelves in the Botany and Horticulture Library at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History after the August 2011 Virginia earthquake, photographed by James DiLoreto, from https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/photos/earthquake-damage-botany-library" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/nhb2011-01160-botany_library.jpg" /></p>

<p>Triangular bookshelves would be annoying for different reasons, but they wouldn’t collapse like this, because triangular structures are more rigid: there is only one triangle that three sides of fixed lengths can form, unlike squares and rectangles which can flex into rhombi and parallelograms without changing their side lengths. So the standard solution to the bookshelf rigidity problem is to add <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_bracing">cross bracing</a>, diagonal beams built into shelves or other rectangular structures that make them similarly rigid. But which parts to brace? Even if every vertical and horizontal segment of a square bookshelf is allowed to flex independently of the other ones on its same line, bracing all the squares of the bookshelf would be too many. The vertical segments in each row of squares must stay parallel (in any flex small enough to avoid self-crossings), and similarly the horizontal segments in each column of squares must stay parallel. So a square grid with \(r\) rows and \(c\) columns has only \(r+c-1\) degrees of freedom in its shape (the relative angles among the verticals of each of the \(r\) rows and the horizontals of each of the \(c\) columns), far fewer than the \(rc\) braces that would be obtained by bracing all the squares.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/grid-flex.svg" alt="Degrees of freedom of a flexible square grid" /></p>

<p>A beautiful theory showing how to minimally brace any square (or rectangular) grid, connecting this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_bracing">grid bracing problem</a> to the connectivity of bipartite graphs, was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Ethan Bolker, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Crapo_(mathematician)">Henry Crapo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Baglivo">Jenny Baglivo</a>, and Jack Graver.<sup id="fnref:bc"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/bracing-squaregraphs.html#fn:bc" class="footnote">1</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:bg"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/bracing-squaregraphs.html#fn:bg" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Their idea was to represent the grid and its bracing more abstractly, as a graph, whose vertices represent the rows and columns of grid squares. A braced square can be represented as an edge in this graph:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/grid-bracing.svg" alt="Representing a braced square grid as a graph" /></p>

<p>An edge in this graph, or more generally any chain of edges, fixes the relative angles between the vertical edges in the rows that it connects, and the horizontal edges of the columns. So if the whole graph is connected, as it is in the figure, all of these angles are fixed, and the grid is made rigid. In particular, any spanning tree of the complete bipartite graph on the rows and columns (such as the spanning tree shown in the figure) provides a bracing pattern that will suffice to make the grid rigid. It is also necessary for rigidity that the bracing pattern contain a spanning tree: any set of braces including a cycle is redundant, with one of the braces removable without changing the possible motions of the braced grid, and any forest that is not a tree has too few braces to eliminate all of the degrees of freedom. So a grid is braced rigidly if and only if its graph is connected, and the minimal rigid bracings are exactly the spanning trees.</p>

<p>The same theory can be (and has been) generalized in multiple ways. A grid is “double braced” if every brace is redundant: you can remove any one brace and the whole structure will stay rigid. This is true if and only if the corresponding graph has the property that you can remove any one edge and the whole graph will remain connected, which is true exactly for the connected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(graph_theory)">bridgeless graphs</a>. A version with directed graphs applies to bracing by strings or wires, strong under tension but useless under compression. These constrain the sides of the squares from turning only in one direction: if one side turns clockwise, the other side is forced to turn clockwise, or vice versa, but not both ways. So we can represent a tension brace in a square by a directed edge. The edge is directed from the square’s row to its column when a clockwise turn of the vertical sides in the row would force a clockwise turn of the horizontal sides in the column, and in the other direction otherwise. Then, the whole structure is rigid under this sort of tension bracing if and only if the resulting directed graph is strongly connected.</p>

<p>For this theory to work, it is necessary that the braced structure consist of quadrilaterals with parallel sides, but they don’t have to be squares: the same thing works for grids of rectangles, rhombi, or parallelograms. It would work for the deformed square grid in the right of the second figure, for instance. It’s also not necessary for the quadrilaterals to be connected in the pattern of a square grid. In 2006, Ture Wester observed that the same method should work for the rhombic version of the Penrose tiling, for instance, but was very vague about boundary conditions (not distinguishing carefully between infinite tilings and finite patches of them).<sup id="fnref:w"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/bracing-squaregraphs.html#fn:w" class="footnote">3</a></sup> The correct boundary conditions are that this works for any tiling of a disk in the plane by finitely many parallel-sided quadrilaterals. For such tilings, one can group the quadrilaterals into zones, sequences of quadrilaterals connected edge-to-edge on opposite sides, so that each quadrilateral belongs to two zones (giving it a zone by itself if two opposite sides are both on the boundary of the disk). Without bracing, the shared parallel sides in each zone can turn independently of any other motion of the tiling; this is the part that requires that the tiled area be a disk rather than an annulus or more complicated shape, so that the two parts of the graph separated by each zone are disconnected from each other and can move independently. And the overall shape of the tiling is completely determined by the angles of the shared sides of all of its zones. Therefore, the number of degrees of freedom (factoring out motions in which the tiling translates without rotation, or rotates rigidly) is exactly one less than the number of zones. Any set of braced quadrilaterals can be represented as a subgraph of the intersection graph of the zones, and after the calculation of degrees of freedom, the same argument as for grids shows that the tiling is rigid if this subgraph connects all the zones, that it is double braced if this subgraph is connected and bridgeless, or that it is tension braced if the directed version of this subgraph is strongly connected.</p>

<p>So as Wester stated, this does work for rhombic Penrose tilings, as long as one considers disk-shaped patches of the tilings. Similar, it works for (simply-connected) polyominoes, or disk-shaped patches of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhombille_tiling">rhombille tiling</a>. It also works for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaregraph">squaregraphs</a>, planar graphs in which all interior vertices have degree at least four and all interior faces are quadrilaterals, as long as those quadrilaterals are drawn with parallel sides. One of my old papers shows that these drawings always exist,<sup id="fnref:e"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/bracing-squaregraphs.html#fn:e" class="footnote">4</a></sup> and another shows how to optimize them to avoid sharp angles.<sup id="fnref:ew"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/bracing-squaregraphs.html#fn:ew" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. In all of these cases, the tiling can be made rigid by bracing tiles forming a spanning tree of its zones, doubly rigid by bracing tiles forming a bridgeless spanning subgraph, or rigid for tension bracing by adding braces that form a strongly connected graph.</p>

<p>However, some algorithmic aspects of this theory may depend more strongly on the fact that for square grids, the intersection graphs of their zones have a very simple structure. Square grids have complete bipartite zone intersection graphs, but more general tilings of disks by parallel-sided quadrilaterals have arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graphs</a> and squaregraphs have triangle-free circle graphs. Extending a partial bracing to a minimal rigid bracing is just a matter of extending a forest to a spanning tree, easy in all graphs, but the corresponding problem for tension bracing is more complicated. Gabow and Jordán solve it for square grids (equivalently, adding as few edges as possible to a bipartite directed graph to make it strongly connected, while respecting its given bipartition) in linear time.<sup id="fnref:gj"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/22/bracing-squaregraphs.html#fn:gj" class="footnote">6</a></sup> But it is not at all obvious that it’s as easy to extend a directed subgraph of a circle graph to a minimal strongly connected subgraph of the same circle graph.</p>

As a student in Berkeley I attended that meeting and the next twenty-five. The conference would join the IEEE in 1987, in 1996 renamed the IEEE Conference and Computational Complexity and in 2015 drop from the IEEE to become the Computational Complexity Conference, still going strong.

<p> Every four years around the time of the inaugural I post a presidential Quiz! I do that today, and I will post the answers on Monday.  I am tempted to joke that I am posting it AFTER Joltin Joe gets sworn in just in case something happens; however, I always posted it after the prez is sworn in. </p><p>The quiz is here: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/prezquiz.pdf">quiz</a></p><p><b> GRADING CRITERIA</b></p><p>33 questions, 3 points each, and 1 free point.</p><p>If the answer is a list of L elts and you get x correct, you get x/L points. If any are wrong then 0 points.</p><p>You can take the quiz one of three ways.</p><p>1) Take it WITHOUT using the web and see how many you can get right. Take 3 hours.</p><p>WARNING- its a hard quiz so this may not be fun. </p><p>2) Take it and use the web and try to do it fast. Stop when you want. Your Score is as follows:</p><p>If  R is the number if points and  T be how many minutes you took,  your score is </p><p> (180R/T)+ 1.</p><p>If  you get all 33 right in 60 minutes then you get a 100. You could get more than 100 if you do it faster.</p><p>3) The answer key has all kinds of other information in it and is fun to read. So do not take the quiz and enjoy  reading the answers on Monday. That's what I did. </p><p><br /></p><p>I was curious if Joltin Joe would be sworn in by Joseph or Joe. I was routing for Joe so he would be the second president sworn in by his nickname (Jimmy Carter was the first--his real name is James). When I am sworn in as president I will use <i>Bill</i> and hence join the nickname-club. Lance does not have a nickname, so my veep will be sworn in by his actual name. Would we win? Is  America ready for a 2-Phd ticket? </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

Eric Lander has been <a href="https://buildbackbetter.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/OSTP-Appointment.pdf">appointed</a> director of the US Office of Science and Technology Policy, a post newly elevated to Cabinet status. He is thus the top science <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/01/biden-appoints-geneticist-eric-lander-science-advisor">advisor</a> in Joe Biden’s cabinet.</p>
<p>
Today we congratulate Eric, whom we both have known personally, and survey some sources of science advice at his career’s roots.</p>
<p>
Peter Cameron, who was Eric’s doctoral advisor at Oxford University, says in his <a href="https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com">blog</a> that: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I have had so many congratulatory emails that it almost seems as if I have done something good myself <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I found out about Eric’s appointment while working on this post. Eric is a longtime friend, who while not close is someone that I have always been impressed with. He is a mathematician who turned molecular biologist—we interacted when I worked on <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/268/5210/542">DNA computing</a>. Eric previously worked closely with Biden during the Barack Obama presidency. </p>

Ken found out first from reading his Princeton Class of 1981 news on Facebook. He says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Eric was my Resident Advisor in Foulke Hall my freshman year, 1977–78. I originally had the ground-floor double room next to his, but I swapped roommates one door further down with another lover of mathematics and Broadway musicals. His RA group of 16 in the staircase included now-Justice Elena Kagan. Eric brought all of us down for meetings in the early weeks; blessing the roommate swap and discussing compatibility aspects in general was a subject of one of them. I got to Oxford just as Eric was leaving, and my first interaction with Peter Neumann was actually Neumann saying Eric had neglected to do something and could I get him in touch before he returned to the US? Kagan also came to Oxford along with three other ’81-ers whom I associated with more. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Wellspring of Advice </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Eric did a swap himself his first weeks in Oxford. As Cameron relates in a followup <a href="https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2021/01/19/family/">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> He arrived in Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship to do research in algebraic topology. But before the term started, he had changed his mind and decided to do coding theory instead. By chance, it happened that I was the only person in Oxford at the time who claimed to know anything about coding theory. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> So I got to supervise Eric. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Peter had a good problem ready about how to combine two strands of applying design theory to codes.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Eric, with a good background in algebraic number theory, took to it immediately. The coding theorists had taken an integer matrix and considered its row space over the finite field with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> elements. Eric observed that, if instead you took the row space over the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />-adic numbers, then you could reduce it modulo arbitrary powers of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />, and get a chain of codes, with the property that duality reversed the order in the chain (so if the power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> involved was odd then the code in the middle was self-dual).</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Eric’s thesis took off from there, and at the end he turned it into a book with the title <em>Symmetric Designs: An Algebraic Approach</em>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course, coding theory and “stringology” feed into genomics, and from there into the broad reach of science. Eric has no shortage of sources across the spectrum. But the wellspring of his career was our general area, not to mention that both of us followed him in several geographic and academic <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2003-04/dna-computing/history.htm">respects</a>. </p>
<p>
Many of our peer bloggers step out to give general advice on science. Some conspicuously often take their advice and recommendations on natural sciences openly national. Others address it within smaller communities, but their ideas can be equally valuable. All may be worthy of consultation.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Blogs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The one rule we’re setting out now is that in order to be advising the advisor, the blogs must stay current. There are tons of terrific blogs that have stopped publishing altogether, or whose last <em>new</em> post is many moons ago. As for those who try to be reasonably current, Ken and I know how hard it is to do. So we took a three-week horizon—that is, who has posted something this year, 2021. That said, here are some of our favorite blogs on math and CS theory—after the first they are alphabetical by writer(s).</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/model-theory/">What’s New</a> Terence Tao <br />
The best math blog of all time. If you must read one, then this is the one. If you read two or more math blogs, then this is still the one. If you read two or more posts on this blog, then you qualify as a mathematician.</p>
<p>

Wonderful blog. A brilliant combination of results, comments, and opinions. We have “encoded” his name in the previous section—see if you can spot where and how.</p>
<p>

Focused on connections between optimization and learning. I conjecture that the key to solving some of our deep questions—P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{&lt;}" class="latex" title="{&lt;}" />NP—could be resolved by machine-learning technology. I recall a year ago while talking with learning experts at Chicago that they said: We think SAT should have an algorithm that runs in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bc%5Csqrt+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^{c\sqrt n}}" class="latex" title="{2^{c\sqrt n}}" /> time for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" title="{c}" />.</p>

Often goes into physics and policy, such as today’s third <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/us-environmental-policy-part-3/">post</a> in a series on environmental policy and climate change.

See his <a href="https://www.openbookpublishers.com/10.11647/OBP.0168.pdf">book</a> with Tony Gardiner, <em>The Essence of Mathematics</em>.

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Stavros Argyrios Papadakis, Vasiliki Petrotou, and Karim Adiprasito</span></p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/12/25/amazing-karim-adiprasito-proved-the-g-conjecture-for-spheres/">I reported here</a> about Karim Adiprasito’s proof of the g-conjecture for simplicial spheres.  This conjecture by McMullen from 1970 was considered a holy grail of algebraic combinatorics and it resisted attacks by many researchers over the years.</p>
<p>Today’s post  reports on two developments. The first from December 2020 is a second proof for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture for spheres by Stavros Argyrios Papadakis and Vasiliki Petrotou. (Here is a link to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09815">the arXive paper</a>.) A second proof to a major difficult theorem is always very very important and exciting.  The proof seems considerably simpler than Karim Adiprasito’s proof. The miracle that enables simplification was working with <em>characteristic two</em> in contrast to Adirasito’s proof which is characteristic free, and which therefore applies in greater generality.</p>
<p>However, the two teams joined forces, and in January 2021 posted a proof  (which seems even simpler) by Karim Adiprasito, Stavros Argyrios Papadakis and Vasiliki Petrotou of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture largely extended to pseudomanifolds. (Here is a link to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07245">the arXived paper</a>.)</p>
<p>I was too slow to report on these developments separately, so let me report here on both.  I am thankful to Karim Adiprasito for telling me about both results and some further conversations.</p>
<p>I hope that with these new proofs more people in the community will be able to absorb and understand the ideas, go carefully over the proofs, and apply the methods to a large number of outstanding problems beyond the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture. (A few of which are <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/20/beyond-the-g-conjecture-algebraic-combinatorics-of-cellular-spaces-i/">discussed in this post</a>.)</p>
<h2>December 2020: Stavros Argyrios Papadakis and Vasiliki Petrotou present a second proof of the g-conjecture.</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago Stavros Argyrios Papadakis and Vasiliki Petrotou uploaded a paper on the arXive <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09815">The characteristic 2 anisotropicity of simplicial spheres.</a>   The paper presents a second proof for McMullen’s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture for simplicial spheres.</p>

As an application, we give a second proof of a recent result of Adiprasito, known as McMullen’s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture for simplicial spheres. We also prove that the simplicial spheres of dimension 1 are generically anisotropic over any field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k_1" class="latex" title="k_1" />.</span></p>
<p>(GK) The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture is about relations between face numbers of simplicial spheres. The new proof, like Karim’s proof and most earlier attacks goes through an algebraic property, the <strong>Lefschetz  property</strong>. And here this property is proved for fields of coefficients of characteristic two. The proof relies on a formula whose discovery was assisted by computer experimentation using the Grayson-Stillman computer algebra program <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay2">Macaulay II</a>.</p>
<h2>January 2021: Karim Adiprasito, Stavros Argyrios Papadakis, and Vasiliki Petrotou present a new proof for the <em>g</em>-theorem extended to general pseudomanifolds, cycles, and doubly-Cohen Macualay complexes.</h2>
<p>A few days ago Karim, Stavros Argyrios, and Vasiliki uploaded a new joint paper with yet a further simplification of the argument and far-reaching extensions to pseudomanifolds, cycles, and doubly Cohen Macaulay complexes.</p>
<p>Karim Adiprasito, Stavros Argyrios Papadakis and Vasiliki Petrotou, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07245">Anisotropy, biased pairings, and the Lefschetz property for pseudomanifolds and cycles</a></p>
<p><strong><span class="has-text-black-bis has-text-weight-semibold">Abstract</span>:</strong> <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2101.07245v1-abstract-full">We prove the hard Lefschetz property for pseudomanifolds and cycles in any characteristic with respect to an appropriate Artinian reduction. The proof is a combination of Adiprasito’s biased pairing theory and a generalization of a formula of Papadakis-Petrotou to arbitrary characteristic. In particular, we prove the Lefschetz theorem for doubly Cohen Macaulay complexes, solving a generalization of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=g&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="g" class="latex" title="g" />-conjecture due to Stanley. We also provide a simplified presentation of the characteristic 2 case of the Papadakis-Petrotou formula, and generalize it to pseudomanifolds and cycles.</span></p>
<h2>A few more comments on both papers</h2>
<p>A crucial ingredient in these works is the need to understand the behaviour of Stanley-Reisner ring w.r.t. generic systems of parameters. Finding the right tools to use “genericity” is a crucial question. Adiprasito considered in his 2018 paper the <strong>Hall-Laman property</strong> which is related to the connection with framework rigidity and the notion of generic rigidity. This property is crucial (under somewhat smaller generality) in the newest APP paper.  It is also closely related to the generic anisotropicity property studied by Papadakis and Vasiliki Petrotou.</p>
<p>Exploring the use of genericity and the connections with rigidity in the study of face numbers go back to works from the 80s and 90s by Stanley, Kalai, Björner and Kalai, Billera, Whitely, Lee, Tay and Whitely, and others. The reference to Hall is based on  Hall’s famous marriage theorems (that has some roots also in Jacobi’s work) and its connections with generic determinants that were considered in the works of  Tutte, Edmonds, Lovàsz, Rabin and Vazirani, Karp, Upfal, and Wigderson, and others. The reference to Laman refers to Laman’s 1970 theorem that gives a characterization for planar generic rigidity (we discussed it briefly in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/12/06/four-derandomization-problems/">this post on derandomization</a>).</p>
<p>Another crucial idea both in Adiprasito’s 2018 proof and the Papadakis- Petrotou proof is the nondegeneracy (in a strong sense) of a Poincaré pairing. Both proofs use the property that the Poincaré pairing does not degenerate at ideals (something Karim calls the <b>biased pairing property</b>) as well infinitesimal deformations of the linear system of parameters. Karim told me that both proofs, however, face distinct difficulties: while his proof is geometrically difficult, and the Papadakis- Petrotou paper is restricted by the characteristic of the field. Through combining, they managed to circumvent both these difficulties!</p>
<p>While, the Lefschetz property  is extended to arbitrary characteristics and to very general classes of simplicial complexes, the generic anisotropicity property itself is still open beyond characteristic two. The new paper also offers a new understanding of the formula that was achieved originally by Stavros and Vasiliki with computer experimentation, and relates it to old results by Carl Lee.</p>
<p>I am quite happy that the new proof extends to the exciting uncharted territory of pseudomanifolds, as there are a lot we want to understand regarding their Stanley-Reisner rings. For example, it is a long dream of mine to be able to identify Goresky-MacPherson’s intersection cohomology of a simplicial pseudomanifold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K" class="latex" title="K" />, (for arbitrary perversities) through the Stanley-Reisner ring.</p>

<h2>Hilda Geiringer</h2>
<p>An interesting historical comment is that Laman’s 1970 theorem about generic planar rigidity was proved already in 1927 by the famous applied mathematician and statistician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_Geiringer">Hilda Pollaczek-Geiringer</a>.

<p>The reason I’m celebrating is presumably obvious to all: today is my daughter Lily’s 8<sup>th</sup> birthday!  (She had a tiny <em>Star Wars</em>-themed party, dressed in her Rey costume.)</p>



<p>A second reason I’m celebrating yesterday: I began teaching (via Zoom, of course) the latest iteration of my graduate course on Quantum Complexity Theory!</p>



<p>A third reason: I’m now scheduled to get my first covid vaccine shot on Monday!  (Texas is working through its “Phase 1b,” which includes both the over-65 and those with underlying conditions—in my case, mild type-2 diabetes.)  I’d encourage everyone to do as I did: don’t lie to jump the line, but don’t sacrifice your place either.  Just follow the stated rules and get vaccinated the first microsecond you can, and urge all your friends and loved ones to do the same.  A crush of demand is actually <em>good</em> if it encourages the providers to expand their hours (they’re taking off weekends! they took off MLK Day!) and not to waste a single dose.</p>



<p>Anyway, people can use this thread to talk about whatever they like, but one thing that would interest me especially is readers’ experiences with vaccination: if you’ve gotten one by now, how hard did you have to look for an appointment, how orderly or chaotic was the process where you live, and what advice can you offer?</p>



<p>Incidentally, to the several commenters on this blog who expressed <em>absolute certainty</em> (as recently as yesterday) that Trump would reverse the election result and be inaugurated instead of Biden, and who confidently accused the rest of us of living in a manufactured media bubble that prevented them from seeing that: I respect that, whatever else is said about you, no one can ever again accuse you of being fair-weather friends!</p>



<p>Congratulations to the new President!  There are difficult months ahead, but today the arc of the universe bent slightly toward sanity and goodness.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Jan 21):</span></strong> WOOHOO!  Yet another reason to celebrate: Scott Alexander is finally back in business, now blogging at <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">Astral Codex Ten</a> on Substack.</p></div>

<p>Back in 2014 I recommended a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/03/should-we-have-tcs-ethics-board.html">TCS ethics board</a> mainly to deal with plagiarism and who should get credit for a result. It went the way of most suggestions I make in my blog, a quick road to nowhere. Bill <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/03/should-we-have-tcs-ethics-board.html?showComment=1396496899643#c955985184567246644">asked</a> "Does any other branch of CS have an ethics board? How have they worked?"</p><p>The NeurIPS conference created a such a board for the <a href="https://neuripsconf.medium.com/what-we-learned-from-neurips-2020-reviewing-process-e24549eea38f">reviewing process</a>, though with a broader mission.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>We appointed an ethics advisor and invited a pool of 22 ethics reviewers (listed <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/ProgramCommittee">here</a>) with expertise in fields such as AI policy, fairness and transparency, and ethics and machine learning. Reviewers could flag papers for ethical concerns, such as submissions with undue risk of harm or methods that might increase unfair bias through improper use of data, etc. Papers that received strong technical reviews yet were flagged for ethical reasons were assessed by the pool of ethics reviewers.</p><p>Thirteen papers met these criteria and received ethics reviews. Only four papers were rejected because of ethical considerations, after a thorough assessment that included the original technical reviewers, the area chair, the senior area chair and also the program chairs. Seven papers flagged for ethical concerns were conditionally accepted, meaning that the final decision is pending the assessment of the area chair once the camera ready version is submitted. Some of these papers require a thorough revision of the broader impact section to include a clearer discussion of potential risks and mitigations, and others require changes to the submission such as the removal of problematic datasets. Overall, we believe that the ethics review was a successful and important addition to the review process. Though only a small fraction of papers received detailed ethical assessments, the issues they presented were important and complex and deserved the extended consideration. In addition, we were very happy with the high quality of the assessments offered by the ethics reviewers, and the area chairs and senior area chairs also appreciated the additional feedback.</p></blockquote><p></p><div>Without seeing the process I cannot say what criteria were used to reject the four papers. There could be legitimate reasons if the authors did violate professional ethics or even inadvertently based their results on biased data sets. But there's a fine line to rejecting papers because you don't like the outcome or the questions they ask. No easy answers here.</div></div>

<p><em><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">Conjectures</span></strong></em>are a staple of mathematics.  They are everywhere, permeating every area, subarea and subsubarea.  They are diverse enough to avoid a single general adjective.  They come in al shapes and sizes.  Some of them are famous, classical, general, important, inspirational, far-reaching, audacious, exiting or popular, while others are speculative, narrow, technical, imprecise, far-fetched, misleading or recreational.  That’s a lot of beliefs about unproven claims, yet we persist in dispensing them, inadvertently revealing our experience, intuition and biases.</p>

<p>The conjectures also vary in attitude.  Like a finish line ribbon they all appear equally vulnerable to an outsider, but in fact differ widely from race to race.  <em>Some </em>are eminently reachable, the only question being who will get there first (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres">100 meter dash</a>).  <em>Others </em>are barely on the horizon, requiring both great effort, variety of tools, and an extended time commitment (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironman_Triathlon">ironman triathlon</a>).

Ed was someone that I knew since the late 1970’s. We met in 1977 at POPL—a conference that I used to regularly attend—where Ed gave a talk. He was a student of Bob Constable; Ken knew Bob at Cornell the next decade but does not recall meeting Ed. As related in this short IEEE <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-institute/ieee-member-news/edmund-melson-clarke-creator-of-model-checking-dies-at-75">bio</a>, Ed had his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in mathematics and started as a mathematics PhD at Cornell before changing to computer science. His POPL <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/512950.512952">paper</a> was on exactly what his Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_M._Clarke">bio</a> notes about his thesis work under Constable: it found programming language constructs that were tough nuts for Tony Hoare’s program verification logics. </p>
<p>
The IEEE bio continues: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> After graduating in 1976, Clarke joined Duke as a computer science professor. In 1978 he began teaching computer science at Harvard. While there, Clarke and his doctoral student Allen Emerson conducted research on methods that could be used to effectively verify how a system performs without errors. In 1981 they published a paper on model checking, “Design and Synthesis of Synchronization Skeletons Using Branching Time Temporal Logic,” in <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/BFb0025769">Logics of Programs</a>. </em>

Model Checking (MC) is related to verification technology (VT). But it is different. MC was initially used mostly for hardware, although it is used for software too. MC also can and is used for partial properties. This to me is the main and most interesting difference. See <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~emc/15414-f12/lecture/intro_mc.pdf">slides</a> and the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/model-checking-second-edition">book</a> by Ed, Orna Grumberg, Daniel Kroening, Doron Peled, and Helmut Veith.</p>
<p>
I have long had doubts about the claims of VT. This goes back to my 1979 <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> with Rich DeMillo and Alan Perlis. We had several issues with the claims of VT, issues that still hold today.</p>
<p>
The brilliant insight of Ed and his colleagues is that these issues are avoided for the most part by MC. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is correct? A key issue with VT is how do you capture the notion of correctness? We argued even for almost trivial algorithms it is hard to get this right. For sorting type algorithms we noted that even a published account gets the correctness wrong: they left out that the output was not only in sorted order, but also was a permutation of the input. <p></p>
</li><li>
How do you prove them? Okay suppose you believe that you have captured what correctness means. How do you know that it always holds? VT tries to prove the universal sentence: For all inputs, the algorithm always satisfies the property. The difficulty is that proofs in mathematics are different than proofs that arise in VT. This difference reduces the ability to trust proofs. We trust math proofs for all sorts of reasons that do not apply to VT.
</li></ol>
<p>
The point of MC is that there are answers to these: </p>
<ol>
<li>
What is correct? MC uses a variety of tools that makes correctness more likely to be captured. I especially like the ability to give partial notions of correctness. It may be hard to state exactly what you want hardware to do, but it may be easy to state something that you want it to satisfy. A server’s correctness may be difficult to capture, but requiring the server to avoid stopping completely, may be still quite useful. <p></p>
</li><li>
How do you prove them? MC uses automatic tools rather than proofs. This allows tremendous leverage that makes the MC much more reliable than any proof based system. This cannot be stressed enough. Checking via a general tool is immensely more believable than any proof.
</li></ol>

Multidimensional packing problems generalize the classical packing problems such as Bin Packing, Multiprocessor Scheduling by allowing the jobs to be $d$-dimensional vectors. While the approximability of the scalar problems is well understood, there has been a significant gap between the approximation algorithms and the hardness results for the multidimensional variants. In this paper, we close this gap by giving almost tight hardness results for these problems.
1. We show that Vector Bin Packing has no $\Omega( \log d)$ factor asymptotic approximation algorithm when $d$ is a large constant, assuming $P \neq NP$. This matches the $\ln d + O(1)$ factor approximation algorithms (Chekuri, Khanna SICOMP 2004, Bansal, Caprara, Sviridenko SICOMP 2009, Bansal, Eliáš, Khan SODA 2016) upto constants. 
2. We show that Vector Scheduling has no polynomial time algorithm with an approximation ratio of $\Omega\left( (\log d)^{1-\epsilon}\right)$ when $d$ is part of the input, assuming NP has no quasipolynomial time algorithms. This almost matches the $O\left( \frac{\log d}{\log \log d}\right)$ factor algorithms(Harris, Srinivasan JACM 2019, Im, Kell, Kulkarni, Panigrahi SICOMP 2019). We also show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within $(\log \log d)^{\omega(1)}$. 
3. We show that Vector Bin Covering is NP-hard to approximate within $\Omega\left( \frac{\log d}{\log \log d}\right)$ when $d$ is part of the input, almost matching the $O(\log d)$ factor algorithm (Alon et al., Algorithmica 1998). 

	Previously, no hardness results that grow with $d$ were known for Vector Scheduling and Vector Bin Covering when $d$ is part of the input and for Vector Bin Packing when $d$ is a fixed constant.</div>

We obtain the first true size-space trade-offs for the cutting planes proof system, where the upper bounds hold for size and total space for derivations with constant-size coefficients, and the lower bounds apply to length and formula space (i.e., number of inequalities in memory) even for derivations with exponentially large coefficients. These are also the first trade-offs to hold uniformly for resolution, polynomial calculus and cutting planes, thus capturing the main methods of reasoning used in current state-of-the-art SAT solvers.

We prove our results by a reduction to communication lower bounds in a round-efficient version of the  real communication model of [Krají$\check{c}$ek '98], drawing on and extending techniques in [Raz and McKenzie '99] and [Göös et al. '15]. Such lower bounds are in turn established by a reduction to trade-offs between cost and number of rounds in the game of [Dymond and Tompa '85] played on directed acyclic graphs.

As a by-product of the techniques developed to show these proof complexity trade-off results, we also obtain a separation between $\textrm{monotone-AC}^{i-1}$ and $\textrm{monotone-NC}^{i}$, and an exponential separation between $\textrm{monotone-AC}^{i-1}$ and $\textrm{monotone-AC}^{i}$, improving exponentially over the superpolynomial separation in [Raz and McKenzie '99].</div>

<p>This semester I am teaching a <a href="https://boazbk.github.io/mltheoryseminar/">seminar on the theory of machine learning</a>. For the first lecture, I would like to talk about what is the theory of machine learning. I decided to write this (very rough!) blog post mainly to organize my own thoughts.</p>



<p>In any science, ML included, the goals of theory and practice are not disjoint. We study the same general phenomena from different perspectives. We can think of questions in computation at a high level as trying to map the unknown terrain of the computational cost of achieving certain quality of output, given some conditions on the input.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h8ZOrcE.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Practitioners aim to find points on this terrain’s practically relevant regions, while theoreticians are more interested in its broad landscape, including at points far out into infinity. Both theoreticians and practitioners care about <em>discontinuities</em>, when small changes in one aspect correspond to large changes in another. As theoreticians, we care about <em>computational/statistical tradeoffs</em>, particularly about points where a small difference in quality yields an exponential difference in time or sample complexity. In practice, models such as GPT-3 demonstrate that a quantitative increase in computational resources can correspond to a qualitative increase in abilities.</p>



<p>Since theory and practice study the same phenomenon in different ways, their relation can vary. Sometimes theory is forward-looking or <em>prescriptive</em> – giving “proof of concepts” results that can inspire future application or impossibility results that can rule out certain directions. Sometimes it is backward-looking or <em>descriptive</em> – explaining phenomena uncovered by experiments and putting them in a larger context.</p>



<h2>What is machine learning?</h2>



<p>Before we talk about what is machine-learning theory, we should talk about what is machine learning. It’s common to see claims of the form “machine learning is X”:</p>



<ul><li>Machine learning is just statistics</li><li>Machine learning is just optimization</li><li>Machine learning is just approximation or “curve fitting”</li></ul>



<p>and probably many more.</p>



<p>I view machine learning as addressing the following setup:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KPvtSl6.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>There is a system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> that interacts with the world around it in some manner, and we have some sense of whether this interaction is successful or unsuccessful.</p>



<p>For example, a self-driving car is “successful” if it gets passengers from point A to point B safely, quickly, and comfortably. It is “unsuccessful” if it gets into accidents, takes a long time, or drives in a halting or otherwise uncomfortable manner.</p>



<h3>Three levels of indirection</h3>



<p>The system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> is the “machine.” It is “learning” since we <em>adapt</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> so that it becomes more successful. Ideally, we would set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> to be the most successful system. However, what we actually do is at least <em>thrice-removed</em> from this ideal:</p>



<ol><li><strong>The model gap:</strong> We do not optimize overall possible systems, but rather a small subset of such systems (e.g., ones that belong to a certain family of models).</li><li><strong>The metric gap:</strong> In almost all cases, we do not optimize the actual measure of success we care about, but rather another metric that is at best correlated with it.</li><li><strong>The algorithm gap:</strong> We don’t even optimize the latter metric since it will almost always be non-convex, and hence the system we end up with depends on our starting point and the particular algorithms we use.</li></ol>



<p>The magic of machine learning is that sometimes (though not always!) we can still get good results despite these gaps. Much of the theory of machine learning is about understanding under what conditions can we bridge some of these gaps.</p>



<p>The above discussion explains the “machine Learning is just X” takes. The expressivity of our models falls under <em>approximation theory</em>. The gap between the success we want to achieve and the metric we can measure often corresponds to the difference between <em>population</em> and <em>sample</em> performance, which becomes a question of <em>statistics</em>. The study of our algorithms’ performance falls under <em>optimization</em>.</p>



<p>The <strong>metric gap</strong> is perhaps the widest of them all. While in some settings (e.g., designing systems to play video games) we can directly measure a system’s success, this is typically the exception rather than rule. Often:</p>



<ul><li>The data we have access to is not the data the system will run on and might not even come from the same distribution.</li><li>The measure of success that we care about is not necessarily well defined or accessible to us. Even if it was, it is not necessarily in a form that we can directly optimize.</li></ul>



<p>Nevertheless, the hope is that if we optimize the hell out of the metrics we can measure, the system will perform well in the way we care about. In other words:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tDKqZZC.jpg" alt="" /></figure>



<p>A priori, it is not clear that this should be the case, and indeed it’s not always is. Part of the magic of auto-differentiation is that it allows optimization of more complex metrics that match more closely with the success metric we have in mind. But, except for very special circumstances, the two metrics can never be the same. The mismatch between the goal we have and the metric we optimize can manifest in one of the following general ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong>“No free lunch”</strong> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a>: If we optimize a metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{M}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{M}" /> then we will get a system that does very well at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{M}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{M}" /> and not at all well in any other measure. For example, if we optimize accuracy in predicting images, then we may <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12152">not do well</a> on slightly perturbed versions of these images.</li><li><strong>“It’s not the destination, it’s the journey”</strong> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle">Anna Karenina principle</a>: All successful systems are similar to one another, and hence if we make our system successful with respect to a metric <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{M}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{M}" /> then it is likely to also be successful with respect to related measures. For example, image classifiers trained on ImageNet have been successfully used for very different images, and there is also evidence that success in ImageNet translates into success on a related distribution (i.e., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">ImageNet v2</a>).</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mzSqGVe.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>At the moment, we have no good way to predict when a system will behave according to Goodhart’s law versus the Anna Karenina principle. It seems that when it comes to learning <em>representations</em>, machine learning systems follow the Anna Karenina principle: all successful models tend to learn very similar representations of their data. In contrast, when it comes to making <em>decisions</em>, we get manifestations of Goodhart’s law, and optimizing for one metric can give very different results than the other.</p>



<p>The <strong>model gap</strong> is the gap between the set of all possible systems and the set that we actually optimize over. Even if a system can be captured as a finite function (say a function mapping <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=32+%5Ctimes+32&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="32 \times 32" class="latex" title="32 \times 32" /> pixel images to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="10" class="latex" title="10" /> classes), a simple counting argument shows that the vast majority of these functions require far too many gates to be efficiently computable by any reasonable computational model. (In case you are curious, the counting argument also works for <em>quantum</em> circuits.) Hence we necessarily have to deal with a subclass of all possible functions.</p>



<p>This raises the question of whether we should expect a realizable system to <em>exist</em>, let alone for us to find it. Often machine learning is used in <em>artifical intelligence</em> applications, where we are trying to mimic human performance. In such cases, human performance is an “existence proof” that some reasonably-sized circuit is successful in the goal. But whether this circuit can be embedded in our model family is still an open question.</p>



<p>Remember when I said that sometimes it’s not about the journey but about the destination? I lied. The <strong>algorithm gap</strong> implies that in modern machine learning, there is a certain sense in which it is always about the journey. In modern machine learning, the system <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> is typically parameterized by a vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5EN&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w \in \mathbb{R}^N" class="latex" title="w \in \mathbb{R}^N" /> of real numbers. Hence the <em>metric</em> we optimize over is to minimize some loss function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28w%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{L}(w)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{L}(w)" />. We use <em>local search algorithms</em>, which start off at some vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w_0" class="latex" title="w_0" /> chosen via some distribution, and then iteratively takes small steps <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_1%2Cw_2%2Cw_3%2C%5Cldots&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w_1,w_2,w_3,\ldots" class="latex" title="w_1,w_2,w_3,\ldots" />. For each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w_i" class="latex" title="w_i" />, the next step <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_%7Bi%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w_{i+1}" class="latex" title="w_{i+1}" /> is chosen from some distribution of vectors close to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w_i" class="latex" title="w_i" /> such that (hopefully) in expectation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28w_%7Bi%2B1%7D%29+%3C+%5Cmathcal%7BL%7D%28w_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{L}(w_{i+1}) &lt; \mathcal{L}(w_i)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{L}(w_{i+1}) &lt; \mathcal{L}(w_i)" />.</p>



<p>Modern machine learning systems are <em>non convex</em>, which means that the final point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w_t" class="latex" title="w_t" /> we end up in depends on the starting point, the algorithms, and the randomness. Hence, we can’t have a neat “separation of concerns” and decouple the <strong>architecture</strong>, <strong>metric</strong>, and <strong>algorithm</strong>. When we say that a system obeys the “Anna Karenina principle,” we really mean that for <em>natural algorithms</em> to optimize <em>natural metrics</em> on <em>natural architectures</em>, successful outputs (ones that do well on the metric) are likely to be similar to one another. The use of the “natural” qualifier is a warning sign that we don’t fully understand the conditions under which this happens, but it is clear that some conditions are necessary. Due to non-convexity, it is typically possible to find a “bad minima” that would be very good in some specific metric but terrible in other ones.</p>



<h2>Types of theory for machine learning (and for CS in general)</h2>



<p>Given the above discussion, what kind of theoretical results should we expect in machine learning? Let’s try to classify the type of results we see in general theoretical computer science. In the discussion below, I will focus on the <em>limitations</em> of these theoretical results and use humorous names, but make no mistake: all of these categories correspond to valuable theoretical insights.</p>



<h3>End to end analysis</h3>



<p>The <em>quicksort</em> algorithm provides a canonical example of algorithm analysis. At this point, we have a reasonably complete understanding of quicksort. We can analyze the distribution of its running time down to the constant.</p>



<p>Hence we have an efficient algorithm, used in practice, with rigoroulsy proven theorems that precisely characterize its performance. This is the “gold standard” of analysis, but also an unrealistic and unachievable goal in almost any other setting.</p>



<h3>Proof of concept</h3>



<p>A more common situation is that we have algorithms that work in practice and algorithms with rigorous analysis, but they are not the same algorithms. A canonical example is linear programming. The simplex algorithm often works well in practice but was known to take exponential time on certain instances. For a long time, it was an open question whether or not there is an algorithm for linear programming that take polynomial time in the worst case.</p>



<p>In 1979, Khachiyan gave the <em>Ellipsoid</em> algorithm that runs in polynomial time, but with a polynomial so large that it is impractical. Still, the Ellipsoid algorithm was a great breakthrough, giving hope for better algorithms and a new approach for defining progress measures for linear programming instances. Indeed in 1984, Karmarkar came up with the <em>interior points</em> algorithm, with much better time dependence.</p>



<p>The interior-point algorithm is practical and often outperforms the simplex method on large enough instances. However, the algorithm as implemented is not identical to the one analyzed- implementations use different step sizes and other heuristics for which we do not have a precise analysis.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, even if (unlike quicksort) the rigorously analyzed algorithm is not identical to the practical implementations, the story of linear programming shows how crucial “proofs of concept” can be to introducing new ideas and techniques.</p>



<p>The flip side of “proof of concept” results are <em>impossiblity results</em> that rule out even “proof of concept ” algorithms. Impossibility results always come with fine print and caveats (for example, NP-hardness results always refer to <em>worst case</em> complexity). However, they still teach us about the structure of the problem and help define the contours of what we can expect to achieve.</p>



<h2>Character witness</h2>



<p>“End to end analysis” is when we can prove the guarantees we need on algorithms we actually want to use. “Proof of concept” is when we prove the guarantees we need on impractical algorithms. A “character witness” result is when we prove something positive about an algorithm people use in practice, even if that positive property falls short of the guarantees we actually want.</p>



<p>While the term “character witness” sounds derogatory, such results can sometimes yield truly profound insights. A canonical example again comes from linear programming. While the simplex algorithm can be exponential in the worst case, in a seminal work, Spielman and Teng showed that it does run in polynomial-time if the input is slightly perturbed- this is so-called <em>smoothed analysis</em>. While the actual polynomial and the level of perturbation do not yield practical bounds, this is still an important result. It gives formal meaning to the intuition that the simplex only fails on “pathological” instances and initiated a new mode of analyzing algorithms between worst-case and average-case complexity.</p>



<p>In machine learning, a “character witness” result can take many forms. For example, some “character witness” results are analyses of algorithms under certain assumptions on the data, that even if not literally true, seem like they could be “morally true”. Another type of “character witness” result shows that an algorithm would yield the right results if it is allowed to run for an infinite or exponentially long time. Evaluating the significance of such results can be challenging. The main question is whether the analysis teaches us something we didn’t know before.</p>



<p>A third type of “character witness” results are quantitative bounds that are too weak for practical use but are still non-vacuous. For example, approximation algorithms with too big of an approximation factor, or generalization bounds with too big of a guaranteed gap. In such cases, one would hope that these bounds will be at least correlated with performance: algorithms with better bounds will also have higher quality output.</p>



<h2>Toy problems</h2>



<p>The name “toy problem” also sounds derogatory, but toy problems or toy models can be extremely important in science, and machine learning is no different. A toy model is a way to abstract the salient issues of a model to enable analysis. Results on “toy models” can teach us about general principles that hold in more complex models.</p>



<p>When choosing a toy model, it is important not to mistake models that share superficial similarity with models that keep the salient issues we want to study. For example, consider the following two variants of deep neural networks:</p>



<ul><li>Networks that have standard architecture except that we make them extremely wide, with the width tending to infinity independently of all other parameters.</li><li>Networks where all activation functions are linear.</li></ul>



<p>Since the practical intuition is that bigger models are better, it may seem that such “ultra-wide” models are not toy models at all and should capture state of the art deep networks. However, the neural tangent kernel results show that these models become kernel models that do not learn their representation at all.</p>



<p>Intuitively, making activation functions linear seems pointless since the composition of linear functions is linear, and hence such linear networks are no more expressive than a layer one linear net. Thus such linear networks seem too much of a “toy model” (maybe a “happy meal model”?). Yet, it turns out that despite their limited expressivity, deep linear networks capture an essential feature of deep networks- the bias induced by the gradient descent algorithm. For example, running gradient descent on a depth two linear network translate to regularizing by a proxy of <em>rank</em>. In general, gradient descent on a deep linear network induces a very different geometry on the manifold of linear functions.</p>



<p>Hence, although the first model seems much more “real” than the second one, there are some deep learning questions where the second model is more relevant.</p>



<h3>Theory without theorems</h3>



<p>One might think that the whole point of theory is to provide rigorous results: if we are not going to prove theorems, we might as well use benchmarks. Yet, there are important theoretical insights we can get from experiments. A favorite example of mine is the Zhang et al result that deep neural networks can fit random labels. This simple experiment ruled out in one fell swoop a whole direction for proving generalization bounds on deep nets. A theory work does not have to involve theorems: well-chosen experiments can provide important theoretical insights.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The above was a stream-of-consciousness and very rough personal overview of questions and results in ML theory. In the <a href="https://boazbk.github.io/mltheoryseminar/">coming seminar</a> we will see results of all the types above, as well as many open questions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" class="has-text-align-center"><i>This is a post about a new paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01739">Online Multivalid Learning: Means, Moments, and Prediction Intervals</a>, that is joint work with Varun Gupta, Christopher Jung, Georgy Noarov, and Mallesh Pai. It is <a href="https://toc4fairness.org/how-to-estimate-the-uncertainty-of-predictions">cross-posted to the new TOC4Fairness blog</a>. </i></p> <p>Suppose you go and train the latest, greatest machine learning architecture to predict something important. Say (to pick an example entirely out of thin air) you are in the midst of a pandemic, and want to predict the severity of patients' symptoms in 2 days time, so as to triage scarce medical resources. Since you will be using these predictions to make decisions, you would like them to be accurate in various ways: for example, at the very least, you will want your predictions to be calibrated, and you may also want to be able to accurately quantify the uncertainty of your predictions (say with 95% prediction intervals). It is a fast moving situation, and data is coming in dynamically --- and you need to make decisions as you go. What can you do? </p> <p>The first thing you might do is <a href="https://twitter.com/Aaroth/status/1272545845603434497">ask on twitter</a>! What you will find is that the standard tool for quantifying uncertainty in settings like this is <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/shafer08a/shafer08a.pdf">conformal prediction</a>. The conformal prediction literature has a number of elegant techniques for endowing arbitrary point prediction methods with <em>marginal prediction intervals</em>: i.e intervals $(\ell(x), u(x))$ such that over the randomness of some data distribution over labelled examples $(x,y)$: $\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)]\right] \approx 0.95$ These would be 95% marginal prediction intervals --- but in general you could pick your favorite coverage probability $1-\delta$.  </p> <p>Conformal prediction has a lot going for it --- its tools are very general and flexible, and lead to practical algorithms. But it also has two well known shortcomings:</p> <ol><li><strong>Strong Assumptions</strong>. Like many tools from statistics and machine learning, conformal prediction methods require that the future look like the past. In particular, they require that the data be drawn i.i.d. from some distribution --- or at least be <em>exchangable</em> (i.e. their distribution should be invariant to permutation). This is sometimes the case --- but it often is not. In our pandemic scenario, the distribution on patient features might quickly change in unexpected ways as the disease moves between different populations, as might the relationship between features and outcomes, as treatments advance. In other settings in which consequential decisions are being made about people --- like lending and hiring decisions --- people might intentionally manipulate their features in response to the predictive algorithms you deploy, in an attempt to get the outcome they want. Or you might be trying to predict outcomes in time series data, in which there are explicit dependencies across time. In all of these scenarios, exchangeability is violated.</li><li><strong>Weak Guarantees</strong>. Marginal coverage guarantees are <em>averages over people</em>. 95% marginal coverage means that the true label falls within the predicted interval for 95% of people. It need not mean anything for <em>people like you</em>. For example, if you are part of a demographic group that makes up less than 5% of the population, it is entirely consistent with the guarantees of a 95% marginal prediction interval that labels for people from your demographic group fall outside of their intervals 100% of the time. This can be both an accuracy and a <strong><em>fairness</em> </strong>concern --- marginal prediction works well for "typical" members of a population, but not necessarily for everyone else. </li></ol> <p>What kinds of improvements might we hope for? Lets start with how to strengthen the guarantee:</p> <p><strong>Multivalidity</strong> Ideally, we would want <em>conditional</em> guarantees --- i.e. the promise that for every $x$, that we would have $\Pr_{y}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \right] \approx 0.95$. In other words, that somehow for each individual, the prediction interval was valid for them specifically, over the "unrealized" (or unmeasured) randomness of the world. Of course this is too much to hope for. In a rich feature space, we have likely never seen anyone exactly like you before (i.e. with your feature vector $x$). So strictly speaking, we have no information at all about your conditional label distribution. We still have to average over people. But we don't have to average over everybody. An important idea that has been investigated in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513">several </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144">different </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12317">contexts </a>in recent years in the theory literature on fairness is that we might articulate a very rich collection of (generally intersecting) demographic groups $G$ corresponding to relevant subsets of the data domain, and ask for things that we care about to hold true as averaged over any group $S \in G$ in the collection. In the case of prediction intervals, this would correspond to asking for something like that simultaneously for every demographic group $S \in G$, $\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \in S \right] \approx 0.95$. Note here that an individual might be a member of many different demographic groups, and can interpret the guarantees of their prediction interval as averages over any of those demographic groups, at their option. This is what we can achieve --- at least for any such group that isn't too small.  </p> <p>And what kinds of assumptions do we need?</p> <p><strong>Adversarial Data </strong>Actually, its not clear that we need any! Many learning problems which initially appear to require distributional assumptions turn out to be solvable even in the worst case over data sequences --- i.e. even if a clever adversary, with full knowledge of your algorithm, and with the intent only to sabotage your learning guarantees, is allowed to adaptively choose data to present to your algorithm. This is the case for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/85/2/379/298827">calibrated weather prediction</a>, as well as <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/syrgkanis16.pdf">general contextual prediction</a>. It turns out to be the case for us as well. Instead of promising coverage probabilities of $1-\delta + O(1/T)$ after $T$ rounds <em>on the underlying distribution</em>, as<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf"> conformal prediction is able to</a>, (for us there is no underlying distribution) we offer <em>empirical</em> coverage rates of $1-\delta \pm O(1/\sqrt{T})$. This kind of guarantee is quite similar to what<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf"> conformal prediction guarantees about empirical coverage</a>. </p> <p><strong>More Generally </strong>Our techniques are not specific to prediction intervals. We can do the same thing for predicting label means, and predicting variances of the residuals of arbitrary prediction methods. For mean prediction, this corresponds to an algorithm for providing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513">multi-calibrated predictions in the sense of Hebert-Johnson et al</a>, in an online adversarial environment. For variances and other higher moments, it corresponds to an online algorithm for making <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037">mean-conditioned moment multicalibrated predictions in the sense of Jung et al</a>.</p> <p><strong>Techniques</strong> At the risk of boring my one stubbornly remaining reader, let me say a few words about how we do it. We generalize an idea that dates back to an argument that<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3203773/fudenberg_calibrate.pdf"> Fudenberg and Levine first made in 1995</a> --- and is closely related to <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/hart/papers/calib-minmax.pdf">an earlier, beautiful argument by Sergiu Hart</a> --- but that I just learned about this summer, and thought was just amazing. It applies broadly to solving any prediction task that would be easy, if only you were facing a known data distribution. This is the case for us. If, for each arriving patient at our hospital, a wizard <em>told us</em> their "true" distribution over outcome severity, we could easily make calibrated predictions by always predicting the mean of this distribution --- and we could similarly read off correct 95% coverage intervals from the CDF of the distribution. So what? That's not the situation we are in, of course. Absent a wizard, we first need to commit to some learning algorithm, and only then will the adversary decide what data to show us. </p> <p>But lets put our game theory hats on. Suppose we've been making predictions for awhile. We can write down some measure of our error so far --- say the maximum, over all demographic groups in $G$, of the deviation of our empirical coverage so far from our 95% coverage target.  For the next round, define a zero sum game, in which we (the learner) want to minimize the <em>increase</em> in this measure of error, and the adversary wants to maximize it. The defining feature of zero-sum games is that how well you can do in them is independent of which player has to announce their distribution on play first --- this is the celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax_theorem">Minimax Theorem</a>. So to evaluate how well the learner could do in this game, we can think about the situation involving a Wizard above, in which for each arriving person, before we have to make a prediction for them, we get to observe their true label distribution. Of course in this scenario we can do well, because for all of our goals, our measure of success is based on how well our predictions match observed properties of these distributions. The Minimax theorem tells us that (at least in principle --- it doesn't give us the algorithm), there must therefore also be a learning algorithm that can do just as well, but against an adversary. </p> <p>The minimax argument is slick, but non-constructive. To actually pin down a concrete algorithm, we need to solve for the equilibrium in the corresponding game. That's what we spend much of the paper doing, for each of the prediction tasks that we study. For multicalibration, we get a simple, elementary algorithm --- but for the prediction interval problem, although we get a polynomial time algorithm, it involves solving a linear program with a separation oracle at each round. Finding more efficient and practical ways to do this strikes me as an important problem. </p> <p>Finally, I had more fun writing this paper --- learning about old techniques from the game theoretic calibration literature --- than I've had in awhile. I hope a few people enjoy reading it!</p><p> </p></div>

It is a fast moving situation, and data is coming in dynamically — and you need to make decisions as you go. What can you do? </p>



<p>The first thing you might do is <a href="https://twitter.com/Aaroth/status/1272545845603434497">ask on twitter</a>! What you will find is that the standard tool for quantifying uncertainty in settings like this is <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume9/shafer08a/shafer08a.pdf">conformal prediction</a>. The conformal prediction literature has a number of elegant techniques for endowing arbitrary point prediction methods with <em>marginal prediction intervals</em>: i.e intervals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(\ell(x), u(x))" class="latex" title="(\ell(x), u(x))" /> such that over the randomness of some data distribution over labelled examples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,y)" class="latex" title="(x,y)" />: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr_%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D%5Cleft%5By+%5Cin+%5B%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%5D%5Cright%5D+%5Capprox+0.95&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)]\right] \approx 0.95" class="latex" title="\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)]\right] \approx 0.95" /> These would be 95% marginal prediction intervals — but in general you could pick your favorite coverage probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1-\delta" class="latex" title="1-\delta" />.  </p>



<p>Conformal prediction has a lot going for it — its tools are very general and flexible, and lead to practical algorithms. But it also has two well known shortcomings:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Strong Assumptions</strong>. Like many tools from statistics and machine learning, conformal prediction methods require that the future look like the past. In particular, they require that the data be drawn i.i.d. from some distribution — or at least be <em>exchangable</em> (i.e. their distribution should be invariant to permutation). This is sometimes the case — but it often is not. In our pandemic scenario, the distribution on patient features might quickly change in unexpected ways as the disease moves between different populations, as might the relationship between features and outcomes, as treatments advance. In other settings in which consequential decisions are being made about people — like lending and hiring decisions — people might intentionally manipulate their features in response to the predictive algorithms you deploy, in an attempt to get the outcome they want. Or you might be trying to predict outcomes in time series data, in which there are explicit dependencies across time. In all of these scenarios, exchangeability is violated.</li><li><strong>Weak Guarantees</strong>. Marginal coverage guarantees are <em>averages over people</em>. 95% marginal coverage means that the true label falls within the predicted interval for 95% of people. It need not mean anything for <em>people like you</em>. For example, if you are part of a demographic group that makes up less than 5% of the population, it is entirely consistent with the guarantees of a 95% marginal prediction interval that labels for people from your demographic group fall outside of their intervals 100% of the time. This can be both an accuracy and a <strong><em>fairness</em> </strong>concern — marginal prediction works well for “typical” members of a population, but not necessarily for everyone else. </li></ol>



<p>What kinds of improvements might we hope for? Lets start with how to strengthen the guarantee:</p>



<p><strong>Multivalidity</strong> Ideally, we would want <em>conditional</em> guarantees — i.e. the promise that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />, that we would have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr_%7By%7D%5Cleft%5By+%5Cin+%5B%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%5D+%7C+x+%5Cright%5D+%5Capprox+0.95&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Pr_{y}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \right] \approx 0.95" class="latex" title="\Pr_{y}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \right] \approx 0.95" />. In other words, that somehow for each individual, the prediction interval was valid for them specifically, over the “unrealized” (or unmeasured) randomness of the world. Of course this is too much to hope for. In a rich feature space, we have likely never seen anyone exactly like you before (i.e. with your feature vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />). So strictly speaking, we have no information at all about your conditional label distribution. We still have to average over people. But we don’t have to average over everybody. An important idea that has been investigated in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513">several </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144">different </a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12317">contexts </a>in recent years in the theory literature on fairness is that we might articulate a very rich collection of (generally intersecting) demographic groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> corresponding to relevant subsets of the data domain, and ask for things that we care about to hold true as averaged over any group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cin+G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S \in G" class="latex" title="S \in G" /> in the collection. In the case of prediction intervals, this would correspond to asking for something like that simultaneously for every demographic group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S+%5Cin+G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S \in G" class="latex" title="S \in G" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr_%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D%5Cleft%5By+%5Cin+%5B%5Cell%28x%29%2C+u%28x%29%5D+%7C+x+%5Cin+S+%5Cright%5D+%5Capprox+0.95&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \in S \right] \approx 0.95" class="latex" title="\Pr_{(x,y)}\left[y \in [\ell(x), u(x)] | x \in S \right] \approx 0.95" />. Note here that an individual might be a member of many different demographic groups, and can interpret the guarantees of their prediction interval as averages over any of those demographic groups, at their option. This is what we can achieve — at least for any such group that isn’t too small. </p>



<p>And what kinds of assumptions do we need?</p>



<p><strong>Adversarial Data </strong>Actually, its not clear that we need any! Many learning problems which initially appear to require distributional assumptions turn out to be solvable even in the worst case over data sequences — i.e. even if a clever adversary, with full knowledge of your algorithm, and with the intent only to sabotage your learning guarantees, is allowed to adaptively choose data to present to your algorithm. This is the case for <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article-abstract/85/2/379/298827">calibrated weather prediction</a>, as well as <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/syrgkanis16.pdf">general contextual prediction</a>. It turns out to be the case for us as well. Instead of promising coverage probabilities of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta+%2B+O%281%2FT%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1-\delta + O(1/T)" class="latex" title="1-\delta + O(1/T)" /> after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> rounds <em>on the underlying distribution</em>, as<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf"> conformal prediction is able to</a>, we offer <em>empirical</em> coverage rates of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-%5Cdelta+%5Cpm+O%281%2F%5Csqrt%7BT%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1-\delta \pm O(1/\sqrt{T})" class="latex" title="1-\delta \pm O(1/\sqrt{T})" /> (since for us there is no underlying distribution). This kind of guarantee is quite similar to what<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/papers/conformal.pdf"> conformal prediction guarantees about empirical coverage</a>. </p>



<p><strong>More Generally </strong>Our techniques are not specific to prediction intervals. We can do the same thing for many other distributional quantities. We work this out in the case of predicting label means, and predicting variances of the residuals of arbitrary prediction methods. For mean prediction, this corresponds to an algorithm for providing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08513">multi-calibrated predictions in the sense of Hebert-Johnson et al</a>, in an online adversarial environment. For variances and other higher moments, it corresponds to an online algorithm for making <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08037">mean-conditioned moment multicalibrated predictions in the sense of Jung et al</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Techniques</strong> At the risk of boring my one stubbornly remaining reader, let me say a few words about how we do it. We generalize an idea that dates back to an argument that<a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3203773/fudenberg_calibrate.pdf"> Fudenberg and Levine first made in 1995</a> — and is closely related to <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/hart/papers/calib-minmax.pdf">an earlier, beautiful argument by Sergiu Hart</a> — but that I just learned about this summer, and thought was just amazing. It applies broadly to solving any prediction task that would be easy, if only you were facing a known data distribution. This is the case for us. If, for each arriving patient at our hospital, a wizard <em>told us</em> their “true” distribution over outcome severity, we could easily make calibrated predictions by always predicting the mean of this distribution — and we could similarly read off correct 95% coverage intervals from the CDF of the distribution. So what? That’s not the situation we are in, of course. Absent a wizard, we first need to commit to some learning algorithm, and only then will the adversary decide what data to show us. </p>



<p>But lets put our game theory hats on. Suppose we’ve been making predictions for awhile. We can write down some measure of our error so far — say the maximum, over all demographic groups in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />, of the deviation of our empirical coverage so far from our 95% coverage target.  For the next round, define a zero sum game, in which we (the learner) want to minimize the <em>increase</em> in this measure of error, and the adversary wants to maximize it. The defining feature of zero-sum games is that how well you can do in them is independent of which player has to announce their distribution on play first — this is the celebrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax_theorem">Minimax Theorem</a>. So to evaluate how well the learner could do in this game, we can think about the situation involving a Wizard above, in which for each arriving person, before we have to make a prediction for them, we get to observe their true label distribution. Of course in this scenario we can do well, because for all of our goals, our measure of success is based on how well our predictions match observed properties of these distributions. The Minimax theorem tells us that (at least in principle — it doesn’t give us the algorithm), there must therefore also be a learning algorithm that can do just as well, but against an adversary. </p>



<p>The minimax argument is slick, but non-constructive. To actually pin down a concrete algorithm, we need to solve for the equilibrium in the corresponding game. That’s what we spend much of the paper doing, for each of the prediction tasks that we study. For multicalibration, we get a simple, elementary algorithm — but for the prediction interval problem, although we get a polynomial time algorithm, it involves solving a linear program with a separation oracle at each round. Finding more efficient and practical ways to do this strikes me as an important problem. </p>



<p>Finally, I had more fun writing this paper — learning about old techniques from the game theoretic calibration literature — than I’ve had in awhile. I hope a few people enjoy reading it!</p>
