source for experimental campaigns in various research fields. Generating such
data-sets at scale is a non-trivial task as it requires design decisions
typically spanning multiple areas of expertise. Challenges begin with the
identification of relevant domain-specific network features, continue with the
question of how to compile such features into a tractable model, and culminate
in algorithmic details arising while implementing the pertaining model.
</p>
<p>In the present survey, we explore crucial aspects of random graph models with
known scalable generators. We begin by briefly introducing network features
considered by such models, and then discuss random graphs alongside with
generation algorithms. Our focus lies on modelling techniques and algorithmic
primitives that have proven successful in obtaining massive graphs. We consider
concepts and graph models for various domains (such as social network,
infrastructure, ecology, and numerical simulations), and discuss generators for
different models of computation (including shared-memory parallelism,
massive-parallel GPUs, and distributed systems).

$2^{n^{o(1)}}$-sparse set in $NTIME(2^{n^{o(1)}})$ that does not have any
randomized streaming algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$ updating time, and $n^{o(1)}$
space, then $NEXP\not=BPP$, where a $f(n)$-sparse set is a language that has at
most $f(n)$ strings of length $n$.
</p>
<p>The class $Tally(d(n), g(n))$ defines the class of all those tally sets
$T\subseteq \{1\}^*$ such that $d(n)$ gives an upper bound for the number of
elements of in $T^{\le n}$, and $g(n)$ gives the gap between a string $1^n\in
T$ and the next string $1^m$ in $T$ with $n&lt;m$ and $g(n)&lt;m$ (there is no string
$1^k\in T$ with $n&lt;k&lt;m$). We identify a class of function pairs $d(n)$ and
$g(n)$ (for example, $d(n)=\log \log n$ and $g(n)=2^{2^{2n}}$) such that if
MCSP~is $ZPP\cap Tally(d(n), g(n))$-hard under polynomial time truth-table
reductions, then $EXP\not=ZPP$. This indicates that proving $MCSP$ to be
$ZPP$-hard under polynomial time truth-table reductions implies separating
$EXP$ from $ZPP$.

required to tighten a collection of closed curves on any compact orientable
surface, where the number of crossings in the curve is not allowed to increase
at any time during the process. The best known upper bound before was
exponential, which can be obtained by combining the algorithm of de Graaf and
Schrijver [J. Comb. Theory Ser. B, 1997] together with an exponential upper
bound on the number of possible surface maps. To obtain the new upper bound we
apply tools from hyperbolic geometry, as well as operations in graph drawing
algorithms---the cluster and pipe expansions---to the study of curves on
surfaces.
</p>
<p>As corollaries, we present two efficient algorithms for curves and graphs on
surfaces. First, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to convert any given
multicurve on a surface into minimal position. Such an algorithm only existed
for single closed curves, and it is known that previous techniques do not
generalize to the multicurve case. Second, we provide a polynomial-time
algorithm to reduce any $k$-terminal plane graph (and more generally, surface
graph) using degree-1 reductions, series-parallel reductions, and $\Delta
Y$-transformations for arbitrary integer $k$. Previous algorithms only existed
in the planar setting when $k \le 4$, and all of them rely on extensive
case-by-case analysis based on different values of $k$. Our algorithm makes use
of the connection between electrical transformations and homotopy moves, and
thus solves the problem in a unified fashion.

show that NP on S-BSS machines is strictly included in NP on BSS machines and
that every NP language on S-BSS machines is a countable union of closed sets in
the usual topology of R^n. Moreover, we establish that on Boolean inputs NP on
S-BSS machines without real constants characterises a natural fragment of the

true existential theory of the reals) and hence lies between NP and PSPACE.
Finally we apply our results to determine the data complexity of probabilistic

using $O(m)$ processors. The time bound holds with good probability. Our
algorithm is based on the breakthrough results of Andoni et al. [FOCS'18] and
Behnezhad et al. [FOCS'19]. Their algorithms run on the more powerful MPC model
and rely on sorting and computing prefix sums in $O(1)$ time, tasks that take
$\Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$ time on a CRCW PRAM with $\text{poly}(n)$
processors. Our simpler algorithm uses limited-collision hashing and does not
sort or do prefix sums. It matches the time and space bounds of the algorithm
of Behnezhad et al., who improved the time bound of Andoni et al. It is widely
believed that the larger private memory per processor and unbounded local
computation of the MPC model admit algorithms faster than that on a PRAM. Our
result suggests that such additional power might not be necessary, at least for
fundamental graph problems like connected components and spanning forest.

of subdivisions of triconnected plane graphs and claimed that every planar
greedy drawing of the graphs in $\mathcal H$ respecting the prescribed plane
embedding requires exponential area. However, we show that every $n$-vertex

prescribed plane embedding on an $O(n)\times O(n)$ grid. This reopens the
question whether triconnected planar graphs admit planar greedy drawings on a

above question by proving that every $n$-vertex Halin graph admits a planar
greedy drawing on an $O(n)\times O(n)$ grid. Both such results are obtained by
actually constructing drawings that are convex and angle-monotone. Finally, we
show that there exist planar triangulations for which every $\alpha$-Schnyder
drawing with a fixed $\alpha&lt;60^\circ$ requires exponential area for any
resolution rule.

position. We present an efficient algorithm for finding all the vertices of the
arrangement $A(L)$ of maximum level, where the level of a vertex $v$ is the
number of lines of $L$ that pass strictly below $v$. The problem, posed in
Exercise~8.13 in de Berg etal [BCKO08], appears to be much harder than it
seems, as this vertex might not be on the upper envelope of the lines.
</p>
<p>We first assume that all the lines of $L$ are distinct, and distinguish
between two cases, depending on whether or not the upper envelope of $L$
contains a bounded edge. In the former case, we show that the number of lines
of $L$ that pass above any maximum level vertex $v_0$ is only $O(\log n)$. In
the latter case, we establish a similar property that holds after we remove
some of the lines that are incident to the single vertex of the upper envelope.
We present algorithms that run, in both cases, in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time.
</p>
<p>We then consider the case where the lines of $L$ are not necessarily
distinct. This setup is more challenging, and the best we have is an algorithm
that computes all the maximum-level vertices in time $O(n^{4/3}\log^{3}n)$.
</p>
<p>Finally, we consider a related combinatorial question for degenerate
arrangements, where many lines may intersect in a single point, but all the
lines are distinct: We bound the complexity of the weighted $k$-level in such
an arrangement, where the weight of a vertex is the number of lines that pass
through the vertex. We show that the bound in this case is $O(n^{4/3})$, which
matches the corresponding bound for non-degenerate arrangements, and we use
this bound in the analysis of one of our algorithms.

CONGEST distributed model. In this setting we test whether the distributive
network, $G_U$, is isomorphic to $G_K$ which is given as an input to all the
nodes in the network, or alternatively, only to a single node.
</p>
<p>We first consider the decision variant of the problem in which the algorithm
distinguishes $G_U$ and $G_K$ which are isomorphic from $G_U$ and $G_K$ which
are not isomorphic. We provide a randomized algorithm with $O(n)$ rounds for
the setting in which $G_K$ is given only to a single node. We prove that for
this setting the number of rounds of any deterministic algorithm is
$\tilde{\Omega}(n^2)$ rounds, where $n$ denotes the number of nodes, which
implies a separation between the randomized and the deterministic complexities
of deciding GI.
</p>
<p>We then consider the \emph{property testing} variant of the problem, where
the algorithm is only required to distinguish the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are
isomorphic from the case that $G_U$ and $G_K$ are \emph{far} from being
isomorphic (according to some predetermined distance measure). We show that
every algorithm requires $\Omega(D)$ rounds, where $D$ denotes the diameter of
the network. This lower bound holds even if all the nodes are given $G_K$ as an
input, and even if the message size is unbounded. We provide a randomized
algorithm with an almost matching round complexity of $O(D+(\epsilon^{-1}\log
n)^2)$ rounds that is suitable for dense graphs.
</p>
<p>We also show that with the same number of rounds it is possible that each
node outputs its mapping according to a bijection which is an
\emph{approximated} isomorphism.
</p>
<p>We conclude with simple simulation arguments that allow us to obtain
essentially tight algorithms with round complexity $\tilde{O}(D)$ for special
families of sparse graphs.

First, for any fixed field

approximations in $\mathbb{Q}$ with bit-length $\log^{O(1)}(dH)$ to all the

on objects within the same topological classes, e.g., scalar functions,
Euclidean curves, or surfaces, etc. For objects that differ in more complex
ways, the current literature offers only topological methods. This paper
introduces a far-reaching geometric approach for analyzing shapes of graphical
objects, such as road networks, blood vessels, brain fiber tracts, etc. It
represents such objects, exhibiting differences in both geometries and
topologies, as graphs made of curves with arbitrary shapes (edges) and
connected at arbitrary junctions (nodes). To perform statistical analyses, one
needs mathematical representations, metrics and other geometrical tools, such
as geodesics, means, and covariances. This paper utilizes a quotient structure
to develop efficient algorithms for computing these quantities, leading to
useful statistical tools, including principal component analysis and analytical
statistical testing and modeling of graphical shapes. The efficacy of this
framework is demonstrated using various simulated as well as the real data from
neurons and brain arterial networks.

as an efficient strategy for space partitioning tasks. Because it uses more
than one dimension to partition the space, the BSP-Tree Process is more
efficient and flexible than conventional axis-aligned cutting strategies.
However, due to its batch learning setting, it is not well suited to
large-scale classification and regression problems. In this paper, we develop
an online BSP-Forest framework to address this limitation. With the arrival of
new data, the resulting online algorithm can simultaneously expand the space
coverage and refine the partition structure, with guaranteed universal
consistency for both classification and regression problems. The effectiveness
and competitive performance of the online BSP-Forest is verified via
simulations on real-world datasets.

points and ranges may be inserted or deleted, and we want to efficiently
maintain an (approximately) optimal solution for the current problem instance.
While their static versions have been extensively studied in the past,
surprisingly little is known about dynamic geometric set cover and hitting set.
For instance, even for the most basic case of one-dimensional interval set
cover and hitting set, no nontrivial results were known. The main contribution
of our paper are two frameworks that lead to efficient data structures for
dynamically maintaining set covers and hitting sets in $\mathbb{R}^1$ and
$\mathbb{R}^2$. The first framework uses bootstrapping and gives a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate data structure for dynamic interval set cover in
$\mathbb{R}^1$ with $O(n^\alpha/\varepsilon)$ amortized update time for any
constant $\alpha &gt; 0$; in $\mathbb{R}^2$, this method gives $O(1)$-approximate
data structures for unit-square (and quadrant) set cover and hitting set with
$O(n^{1/2+\alpha})$ amortized update time. The second framework uses local
modification, and leads to a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate data structure for
dynamic interval hitting set in $\mathbb{R}^1$ with
$\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ amortized update time; in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it
gives $O(1)$-approximate data structures for unit-square (and quadrant) set
cover and hitting set in the \textit{partially} dynamic settings with
$\widetilde{O}(1)$ amortized update time.

between processors over a network - is a key component of performance
optimization (in both time and energy) for many problems, including dense
linear algebra, particle interactions, and machine learning. For these
problems, which can be represented as nested-loop computations, previous tiling
based approaches have been used to find both lower bounds on the communication
required to execute them and optimal rearrangements, or blockings, to attain
such lower bounds. However, such general approaches have typically assumed the
problem sizes are large, an assumption that is often not met in practice. For
instance, the classical $(\text{# arithmetic operations})/(\text{cache
size})^{1/2}$ lower bound for matrix multiplication is not tight for
matrix-vector multiplications, which must read in at least $O(\text{#
arithmetic operations})$ words of memory; similar issues occur for almost all
convolutions in machine learning applications, which use extremely small filter
sizes (and therefore, loop bounds).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide an efficient way to both find and obtain, via an
appropriate, efficiently constructible blocking, communication lower bounds and
matching tilings which attain these lower bounds for nested loop programs with
arbitrary loop bounds that operate on multidimensional arrays in the projective
case, where the array indices are subsets of the loop indices. Our approach
works on all such problems, regardless of dimensionality, size, memory access
patterns, or number of arrays, and directly applies to (among other examples)
matrix multiplication and similar dense linear algebra operations, tensor
contractions, n-body pairwise interactions, pointwise convolutions, and fully
connected layers.

store designs, each optimizing for a different set of requirements.
Furthermore, with the advancements of storage technology the design space of KV
stores has become even more complex. More recent KV-store designs target fast
storage devices, such as SSDs and NVM. Most of these designs aim to reduce
amplification during data reorganization by taking advantage of device
characteristics. However, until today most analysis of KV-store designs is
experimental and limited to specific design points. This makes it difficult to
compare tradeoffs across different designs, find optimal configurations and
guide future KV-store design. In this paper, we introduce the Variable
Amplification- Throughput analysis (VAT) to calculate insert-path amplification
and its impact on multi-level KV-store performance.We use VAT to express the
behavior of several existing design points and to explore tradeoffs that are
not possible or easy to measure experimentally. VAT indicates that by inserting
randomness in the insert-path, KV stores can reduce amplification by more than
10x for fast storage devices. Techniques, such as key-value separation and
tiering compaction, reduce amplification by 10x and 5x, respectively.
Additionally, VAT predicts that the advancements in device technology towards
NVM, reduces the benefits from both using key-value separation and tiering.

distributed networks. Finding small min-cuts for a network is essential for
ensuring the quality of service and reliability. Throughout this thesis, we use
the CONGEST model which is a typical message passing model used to design and
analyze algorithms in distributed networks. We survey various algorithmic
techniques in the CONGEST model and give an overview of the recent results to
find cuts. We also describe elegant graph theoretic ideas like cut spaces and
cycle spaces that provide useful intuition upon which our work is built.
</p>
<p>Our contribution is a novel fast algorith to find small cuts. Our algorithm
relies on a new characterization of trees and cuts introduced in this thesis.
Our algorithm is built upon several new algorithmic ideas that, when coupled
with our characterization of trees and cuts, help us to find the required
min-cuts. Our novel techniques include a tree restricted semigroup function
(TRSF), a novel sketching technique, and a layered algorithm. TRSF is defined
with respect to a spanning tree and is based on a commutative semigroup. This
simple yet powerful technique helps us to deterministically find min-cuts of
size one (bridges) and min-cuts of size two optimally. Our sketching technique
samples a small but relevant vertex set which is enough to find small min-cuts
in certain cases. Our layered algorithm finds min-cuts in smaller sub-graphs
pivoted by nodes at different levels in a spanning tree and uses them to make
the decision about the min-cuts in the complete graph. This is interesting
because it enables us to show that even for a global property like finding
min-cuts, local information can be exploited in a coordinated manner.

Unfortunately, many clustering algorithms lead to cluster assignments that are
hard to explain, partially because they depend on all the features of the data
in a complicated way. To improve interpretability, we consider using a small
decision tree to partition a data set into clusters, so that clusters can be
characterized in a straightforward manner. We study this problem from a
theoretical viewpoint, measuring cluster quality by the $k$-means and
$k$-medians objectives: Must there exist a tree-induced clustering whose cost
is comparable to that of the best unconstrained clustering, and if so, how can
it be found? In terms of negative results, we show, first, that popular
top-down decision tree algorithms may lead to clusterings with arbitrarily
large cost, and second, that any tree-induced clustering must in general incur
an $\Omega(\log k)$ approximation factor compared to the optimal clustering. On
the positive side, we design an efficient algorithm that produces explainable
clusters using a tree with $k$ leaves. For two means/medians, we show that a
single threshold cut suffices to achieve a constant factor approximation, and
we give nearly-matching lower bounds. For general $k \geq 2$, our algorithm is
an $O(k)$ approximation to the optimal $k$-medians and an $O(k^2)$
approximation to the optimal $k$-means. Prior to our work, no algorithms were
known with provable guarantees independent of dimension and input size.

<p>At least there’s that: I live in a world where some people care about it and publish their <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/3/243024-conferences-in-an-era-of-expensive-carbon/abstract">viewpoint in the latest CACM</a>. Read it on your next flight.  Some interesting things that won’t shock anyone:</p>



<p>There’s a nice picture with different environmental costs based on the location of the conference.  It also shows that people like to go to nearby conferences, one of the reasons why “The impulse to ignore the issue is entirely understandable.”  For more perspective see some of our earlier posts for example <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/working-remotely-will-be-the-most-significant-transformation-since-agriculture/">here</a> and <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/01/01/publish-and-perish/">here</a>.</p>



<p>The viewpoint also reports on a recent switch from in-person to online program committees for flagship conferences (POPL and ICFP), following a recent trend.  For starters we continue to suggest that <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/stocfocs-pc-meetings-does-nature-of-decisions-justify-cost/">STOC and FOCS do the same, because the nature of decisions does not justify the cost.</a> The latter post also includes hard numbers on the added value of a physical meeting (with respect to accept/reject decisions — of course one can value at infinity meeting in person luminaries in your field, but that can be done in other ways and should not be tied to PC meetings).</p>

<br />
(I injured my hand about a month ago so I have had a hard time typing. That is why<br />
I have not blogged for a while. I'm better now but still slow. This is a post I prepared<br />
a while back.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of English and logic for your discrete math class. Or for mine anyway.<br />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
1) <i>A computer programmer leaves work and heads for home. Being the good spouse that he is, he calls  his partner and asks if there's anything that needs to be picked up on the way.</i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<i>Yes, a gallon of milk and, oh, if they have <span class="il">eggs</span>, get a dozen.</i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<i>Later he arrives home and stumbles into the kitchen burdened with a dozen gallons of milk. His partner  perplexed, asks him ``why in the world did you buy 12 gallons of milk?''</i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<i>What did he answer?</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
When I told this to my class one student said that he should answer:</div>
<div>
<br />
                                                      <i>I love you too Darling</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
while that is always a good thing to tell Darling, it is not the answer I had in mind.<br />
<br /></div>
<div>
The  answer is  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/eggs.txt">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
2) I saw a headline:</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
                                                 <i> Rise in faux-incest porn alarming</i></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Give two different interpretations of this sentence. (Note- One you might agree with, the other you will likely disagree with.)<br />
<br />
My answer is  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/faux.txt">here</a></div>
<div>
<br />
3) Recently someone was describing what I work on to someone else and he said the following wonderfully ambiguous sentence<br />
<br />
                           <i>Bill works on puzzles and games. He also work on cake cutting, to be fair.</i><br />
<br />
Give two different interpretations of this sentence.  My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/billcake.txt">here</a><br />
<br />
<br />
4) A common saying is<br />
<br />
                          <i> All that glitters is not gold</i><br />
<br />
What does this mean literally? What did they really mean to say? My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/gold.txt">here.</a><br />
<br />
(I had originally thought this was a quote from the Led Zeppelin song <i>Stairway to Heaven</i>;<br />
however, an astute reader left a comment reminding me that, in that song, they actually<br />
say that there is a lady who believes <i>All that Glitters is Gold. </i>The song implies that she is incorrect, so really<br />
NOT(All that Glitters is Gold) which means (exists x)[x glitters but x is not gold] which actually<br />
IS what they meant to say. Yeah!)<br />
<br />
5)When the chess player Bobby Fisher died I saw in one article about him the sentence<br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>                                Bobby Fisher was a terrible anti-semite.</i><br />
<br />
<i></i>This can be interpreted two ways. What are they? Which one did the writer probably mean? My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fisher.txt">here</a><br />
<br />
6) When Donald Trump broke the Nuclear Treaty with Iran he said<br />
<br />
                             <i> Iran is the worse enabler of terrorist in the mideast</i><br />
<br />
This can be interpreted two ways. What are they? Which one did Trump mean? My answer is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/iran.txt">here.</a><br />
<br /></div>
<div>
<br />
7) I saw the headline (see <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2019/12/31/1905544/-There-was-actually-good-news-in-the-War-on-Women-in-2019-news-we-have-to-build-on-in-2020">here</a>)<br />
<br />
<i>There was actually good news in the War on Women in 2019, news we have to build on in 2020</i>.<br />
<br />
This can be interepreted in two ways. This one I leave to you, or read the article.<br />

($\mathsf{HPC}^4$), and using it, give strong multi-pass lower bounds for graph
problems in the streaming model of computation and a lower bound on the query
complexity of sub-modular minimization. We present a two-player version
($\mathsf{HPC}^2$) of $\mathsf{HPC}^4$ that has matching communication
complexity to $\mathsf{HPC}^4$. Our formulation allows us to lower bound its
communication complexity with a simple direct-sum argument. Using this lower
bound on the communication complexity of $\mathsf{HPC}^2$, we retain the
streaming and query complexity lower bounds by (Assadi, Chen, and Khanna,
2019).
</p>
<p>Further, by giving reductions from $\mathsf{HPC}^2$, we prove new multi-pass
space lower bounds for graph problems in turnstile streams. In particular, we
show that any algorithm which computes the exact weight of the maximum weighted
matching in an $n$-vertex graph requires $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ space unless it
makes $\omega(\log n)$ passes over the turnstile stream, and that any algorithm
which computes the minimum $s\text{-}t$ distance in an $n$-vertex graph
requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ space unless it makes $n^{\Omega(1)}$ passes over the
turnstile stream. Our reductions can be modified to use $\mathsf{HPC}^4$ as
well.

Hoban</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12814">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>The decision problem version of estimating the Shannon entropy is the Entropy
Difference problem (ED): given descriptions of two circuits, determine which
circuit produces more entropy in its output when acting on a uniformly random
input. The analogous problem with quantum circuits (QED) is to determine which
circuit produces the state with greater von Neumann entropy, when acting on a
fixed input state and after tracing out part of the output. Based on plausible
complexity-theoretic assumptions, both of these problems are believed to be
intractable for polynomial-time quantum computation. In this paper, we
investigate the hardness of these problems in the case where the input circuits
have logarithmic and constant depth, respectively. We show that, relative to an
oracle, these problems cannot be as hard as their counterparts with
polynomial-size circuits. Furthermore, we show that if a certain type of
reduction from QED to the log-depth version exists, it implies that any
polynomial-time quantum computation can be performed in log depth. While this
suggests that having shallow circuits makes entropy estimation easier, we give
indication that the problem remains intractable for polynomial-time quantum
computation by proving a reduction from Learning-With-Errors (LWE) to
constant-depth ED. We then consider a potential application of our results to
quantum gravity research. First, we introduce a Hamiltonian version of QED
where one is given two local Hamiltonians and asked to estimate the
entanglement entropy difference in their ground states. We show that this
problem is at least as hard as the circuit version and then discuss a potential
experiment that would make use of the AdS/CFT correspondence to solve LWE
efficiently. We conjecture that unless the AdS/CFT bulk to boundary map is
exponentially complex, this experiment would violate the intractability
assumption of LWE.

and exact-size generation of large random combinatorial structures, such as
context-free words, various tree-like data structures, maps, tilings, or even
RNA sequences. In their multi-parametric variants, combinatorial samplers are
adapted to combinatorial specifications with additional parameters, allowing
for a more flexible control over the output profile of parametrised
combinatorial patterns. One can control, for instance, the number of leaves,
profile of node degrees in trees or the number of certain sub-patterns in
generated strings. However, such a flexible control requires an additional and
nontrivial tuning procedure.
</p>
<p>Using techniques of convex optimisation, we present an efficient polynomial
tuning algorithm for multi-parametric combinatorial specifications. For a given
combinatorial system of description length $L$ with $d$ tuning parameters and
target size parameter value $n$, our algorithm runs in time $O(d^{3.5} L \log
n)$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a series of practical
examples, including rational, algebraic, and so-called P\'olya specifications.
We show how our method can be adapted to a broad range of less typical
combinatorial constructions, including symmetric polynomials, labelled sets and
cycles with cardinality lower bounds, simple increasing trees or substitutions.
Finally, we discuss some practical aspects of our prototype tuner
implementation and provide its benchmark results.

find a bipartition of the vertex set into two sets whose sizes differ by at
most one, such that the total weight of edges between the two sets is
maximized/minimized. Although these two problems are known to be NP-hard, there
is an efficient algorithm for bounded-treewidth graphs. In particular, Jansen
et al. (SIAM J. Comput. 2005) gave an $O(2^tn^3)$-time algorithm when given a
tree decomposition of width $t$ of the input graph, where $n$ is the number of
vertices of the input graph. Eiben et al. (ESA 2019) improved the running time
to $O(8^tt^5n^2\log n)$. Moreover, they showed that there is no
$O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$-time algorithm for trees under some reasonable
complexity assumption.

<p>In this paper, we show an $O(2^t(tn)^2)$-time algorithm for both problems,
which is asymptotically tight to their conditional lower bound. We also show
that the exponential dependency of the treewidth is asymptotically optimal
under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Moreover, we discuss the
(in)tractability of both problems with respect to special graph classes.

a digraph, $\gamma$ is a function on $V(G)$ that tells us the timestamps when a
vertex is active, and $\lambda$ is a function on $E(G)$ that tells for each $uv
\in E(G)$ when $u$ and $v$ are linked. Given a static digraph $G$, and a subset
$R\subseteq V(G)$, a spanning branching with root $R$ is a subdigraph of $G$
that has exactly one path from $R$ to each $v\in V(G)$. In this paper, we
consider the temporal version of Edmonds' classical result about the problem of
finding $k$ edge-disjoint spanning branchings respectively rooted at given
$R_1,\cdots,R_k$. We introduce and investigate different definitions of
spanning branchings, and of edge-disjointness in the context of temporal
graphs. A branching ${\cal B}$ is vertex-spanning if the root is able to reach
each vertex $v$ of $G$ at some time where $v$ is active, while it is
temporal-spanning if $v$ can be reached from the root at every time where $v$
is active. On the other hand, two branchings ${\cal B}_1$ and ${\cal B}_2$ are
edge-disjoint if they do not use the same edge of $G$, and are
temporal-edge-disjoint if they can use the same edge of $G$ but at different
times. This lead us to four definitions of disjoint spanning branchings and we
prove that, unlike the static case, only one of these can be computed in
polynomial time, namely the temporal-edge-disjoint temporal-spanning branchings
problem, while the other versions are $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even under very
strict assumptions.

quickly determine that whether their earth mover's distance (EMD) is larger or
smaller than a pre-specified threshold $T\geq 0$. The problem finds a number of
important applications in the fields of machine learning and data mining. In
particular, we assume that the dimensionality $d$ is not fixed and the sizes
$|A|$ and $|B|$ are large. Therefore, most of existing EMD algorithms are not
quite efficient to solve this problem. Here, we consider the problem under the
assumption that $A$ and $B$ have low doubling dimension, which is common for
high-dimensional data in real world. Inspired by the geometric method {\em net

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p class="justify-text">This month, I will follow up on <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">last month’s blog post</a>, and describe classical techniques from numerical analysis that aim at accelerating the convergence of a vector sequence to its limit, by only combining elements of the sequence, and without the detailed knowledge of the iterative process that has led to this sequence. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Last month, I focused on sequences that converge to their limit exponentially fast (which is referred to as <em>linear</em> convergence), and I described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitken%27s_delta-squared_process">Aitken’s \(\Delta^2\) method</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanks_transformation">Shanks transformation</a>, Anderson acceleration and its <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04133">regularized version</a>. These methods are called “non-linear” acceleration techniques, because, although they combine linearly iterates as \(c_0 x_k + c_1 x_{k+1} + \cdots + c_m x_{k+m}\), the scalar weights in the linear combination depend non-linearly on \(x_k,\dots,x_{k+m}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will focus on sequences that converge sublinearly, that is, with a difference to their limit that goes to zero as an inverse power of \(k\), typically in \(O(1/k)\). </p>



<h2>Richardson extrapolation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider a sequence \((x_k)_{k \geq 0} \in \mathbb{R}^d\), with an asymptotic expansion of the form $$ x_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k}\Delta + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big), $$ where \(x_\ast \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is the limit of \((x_k)_k\) and \(\Delta\) a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The idea behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_extrapolation">Richardson extrapolation</a> [<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.1911.0009">1</a>] is to combine linearly two iterates taken at two different values of \(k\) so that the zero-th order term \(x_\ast\) is left unchanged, but the first order term in \(1/k\) cancels out. For \(k\) even, we can consider $$  2 x_k – x_{k/2} =  2 \Big( x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta  +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big)  \Big) \, – \Big( x_\ast +  \frac{2}{k} \Delta  + O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big) \Big)  =  x_\ast +O\Big(\frac{1}{k^2}\Big).$$</p>

<p class="justify-text">The key benefit of Richardson extrapolation is that we only need to know that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion is proportional to \(1/k\), <em>without the need to know the vector \(\Delta\)</em>. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/richardson_2d.gif" alt="" width="332" class="wp-image-2481" height="280" />Richardson extrapolation in two dimensions. The sequence is of the form \(x_k = \frac{1}{k} \Delta_1 + \frac{(-1)^k}{k^2} \Delta_2\). The extrapolated sequence \(2 x_k – x_{k/2}\) is only plotted for \(k\) even.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, following [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], I will explore situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful within machine learning. I identified three situations where Richardson extrapolation can be useful (there are probably more):</p>



<ol class="justify-text"><li>Iterates of an optimization algorithms \((x_k)_{k \geq 0}\), and the extrapolation is \( 2x_k – x_{k/2}.\)</li><li>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent, where we will combine iterates obtained from two different values of the step-size.</li><li>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter.</li></ol>



<p class="justify-text">As we will show, extrapolation techniques come with no significant loss in performance, but in several situations strong gains. It is thus “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">unreasonably effective</a>“.</p>

<p class="justify-text">We consider an iterate \(x_k\) of an iterative optimization algorithm which is minimizing a function \(f\), thus converging to a global minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(f\). Then so is \(x_{k/2}\), and thus also $$  x_k^{(1)} = 2x_k – x_{k/2}.$$ Therefore, performance is never significantly deteriorated (the risk is essentially to lose half of the iterations). The potential gains depend on the way \(x_k\) converges to \(x_\ast\). The existence of a convergence rate of the form \(f(x_k) -f(x_\ast) = O(1/k)\) or \(O(1/k^2)\) is not enough, as Richardson extrapolation requires a specific direction of asymptotic convergence. As illustrated below, some algorithms are oscillating around their solutions, while some converge with a specific direction. Only the latter ones can be accelerated with Richardson extrapolation, while the former ones are good candidates for <a href="https://francisbach.com/acceleration-without-pain/">Anderson acceleration</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nonoscillating_oscillating-1024x350.png" alt="" width="476" class="wp-image-2395" height="162" /> Left: Oscillating convergence, where Richardson extrapolation does not lead to any gain. Right: non-oscillating  convergence, with a main direction \(\Delta\) (in red dotted), where Richardson extrapolation can be beneficial if the oscillations orthogonal to the direction \(\Delta\) are negligible compared to convergence along the direction \(\Delta\). </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Averaged gradient descent.</strong> We consider the usual gradient descent algorithm $$x_k = x_{k-1} – \gamma f'(x_{k-1}),$$ where \(\gamma &gt; 0 \) is a step-size, with Polyak-Ruppert averaging [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>]: $$ y_k = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i.$$ Averaging is key to robustness to potential noise in the gradients [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0330046">4</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070704277">5</a>]. However it comes with the unintended consequence of losing the exponential forgetting of initial conditions for strongly-convex problems [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4316-non-asymptotic-analysis-of-stochastic-approximation-algorithms-for-machine-learning.pdf">6</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">A common way to restore exponential convergence (up to the noise level in the stochastic case) is to consider “tail-averaging”, that is, to replace \(y_k\) by the average of only the latest \(k/2\) iterates [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/16-595/16-595.pdf">7</a>]. As shown below for \(k\) even, this corresponds exactly to Richardson extrapolation on the sequence \((y_k)_k\): $$ \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=k/2}^{k-1} x_i = \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} x_i – \frac{2}{k} \sum_{i=0}^{k/2-1} x_i = 2 y_k – y_{k/2}. $$</p>



<p class="justify-text">With basic  assumptions on \(f\), it is shown in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>] that for locally strongly-convex problems: $$y_k = x_\ast + \frac{1}{k} \Delta + O(\rho^k), $$ where  \(\displaystyle \Delta = \sum_{i=0}^\infty (x_i – x_\ast)\) and \(\rho \in (0,1)\) depends on the condition number of \(f”(x_\ast)\). This is illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/averaged_gradient.png" alt="" width="342" class="wp-image-2507" height="250" />Averaged gradient descent on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic regression</a> problem in dimension \(d=400\), and with \(n=4000\) observations.

See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We can make the following observations:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Before Richardson extrapolation, the asymptotic convergence rate after averaging is of order \(O(1/k^2)\), which is better than the usual \(O(1/k)\) upper-bound for the rate of gradient descent, but with a stronger assumption that in fact leads to exponential convergence before averaging.</li><li>While \(\Delta\) has a simple expression, it cannot be computed in practice (but Richardson extrapolation does not need to know it).</li><li>Richardson extrapolation leads to an exponentially convergent algorithm from an algorithm converging asymptotically in \(O(1/k^2)\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Accelerated gradient descent.</strong> Above, we considered averaged gradient descent, which is asymptotically converging as \(O(1/k^2)\), and on which Richardson extrapolation could be used with strong gains. Is it possible also for the accelerated gradient descent method [<a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/php/getFT.phtml?jrnid=dan&amp;paperid=46009&amp;what=fullt&amp;option_lang=eng">8</a>], which has a (non-asymptotic) convergence rate of \(O(1/k^2)\) for convex functions?</p>



<p class="justify-text">It turns out that the behavior of the iterates of accelerated gradient descent is exactly of the form depicted in the left plot of the figure above: that is, the iterates \(x_k\) oscillate around the optimum [<a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-084/15-084.pdf">9</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v40/Flammarion15.pdf">10</a>], and Richardson extrapolation is of no help, but is not degrading performance too much. See below for an illustration. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/accelerated_gradient.png" alt="" width="332" class="wp-image-2509" height="243" />Accelerated gradient descent on a quadratic optimization problem in dimension \(d=1000\). See experimental details in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>].  </figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other algorithms.</strong> It is tempting to test it on other optimization algorithms. For example, as explained in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>], Richardson extrapolation can be used to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe</a> algorithm, where sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. Others could be tried.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on the step-size of stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While above we have focused on Richardson extrapolation applied to the number of iterations of an iterative algorithm, it is most often used in integration methods (for computing integrals or solving ordinary differential equations), and then often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romberg%27s_method">Romberg-Richardson extrapolation</a>. Within machine learning, in a similar spirit, this can be applied to the step-size of stochastic gradient descent [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6514-stochastic-gradient-richardson-romberg-markov-chain-monte-carlo.pdf">11</a>], which I now describe.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the minimization of a function \(F(x)\) defined on \(\mathbb{R}^d\), which can be written as an expectation as $$F(x) = \mathbb{E}_{z} f(x,z).$$ We assume that we have access to \(n\) independent and identically distributed observations (i.i.d.) \(z_1,\dots,z_n\). This is a typical scenario in machine learning, where \(f(x,z)\) represents the loss for the predictor parameterized by \(x\) on the observation \(z\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">The stochastic gradient method is particularly well adapted, and we consider here a single pass, as $$x_i= x_{i-1} – \gamma f'(x_{i-1},z_i),$$ where the gradient is taken with respect to the first variable, for \(i = 1,\dots,n\). It is known that with a constant step-size, when \(n\) tends to infinity, \(x_n\) will <em>not</em> converge to the minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\), as the algorithm always moves [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/0324039">16</a>], as illustrated below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/logistic_2d-1.gif" alt="" width="403" class="wp-image-2488" height="279" />Stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem: (blue) without averaging, (red) with averaging.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">One way to damp the oscillations is to consider averaging, that is, $$ y_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \sum_{i=0}^{n} x_i$$ (we consider uniform averaging for simplicity). For least-squares regression, this leads to a converging algorithm [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">12</a>] with attractive properties for ill-conditioned problems (see also <a href="https://francisbach.com/the-sum-of-a-geometric-series-is-all-you-need/">January’s blog post</a>). However, for general loss functions, it is shown in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>] that \(y_n\) converges to some \(y^{(\gamma)} \neq x_\ast\). There is a bias due to a step-size \(\gamma\) that does not go to zero. In order to apply Richardson extrapolation, together with Aymeric Dieuleveut and Alain Durmus [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">3</a>], we showed that $$ y^{(\gamma)} = x_\ast + \gamma \Delta + O(\gamma^2),$$ for some \(\Delta \in \mathbb{R}^d\) with some complex expression. Thus, we have $$2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2),$$ thus gaining one order. If we consider the iterate \(y_n^{(\gamma)}\) and \(y_n^{(2 \gamma)}\) associated to the two step-sizes \(\gamma\) and \(2 \gamma\), the linear combination $$2 y_n^{(\gamma)} – y_n^{(2\gamma)} $$ has an improved behavior as it tends to \(2 y^{(\gamma)} – y^{(2\gamma)} = x_\ast + O(\gamma^2)\): it remains not convergent, but get to way smaller values. See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SGD_logistic-1.png" alt="" width="359" class="wp-image-2525" height="274" />Averaged stochastic gradient descent on a logistic regression problem in dimension 20.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Higher-order extrapolation.</strong> If we can accelerate a sequence by extrapolation, why not extrapolate the extrapolated sequence? This is possible if we have an higher-order expansion of the form $$ y^{(\gamma)} = \theta_\ast + \gamma \Delta_1 + \gamma^2 \Delta_2 + O(\gamma^3),$$ for some (typically unknown) vectors \(\Delta_1\) and \(\Delta_2\). Then, the sharp reader can check that $$3 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 3 y_n^{(2\gamma)} +  y_n^{(3\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first two orders \(\gamma\) and \(\gamma^2\). This is illustrated above for SGD.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not extrapolate the extrapolation of the extrapolated sequence? One can check that $$4 y_n^{(\gamma)} – 6 y_n^{(2\gamma)} + 4  y_n^{(3\gamma)}  -y_n^{(4\gamma)}, $$ will lead to cancellation of the first three orders of an expansion of \(y^{(\gamma)}\). The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient">binomial coefficient</a> aficionados have already noticed the pattern there, and checked that $$ \sum_{i=1}^{m+1} (-1)^{i-1} { m+1 \choose i} y_n^{(i\gamma)}$$ will lead to cancellations of the first \(m\) orders.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, why not go on forever? First because \(m+1\) recursions have to be run in parallel, and second, because the constant in front of the term in \(\gamma^{m+1}\) typically explodes, a phenomenon common to many expansion methods.</p>



<h2>Extrapolation on a regularization parameter</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We now explore the application of Richardson extrapolation to regularization methods. In a nutshell, regularization allows to make an estimation problem more stable (less subject to variations for statistical problems) or the algorithm faster (for optimization problems). However, regularization adds a bias that needs to be removed. In this section, we apply Richardson extrapolation to the regularization parameter to reduce this bias. I will only present an application to smoothing for non-smooth optimization (see an application to  ridge regression in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02470950/document">2</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-smooth optimization problems</strong>. We consider the minimization of a convex function of the form \(f = h + g\), where \(h\) is smooth and \(g\) is non-smooth. These optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing, where the lack of smoothness can come from (a) non-smooth losses such as max-margin losses used in support vector machines and more generally structured output classification [<a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2005/proceedings/papers/113_StructuredPrediction_TaskarEtAl.pdf">13</a>], and (b) sparsity-inducing regularizers (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">14</a>] and references therein). While many algorithms can be used to deal with this non-smoothness, we consider a classical smoothing technique below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Nesterov smoothing</strong>. In this section, we consider the smoothing approach of Nesterov [<a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A_Files/Nesterov-2005.pdf">15</a>] where the non-smooth term is “smoothed” into \(g_\lambda\), where \(\lambda\) is a regularization parameter, and accelerated gradient descent is used to minimize \(h+g_\lambda\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">A typical way of smoothing the function \(g\) is to add \(\lambda\) times a strongly convex regularizer (such as the squared Euclidean norm) to the Fenchel conjugate of \(g\); this leads to a function \(g_\lambda\) which has a smoothness constant (defined as the maximum of the largest eigenvalues of all Hessians) proportional to \(1/\lambda\), with a uniform error of \(O(\lambda)\) between \(g\) and \(g_\lambda\). Given that accelerated gradient descent leads to an iterate with excess function values proportional to \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) after \(k\) iterations, with the choice of \(\lambda \propto 1/k\), this leads to an excess in function values proportional to \(1/k\), which improves on the subgradient method which converges in \(O(1/\sqrt{k})\). Note that the amount of regularization depends on the number of iterations, so that this smoothing method is not “anytime”.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Richardson extrapolation.</strong> If we denote by \(x_\lambda\) the minimizer of \(h+g_\lambda\) and \( x_\ast\) the global minimizer of \( f=h+g\), if we can show that \( x_\lambda = x_\ast + \lambda \Delta + O(\lambda^2)\), then \( x^{(1)}_\lambda = 2 x_\lambda – x_{2\lambda} = O(\lambda^2)\) and we can expand \( f(x_\lambda^{(1)})  = f(x_\ast)  + O(\lambda^2)\), which is better than the \(O(\lambda)\) approximation without extrapolation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Then, given a number of iterations \(k\), with \( \lambda \propto k^{-2/3}\), to balance the two terms \( 1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \( \lambda^2\),  we get an overall convergence rate for the non-smooth problem of \( k^{-4/3}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>\(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation</strong>. Like above for the step-size, we can also consider \(m\)-step Richardson extrapolation \(x_{\lambda}^{(m)}\), which leads to a bias proportional to \(\lambda^{m+1}\). Thus, if we consider \(\lambda \propto 1/k^{2/(m+2)}\), to balance the terms \(1/(\lambda k^2)\) and \(\lambda^{m+1}\), we get an error for the non-smooth problem of \(1/k^{2(m+1)/(m+2)}\), which can get arbitrarily close to \(1/k^2\) when \(m\) gets large. The downsides (like for the extrapolation on the step-size above) are that (a) the constants in front of the asymptotic equivalent may blow up (a classical problem in high-order expansions), and (b) \(m\)-step extrapolation requires running the algorithm \(m\) times (this can be down in parallel). In the experiment below, 3-step extrapolation already brings in most of the benefits.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to experimentally study the benefits of extrapolation, for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)">Lasso</a> optimization problem, and for a series of regularization parameters equal to \(2^{i}\) for \(i\) between \(-18\) and \(1\) (sampled every \(1/5\)), we run accelerated gradient descent on \(h+g_\lambda\) and we plot the value of \(f(x)-f(x_\ast)\) for the various estimates, where for each number of iterations, we minimize over the regularization parameter. This is an oracle version of varying \(\lambda\) as a function of the number of iterations. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">These last two blog posts were dedicated to acceleration techniques coming from numerical analysis. They are cheap to implement, typically do not interfere with the underlying algorithm, and when used in the appropriate situation, can bring in significant speed-ups.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will most probably host an invited post by my colleague <a href="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/">Adrien Taylor</a>, who will explain how machines can <s>replace</s> help researchers that prove bounds on optimization algorithms.</p>

This leads to a notion of a dual, which usually does not come from a graph, with an interesting operation of “exploding” edges dual to edge deletion.</p>

    <p>My graph algorithm lectures on stable matching have shifted their terminology and metaphors to stable matching from stable marriage (outdated, sexist, heteronormative, potentially offensive, and not a good fit for the applications) but so far Wikipedia hasn’t. Maybe the ngram below explains why: there’s a base level of colloquial usage of “stable marriage” masking the popularity of “matching” in technical usage. Google Scholar shows a clearer picture: 3940 hits for “stable matching” since 2016, 2710 for “stable marriage”. (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103717212351898100"></a>).</p>

    <p>You can encode complex numbers as pairs of real numbers, their real and imaginary parts, and perform complex arithmetic using only real-number operations. But can you go the other way, and encode real numbers somehow using complex arithmetic? <a href="http://jdh.hamkins.org/the-real-numbers-are-not-interpretable-in-the-complex-field/">Joel David Hamkins gives a simple proof of the folklore result that the answer is no</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103738094179310308"></a>).

<p>Today, as the world braces for the possibility of losing millions of lives to the new coronavirus—to the <em>hunger for pangolin meat</em>, of all things (combined with the evisceration of competent public health agencies like the CDC)—we also mourn the loss of two incredibly special lives, those of Freeman Dyson (age 96) and Boris Tsirelson (age 69).</p>



<p>Freeman Dyson was sufficiently legendary, both within and beyond the worlds of math and physics, that there’s very little I can add to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/science/freeman-dyson-dead.html">what’s been said</a>.  It seemed like he was immortal, although I’d heard from mutual friends that his health was failing over the past year.  When I spent a year as a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study, in 2004-5, I often sat across from Dyson in the common room, while he drank tea and read the news.  That I never once struck up a conversation with him is a regret that I’ll now carry with me forever.</p>



<p>My only exchange with Dyson came when he gave a lecture at UC Berkeley, about how life might persist infinitely far into the future, even after the last stars had burnt out, by feeding off steadily dimishing negentropy flows in the nearly-thermal radiation.  During the Q&amp;A, I challenged Dyson that his proposal seemed to assume an analog model of computation.  But, I asked, once we took on board the quantum-gravity insights of Jacob Bekenstein and others, suggesting that nature behaves like a (quantum) digital computer at the Planck scale, with at most ~10<sup>43</sup> operations per second and ~10<sup>69</sup> qubits per square meter and so forth, wasn’t this sort of proposal ruled out?  “I’m not going to argue with you,” was Dyson’s response.  Yes, he’d assumed an analog computational model; if computation was digital then that surely changed the picture.</p>



<p>Sometimes—and not just with his climate skepticism, but also (e.g.) with his idea that general relativity and quantum mechanics <em>didn’t need to be reconciled</em>, that it was totally fine for the deepest layer of reality to be a patchwork of inconsistent theories—Dyson’s views struck me as not merely contrarian but as a high-level form of trolling.  Even so, Dyson’s book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disturbing-Universe-Sloan-Foundation-Science/dp/0465016774">Disturbing the Universe</a></em> had had a major impact on me as a teenager, for the sparkling prose as much as for the ideas.</p>



<p>With Dyson’s passing, the scientific world has lost one of its last direct links to a heroic era, of Einstein and Oppenheimer and von Neumann and a young Richard Feynman, when theoretical physics stood at the helm of civilization like never before or since.  Dyson, who apparently remained not only lucid but <em>mathematically powerful</em> (!) well into his last year, clearly remembered when the Golden Age of science fiction looked like simply sober forecasting; when the smartest young people, rather than denouncing each other on Twitter, dreamed of scouting the solar system in thermonuclear-explosion-powered spacecraft and seriously worked to make that happen.</p>



<p>Boris Tsirelson (<a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~tsirel/">homepage</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Tsirelson">Wikipedia</a>), who emigrated from the Soviet Union and then worked at Tel Aviv University (where my wife Dana attended his math lectures), wasn’t nearly as well known as Dyson to the wider world, but was equally beloved within the quantum computing and information community.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson%27s_bound">Tsirelson’s bound</a>, which he proved in the 1980s, showed that even quantum mechanics could only violate the Bell inequality by so much and by no more, could only let Alice and Bob win the <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/quantum18/lecture07.pdf">CHSH game</a> with probability cos<sup>2</sup>(π/8).  This seminal result anticipated many of the questions that would only be asked decades later with the rise of quantum information.  Tsirelson’s investigations of quantum nonlocality also led him to pose the famous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.4305">Tsirelson’s problem</a>: loosely speaking, can all sets of quantum correlations that can arise from an infinite amount of entanglement, be arbitrarily well approximated using <em>finite</em> amounts of entanglement?  The spectacular answer—no—was only announced one month ago, as a corollary of the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512">MIP*=RE breakthrough</a>, something that Tsirelson happily lived to see although I don’t know what his reaction was (<font color="red"><strong>update:</strong></font> I’m told that he indeed learned of it in his final weeks, and was happy about it).  Sadly, for some reason, I never met Tsirelson in person, although I did have lively email exchanges with him 10-15 years ago about his problem and other topics.  This <a href="https://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/en/blog/article/boris-tsirelson/?fbclid=IwAR1PrVvK0u5XmnFLLoPMzMN3x9rY1WIdp1wrYZ_yYPlqSGRpXDkollYTCR0">amusing interview</a> with Tsirelson gives some sense for his personality (hat tip to Gil Kalai, who knew Tsirelson well).</p>



<p>Please share any memories of Dyson or Tsirelson in the comments section.</p></div>

<p>In the past two weeks, in Italy, we have been drowning in information about the novel coronavirus infection, but the statistics that have been circulating were lacking proper context and interpretation. Is covid-19 just a stronger form of the flu or is it a threat to the world economy? Yes.</p>
<p>Now that the first community transmissions are happening in my adopted home in the San Francisco Bay Area, I would like to relay to my American readers what I learned from the Italian experience.</p>
<p><span id="more-4315"></span></p>
<p>The most quoted statistics concerned the mortality rate, which has been around 2-2.5% worldwide but only about 0.8% outside of Wuhan, while the flu has a mortality rate around 0.1% and measles around 0.2%. Furthermore, there are no reports of children and infants having died (<a href="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51">source</a>) or even having been in critical conditions. This means that it is an infection only somewhat more serious than the flu and that, in particular, parents should not be concerned about their small children.</p>
<p>The other important statistics, however, is the number of infected people that require intensive care. Some source give it at 5%, while the number circulating in Italy is 10%. </p>
<p>Now, developed countries have of the order of an ICU bed per 10,000 people: the European average is one bed per 9,000 people, Italy has one per 8,000, Germany has one per 3,400 (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8">source</a>) and the United States has one per 4,000 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351597/">source</a>). </p>
<p>ICU beds tend to have high occupancy, and they are used for victims of stroke and heart attacks, patients recovering from difficult surgeries and so on.</p>
<p>This means that if a person in 1,000 is sick with covid-19 at a given time, the critical cases might overwhelm the capacity of intensive care units. So far, this has happened only in Wuhan, at which point the Chinese government started implementing increasingly strong measures, leading to the lockdown of Wuhan and other places in Hubei province. A ratio of 0.1% of infected people at a regional level has not occurred anywhere outside Hubei province. Even in Lombardy we have “only” about 500 cases out of 10 million people. Two nights ago, however, in the town of Lodi (which has about 50,000 residents) 17 people where brought to the hospital in critical condition from the nearby “red zone”, and many of them had to be routed to other cities because Lodi could not deal with them.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that a covid-19 infected person infects on average another 2-2.5 other people (the “R0” parameter of the disease), typically over a week or less, leading to a rather fast exponential growth. On the Diamond Princess, about 20% of passengers and crew were infected. The only way to reduce the R0 below 1, which would make the epidemic die down, or at least to a value not much bigger than 1 (which would make it grow more slowly) is to reduce person-to-person contact. This is why clusters are locked down, and in places too big to lock down there are measures to reduce such contact, such as closing schools, shutting down sports events, conferences, fairs, concerts etc., and encouraging people to work from home.</p>
<p>The latter “lockdown-lite” measures have stopped the growth of infections in cities like Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore, where there were relatively large clusters of cases (much more in Shanghai than in Hong Kong and Singapore). We haven’t seen the number of cases in Korea and Italy leveling off, but this is because testing tends to discover infections that happened one or two weeks prior to the test, so the effect of any measure is only seen in the test numbers a couple of weeks or more after they are implemented.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Italy is building field hospitals in parking lots, using technology tested during earthquakes, to add hospital bed capacity to the system.</p>
<p>Finally, the measures introduced a week ago are starting to show dramatic economic consequences. The government first emphasized the gravity of the situation, in order to be seen as taking strong actions in a grave moment, and then realized it had caused a PR disaster and now is trying to sound a more optimistic note and to walk back some of the measures that are having the most negative economic consequences. Other governments are unlikely to repeat the same errors, so one should expect official government communication to be biased on the side of not creating alarm.</p>
<p>So here are the lessons for America, in brief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t worry about your young children
</li>
<li>If the government follows public health best practices, prepare to see school closures and cancelations of big events wherever there are signs of community transmission</li>
<li>With containment efforts similar to Hong Kong’s and Singapore’s (and Italy’s, Japan’s and Korea’s), we might see as little as one infection per 10,000-100,000 people, meaning nearly zero risk on an individual basis and no major strain on hospitals, but with significant effects on daily life and on the economy
</li><li>There will be political pressure to send out optimistic messages (see how the White House is asking to pre-approve all communication out of the CDC and the NIH) and to avoid measures that could hurt the economy</li>
<li>If the containment efforts are too light, and infections reach even a person in 1,000 on a regional level, the individual risk is still extremely small, but the health care system will be unable to deal with the critically ill. Note that <em>this hasn’t happened anywhere outside of Wuhan</em> and whatever directives come from the top, it’s hard to imagine that local officials would let it happen in their jurisdiction</li>
<li>Try not to have a stroke, a heart attack, or serious surgery in the next few months</li>
</ul></div>

Emil Post was the first to use the formal notion of reduction between problems. We discussed Post’s wonderful work and its relevance to complexity earlier <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/a-post-on-post/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to discuss the notion of reduction, and also perhaps some jokes for your amusement.</p>
<p>
Reductions are used throughout mathematics. We regard Post’s definition from 1944 as quintessential. His are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-one_reduction">many-one</a> reductions. Here is the definition in a functional style that we’ve tried to promote in other cases: A problem <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> reduces to a problem <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> if there is a computable function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> such that for any instance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> of problem <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />, </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++A%28x%29+%3D+B%28f%28x%29%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  A(x) = B(f(x)). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  A(x) = B(f(x)). " /></p>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> are languages then this gives the familiar condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+A+%5Ciff+f%28x%29+%5Cin+B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x \in A \iff f(x) \in B}" class="latex" title="{x \in A \iff f(x) \in B}" />. But the idea can be more general: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> can be functions.</p>
<p>
Alan Turing had earlier defined an even more general kind of reduction, in which given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> one computes multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y_i}" class="latex" title="{y_i}" />, gets the answer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%28y_i%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B(y_i)}" class="latex" title="{B(y_i)}" /> for each of them, and finally pieces together the answers to obtain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A(x)}" class="latex" title="{A(x)}" />. But this feels more like “expanding” than “reducing.” We want it to be: one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />, one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. That was Post’s notion.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dating Reductions and Jokes </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The idea of reduction is simple: When confronted with some problem, be lazy: Instead of solving the problem, show that it can be changed and then solved by some previously known method. That is, show that your problem is reduced to someone’s already solved problem. Be lazy.</p>
<p>
In this form, we can think of two mathematical examples that are much older than Post’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Logarithms</em>. Multiplying two numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" /> with many digits or decimals can be cumbersome. If you can compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> and its inverse such that <p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a%5Ccdot+b+%3D+f%5E%7B-1%7D%28f%28a%29+%2B+f%28b%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  a\cdot b = f^{-1}(f(a) + f(b)), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  a\cdot b = f^{-1}(f(a) + f(b)), " /></p>
<p>then your multiplication is reduced to a much easier addition. John Napier gave <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> the name “logarithm” in 1614 and soon William Oughtred built a physical device to automate this reduction. If you are over 40, perhaps you have seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">one</a>. </p>

<em>Integration</em>. Do you have a hard integral <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cint+A%28x%29+dx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\int A(x) dx}" class="latex" title="{\int A(x) dx}" />? Often tricks of defining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By+%3D+f%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y = f(x)}" class="latex" title="{y = f(x)}" />, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdy+%3D+f%27%28x%29+dx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{dy = f'(x) dx}" class="latex" title="{dy = f'(x) dx}" />, and/or integrating by parts, yields an integral <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cint+B%28y%29+dy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\int B(y) dy}" class="latex" title="{\int B(y) dy}" /> that is easier to solve, and whose solution completes your answer.
</li></ul>
<p>
The latter example is in Wikipedia’s article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(mathematics)">reduction</a>. The former, however, has the signature idea of reduction <em>between</em> problems, more than massaging instances of the same problem. What we really want to know is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> When was the process of transforming between problems first known by the term <b>reduction</b>? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We wonder if tracing an old kind of joke can help. The point is that reductions are a neat source of jokes. Here is a classic one, taken from a big <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~cherk/mathjokes.html">list</a> of math jokes. The list gives a second form of the joke based on reductions and there are many others. More on the jokes later.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A physicist and a mathematician are sitting in a faculty lounge. Suddenly, the coffee machine catches on fire. The physicist grabs a waste basket, empties the basket, leaps towards the sink, fills the basket with water, and puts out the fire. As this coffee machine has done this before they agree to keep a waste basket next to the coffee machine filled with water.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
The next day, the same two are sitting in the same lounge. Again, the coffee machine catches on fire. This time, the mathematician stands up, grabs the waste basket that is filled with water. Empties it, places some trash in the basket, and hands it to the physicist. Thus reducing the problem to a previously solved one. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Instead of putting out a fire, the following <a href="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DifficultVapidAmericanredsquirrel-size_restricted.gif?fbclid=IwAR2AXbtag_WFTP9bmipr4JOhvViHAQbvEgE8h1oCdG_71IttR28EgcSTqhg">video</a> is about retrieving a shoe that is floating away.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Another Example </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is an example of reductions that are not so silly and a little less simple.</p>
<p>
Imagine that Alice and Bob are at it again. Bob wants to be able to multiply integers fast and he plans on building a hardware system that stores the answers in a table. Then his hardware system will be able to compute the product of two integers by just looking up the answers. Okay, there are really better ways to do this, but just play along for the moment. </p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/tables2.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/tables2.jpg?w=200&amp;h=200" alt="" width="200" class="aligncenter wp-image-16747" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>
Bob’s table is big and he is troubled. The above table has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{100}" class="latex" title="{100}" /> entries just to multiply numbers less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{10}" class="latex" title="{10}" />. Clearly for a more extensive table the cost grows fast. He asks his friend Alice for some help. She says:”Just store the diagonal values and I can show you how to handle the general case.” Here is her old trick. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a+%5Ctimes+b+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cleft%28%5Cleft%28a+%2B+b%5Cright%29%5E%7B2%7D+-+a%5E%7B2%7D+-+b%5E%7B2%7D%5Cright%29%7D%7B2%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  a \times b = \frac{\left(\left(a + b\right)^{2} - a^{2} - b^{2}\right)}{2}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  a \times b = \frac{\left(\left(a + b\right)^{2} - a^{2} - b^{2}\right)}{2}. " /></p>
<p>Using this allows Bob to just store the diagonal of the multiplication table, and forget all the rest. It is a powerful reduction that shows:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> One can reduce integer multiplication to addition and taking the square of a number. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For example, </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++37+%5Ctimes+15+%26%3D%26+%28+52%5E%7B2%7D+-+37%5E%7B2%7D+-+15%5E%7B2%7D+%29%2F2+%5C%5C++++++++++++++%26%3D%26+%282704+-+1369+-+225%29%2F2+%5C%5C++++++++++++%26%3D%26+555.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        37 \times 15 &amp;=&amp; ( 52^{2} - 37^{2} - 15^{2} )/2 \\              &amp;=&amp; (2704 - 1369 - 225)/2 \\            &amp;=&amp; 555. \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        37 \times 15 &amp;=&amp; ( 52^{2} - 37^{2} - 15^{2} )/2 \\              &amp;=&amp; (2704 - 1369 - 225)/2 \\            &amp;=&amp; 555. \end{array} " /></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Complexity Reductions: No Joke? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Wikipedia actually gives the above as the first example in its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduction_(complexity)">article</a> on the <em>complexity</em> kind of reduction. These kind of reductions not only define NP hardness and completeness, they are really needed to understand what the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> problem is really about. </p>
<p>
For example, once one accepts that a language <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> can be represented by a uniform family of Boolean circuits <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_n}" class="latex" title="{C_n}" />, one for each length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> of instances <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />, the reduction to SAT is quickly defined: The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_n}" class="latex" title="{C_n}" /> have auxiliary inputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cy_q%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y_1,\dots,y_q}" class="latex" title="{y_1,\dots,y_q}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />, such that there is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5Eq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y \in \{0,1\}^q}" class="latex" title="{y \in \{0,1\}^q}" /> making <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_n%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_n(x,y) = 1}" class="latex" title="{C_n(x,y) = 1}" /> if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x \in A}" class="latex" title="{x \in A}" />.

The reduction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> first constructs the Boolean formula </p>

<p>To apply <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> to a given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />, simply substitute the bits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> for the variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" title="{x_i}" /> and simplify to make the formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi_x+%3D+f%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi_x = f(x)}" class="latex" title="{\phi_x = f(x)}" />.

The reduction not only proves the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-completeness of SAT (indeed, 3SAT) instantly, it conveys the character both of SAT and what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> is all about.</p>
<p>
This leads us to wonder something about teaching complexity theory. Maybe <b>reductions</b>, not <em>languages</em>, should be the principal objects of study. </p>
<p>
This may seem like a joke but there are benefits. The reductions are composable in ways that languages are not. They carry the source and target problems with them, at least in the form of the function’s arguments and values. Emphasizing reductions highlights the greatest success of complexity theory to date, which is proving relations between problems, rather than its failure to classify languages via lower bounds.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The main conjecture from Talagrand’s paper on boundaries and influences was settled by Ronen Eldan and Renan Gross. Their paper introduces a new powerful method to the field of analysis of Boolean functions (ABF).</span></p>
<p>This post is devoted to a new breakthrough paper by Ronen Eldan and Renan Gross, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12067">Concentration on the Boolean hypercube via pathwise stochastic analysis.</a></p>
<p>The paper introduces remarkable new techniques based on stochastic calculus, (that bypass the use of hypercontractivity), that allow to settles several open problems on analysis of Boolean functions. (And on the way, to give a very different proof for KKL.)</p>
<p>Renan Gross recently wrote an excellent high-level explanation of the paper in his  blog: <a href="https://sarcasticresonance.wordpress.com/2020/02/06/new-paper-on-arxiv-concentration-on-the-boolean-hypercube-via-pathwise-stochastic-analysis/">New paper on arXiv: Concentration on the Boolean hypercube via pathwise stochastic analysis.</a> It is accompanied by a <a href="https://sarcasticresonance.wordpress.com/2020/02/05/catastrophic-cubic-crash-course">brief introduction to Boolean analysis, featuring the required Boolean material</a>:</p>

<p>Before we move on, a trivia question:</p>
<h3><strong>Trivia question:</strong> Who invented the term hypercontractivity?</h3>
<p>(For a hint, see at the end of the post.)</p>
<p>Back to the paper by Ronen Eldan and Renan Gross. Perhaps the best way to explain what was achieved in this paper is to put one after the other the abstracts of the first version followed by the abstract of the second paper.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ronen and Renan’s paper. Version 1, 26 Sept 2019.</h2>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">The title for version 1 was: Stability of Talagrand’s influence inequality</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">And here is the abstract: </span></p>
<p>We strengthen several classical inequalities concerning the influences of a Boolean function, showing that near-maximizers must have large vertex boundaries. An inequality due to Talagrand states that for a Boolean function</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%29%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E%5Cmathrm%7Bvar%7D%5Cleft%28f%5Cright%29%5Cleq+C%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7BInf%7D_%7Bi%7D%5Cleft%28f%5Cright%29%7D%7B1%2B%5Clog%5Cleft%281%2F%5Cmathrm%7BInf%7D_%7Bi%7D%5Cleft%28f%5Cright%29%5Cright%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(1)~~~~~\mathrm{var}\left(f\right)\leq C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)}{1+\log\left(1/\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)\right)}" class="latex" title="(1)~~~~~\mathrm{var}\left(f\right)\leq C\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)}{1+\log\left(1/\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)\right)}" /></p>
<p>where  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathrm%7BInf%7D_%7Bi%7D%5Cleft%28f%5Cright%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)" class="latex" title="\mathrm{Inf}_{i}\left(f\right)" /> denote the influence of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />-th coordinate. We give a lower bound for the size of the vertex boundary of functions saturating this inequality. As a corollary, we show that for sets that satisfy the edge-isoperimetric inequality or the Kahn-Kalai-Linial (KKL) inequality up to a constant, a constant proportion of the mass is in the inner vertex boundary. Our proofs rely on new techniques, based on stochastic calculus, and bypass the use of hypercontractivity common to previous proofs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Let me say a few words about it. KKL theorem asserts that the maximal influence of a balanced Boolean function is at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5COmega+%28%5Clog+n%2Fn%29+var+%28f%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Omega (\log n/n) var (f)" class="latex" title="\Omega (\log n/n) var (f)" />. The famous tribe example of Ben-Or and Linial shows that this is tight.  The KKL paper gave some statements about other norms of the influence vector and Talagrand’s inequality stated above (from the paper “On Russo’s 0-1 law”) gives a sharp description of the influence vectors. Ronen and Renan found a new method that gave new proofs for KKL’s theorem and the stronger Talagrand’s inequality. This new methods led to new stability result.</span></p>

<p>Abstract: We develop a new technique for proving concentration inequalities which relate between the variance and influences of Boolean functions. Using this technique, we</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Settle a conjecture of Talagrand [Tal97] proving that</p>

<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h_f%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="h_f(x)" class="latex" title="h_f(x)" /> is the number of edges at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" />  along which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> changes its value, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Inf_i%28f%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Inf_i(f)" class="latex" title="Inf_i(f)" /> is the influence of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />-th coordinate.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Strengthen several classical inequalities concerning the influences of a Boolean function, showing that near-maximizers must have large vertex boundaries. An inequality due to Talagrand states that for a Boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /></p>

<p>We give a lower bound for the size of the vertex boundary of functions saturating this inequality. As a corollary, we show that for sets that satisfy the edge-isoperimetric inequality or the Kahn-Kalai-Linial inequality up to a constant, a constant proportion of the mass is in the inner vertex boundary.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Improve a quantitative relation between influences and noise stability given by Keller and Kindler.</p>
<p>Our proofs rely on techniques based on stochastic calculus, and bypass the use of hypercontractivity common to previous proofs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Let me explain in a few words the main inequality that verified a conjecture by Talagrand. For other advances look at the paper itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">The famous Margulis-Talagrand inequality asserts that</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%283%29%7E%7E%7E%7E%7E%5Cint_%7B%5Cleft%5C%7B+-1%2C1%5Cright%5C%7D+%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%5Csqrt%7Bh_%7Bf%7D%5Cleft%28x%5Cright%29%7Dd%5Cmu%5Cgeq+C%5Ccdot%5Cmathrm%7Bvar%7D%28f%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(3)~~~~~\int_{\left\{ -1,1\right\} ^{n}}\sqrt{h_{f}\left(x\right)}d\mu\geq C\cdot\mathrm{var}(f)." class="latex" title="(3)~~~~~\int_{\left\{ -1,1\right\} ^{n}}\sqrt{h_{f}\left(x\right)}d\mu\geq C\cdot\mathrm{var}(f)." /></p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;">Let me say a little more. Talagrand’s proved in  his paper on Influence and boundary asserts that the right hand is a constant only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=II%28f%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="II(f)" class="latex" title="II(f)" /> – the sum of squares of the influences is a constant. He conjectured that we can actually add the square root of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+II%28f%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\log II(f)" class="latex" title="\log II(f)" /> to the RHS.</span></p>
<p>A few remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li> For more background see my old post “<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/natis-influence/">Nati’s influence</a>“.</li>
<li>Let me mention that Talagrand’s influence inequality (Equation (1) above) is sharp up to a multiplicative constant. This is shown in a 2015 paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06325">On the Converse of Talagrand’s Influence Inequality</a> by Saleet Klein, Amit Levi, Muli Safra, Clara Shikhelman, and Yinon Spinka.</li>
<li> Finding the best constant in KKL’s theorem is a well known challenge. So is the question of understanding balanced Boolean functions on n variables where the maximum influence is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C+%5Clog+n%2Fn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C \log n/n" class="latex" title="C \log n/n" />. Ehud Friedgit in his paper:<a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehudf/docs/kkl.ps"> Influences in Product Spaces, KKL and BKKKL Revisited</a>, have made important conjectures for such Boolean functions.</li>
<li> I expect that the new method will have many applications. Ronen Eldan in a paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11641">Second-order bounds on correlations between increasing families</a>, found applicaions to correlation inequalities which I will discuss at some other time.</li>
<li> See the last part of <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/22/jeff-kahn-and-jinyoung-park-maximal-independent-sets-and-a-new-isoperimetric-inequality-for-the-hamming-cube/">this post</a> for a description of Talagrand’s various relevant papers.</li>
<li>Renan Gross is building the <a href="https://booleanzoo.weizmann.ac.il/index.php/Main_Page">BooleanZoo</a> in a similar spirit to the famous complexityZoo.</li>
<li>I was in the process of writing a post about progress on ABS, mentioning twelve or so papers, apologizing for not mentioning others, promising to write in details about some of the papers, and making further apologetic remarks. But as this large post does not advance let me start with some of the promises.</li>

<p>The first Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place this coming Friday, February 28th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC). <strong>Jon Kleinberg</strong> from Cornell University will speak about “<em>Fairness and Bias in Algorithmic Decision-Making</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: As data science has broadened its scope in recent years, a number of domains have applied computational methods for classification and prediction to evaluate individuals in high-stakes settings. These developments have led to an active line of recent discussion in the public sphere about the consequences of algorithmic prediction for notions of fairness and equity. In part, this discussion has involved a basic tension between competing notions of what it means for such classifications to be fair to different groups. We consider several of the key fairness conditions that lie at the heart of these debates, and in particular how these properties operate when the goal is to rank-order a set of applicants by some criterion of interest, and then to select the top-ranking applicants. The talk will be based on joint work with Sendhil Mullainathan and Manish Raghavan.</p>

<div class="content">
We show an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{2.5})$ lower bound for general depth four arithmetic circuits computing an explicit $n$-variate degree $\Theta(n)$ multilinear polynomial over any field of characteristic zero. To our knowledge, and as stated in the survey by Shpilka and Yehudayoff (FnT-TCS, 2010), no super-quadratic lower bound was known for depth four circuits over fields of characteristic other than 2 before this work. The previous best lower bound is $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1.5})$ shown in the work of Sharma (Master's Thesis, 2017), which is a slight quantitative improvement over the roughly $\Omega(n^{1.33})$ bound obtained by invoking the super-linear lower bound for constant depth circuits in the works of Raz (STOC, 2008) and Shoup and Smolensky (FOCS, 1991).

Our lower bound proof follows the approach of the almost cubic lower bound for depth three circuits in the work by Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (ICALP, 2016) by replacing the shifted partials measure with a suitable variant of the projected shifted partials measure, but it differs from their proof at a crucial step - namely, the way "heavy" product gates are handled. Loosely speaking, a heavy product gate has a relatively high fan-in. Product gates of a depth three circuit compute products of affine forms, and so, it is easy to prune $\Theta(n)$ many heavy product gates by projecting the circuit to a low-dimensional affine subspace as shown in the works by Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (ICALP, 2016) and Shpilka and Wigderson (CCC, 1999). However, in a depth four circuit, the second (from the top) layer of product gates compute products of polynomials having arbitrary degree, and hence it was not clear how to prune such heavy product gates from the circuit. We show that heavy product gates can also be eliminated from a depth four circuit by projecting the circuit to a low-dimensional affine subspace, unless the heavy gates together account for $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{2.5})$ size. This part of our argument is inspired by a well-known greedy approximation algorithm for the weighted set-cover problem.</div>

The randomized query complexity $R(f)$ of a boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ is famously characterized (via Yao's minimax) by the least number of queries needed to distinguish a distribution $D_0$ over $0$-inputs from a distribution $D_1$ over $1$-inputs, maximized over all pairs $(D_0,D_1)$. We ask: Does this task become easier if we allow query access to infinitely many samples from either $D_0$ or $D_1$? We show the answer is no: There exists a hard pair $(D_0,D_1)$ such that distinguishing $D_0^\infty$ from $D_1^\infty$ requires $\Theta(R(f))$ many queries. As an application, we show that for any composed function $f\circ g$ we have $R(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{fbs}(f)R(g))$ where $\mathrm{fbs}$ denotes fractional block sensitivity.</div>

<p>Greetings from Milan, in Italy’s “yellow zone” of areas bordering clusters of coronavirus infections. This week, all schools, universities, museums, theaters  are closed, bars have to close by 6pm, and fairs and conferences are being postponed. The “red zone” of small towns with the clusters of infections is on lockdown.</p>
<p>Milan has been unseasonably warm and sunny in the past few days, and walking through the city, with very light car and pedestrian traffic, has been lovely. This is apparently what the city usually looks like in August, but without the heat and humidity.<br />
<span id="more-4301"></span></p>
<p>Italians have the well deserved fame of being very dramatic people, but we have been taking the inconvenience in stride and with a mix of stoicism and good humor. Maybe I am wrong, but, apart from New York City, if a large American city had a cluster of infections in the suburbs, and it were similarly shut down, we would see riots and looting on the first night.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the lockdown of the small towns was announced before any announcement of what to do about Milan, and the news showed long lines of people in those small towns waiting to buy groceries in the few open supermarkets. This induced some panic-buying on Sunday and Monday in Milan.</p>
<p>While people in Hong Kong and Singapore panic-bought toilet paper, Italians have mostly been buying pasta. Except, that is, <i>penne lisce</i>, like this Twitter user noted in a broadly shared picture. (Short cuts of pasta, like penne, are usually ribbed, to better catch sauce. Smooth short pasta like penne lisce makes no sense)</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="it" dir="ltr">Continuo a guardare questa foto fatta prima al supermercato e penso al fatto che il grande sconfitto da questo virus sono le penne lisce che agli italiani fanno cagare pure quando sono presi dal panico e si preparano all’apocalisse. <a href="https://t.co/Lq9Y06jdho">pic.twitter.com/Lq9Y06jdho</a></p>

<p>By Sunday night, the government decided that Lombardy and Veneto would be subject to a series of measures with the goal of reducing person-to-person contact, such as the closures mentioned above of schools, universities, museums etc. The meme below is titled “Here in Milan we are going too far”.</p>

<p>Most annoyingly, every other newspaper headline or tv news chyron has been of the form “X in the time of coronavirus”. I can’t take it any more. This is the Autumn of journalism, a foretold death of creativity. Journalists are lost in the labyrinth of cliches. I wish all those headline writers one hundred years of solitude. The real news is the kidnapping of new ideas. Anyways, I think I am going to live to tell the tale.</p>
<p>The silver linings are that I have not been paying attention to the Democratic primaries and that I have plenty of free time to restart my planned series of posts on applications of online convex optimization to computational complexity. The next post will be on Impagliazzo’s hard-core lemma, a milestone in the theory of average-case complexity and pseudorandomness.</p>
<p>I am happy to answer any questions in the comments.</p></div>
