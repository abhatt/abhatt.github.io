<div class="content">
We study the error resilience of transitive linear codes over $F_2$. We give tight bounds on the weight distribution of every such code $C$, and we show how these bounds can be used to infer bounds on the error rates that $C$ can tolerate on the binary symmetric channel. Using this connection, we show that every transitive code can be list-decoded from random errors. As an application, our results imply list-decoding bounds for Reed-Muller codes even when the rate exceeds the channel capacity.</div>

maximum matchings in general graphs. Unlike blossom shrinking algorithms, which
store all possible alternative alternating paths in the super-vertices shrunk
from blossoms, the newly proposed algorithm does not involve blossom shrinking.
The basic idea is to deflect the alternating path when facing blossoms. The
algorithm maintains detour information in an auxiliary stack to minimize the
redundant data structures. A benefit of our technique is to avoid spending time
on shrinking and expanding blossoms. This DFS algorithm can determine a maximum
matching of a general graph with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices in $O(mn)$ time
with space complexity $O(n)$.

peers, but these networks currently do not have any provable guarantees for
desirable properties such as Byzantine fault tolerance, good connectivity and
small diameter. This is not just a theoretical problem, as recent works have
exploited unsafe peer connection policies and weak network synchronization to
mount partitioning attacks on Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency blockchains are safety
critical systems, so we need principled algorithms to maintain their networks.
</p>
<p>Our key insight is that we can leverage the blockchain itself to share
information among the peers, and thus simplify the network maintenance process.
Given that the peers have restricted computational resources, and at most a
constant fraction of them are Byzantine, we provide communication-efficient
protocols to maintain a hypercubic network for blockchains, where peers can
join and leave over time. Interestingly, we discover that our design can
\emph{recover} from substantial adversarial failures. Moreover, these
properties hold despite significant churn.
</p>
<p>A key contribution is a secure mechanism for joining the network that uses
the blockchain to help new peers to contact existing peers. Furthermore, by
examining how peers join the network, i.e., the "bootstrapping service," we
give a lower bound showing that (within log factors) our network tolerates the
maximum churn rate possible. In fact, we can give a lower bound on churn for
any fully distributed service that requires connectivity.

counting. In Barvinok's original framework[Bar17], by calculating truncated
Taylor expansions, a quasi-polynomial time algorithm was given for estimating
zero-free partition functions. Patel and Regts[PR17] later gave a refinement of
Barvinok's framework, which gave a polynomial-time algorithm for a class of
zero-free graph polynomials that can be expressed as counting induced subgraphs
in bounded-degree graphs.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for estimating classical
and quantum partition functions specified by local Hamiltonians with bounded
maximum degree, assuming a zero-free property for the temperature.
Consequently, when the inverse temperature is close enough to zero by a
constant gap, we have polynomial-time approximation algorithm for all such
partition functions. Our result is based on a new abstract framework that
extends and generalizes the approach of Patel and Regts.

(insertion-deletions) streams with *asymptotically optimal* space complexity:
for any $n$-vertex graph, our algorithm with high probability outputs an
$\alpha$-approximate matching in a single pass using $O(n^2/\alpha^3)$ bits of
space.
</p>
<p>A long line of work on the dynamic streaming matching problem has reduced the
gap between space upper and lower bounds first to $n^{o(1)}$ factors
[Assadi-Khanna-Li-Yaroslavtsev; SODA 2016] and subsequently to
$\text{polylog}{(n)}$ factors [Dark-Konrad; CCC 2020]. Our upper bound now
matches the Dark-Konrad lower bound up to $O(1)$ factors, thus completing this
research direction.
</p>
<p>Our approach consists of two main steps: we first (provably) identify a
family of graphs, similar to the instances used in prior work to establish the
lower bounds for this problem, as the only "hard" instances to focus on. These
graphs include an induced subgraph which is both sparse and contains a large
matching. We then design a dynamic streaming algorithm for this family of
graphs which is more efficient than prior work. The key to this efficiency is a
novel sketching method, which bypasses the typical loss of
$\text{polylog}{(n)}$-factors in space compared to standard $L_0$-sampling
primitives, and can be of independent interest in designing optimal algorithms
for other streaming problems.

and employs a dimensionality reduction technique for swifter domination checks.
While the method itself maintains solution optimality, it is able to
additionally incorporate existing heuristics for further speedups. The proposed
algorithm has been tested on multiple criteria combinations of varying
correlation. The results show the introduced approach provides a speedup of at
least 6 times on simple criteria combinations and up to 60 times on hard

also decreases memory requirements of queries by up to 13 times.

framework for formal guarantees of privacy, and boosted decision trees are a

algorithm for boosting decision trees that guarantees differential privacy.
Privacy is enforced because our booster never puts too much weight on any one
example; this ensures that each individual's data never influences a single
tree "too much." Experiments show that this boosting algorithm can produce
better model sparsity and accuracy than other differentially private ensemble
classifiers.

information from high-dimensional (multi-modal) sparse data. This study
presents a novel framework for accelerating fundamental TD operations on
massively parallel GPU architectures. In contrast to prior work, the proposed
Blocked Linearized CoOrdinate (BLCO) format enables efficient out-of-memory
computation of tensor algorithms using a unified implementation that works on a
single tensor copy. Our adaptive blocking and linearization strategies not only
meet the resource constraints of GPU devices, but also accelerate data
indexing, eliminate control-flow and memory-access irregularities, and reduce
kernel launching overhead. To address the substantial synchronization cost on
GPUs, we introduce an opportunistic conflict resolution algorithm that
discovers and resolves conflicting updates across threads on-the-fly, without
keeping any auxiliary information or storing non-zero elements in specific mode
orientations. As a result, our framework delivers superior in-memory
performance compared to prior state-of-the-art, and is the only framework
capable of processing out-of-memory tensors. On the latest Intel and NVIDIA
GPUs, BLCO achieves 2.12-2.6X geometric-mean speedup (with up to 33.35X
speedup) over the state-of-the-art mixed-mode compressed sparse fiber (MM-CSF)
on a range of real-world sparse tensors.

importance to Computational Biology. For finding a walk in an arbitrary graph
with $|E|$ edges that exactly matches a pattern of length $m$, a lower bound
based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) implies an algorithm
significantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ time is unlikely [Equi et al., ICALP 2019].
However, for many special graphs, such as de Bruijn graphs, the problem can be
solved in linear time [Bowe et al., WABI 2012]. For approximate matching, the
picture is more complex. When edits (substitutions, insertions, and deletions)
are only allowed to the pattern, or when the graph is acyclic, the problem is
again solvable in $O(|E|m)$ time. When edits are allowed to arbitrary cyclic
graphs, the problem becomes NP-complete, even on binary alphabets [Jain et al.,
RECOMB 2019]. These results hold even when edits are restricted to only
substitutions. The complexity of approximate pattern matching on de Bruijn
graphs remained open. We investigate this problem and show that the properties
that make de Bruijn graphs amenable to efficient exact pattern matching do not
extend to approximate matching, even when restricted to the substitutions only
case with alphabet size four. We prove that determining the existence of a
matching walk in a de Bruijn graph is NP-complete when substitutions are
allowed to the graph. In addition, we demonstrate that an algorithm
significantly faster than $O(|E|m)$ is unlikely for de Bruijn graphs in the
case where only substitutions are allowed to the pattern. This stands in
contrast to pattern-to-text matching where exact matching is solvable in linear
time, like on de Bruijn graphs, but approximate matching under substitutions is
solvable in subquadratic $O(n\sqrt{m})$ time, where $n$ is the text's length
[Abrahamson, SIAM J. Computing 1987].

improves upon the best bounds know so far, some of which have remained
unchanged since 2001.

<p><strong>Update: Junior/Senior Lunches by <a href="https://ccanonne.github.io/">Clement Cannone</a> and <a href="http://www.gautamkamath.com/">Gautam Kamath</a>:<br /></strong></p>



<p>Back by popular demand! As part of FOCS 2021, and in view of the success of similar events in the past, a “junior/senior lunch” will take place on Tuesday February 8, 1:30PM-2:30pm ET. Importantly, this is <strong>not</strong> limited to FOCS attendees! As in previous years, this virtual lunch will be the occasion for senior researchers in the field, broadly construed, to have an informal chat with students, postdocs, and junior faculty, answer their questions, discuss their research, and generally have a nice conversation.</p>



<p>To participate as either a senior or junior researcher, please write your name in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nrL8I0l2OF1kbMFTKlaBdK1L2LXkOMjR1PKBjEUSA4E/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a>. Further instructions will be sent to people who sign up.  If you are on the “senior” side of the lunch, you will be responsible for contacting the corresponding juniors, and provide a Zoom link.</p>

<p>Ken Regan emailed me recently asking if our software could tell how many blogs I had done (not how many Lance+Bill had done). We didn't know how to do that but he managed it anyway. Apparently he was more interested in this question than either Lance or I was. </p><p>But the answer was interesting: My1000th post of Complexityblog was about Betty White dying at just the wrong time to be in those <i>those we say goodbye to</i> articles that appear CLOSE to the end of the year. (I don't know why, but I think the fact that my 1000th post was on Betty White is just awesome!) The post is <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/01/did-betty-white-die-in-2021why-do.html">here</a>. He was asking this because he thought (correctly) that I was around 1000 and wanted to do a tribute blog to me (actually it was done by Lipton and Regan- more on that later). And indeed they did do the post, its <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/29/bill-gasarch-also-1000/">here</a>.</p><p>RANDOM THOUGHT ONE</p><p>While preparing it Ken asked me about my papers.  This brings up the more general question: When looking at your old work what do you think? Common reactions are</p><p>1) Gee, I was smarter then. That was very clever. OH, now I remember, my co-author did it. </p><p>2) Gee, I was dumber then. I could do that argument so much better now. </p><p>3) Why did I care about Muffins so much to write a book about it? (Replace <i>Muffins</i> with <i>whatever you</i> <i>worked on</i> and <i>book</i> with the<i> venue it appeared in</i>.) </p><p>Item 3 is probably the most common: As a graduate student one works on things without really have a vision of the field (though the advisor can mitigate this) so what you work on may seem odd later on. And ones tastes can change as well. </p><p>RANDOM THOUGHT TWO</p><p>Ken and Dick write actual posts together. I find that amazing! By contrast, the extent of Lance and my interactions about the blog are: </p><p>a) Someone died. Which of us should do the blog obit? or get a guest blogger.?(Whenever Lance phones me on the telephone I answer <i>who died</i> and usually someone did.) </p><p>b) Which of us does the April Fools Day post this year (we usually alternate, or <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/04/i-am-bill-gasarch.html">do we</a>)?</p><p>c) I plan on doing 2 posts close together- a question and an answer, so when do you NOT plan on blogging so I can do that.</p><p>d) Someone proved X. Which of us should blog? Or should we get a guest blogger?</p><p>e) Establish a general rule for the year like <i>Bill will post Sunday's, Lance Thursdays.</i></p><p>f) I ask Lance for technical help on the blog. How do you get rid of the white background when I cut and paste?</p><p>g) Sometimes one of us wants commentary on a blog we are working no- but that is rare. Though I asked Lance for this post and he added a few things to this list.</p><p>h) Sometimes I look at one of his posts before it goes out and offer commentary, or vice versa. Also rare.</p><p>i) Lance writes the end of year posts, but always with my input. We jointly choose the theorem of the year.</p><p>j) The very <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/03/leonard-nimoy-1931-2015_2.html">rare</a> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/08/the-crystal-blogaversity.html">joint</a> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/02/wseas-greek-tragedy.html">posts</a>.</p><p>k) If we happen to be in the same place at the same time, like Dagsthul, we'll do a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=typecast">typecast</a> capturing our conversations. In the past we've also had <a href="https://lance.fortnow.com/blogpodcasts/podcast.xml">podcasts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fortnow">vidcasts</a> together.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>Soon after I posted my preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11607">“The Complexity of Iterated Reversible Computation” (arXiv:2112.11607)</a> last month (see <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/12/23/raytracing-diamonds.html">previous post “Raytracing diamonds”</a>), Mark Bell emailed me to observe that one of the problems I mentioned in it, iterated integer interval exchange transformations, could be solved in polynomial time by reinterpreting it as a problem on normal curves in triangulated surfaces and plugging in known results from computational topology. Here is a more detailed expansion of that observation.</p>

<p>First, some terminology, with a picture to help make sense of it:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/normal-interval-exchange.svg" alt="Integer interval exchange transformation represented as a normal curve on a triangulated surface" /></p>

<dl>
  <dt>Interval exchange transformation</dt>
  <dd>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_exchange_transformation">interval exchange transformation</a> is a transformation of an interval, obtained by dividing it up into subintervals, permuting the subintervals, and concatenating them back together in the permuted order to obtain the starting interval. They have been widely studied in the theory of dynamical systems. The picture above is derived from an interval exchange transformation on four subintervals \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) (top edge of the rectangle), permuted into the new order \(b\), \(d\), \(c\), \(a\) (bottom edge of the rectangle).</dd>
  <dt>Integer interval exchange transformation</dt>
  <dd>In order to obtain a transformation on a discrete set rather than a continuous interval, we restrict our attention to intervals of the number line, interval exchange transformations that map integers to integers on the number line, and the action of those transformations on the integers. More specifically, we can consider the \(N\) integers from \(0\) to \(N-1\), for some \(N\). The one in the picture has \(N=15\), with the integer positions on the number line shown as vertical blue line segments.</dd>
  <dd>
    <p>An integer interval exchange transformation can be specified by listing the largest integer in each interval, in permuted order: here, this permuted list is \(5, 14, 6, 3\). If there are \(k\) intervals, this specification has bit-length \(O(k\log N)\) and so to achieve polynomial time we will want a time bound that is polynomial in \(k\) and \(\log N\).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Iterated interval exchange transformation</dt>
  <dd>Given a number \(n\), a starting value \(x\), and a specified integer interval exchange transformation \(f\), repeatedly apply \(f\), \(n\) times. What is the value \(f^{(n)}(x)\) that results? For instance, the transformation shown takes \(0\to 11\to 6\to 8\to\cdots\), so \(f^3(0)=8\).</dd>
  <dt>Surface</dt>
  <dd>The surfaces I have in mind are compact two-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientability">oriented manifolds</a> without boundary: topologically like a plane at every point, but globally having a different topology. They can be classified as the sphere, torus, two-handled torus, etc., but we won’t need this classification. The rectangle in the figure can be interpreted as a surface if we glue the pairs of labeled edges together. The left and right sides of the rectangle, when glued together, make a cylinder. The top and bottom edges of the rectangle are glued according to the labeling shown, rather than just wrapping directly from top to bottom.</dd>
  <dt>Triangulated surface</dt>
  <dd>Subdivide the surface into triangles, meeting edge-to-edge, as in the figure. For topological purposes the geometry of the surface is unimportant: all you need to know is the triangles and how they meet edge-to-edge.</dd>
  <dt>Normal curve</dt>
  <dd>A normal curve, on a triangulated surface, is a curve that does not cross itself, does not pass through any triangle vertices, and when entering a triangle on one edge always leaves on a different edge. After gluing the rectangle to form a surface, the blue lines link up to form a normal curve.</dd>
  <dt>Normal arc</dt>
  <dd>A normal curve can have more than one connected component; when it does, a single component is called an arc. The blue normal curve turns out to be an arc: it has only one component.</dd>
  <dt>Normal coordinates</dt>
  <dd>The normal coordinates of a normal curve describe the curve by specifying, for each edge of a topological triangulation, how many times the normal curve crosses each edge. The normal coordinates on the labeled horizontal edges are \(N_a=4\), \(N_b=2\), \(N_c=1\), and \(N_d=8\). The normal coordinates on the vertical edges are all zero; the other edges interior to the rectangle have nonzero normal coordinates, which are just the numbers of times each edge is crossed by the blue curve.</dd>
  <dd>
    <p>Not all assignments of numbers to triangulation edges work. For a triangle with edges \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), the normal coordinates \(N_x\), \(N_y\), and \(N_z\) must obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality">triangle inequality</a>. You can read off how the curve crosses the triangle from these numbers: it has \(N_x+N_y-N_z\) segments that cross from edge \(x\) to edge \(y\), etc. The triangle inequality ensures that these numbers of segments are all non-negative. A curve topologically equivalent to the given curve can be obtained by placing the given number of tick-marks on each edge and connecting them by non-crossing segments according to this formula.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Edge coordinates</dt>
  <dd>The edge coordinate of a point where a normal curve crosses an edge is just its position along the crossings on that edge.</dd>
  <dt>Arc coordinates</dt>
  <dd>The arc coordinate of a point where a normal curve crosses an edge is its position among all of the crossings along the normal curve, in the order they are reached by that curve, after choosing an arbitrary starting point to have coordinate zero.</dd>
</dl>

<p>With all of this as setup, and with the algorithms on normal curves from a paper by Jeff Erickson and Amir Nayyeri, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-013-9515-z">“Tracing Compressed Curves in Triangulated Surfaces”, <em>DCG</em> 2013</a>, the rest is easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Given an interval exchange transformation, construct a surface in the form depicted: a triangulated rectangle, divided into some number \(s\) of horizontal stripes, with the input intervals to the transformation subdividing the top of the rectangle and the outputs subdividing the bottom. Triangulate it as shown in the figure, so that each vertical line through the rectangle crosses exactly one diagonal per slice, and so that the central horizontal line across the rectangle forms an unsubdivided edge. Each step up or down from this central line allows the number of horizontal subdivisions to double, so it suffices to let \(s=2\lceil\log_2 k\rceil\), producing a triangulation with \(O(k)\) triangles. Glue the left and right sides of the rectangle together, and glue top and bottom according to the labeling from the transformation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compute the normal coordinates of the normal curve formed by the vertical integer lines in the rectangle. The normal coordinate of any edge is how far apart horizontally its endpoints are within the rectangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the number \(x\) whose iterates we want to compute, let \(p_x\) be the point of the central horizontal line, \(x\) steps from the left. Each iteration of the exchange transformation can be obtained by advancing \(2s\) units upward along the curve, starting from \(p_x\), and wrapping around halfway through from the top of the rectangle to the bottom.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find the normal arc containing \(p_x\) and its normal coordinates (Erickson and Nayyeri, Theorem 6.2). Its length \(X\) (measured as a number of crossings) is just the sum of these normal coordinates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Convert the known edge coordinate of \(p_x\) to an arc coordinate (Erickson and Nayyeri, Theorem 6.3), add \(2ns\) (modulo \(X\)) to this arc coordinate, convert the resulting arc coordinate back into an edge coordinate in its arc (Erickson and Nayyeri, Theorem 6.4), and then back into an edge coordinate in the whole curve. This edge coordinate is the number we want to compute, \(f^{(n)}(x)\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The topological subroutines used by this algorithm all take time quadratic in the size of the triangulation and logarithic in the number of crossings of the normal curve, so for the triangulation and normal curve constructed above this time bound is \(O(k^2\log N)\).</p>

The continuous learning with errors (CLWE) problem was recently introduced by Bruna
et al. (STOC 2021). They showed that its hardness implies infeasibility of learning Gaussian
mixture models, while its tractability implies efficient Discrete Gaussian Sampling and thus
asymptotic improvements in worst-case lattice algorithms. No reduction between CLWE and
LWE is currently known, in either direction.
We propose four public-key encryption schemes based on the hardness of CLWE, with varying
tradeoffs between decryption and security errors, and different discretization techniques. Some
of our schemes are based on hCLWE, a homogeneous variant, which is no easier than CLWE.
Our schemes yield a polynomial-time algorithm for solving hCLWE, and hence also CLWE,
using a Statistical Zero-Knowledge oracle.</div>

William Gasarch turned 1,000 earlier this month. Or in October, depending on how you count. That is, he has made 1,000 posts on a theory blog all by himself. Bill is a professor at the University of Maryland Department of Computer Science and is one of the leaders in computational complexity theory, computability theory, computational learning theory, and Ramsey theory. </p>
<p>
Today we congratulate Bill on this milestone and convey some of his other work and activities.</p>
<p>
Bill joined as Lance Fortnow’s official partner on the <i>Computational Complexity</i> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org">blog</a> in March 2007. His 1,000th from that point was his Jan. 2 <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/01/did-betty-white-die-in-2021why-do.html">post</a> about Betty White and boundaries of time. If we count seven posts from two earlier guest-blogger stints when Lance was on vacation, then his 1,000th <i>Computational Complexity</i> post was <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/squaring-circle-is-mentioned-in-gilbert.html">this</a> last October 24th about some appearances of mathematics in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.</p>
<p>
As noted <a href="https://www.meersworld.net/2019/02/how-to-filter-blogger-posts-by-authors.html">here</a>, the <em>Blogger</em> platform does not break down post counts by author, only by label, so I (Ken) resorted to grabbing all the text and counting all the “Posted by” lines. By the same count, Lance has 1,850 posts, and there are blocks by other guest posters. </p>
<p>
Other metrics might be interesting: Shall we count equations? theorems? open problems? proofs given in full? conjectures? How about a raw count of numbers used in the posts, apart from words? Anyway, Bill has done a lot more in the public eye than the blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Book Reviews </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Bill was the book review editor for ACM SIGACT NEWS from 1997 to 2015 before turning the job over to Fred Green, a professor of computer science at Clark University. See Bill’s reviews <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>. The reviews are wonderful and there are lots of them. He should be thanked many times for the terrific work he did there.</p>
<p>
I (Dick) am happy to say that Bill reviewed three of my books: </p>
<ol>
<li>
People, Problems, and Proofs, by Richard Lipton and Ken Regan. <p></p>
</li><li>
The P=NP Question and Gödel’s Lost Letter, by Richard Lipton. <p></p>
</li><li>
Ideas that Created the Future: Classic Papers of Computer Science, the <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/65334324/pdf-ideas-that-created-the-future-classic-papers-of-computer-science-full">book</a> edited by Harry Lewis.
</li></ol>
<p>
The last one includes one of my strangest papers: “Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems and Programs,” with Rich DeMillo and Alan Perlis in 1977. Rich and I cherish it because it included Perlis as a co-author. He was special to many of us—especially those from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu">CMU</a>. We always will miss him. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> New Book and Numbers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s look at Bill’s <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/">personal</a> page. He highlights his wonderful newest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Muffin-Morsels-Problem-Mathematics/dp/9811215170">book</a> <i>Mathematical Muffin Morsels: Nobody Wants a Small Piece</i>. It is joint with Erik Metz, Jacob Prinz, and Daniel Smolyak, who were undergraduate students in Bill’s group, and features contributions by numerous others.</p>

A summary: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Suppose you have five muffins that you want to divide and give to Alice, Bob, and Carol. You want each of them to get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%2F3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{5/3}" class="latex" />. You could cut each muffin into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3-1%2F3-1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/3-1/3-1/3}" class="latex" /> and give each student five <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/3}" class="latex" />-sized pieces. But Alice objects! She has large hands! She wants everyone to have pieces larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/3}" class="latex" />.</em></p><em>
<p>
Is there a way to divide five muffins for three students so that everyone gets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%2F3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{5/3}" class="latex" />, and all pieces are larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/3}" class="latex" />? Spoiler alert: Yes! In fact, there is a division where the smallest piece is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%2F12%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{5/12}" class="latex" />. Is there a better division? Spoiler alert: No.</p>
</em><p><em>
This problem takes us through much mathematics of interest, for example, combinatorics and optimization theory. However, the math is elementary enough for an advanced high school student. </em>

<p></p><p>
What supplements the math is the use of accessibly simple computer programs to do numerical experiments. Some can be found on Bill’s <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/MUFFINS/muffins.html">Muffin Website</a>. Among news after our June 2018 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/06/21/muffins-and-integers/">post</a> on the muffin problem, Richard Chatwin <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.08726.pdf">proved</a> that the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28s%2Cm%29+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f(s,m) =}" class="latex" /> the largest size of the smallest piece—when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m}" class="latex" /> muffins are divided equally among <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" /> people—depends only on the ratio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%2Fs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m/s}" class="latex" />.

<p>
All these sources have tables of what we might—to channel the title of Bill’s other <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/03/10/problems-with-a-point/">recent</a> <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261">book</a> with Clyde Kruskal—call <em>Numbers With a Point</em>. The point is the insight they give about asymptotic growth and likelihood of conjectures. We note in particular a 2020 <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/MUFFINS/MuffinsAnalysis/MuffinsAnalysis.pdf">paper</a> by Smolyak on “The Muffin Problem – Data Analysis of Exceptions” to patterns in the values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28s%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f(s,m)}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> More Numbers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Bill gave a <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/COURSES/858/S20/notes/liptonbday.pdf">talk</a> in our January 17 workshop on “Seeking an Easier Proof of a Weaker Result in Multiparty Communication Complexity.” The topic is a classic setting in which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> people each have an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-bit number on their foreheads, so that all can see everyone else’s number but not their own. The problem is to compute some function or predicate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" /> of the numbers, such as their whether their sum exceeds or equals a given value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" />, while minimizing the total number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7Bf%2Ck%7D%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d_{f,k}(n)}" class="latex" /> of bits communicated. </p>
<p>
Ashok Chandra, Merrick Furst, and I (Dick) raised these problems in a 1983 <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/ramsey/mpp.pdf">paper</a>, which Bill preserves on his site for papers related to Ramsey theory. The trivial way of having one person reveal another’s hidden number giving bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7Bf%2Ck%7D%28n%29+%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d_{f,k}(n) \leq n}" class="latex" /> (plus one or more bits needed for that person to speak the result of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" /> to all parties). The basic surprising fact is that, as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and for the above and other natural predicates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" />, one can do asymptotically much better than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Bill talked about his own <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/multicomm.pdf">paper</a> with Richard Beigel and James Glenn on the exact-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> case. It appeared at the MFCS 2006 conference. This paper is really neat because it shows the problem has depth and difficulty and ramifications beyond what I imagined back then. It gives connections to groups and regular expressions, besides refining our original application to branching programs. See also the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGBOOK/foreheadserious.pdf">update</a> that went with Bill’s talk.</p>

The paper gives a chart tracking the constant in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O}" class="latex" /> for the result giving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_%7Bf%2Ck%7D%28n%29+%3D+O%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{d_{f,k}(n) = O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" />.

Is that a coincidence? It relates to the density of sets of integers with no arithmetic progression of length 3, for which see this StackExchange <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1250622/largest-subset-with-no-arithmetic-progression">item</a> from last year, and this older <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apsurvey.pdf">survey</a> by Bill with Glenn and Kruskal.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The UCI mathematics department had a departmental colloquium today given by Noga Alon, titled “The Polynomial Method and its Algorithmic Aspects”. One part of his talk that I found very interesting was a collection of easy-to-state combinatorial problems where the existence of a solution can be proved, but there is no known efficient (polynomial time) algorithm for finding the solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(p\) be a prime number, and suppose that we are given two inputs: a sequence \(A=a_1,a_2,\dots a_k\) of elements of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), of length \(k\lt p\), not necessarily distinct from each other, and a set \(B\), also consisting of \(k\) elements of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), distinct but not ordered. Can we pair them up by assigning an ordering \(b_1,b_2,\dots\) to the elements of \(B\) so that all of the sums \(a_i+b_i\) are distinct? For instance, if all of the \(A\)’s are equal, then any ordering of the \(B\)’s will work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(G\) be a bipartite graph that has a perfect matching. Assign “non-degrees” to the vertices on one side of the bipartition, numbers that should not be the degree of the vertex. Can we delete some subset of the vertices on the other side, so that in the remaining graph each vertex’s degree is different from its non-degree? For instance, if the non-degrees are all zero, then \(G\) itself will work (it has nonzero degree because it has a perfect matching). If the non-degrees are all non-zero, then we can delete all of the vertices on the other side of the bipartition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(G\) be a planar graph with degree three at every vertex, and suppose also that each edge of \(G\) has a list of three colors available to it. Can we assign colors from these lists to the edges so that each vertex touches edges of three different colors?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let \(C_1\) and \(C_2\) be proper colorings of a large \(d\)-dimensional grid, using \(q\ge d+2\) colors, and let \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) be subsets of the vertices of the grid that are far apart from each other (I am not sure how far this needs to be but it seems to be \(d\pm O(1)\) or maybe \(q\pm O(1)\)). Can we find a proper coloring of the whole grid that blends between the two colorings, agreeing with each \(C_i\) on \(S_i\)? This one comes from a new paper by Alon, Raimundo Briceño, Nishant Chandgotia, Alexander Magazinov, and Yinon Spinka, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0963548320000395">“Mixing properties of colourings of the \(\mathbb{Z}^d\) lattice”, <em>Combinatorics, Probability and Computing</em> 2021</a>. Fewer colors will not always work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In all of these cases, the answer to the existence problem is yes, but we don’t know of an efficient algorithm for finding the structure that is supposed to exist. Instead, Alon proves the existence non-constructively, through a combinatorial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz">Nullstellensatz</a> encoding the principle that low-degree polynomials don’t have many roots. For one-variable polynomials of degree \(d\), for instance, there cannot be more than \(d\) values at which the polynomial is zero. But the degree really has to be \(d\), and not merely at most \(d\), because the degree-zero constant-zero polynomial is zero everywhere.</p>

<p>The analogous principle Alon uses for higher numbers of variables is the following: Let \(p\) be a polynomial of degree \(d\) in the variables \(x_1,x_2,\dots x_n\), over some field, and let \(t_i\) be the exponents of a nonzero monomial \(\prod_i x_i^{t_i}\) of degree \(d\) in \(p\). Additionally, let \(S_i\) be (not necessarily distinct) sets of \(t_i+1\) elements. Then we can choose an element \(s_i\) in each \(S_i\) such that \(p(s_1,s_2,\dots)\) is non-zero. Alon surveys this principle and its applications in his paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0963548398003411">“Combinatorial Nullstellensatz”, <em>Combinatorics, Probability and Computing</em> 1999</a>.</p>

<p>The hard parts about using this method to prove existence in combinatorial problems such as the ones above are finding the right polynomial and proving that it has a nonzero coefficient at the right monomial. The problem on reordering with distinct pairwise sums, for instance, comes from Alon’s paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02773567">“Additive Latin transversals”, <em>Israel J. Math.</em> 2000</a> and uses the polynomial</p>

\[\prod_{i\lt j}(x_i-x_j)(a_i+x_i-a_j-x_j)\]

<p>where each \(S_i=B\), the first terms in the product can only be nonzero if each \(x_i\) is chosen to be a distinct member of \(B\), and the second terms in the product can only be nonzero if the pairwise sums are different from each other. The coefficient of the monomial \(\prod x_i^{k-1}\) turns out to be (up to sign) exactly \(k!\), which is nonzero modulo \(p\) by the assumptions that \(p\) is prime and \(k\lt p\). The nonzero coefficients for the other two problems are not so easy to compute: they are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_(mathematics)">permanent</a> (number of perfect matchings) and the number of 3-edge-colorings of the given graphs. For the case of 3-edge-colorings, the fact that this number is nonzero is one of the equivalent forms of the 4-color theorem.</p>

<p>The general problem of constructing a nonzero solution to an instance of the combinatorial Nullstellensatz whose polynomial is described by an arithmetic circuit is (according to Alon) as hard as inverting arbitrary one-way permutations, a standard cryptographic primitive. This suggests that a polynomial-time construction algorithm does not exist; if it did exist, it would break a lot of modern cryptography. On the other hand, proving that it does not exist would also prove \(\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}\). Despite this relation to standard hard problems, there’s no strong reason for believing that any of the combinatorial problems outlined above is as hard as the general case, so maybe they might still have an efficient algorithm. If so, it would probably translate into an existence proof that is substantially different than the ones we already have for these problems.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>In the <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/synth-data-0/">last blog post</a>, we covered the potential pitfalls of synthetic data without formal privacy guarantees, and motivated the need for differentially private synthetic data mechanisms.  In this blog post, we will describe the <strong>select-measure-generate</strong> paradigm, which is a simple and effective template for designing synthetic data mechanisms.  The three steps underlying the select-measure-generate paradigm are illustrated and explained below.</p>

<p><img src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/select-measure-reconstruct.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Select</strong> a collection of queries to measure — typically low-dimensional marginals.</li>
  <li><strong>Measure</strong> the selected queries privately using a noise-addition mechanism.</li>
  <li><strong>Generate</strong> synthetic data that best explains the noisy measurements.<sup id="fnref:0"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:0" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>Mechanisms in this class differ primarily in their methodology for selecting queries and their algorithm for generating synthetic data from noisy measurements.  The focus of this blog post is the final <strong>Generate</strong> step.  Specifically, we will explore different ways in which one can model data distributions for the purpose of generating synthetic data, outlining the qualitative pros and cons of each method. We will then introduce the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ryan112358/private-pgm" target="_blank">Marginal-Based Inference (MBI)</a></strong> repository that provides methods that, given some set of noisy measurements, enables users to generate synthetic data in a generic and scalable way.</p>

<p>Separating the Generate subroutine from the existing synthetic data generation mechanisms greatly simplifies the design space of new differentially private mechanisms.  It allows the mechanism designer to focus on <em>selecting the queries</em> to maximize utility of the synthetic data, rather than <em>how to generate synthetic data</em> that explain the noisy measurements well.  Both are challenging technical problems that require different techniques to solve, and MBI provides principled solutions to the latter problem, while exposing an interface that can be readily adopted by mechanism designers.</p>

<h1 id="the-generate-subproblem-a-unifying-view">The Generate Subproblem: A Unifying View</h1>

<p>In this section we will introduce the main optimization problem that underlies several methods for the Generate subproblem, and provide a high-level overview of how each method attempts to solve this optimization problem. Let \( y = \mathcal{M}(D) \) be the noisy measurements obtained from running a privacy mechanism on a discrete dataset \( D \).  Our goal is to post-process these noise measurements to obtain synthetic data that explains them well.  In particular, we wish to minimize over the space of all <em>datasets</em> for one that maximizes the likelihood of the observations \( y \).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>\[ \hat{D} \in \text{arg} \max_{D \in \mathcal{D}} \log \mathbb{P}[\mathcal{M}(D) = y] \]</p>

<p>This is a high-dimensional discrete optimization problem, and is generally intractable to solve in practice, even in low-dimensional settings.  It is common to consider the relaxed problem that instead optimizes over the set of <em>probability distributions</em> \( \mathcal{S} \):</p>

<p>\[ \hat{P} \in \text{arg} \max_{P \in \mathcal{S}} \log \mathbb{P}[\mathcal{M}(P) = y] \label{eq1} \tag{1} \]</p>

<p>More generally, we can consider any objective function that measures how well \( P \) explains \( y \).  The log-likelihood is a natural choice, although other choices are also possible and used in practice.  In the special-but-common case where the mechanism is an instance of the Gaussian mechanism, we have \( \mathcal{M}(D) = f(D) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)^k \) and \( \log \mathbb{P}[\mathcal{M}(P) = y] \propto - || f(P) - y ||_2^2 \).  If \( f \) is a linear function of \( P \), then Problem \ref{eq1} is simply a quadratic program.  In the subsequent subsections, we will describe different approaches to solve or approximately solve Problem \ref{eq1}.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 1</strong>: The distribution learned from solving Problem \ref{eq1} will resemble the true data with respect to the statistics measured by \( \mathcal{M} \).  It may or may not accurately preserve other statistics — that is data dependent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 2</strong>: The most common statistics to measure are <strong>low-dimensional marginals</strong>.  A marginal for a subset of attributes counts the number of records in the dataset that match each setting of possible values. They are appealing statistics to measure because:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They capture low-dimensional structure common in real world data distributions.</li>
    <li>Each cell in a marginal is a count, a statistic that is fairly robust to noise.</li>
    <li>One individual can only contribute to a single cell of a marginal, so all cells have low sensitivity and can be measured simultaneously with low privacy cost.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="direct">Direct</h3>

<p>We can attempt to solve Problem \ref{eq1} directly by utilizing any algorithm for convex optimization over the probability simplex, such as multiplicative weights.  This method works well in low-dimensional regimes, although quickly becomes intractable for higher-dimensional domains, where it is generally intractable to even enumerate all the entries of a single distribution \( P \), let alone optimize over the space of all distributions.</p>

<p>Until recently, variants of the direct method were the only general-purpose solutions available for this problem, and as a result, many mechanisms struggled to scale to high-dimensional domains.  Recently, several methods have been proposed that attempt to overcome the curse of dimensionality inherent in the direct approach, which scale by imposing additional assumptions on the mechanism \( \mathcal{M} \) and/or by relaxing the optimization problem.  A common theme is to restrict attention to a subset of joint distributions which have tractable representations.     The sections below describe these more scalable methods, including the different (implicit) assumptions each method makes, as well as the consequences of those assumptions.</p>

<h3 id="probabilistic-graphical-models-pgm">Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM)</h3>

<p>The first method we describe is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09136" target="\_blank">PGM</a>, which was a key component of the first-place solution in the 2018 NIST Differential Privacy <a href="https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/past-prize-challenges/2018-differential-privacy-synthetic" target="\_blank">Synthetic Data Competition</a> and in both the first and second-place solutions in the follow-up <a href="https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/current-and-upcoming-prize-challenges/2020-differential" target="\_blank">Temporal Map Competition</a>.</p>

<p>PGM scales by restricting attention to distributions that can be represented as a graphical model \( P_{\theta} \).  The key observation of PGM is that when \( \mathcal{M} \) only depends on \( P \) through its low-dimensional marginals, then one of the optimizers of Problem \ref{eq1} is a graphical model with parameters \( \theta \).  In this case, Problem \ref{eq1} is under-determined and typically has infinitely many solutions.  It turns out that the solution found by PGM has maximum entropy among all solutions to the problem — a very natural way to break ties among equally good solutions. Remarkably, these facts are true for any dataset — they do not require the underlying data to be generated from a graphical model with the same structure <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04978" target="\_blank">[MMS21]</a>.</p>

<p>The parameter vector \( \theta \) is often much smaller than \( P \), and we can efficiently optimize it, bypassing the curse of dimensionality in this special case.  The size of \( \theta \) and in turn the complexity of PGM depends on the mechanism \( \mathcal{M} \), and in the worst case is the same as the Direct method.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>  However, in many common cases of practical interest, the complexity of PGM is exponentially better than that of Direct, in which case we can efficiently solve the optimization problem above, finding \( \theta \) and thus a tractable representation of \( \hat{P} \).  The complexity ultimately depends on the size of the junction tree derived from the mechanism \( \mathcal{M} \), and understanding this relationship requires some expertise in graphical models.  However, if we utilize this understanding to design \( \mathcal{M} \), we can avoid this worst-case behavior, as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04978" target="\_blank">MST</a> and <a href="http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2190-cai.pdf" target="\_blank">PrivMRF</a> do.</p>

<h3 id="relaxed-tabular">Relaxed Tabular</h3>

<p>An alternative approach was proposed in the recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06641" target="\_blank">RAP</a> paper.  The key idea is to restrict attention to “pseudo-distributions” that can be represented in a relaxed tabular format.  The format is similar to the one-hot encoding of a discrete dataset, although the entries need not be \( 0 \) or \( 1 \), which enables gradient-based optimization to be performed on the cells in this table.  The number of rows is a tunable knob that can be set to trade off expressive capacity with computational efficiency.  With a sufficiently large knob size, the true minimizer of the original problem can be expressed in this way, but there is no guarantee that gradient-based optimization will converge to it because this representation introduces non-convexity.  Moreover, the search space of this method includes “spurious” distributions, so even the global optimum of relaxed problem would not necessarily solve the original problem.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>  Despite these drawbacks, this method appears to work well in practice.</p>

<h3 id="generative-networks">Generative Networks</h3>

<p>Among the iterative methods introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07153" target="\_blank">[LVW21]</a> is GEM (Generative networks with the exponential mechanism), an approach inspired by generative adversarial networks. They propose representing any dataset as mixture of product distributions over attributes in the data domain. They implicitly encode such distributions using a generative neural network with a softmax layer. In concrete terms, given some Gaussian noise \( \mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \), their <strong>Generate</strong> step outputs \( f_\theta(\mathbf{z}) \) where \( f \) is some feedforward neural network parametrized by \( \theta \). \( f_\theta(\mathbf{z}) \) represents a collection of marginal distributions for each individual attribute in the domain, which can be used to directly answer any k-way marginal query. Alternatively, one can sample directly from \( f_\theta(\mathbf{z}) \) if the goal is generate synthetic tabular data.</p>

<p>Note that the size of \( \mathbf{z} \) can be arbitrarily large, meaning that this generative network approach can theoretically be scaled up to capture any distribution \( P \). Moreover, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07153">[LVW21]</a> show that one can achieve strong performance in practical settings even when \( \mathbf{z} \) is small, making such generative network approaches to scale in terms of both computation and memory. Howevever, as is commonly found in deep learning methods, this optimization problem is nonconvex.</p>

<h3 id="local-consistency">Local Consistency</h3>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07153" target="\_blank">GUM</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06153" target="\_blank">APPGM</a> do not search over any space of distributions, but instead impose <em>local consistency</em> constraints on the noisy measurements.  These methods relax Problem \ref{eq1} to optimize over the space of pseudo-marginals, rather than distributions.  The pseudo-marginals are required to be internally consistent, but there is no guarantee that there is a distribution which realizes those pseudo-marginals.  As a result, the solution found by these methods need not be feasible in Problem \ref{eq1}.  Nevertheless, we can attempt to generate synthetic data using heuristics to translate these locally consistent pseudo-marginals into synthetic tabular data.  This approach was used by team DPSyn in both NIST competitions.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>A qualitative comparison between the discussed methods is given in the table below.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 3</strong>: Among the alternatives discussed here, only Direct and PGM can be expected to solve Problem \ref{eq1}.    The alternatives fail to solve Problem \ref{eq1} in general, either from non-convexity, or from introducing spurious distributions to the search space.  This distinguishing feature of PGM comes at a cost: the complexity can be much higher than the alternatives, and in the worst-case, will not be feasible to run.  In such cases, one of the approximations must be used instead.</p>

<p>Now that we have introduced the techniques underlying the Generate step, we will show how to utilize the implementations in the MBI repository to develop end-to-end mechanisms for differentially private synthetic data.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-noisy-measurements">Preparing Noisy Measurements</h2>

<p>The input to any method for Generate is a collection of noisy measurements.  We show below how to prepare these measurements in a format compatible with the methods for Generate implemented in the MBI repository.  The measurements are represented as a list, where each element of the list is a noisy marginal (represented as a numpy array), along with relevant metadata including the attributes in the marginal and the amount of noise used to answer it.  In the code snippet below, the selected marginals are hard-coded, but in general this list can be modified to tailor the synthetic data towards a different set of marginals.</p>

<p>The above code snippet is a 5-fold composition of Gaussian mechanisms with \( \sigma = 50 \), and hence the entire mechanism is \( \frac{5}{2 \sigma^2} = \frac{1}{1000} \)-zCDP.</p>

<h2 id="generating-synthetic-data-from-measurements">Generating Synthetic Data from Measurements</h2>

<p>Given measurements represented in the format above, we can readily generate synthetic data using one of several methods.  For example, the code snippet below generates synthetic data that approximately matches the noisy measurements:</p>

<p>To generate synthetic data, we have to simply instantiate one of the inference engines imported.  In the code snippet above, we use the FactoredInference engine, which corresponds to the PGM method.  The other inference engines share the same interface, and can be used instead if desired.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 4</strong>: By utilizing the inference engines implemented in MBI, end-to-end synthetic data mechanisms can be written with remarkably little code.  This simple example required less than 25 lines of code, and <a href="https://github.com/ryan112358/private-pgm/tree/master/mechanisms" target="\_blank">more complex mechanisms</a> can usually be written in a single file with less than 200 lines of code.  As a result, future research can focus on the measurement selection subproblem, and new ideas can more rapidly be evaluated and iterated on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We evaluated the quality of the synthetic data generated by measuring the error of the measured marginals.  Interestingly, the synthetic data has lower error than the noisy marginals, with reductions in error up to 30% for the larger marginals, and around 3% for the smaller ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/smr1.png" alt="" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 5:</strong> It is not surprising that the synthetic data enjoys lower error than the noisy marginals.  Problem \ref{eq1} can be seen as a <em>projection problem</em>, and there is substantial theoretical <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0297" target="\_blank">[NTZ12]</a> and empirical [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2783258.2783366" target="\_blank">LWK15</a>, <a href="https://systems.cs.columbia.edu/private-systems-class/papers/Abowd2019Census.pdf" target="\_blank">AAGK+19</a>] evidence that solving this problem reduces error.  Intuitively, the benefit arises due to the inconsistencies in the noisy observations that are resolved through the optimization procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can also use the synthetic data to estimate marginals we didn’t measure with the Gaussian mechanism.  These estimates may or may not be accurate, it depends on the data and the marginal being estimated.  For example, the error on the (sex, income&gt;50K) marginal is around 0.02, while the error on the (education-num, occupation) marginal is about 0.5.</p>

<p><img src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/smr2.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Remark 6:</strong> The fact that the synthetic data is not accurate for some marginals is not a limitation of the method used for Generate, but rather an artifact of what marginals were selected.  Thus, it is clear that selecting the right marginals to measure plays a crucial role in the quality of the synthetic data. This is an important open problem that will be the topic of a future blog post.</p>

      <p>The Generate step is a post-processing of already privatized noisy marginals, and therefore the privacy analysis only needs to reason about the first two steps. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:0" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>Here we assume that \( \mathcal{M} \) is a mechanism with a discrete output space.  In practice, this is always the case because any mechanism implemented on a finite computer must have a discrete output space.  For continuous output spaces, interpret the objective function as a log density rather than a log probability. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:6">
      <p>For example, this worst-case behavior is realized if <strong>all</strong> 2-way marginals are measured.  While this can be seen as a limitation of PGM, <a href="http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/research/synthetic-Feb2010.pdf">it is known</a> that generating synthetic data that preserves all 2-way marginals is computationally hard in the worst-case. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:9">
      <p>This idea was refined into <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07153" target="\_blank">RAP<sup>softmax</sup></a> in follow-up-work, which overcomes the latter issue, but does not resolve the non-convexity issue. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:9" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:7">
      <p>These approximations were all developed concurrently, and systematic empirical comparisons between them (and PGM) have not been done to date.  Some experimental comparisons can be found in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07153" target="\_blank">[LVW21]</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06153">[MPSM21]</a>. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

<p>The screenwriter Aaron Sorkin wrote an <a href="https://ew.com/movies/aaron-sorkin-column-biopics-being-the-ricardos/">article</a> on prioritizing "Truth over Accuracy". He tells stories from his movies The Social Network and Being the Ricardos, of where he moves away from accuracy to get to the truth of a situation.</p><blockquote><p>My friend and teacher, the late William Goldman, said of his Academy Award-winning screenplay for All the President's Men, "If I'm telling the true story of the fall of the President of the United States, the last thing I'm going to do is make anything up." I understand what he meant in context, but the fact is, as soon as he wrote "FADE IN," he'd committed to making things up. People don't speak in dialogue, and their lives don't play out in a series of scenes that form a narrative. Dramatists do that. They prioritize truth over accuracy. Paintings over photographs.</p></blockquote><p>As scientists we focus on accuracy, as we should in our scientific publications. However being fully accurate can distract from the "truth", the underlying message you want to say, particularly in the title, abstract and introduction of our papers </p><p>Even more so when we promote our research to the public. A science writer once <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/04/view-of-science-writer.html">lamented to me</a> that scientists would focus too much on the full accuracy of the science and the names behind it, even though neither serves the reader well.</p><p>Reminds me of the recent Netflix movie <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81252357">Don't Look Up</a> satirizes scientists trying to communicate an end-of-the-world event to an untrusting society. I wish it was a better movie but still worth watching just to see Leo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence play scientists frustrated with their ability to communicate a true existential crisis to the government and the general public. </p><p>So how should we as scientists try to frame our messaging to get people onboard, particularly when we say things they don't want to hear? Most importantly, how do scientists regain trust in a world where trust is in short supply. Perhaps we should paint more and photograph less.</p></div>

<p>In the past few months, I’ve twice injured the same ankle while playing with my kids.  This, perhaps combined with covid, led me to several indisputable realizations:</p>



<ol><li>I am mortal.</li><li>Despite my self-conception as a nerdy little kid awaiting the serious people’s approval, I am now firmly middle-aged.  By my age, Einstein had completed general relativity, Turing had founded CS, won WWII, <em>and</em> proposed the Turing Test, and Galois, Ramanujan, and Ramsey had been dead for years.</li><li>Thus, whatever I wanted to accomplish in my intellectual life, I should probably get started on it <em>now</em>.</li></ol>



<p>Hence today’s post.  I’m feeling a strong compulsion to write an essay, or possibly even a book, surveying and critically evaluating a century of ideas about the following question:</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why should the universe have been quantum-mechanical?</strong></p>



<p>If you want, you can divide Q into two subquestions:</p>



<p><strong>Q1: Why didn’t God just make the universe classical and be done with it?  What would’ve been wrong with <em>that</em> choice?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Q2: Assuming classical physics wasn’t good enough for whatever reason, why this specific alternative?  Why the complex-valued amplitudes?  Why unitary transformations?  Why the Born rule?  Why the tensor product?</strong></p>



<p>Despite its greater specificity, Q2 is ironically the question that I feel we have a better handle on.  I could spend half a semester teaching theorems that admittedly don’t <em>answer</em> Q2, as satisfyingly as Einstein answered the question “why the Lorentz transformations?,” but that at least render this particular set of mathematical choices (the 2-norm, the Born Rule, complex numbers, etc.) orders-of-magnitude less surprising than one might’ve thought they were <em>a priori</em>.  Q1 therefore stands, to me at least, as the more mysterious of the two questions.</p>



<p>So, I want to write something about the space of credible answers to Q, and especially Q1, that humans can currently conceive.  I want to do this for my own sake as much as for others’.  I want to do it because I regard Q as one of the biggest questions ever asked, for which it seems plausible to me that there’s simply an <em>answer</em> that most experts would accept as valid once they saw it, but for which no such answer is known.  And also because, besides having spent 25 years working in quantum information, I have the following qualifications for the job:</p>



<ul><li><span style="color: initial;">I don’t dismiss either Q1 </span><em style="color: initial;">or</em><span style="color: initial;"> Q2 as silly; and</span></li><li>crucially, I don’t think I already know the answers, and merely need better arguments to justify them.  I’m genuinely uncertain and confused.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The purpose of this post is to invite you to share your own answers to Q in the comments section.</strong>  Before I embark on my survey project, I’d better know if there are promising ideas that I’ve missed, and this blog seems like as good a place as any to crowdsource the job.</p>



<p>Any answer is welcome, no matter how wild or speculative, <em>so long as it honestly grapples with the actual nature of QM</em>.  To illustrate, nothing along the lines of “the universe is quantum because it needs to be holistic, interconnected, full of surprises, etc. etc.” will cut it, since such answers leave utterly unexplained why the world wasn’t simply endowed with those properties directly, rather than specifically via <em>generalizing the rules of probability to allow interference and noncommuting observables</em>.</p>



<p>Relatedly, whatever “design goal” you propose for the laws of physics, if the goal is satisfied by QM, but satisfied <em>even better</em> by theories that provide <em>even more</em> power than QM does—for instance, superluminal signalling, or violations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson%27s_bound">Tsirelson’s bound</a>, or the efficient solution of NP-complete problems—then your explanation is out.  This is a remarkably strong constraint.</p>



<p>Oh, needless to say, don’t try my patience with anything about the uncertainty principle being due to floating-point errors or rendering bugs, or anything else that relies on a travesty of QM lifted from a popular article or meme! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /></p>



<p>OK, maybe four more comments to enable a more productive discussion, before I shut up and turn things over to you:</p>



<ol><li>I’m aware, of course, of the radical uncertainty about what form an answer to Q should even take.  Am I asking you to psychoanalyze the will of God in creating the universe?  Or, what perhaps amounts to the same thing, am I asking for the design objectives of the giant computer simulation that we’re living in?  (As in, “I’m 100% fine with living inside a Matrix … I just want to understand why it’s a <em>unitary</em> matrix!”)  Am I instead asking for an anthropic explanation, showing why <em>of course</em> QM would be needed if you wanted life or consciousness like ours?  Am I “merely” asking for simpler or more intuitive physical principles from which QM is to be derived as a consequence?  Am I asking why QM is the “most elegant choice” in some space of mathematical options … even to the point where, with hindsight, a 19th-century mathematician or physicist could’ve been convinced that <em>of course</em> this must be part of Nature’s plan?  Am I asking for something else entirely?  <strong>You get to decide</strong>!<strong>  Should you take up my challenge, this is both your privilege and your terrifying burden.</strong><br /></li><li>I’m aware, of course, of the dizzying array of central physical phenomena that rely on QM for their ultimate explanation.  These phenomena range from the stability of matter itself, which depends on the Pauli exclusion principle; to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun, which depends on a quantum tunneling effect; to the discrete energy levels of electrons (and hence, the combinatorial nature of chemistry), which relies on electrons being waves of probability amplitude that can only circle nuclei an integer number of times if their crests are to meet their troughs.  Important as they are, though, I don’t regard any of these phenomena as satisfying answers to Q in themselves.  The reason is simply that, in each case, it would seem like child’s-play to contrive some classical mechanism to produce the same effect, were that the goal.  QM just seems far too grand to have been the answer to <em>these</em> questions!  An exponentially larger state space for all of reality, <em>plus</em> the end of Newtonian determinism, just to overcome the technical problem that accelerating charges radiate energy in classical electrodynamics, thereby rendering atoms unstable?  It reminds me of the <em>Simpsons</em> episode where Homer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ6cCaEy5eo">uses a teleportation machine</a> to get a beer from the fridge without needing to get up off the couch.<br /></li><li>I’m aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason%27s_theorem">Gleason’s theorem</a>, and of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401062">specialness</a> of the 1-norm and 2-norm in linear algebra, and of the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4021">arguments for complex amplitudes</a> as opposed to reals or quaternions, and of the beautiful work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101012">Lucien Hardy</a> and of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00398">Chiribella et al.</a> and others on axiomatic derivations of quantum theory.  As some of you might remember, I even discussed much of this material in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em>!  There’s a <em>huge</em> amount to say about these fascinating justifications for the rules of QM, and I hope to say some of it in my planned survey!  For now, I’ll simply remark that every axiomatic reconstruction of QM that I’ve seen, impressive though it was, has relied on one or more axioms that struck me as <em>weird</em>, in the sense that I’d have little trouble dismissing the axioms as totally implausible and unmotivated if I hadn’t already known (from QM, of course) that they were true.  The axiomatic reconstructions <em>do</em> help me somewhat with Q2, but little if at all with Q1.<br /></li><li>To keep the discussion focused, in this post I’d like to exclude answers along the lines of “but what if QM is merely an approximation to something else?,” to say nothing of “a century of evidence for QM was all just a massive illusion!  LOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES FOR THE WIN!!!”  We can have those debates another day—God knows that, here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, we <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6215">have</a> and we will.  Here I’m asking instead: imagine that, as fantastical as it sounds, QM were not only exactly true, but (along with relativity, thermodynamics, evolution, and the tastiness of chocolate) one of the profoundest truths our sorry species had ever discovered.  Why should I have <em>expected</em> that truth all along?  What possible reasons to expect it have I missed?</li></ol>

Ken Regan is well known to us all, and is the co-author of this blog. He is in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo (SUNY)–as part of the theory group. He is also an International Master from the World Chess Federation (FIDE).<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kr.png?ssl=1"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kr.png?resize=600%2C643&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19573" height="643" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken’s Trip </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken has used his ability in theory with his expertise in chess to study how to detect cheating in chess. Unfortunately people do currently cheat in chess, and so detecting them is an important problem for FIDE. Ken has just spent some time in Bologna, Italy at the International Chess Federation Fair Play Commission’s meeting. The group’s goal is:  There is an increasing demand for fair play experts during chess events, and we want to provide the organizers with professionals who know how to collect evidence, apply law, use the state-of-the-art detection tools. And do it in the way that players are protected and public perception of how important the fair play is improved. </p>
<p>
Ken is on the way back from Italy and soon will explain in detail what is the latest about cheating in chess.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Cheating In The Past </b></p>
<p></p><p>
In the past cheating at chess started with machines like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk">Turk</a> of 1770. This was a machine that claimed to play chess without human help. Even just playing legal moves would have been impressive, but the Turk played strong chess.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/turk.jpg?ssl=1"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/turk.jpg?resize=600%2C462&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19574" height="462" /></a></p>
<p>
The secret to the Turk is it used a hidden human chess player to make its moves. The player was hidden inside the machine. The audience was allowed to examine the machine by opening and looking at parts of the machine. The audience member could only examine one part of the Turk at a time. The trick was that the player could move from one part of the Turk to another. At each time some parts of the Turk would be visible, but some part stayed invisible. This meant the player could move from one part to another of the Turk. This fooled the audience and made it seem “magical” that the mechanical system could play chess.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/show.png?ssl=1"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/show.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19577" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Cheating Now and in the Future </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Cheating at chess became interesting again when computer programs started to play strong chess—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess">cheating</a>. The fundamental insight was that once programs could play master level chess, players could cheat and play at this level. The idea was simple: A player would not look at the board and select the next move. They would instead ask the program what move should they do. They would then use that move.</p>
<p>
Of course a serious issue was how could the player ask a program to make the next move? If the game they were playing was offline, then the player should be able to use their laptop to remotely run the program. If the game was played in some public place, then the player might have to work harder to run the program. But a player could perhaps still do this without being detected. </p>
<p>
 Technology has been used by chess cheaters in several ways. The most common way is to use a chess program while playing chess remotely, such as on the Internet or in correspondence chess. Rather than play the game directly, the cheater simply inputs the moves so far into the program and follows its suggestions, essentially letting the program play for them. Electronic communication with an accomplice during face-to-face competitive chess is a similar type of cheating; the accomplice can either be using a computer program or else simply be a much better player than their associate.  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
The main open problem is still: How well can cheating be detected? The basic idea is simple: Suppose that the player named Carol plays a game in some tournament. We wish to determine whether Carol played her own moves or whether she used moves of some program. How can we do this? There are several issues that make this hard. </p>
<ol>
<li> Carol may stay on “book” at the beginning. How do we factor this in?
</li><li> Carol may have used a program that is secret. Does this effect the detection?
</li><li> Carol may follow a program for all moves or for some of the moves. Does this make the detection more difficult?
</li><li> Carol may already be a strong player. Suppose she uses the program to play at a stronger level. Is this even more difficult to detect?
</li></ol>
<p>
Ken will update us on the latest views of these and other issues. </p>

<p> Is it an irony that Lipton's 1000th post and 75th bday are close together? No. Its a coincidence. People use irony/paradox/coincidence interchangeably. Hearing people make that mistake makes me literally want to strangle them. </p><p>The community celebrated this milestone by having  talks on zoom in Lipton's honor. The  blog post by Ken Regan that announced the event and has a list of speakers is <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/14/happy-1000th-post-and-75th-birthday-dick/">here</a>. The talks were recorded so they should be available soon. YEAH KEN for organizing the event! We may one day be celebrating his 2000th blog post/Xth bday. </p><p>I will celebrate this milestone by writing on how Lipton and his work have inspired and enlightened me. </p><p><br /></p><p>1) My talk at the Lipton zoom-day-of-talks was on the Chandra-Furst-Lipton (1983)  paper (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/CFG-multiparty.pdf">here</a>) that sparked my interest in Ramsey Theory, lead to a paper I wrote that improved their upper and lower bounds, and lead to an educational open problem that I posted on this blog, that was answered. There is still more to do.  An expanded version of the slide talk I gave on the zoom-day is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/liptonbdaytalk.pdf">here</a>. (Their paper also got me interested in Communication complexity.) </p><p>2) I read the De Millo-Lipton-Perlis (1979) paper (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">here</a>) my first year in graduate school and found it very enlightening. NOT about program verification, which I did not know much about, but about how mathematics really works.  As an ugrad I was very much into THEOREM-PROOF-THEOREM-PROOF as the basis for truth. This is wrongheaded for two reasons (1) I did not see the value of intuition, and (2) I did not realize that the PROOF is not the END of the story, but the BEGINNING of a process of checking it- many people over time have to check a result. DLP woke me up to point (2) and (to a lesser extend) point (1). A scary thought: most results in math, once published, are never looked at again. So their could be errors in the math literature. However, the important results DO get looked at quite carefully. Even so, I worry that an important result will depend on one that has not been looked at much...Anyway, a link to a  blog post about a symposium about DLP is <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">here</a>.</p><p>3) The Karp-Lipton theorem is: <i> if SAT has poly sized circuits than PH collapses</i> (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800141.804678">here</a>), It connects uniform and non-uniform complexity.  This impressed me but also made me thing about IF-THEN statements. In this case something we don't think is true implies something else we don't think is true. So--- do we know something? Yes! The result has been used to get results like </p><p>                                                   If GI is NPC then PH collapses.</p><p>This is evidence that GI is not NPC. </p><p>4) Lipton originally blogged by himself and a blog book came out of that. I reviewed it in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/41-4.pdf">this</a> column. Later it became the  Lipton-Regan blog, which also gave rise to a book, which I reviewed   <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/05/review-of-people-problems-and-proofs-by.html#comment-form">here</a>.  Both of these books inspired my blog book. This is a shout-out to BOTH Lipton AND Regan.</p><p>5) Lipton either thinks P=NP or pretends to since he wants people to NOT all think the same thing. Perhaps someone will prove P NE NP while trying to prove P=NP. Like in <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the</i> <i>Galaxy </i>where they say that to fly, you throw yourself on the ground and miss. I took Lipton's advice in another context: While trying to prove that there IS a protocol for 11 muffins, 5 students where everyone gets 11/5 and the smallest piece is 11/25, I wrote down what such a protocol  would have to satisfy (I was sincerely trying to find such a protocol) and ended up proving that you could not do better than 13/30 (for which I already had a protocol). Reminds me of a quote attributed to Erdos: when trying to prove X, spend half your time trying to prove X and half trying to prove NOT(X).</p><p>6) Lipton had a blog post (probably also a paper someplace) about using Ramsey Theory as the basis for a proof system (see <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/06/13/a-proof-system-based-on-ramsey-theory/">here</a>).  That inspired me to propose a potential randomized n^{log n) algorithm for the CLIQUE-GAP problem (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/07/slightly-diff-take-on-liptons-use-or.html">here</a>). The comments showed why the idea could not work-- no surprise as my idea would have lead to NP contained in RTIME(n^{log n}). Still, it was fun to think about and I learned things in the effort. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

These objects imply unproven circuit lower bounds and our construction is secure provided E requires exponential size nondeterministic circuits, an assumption from the derandomization literature.
	
	Prior works on NMC for polysize circuits, either required an untamperable CRS [Cheraghchi, Guruswami ITCS'14; Faust, Mukherjee, Venturi, Wichs EUROCRYPT'14] or very strong cryptographic assumptions [Ball, Dachman-Soled, Kulkarni, Lin, Malkin EUROCRYPT'18; Dachman-Soled, Komargodski, Pass CRYPTO'21]. Both of works in the latter category only achieve non-malleability with respect to efficient distinguishers and, more importantly, utilize cryptographic objects for which no provably secure instantiations are known outside the random oracle model. In this sense, none of the prior yields fully explicit codes from non-heuristic assumptions. Our assumption is not known to imply the existence of one-way functions, which suggests that cryptography is unnecessary for non-malleability against this class.
	
	Technically, security is shown by \emph{non-deterministically} reducing polynomial size tampering to split-state tampering. The technique is general enough that it allows us to to construct the first \emph{seedless non-malleable extractors} [Cheraghchi, Guruswami TCC'14] for sources sampled by polynomial size circuits [Trevisan, Vadhan FOCS'00] (resp. recognized by polynomial size circuits [Shaltiel CC'11]) and tampered by polynomial size circuits. Our construction is secure assuming E requires exponential size $\Sigma_4$-circuits (resp. $\Sigma_3$-circuits), this assumption is the state-of-the-art for extracting randomness from such sources (without non-malleability).
	
	We additionally observe that non-malleable codes and non-malleable secret sharing [Goyal, Kumar STOC'18]  are essentially equivalent with respect to polynomial size tampering. In more detail, assuming E is hard for exponential size nondeterministic circuits, any efficient secret sharing scheme can be made non-malleable against polynomial size circuit tampering.
	
	Unfortunately, all of our constructions only achieve inverse polynomial (statistical) security. Extending a result from [Applebaum, Artemenko, Shaltiel, Yang CC'16] we show it is impossible to do better using black-box reductions. However, we extend the notion of relative error from [Applebaum, Artemenko, Shaltiel, Yang CC'16] to non-malleable extractors and show that they can be constructed from similar assumptions. We additionally observe that relative-error non-malleable extractors can be utilized to render a broad class of cryptographic primitives tamper and leakage resilient, while preserving negligible security guarantees.</div>

Peter Winkler is featured in the current issue of the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/17/dinner-drinks-denominators">New Yorker</a> magazine. Peter is a famous Dartmouth mathematics professor. He is an expert on math puzzles, both for making them and solving them—see his <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Mathematical_Puzzles/XWwNEAAAQBAJ?hl=en">book</a>, simply titled <em>Mathematical Puzzles</em>.</p>

A recent evening of mathematical dinner theater hosted by Peter is the subject of the article, which is by <a href="https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/daniel-rockmore">Dan Rockmore</a>, also of the Dartmouth math department. This event was co-coordinated by <a href="https://momath.org/cindy-lawrence/">Cindy Lawrence</a>, who is executive director of the National Museum of Mathematics:</p>

<p></p><p><br />
The event was attended by a group of investors, economists. and teachers in a suitable alcove of a restaurant in Manhattan.  Quoting Rockmore’s article:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Winkler began the evening’s program. The first course of math, delivered during the first course of dinner (a scattering of salads), was a statistics starter called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox">Simpson’s paradox</a>. The paradox explains how apparent biases in large samples can disappear in smaller ones. A famous example: For the University of California at Berkeley’s graduate programs in 1975, over all, men were admitted at a higher rate than women, but, program by program, women were admitted at a higher rate. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
About Berkeley, see <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/posts/2016-05-08-simpsons-paradox-berkeley.html">this</a> first. We covered Simpson’s paradox <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/01/30/global-warming/">here</a>. The article goes on the mention the famous trick of how a biased coin can be made to simulate a fair coin by tossing it twice, and continues:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Winkler let loose with the last official mind bender, a gambling thought experiment involving a fictitious couple named Alice and Bob, who are famous in math circles. Each of them has a biased coin—fifty-one-per-cent chance of heads, forty-nine-per-cent chance of tails. They each start with a hundred dollars, flipping the coin and betting against the bank on the outcome. Alice calls heads every time; Bob calls tails. The puzzle: Given that they both go broke, which one is more likely to have gone broke first? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The article relates that most diners guessed Bob, but the correct answer is Alice. Former Times math and science columnist John Tierney, a serious enough math fan to have remarked once that the term “recreational mathematics” is a self-contradiction, reasoned it out: “The longer Alice plays, the less likely she is to go broke.” We finish Tierney’s intent by contraposing: hence given that she too went broke, the more likely it was she that played less time.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Old Friend </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Peter is a long time friend of mine. See him in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg6XZcNAgrw">here</a>. He is a delight to talk to about many things—just about any part of math. </p>
<p>
Peter has a <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/solutions.pdf">paper</a> with the title, “Seven Puzzles You Think You Must Not Have Heard Correctly.” I had already started writing this post when I looked up this paper to get a few more puzzle examples. I found this one:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> #4 <b>Unwanted Expansion:</b> <br />
Suppose you have an algebraic expression involving variables, addition, multiplication, and parentheses. You repeatedly attempt to expand it using the distributive law. How do you know that the expression doesn’t continue to expand forever? Comment: Note that applying the distributive law to, say, the outer product in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x+%2B+y%29%28s%28u+%2B+v%29+%2B+t%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(x + y)(s(u + v) + t)}" class="latex" />, yields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%28s%28u+%2B+v%29+%2B+t%29+%2B+y%28s%28u+%2B+v%29+%2B+t%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x(s(u + v) + t) + y(s(u + v) + t)}" class="latex" /> which has more parentheses than before. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought about this for a little. Then I looked up the answer. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> One can analyze the expression in terms of depth of trees, but there’s an easier way: set all the variables equal to 2. The point of the distributive law is that its application doesn’t change the value of the expression. The value of the initial expression limits the size of anything you can get from it by expansion. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter then says: <i>This proof of stopping is due to Dick Lipton.</i> I must say that surprised me. I am getting old. Oops.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s end with a fun puzzle about the dictionary that is also mentioned in the <em>New Yorker</em> article.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/20/dinner-drinks-denominators/dictionary/" rel="attachment wp-att-19556"><img width="240" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dictionary.jpg?resize=240%2C156&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19556" height="156" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If each number between one and ten billion was written down in English, which odd number would appear first alphabetically? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Given that spaces do not count, here is the <a href="https://puzzleaday.wordpress.com/2018/10/05/what-is-the-first-odd-number-in-the-dictionary/">answer</a>. The last part changes because the number must be odd. If spaces do count—as in many dictionaries of phrases—then what is the answer?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://scottaaronson.blog" title="Shtetl-Optimized">Scott Aaronson</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Exciting news, everyone!  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaan_Tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</a>, who many of you might recognize as a co-creator of Skype, tech enthusiast, and philanthropist, graciously invited me, along with a bunch of other nerds, to join the new <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/speculation-grants">Speculation Grants</a> program of the <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/">Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF)</a>.  In plain language, that means that Jaan is <strong>giving me $200,000 to distribute to charitable organizations in any way I see fit</strong>—though ideally, my choices will have <em>something</em> to do with the survival and flourishing of our planet and civilization.</p>



<p>(If all goes well, this blog post will actually lead to a lot <em>more</em> than just $200,000 in donations, because it will inspire applications to SFF that can then be funded by other “Speculators” or by SFF’s usual process.)</p>



<p>Thinking about how to handle the responsibility of this amazing and unexpected gift, I decided that I couldn’t possibly improve on what Scott Alexander did with his <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results">personal grants program</a> on <em>Astral Codex Ten</em>.  Thus: I hereby invite the readers of <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> to pitch registered charities (which might or might not be their own)—especially, charities that are relatively small, unknown, and unappreciated, yet that would resonate strongly with someone who thinks the way I do.  Feel free to renominate (i.e., bring back to my attention) charities that were mentioned when I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5448">asked a similar question</a> after winning $250,000 from the ACM Prize in Computing.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, there’s a two-step process this time:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is to make your pitch to me, either by a comment on this post or by email to me, depending on whether you’d prefer the pitch to be public or private.  Let’s set a deadline for this step of <strong>Thursday, January 27, 2022</strong> (i.e., one week from now).  Your pitch can be extremely short, like 1 paragraph, although I might ask you followup questions.  After January 27, I’ll then take one of two actions in response: I’ll either</p>



<p>(a) commit a specified portion of my $200,000 to your charity, <em>if</em> the charity formally applies to SFF, and <em>if</em> the charity isn’t excluded for some unexpected reason (5 sexual harassment lawsuits against its founders or whatever), and <em>if</em> one of my fellow “Speculators” doesn’t fund your charity before I do … or else I’ll</p>



<p>(b) not commit, in which case your charity <strong>can still apply</strong> for funding from SFF!  One of the other Speculators might fund it, or it might be funded by the “ordinary” SFF process.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2</strong>, which <strong>cannot</strong> be skipped, is then to have your charity <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4PRBIP8CNCviFiNkSSMKy6Ms3sUJBOi_ykE8IDvTeB5Nr_A/viewform">submit a formal application</a> to SFF.  The application form isn’t too bad.  But if the charity isn’t your own, it would help enormously if you at least <em>knew</em> someone at the charity, so you could tell them to apply to SFF.  Again, Step 2 can be taken regardless of the outcome of Step 1.</p>



<p>The one big rule is that anything you suggest has to be a registered, tax-exempt charity in either the US or the UK.  I won’t be distributing funds myself, but only advising SFF how to do so, and this is SFF’s rule, not mine.  So alas, no political advocacy groups and no individuals.  Donating to groups outside the US and UK is apparently possible but difficult.</p>



<p>While I’m not putting any restrictions on the scope, let me list a few examples of areas of interest to me.</p>



<ul><li>Advanced math and science education at the precollege level: gifted programs, summer camps, online resources, or anything, really, that aims to ensure that the next Ramanujan or von Neumann isn’t lost to the world.</li><li>Conservation of endangered species.</li><li>Undervalued approaches to dealing with the climate catastrophe (including new approaches to nuclear energy, geoengineering, and carbon capture and storage … or even, e.g., studies of the effects of rising CO<sub>2</sub> on cognition and how to mitigate them).</li><li>Undervalued approaches to preventing or mitigating future pandemics—basically, anything dirt-cheap that we <em>wish</em> had been done before covid.</li><li>Almost anything that <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results">Scott Alexander might have funded</a> if he’d had more money.</li><li>Anything that would enrage the SneerClubbers or those who attack me on Twitter, by doing stuff that even <em>they</em> would have to acknowledge makes the world better, but that does so via people, organizations, and means that they despise.</li></ul>



<p>Two examples of areas that I <em>don’t</em> plan to focus on are:</p>



<ul><li>AI-risk and other “strongly rationalist-flavored” organizations (these are already well-covered by others at SFF, so that I don’t expect to have an advantage), and</li><li>quantum computing research (this is already funded by a zillion government agencies, companies, and venture capitalists).</li></ul>



<p>Anyway, thanks so much to Jaan and to SFF for giving me this incredible opportunity, and I look forward to seeing what y’all come up with!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Note:</span></strong> Any other philanthropists who read this blog, and who’d like to add to the amount, are more than welcome to do so!</p></div>

Read-once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs (ROABPs) compute polynomials as products of univariate polynomials that have matrices as coefficients. In an attempt to understand the landscape of algebraic complexity classes surrounding ROABPs, we study classes of ROABPs based on the algebraic structure of these coefficient matrices. We study connections between polynomials computed by these structured variants of ROABPs and other well-known classes of polynomials (such as depth-three powering circuits, tensor-rank and Waring rank of polynomials).

Our main result concerns commutative ROABPs, where all coefficient matrices commute with each other, and diagonal ROABPs, where all the coefficient matrices are just diagonal matrices. In particular, we show a somewhat surprising connection between these models and the model of depth-three powering circuits that is related to the Waring rank of polynomials. We show that if the dimension of partial derivatives captures Waring rank up to polynomial factors, then the model of diagonal ROABPs efficiently simulates the seemingly more expressive model of commutative ROABPs. Further, a commutative ROABP that cannot be efficiently simulated by a diagonal ROABP will give an explicit polynomial that gives a super-polynomial separation between dimension of partial derivatives and Waring rank.

Our proof of the above result builds on the results of Marinari, Möller and Mora (1993), and Möller and Stetter (1995), that characterise rings of commuting matrices in terms of polynomials that have small dimension of partial derivatives. The algebraic structure of the coefficient matrices of these ROABPs plays a crucial role in our proofs.</div>
