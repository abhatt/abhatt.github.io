These
algorithms solve the word problem and compute the spinor norm for orthogonal
groups. This gives us an algorithmic definition of the spinor norm. We compute
the double coset decomposition with respect to a Siegel maximal parabolic
subgroup, which is important in computing infinite-dimensional representations
for some algebraic groups.

puzzle, which asks for the shortest path along the surfaces of a square prism
between two points (source and target) located on the square faces, and
surprisingly showed that the shortest path traverses five faces. Dudeney's
source and target points had very symmetrical locations; in this article, we
allow the source and target points to be anywhere in the interior of opposite
faces, but now require the square prism to be a cube. In this context, we find
that, depending on source and target locations, a shortest path can traverse
either three or four faces, and we investigate the conditions that lead to
four-face solutions and estimate the probability of getting a four-face
shortest path. We utilize a combination of numerical calculations, elementary
geometry, and transformations we call corner moves of cube unfolding diagrams,

variables $x_i\in \{0,\ldots,k-1\}, 1 \leq i \leq n$ (where $k$ is constant)
with the smallest possible number of queries to a noisy oracle that returns for
a given query pair $(x_i,x_j)$ a noisy measurement of their modulo $k$ pairwise
difference, i.e., $y_{ij} = (x_i-x_j) \mod k$. This is a joint discrete
alignment problem with important applications in computer vision, graph mining,
and spectroscopy imaging. Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that
learns exactly with high probability the alignment (up to some unrecoverable
offset) using $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ queries.

(I’m deliberately not linking Coronavirus information, despite its importance, both because I’m not an expert and have neither useful original opinions to contribute nor adequate filters between information and misinformation, and because I suspect that many people’s mental health depends on not getting overloaded with that stuff while there’s so little to do but staying isolated and avoiding becoming part of the problem).</p>

We suggest a general framework to study dependency schemes for dependency quantified Boolean formulas (DQBF). As our main contribution, we exhibit a new tautology-free DQBF dependency scheme that generalises the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme. We establish soundness of the tautology-free scheme, implying that it can be used in any DQBF proof system. We further explore the power of DQBF resolution systems parameterised by dependency schemes and show that our new scheme results in exponentially shorter proofs in comparison to the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in the basic DQBF expansion proof system.

On QBFs, we demonstrate that our new scheme is exponentially stronger than the reflexive resolution path dependency scheme when used in Q Resolution, thus resulting in the strongest QBF dependency scheme known to date.</div>

We revisit one original motivation for the study of no-signaling multi-prover
  interactive proofs (NS-MIPs): specifically, that two spatially separated
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling by the physical principle that
  information cannot travel from one point to another faster than light.

  We observe that with more than two provers, the physical connection between
  no-signaling and faster-than-light communication is more nuanced, depending on
  the relative positioning of the provers.  In particular, we observe that
  provers are guaranteed to be no-signaling if and only if their positions are
  convexly independent.  Other prover positionings provide weaker guaranteees.

  We consider a new issue that thus arises only in the many-prover setting:
  how precisely must provers be positioned in order to guarantee the
    soundness of a (NS-)MIP?  We prove that substantially more precision is
  required to guarantee full no-signaling than to guarantee soundness of a
  specific NS-MIP for PSPACE implicit in the work of Kalai and Raz (CRYPTO 2009).</div>

We
consider a robust version of this revenue-maximization pricing problem, where
the seller knows the buyer's marginal distributions of values for each item,
but not the joint distribution, and wishes to maximize worst-case revenue over
all possible correlation structures. We devise a computationally efficient
(polynomial in the support size of the marginals) algorithm that computes the
worst-case joint distribution for any choice of item prices. And yet, in sharp
contrast to the additive buyer case (Carroll, 2017), we show that it is NP-hard
to approximate the optimal choice of prices to within any factor better than
$n^{1/2-\epsilon}$. For the special case of marginal distributions that satisfy
the monotone hazard rate property, we show how to guarantee a constant fraction
of the optimal worst-case revenue using item pricing; this pricing equates
revenue across all possible correlations and can be computed efficiently.

enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic
depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes
the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size
$n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound
deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is
superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the
dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an
earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$
and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of
bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must

<p>In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough

$\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded
individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size
$n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof
of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure
introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].

Poincar\'e-type functional graph parameter, $\lambda_\infty(G)$, of a graph
$G$, and related it to the {\em vertex expansion} of $G$ via a Cheeger-type
inequality. This is analogous to the Cheeger-type inequality relating the
spectral gap, $\lambda_2(G)$, of the graph to its {\em edge expansion}.
</p>
<p>While $\lambda_2$ can be computed efficiently, the computational complexity
of $\lambda_\infty$ has remained an open question. Following the work of the
second author with Raghavendra and Vempala, wherein the complexity of
$\lambda_\infty$ was related to the so-called Small-Set Expansion (SSE)
problem, it has been believed that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is a hard
problem. We settle this question by proving that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is
indeed NP-hard. Additionally, we use our techniques to prove NP-hardness of
computing the spread constant (of a graph), a geometric measure introduced by
Alon, Boppana, and Spencer, in the context of deriving an asymptotic
isoperimetric inequality on cartesian products of graphs.
</p>
<p>We complement our hardness results by providing approximation schemes for
computing $\lambda_\infty$ and the spread constant of star graphs, and
investigate constant approximability for weighted trees.
</p>
<p>Finally, we provide improved approximation results for the maximum variance
embedding problem for general graphs, by replacing the optimal orthogonal
projection (PCA) with a randomized projection approach.

connecting classical dynamics with data-oriented, algorithmic methods.
Combinatorial vector fields introduced by Forman and their recent
generalization to multivector fields have provided a starting point for
building such a connection. In this work, we strengthen this relationship by
placing the Conley index in the persistent homology setting. Conley indices are
homological features associated with so-called isolated invariant sets, so a
change in the Conley index is a response to perturbation in an underlying
multivector field. We show how one can use zigzag persistence to summarize
changes to the Conley index, and we develop techniques to capture such changes
in the presence of noise. We conclude by developing an algorithm to track
features in a changing multivector field.

needed to compute Functional Aggregate Queries (FAQs) studied by Abo Khamis et
al. [PODS 2016] in a synchronous distributed network under the model considered
by Chattopadhyay et al. [FOCS 2014, SODA 2017]. Unlike the recent work on
computing database queries in the Massively Parallel Computation model, in the
model of Chattopadhyay et al., nodes can communicate only via private
point-to-point channels and we are interested in bounds that work over an {\em
arbitrary} communication topology. This is the first work to consider more
practically motivated problems in this distributed model. For the sake of
exposition, we focus on two special problems in this paper: Boolean Conjunctive
Query (BCQ) and computing variable/factor marginals in Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs). We obtain tight bounds on the number of rounds needed to compute
such queries as long as the underlying hypergraph of the query is
$O(1)$-degenerate and has $O(1)$-arity. In particular, the $O(1)$-degeneracy
condition covers most well-studied queries that are efficiently computable in
the centralized computation model like queries with constant treewidth. These
tight bounds depend on a new notion of `width' (namely internal-node-width) for
Generalized Hypertree Decompositions (GHDs) of acyclic hypergraphs, which
minimizes the number of internal nodes in a sub-class of GHDs. To the best of
our knowledge, this width has not been studied explicitly in the theoretical
database literature. Finally, we consider the problem of computing the product
of a vector with a chain of matrices and prove tight bounds on its round
complexity (over the finite field of two elements) using a novel min-entropy
based argument.

<p>Things do not look that good, and these are difficult times. But here on the blog we have plenty of things to cheer you up and assure you. And today we point to two book proofs — two book proofs to the same theorem– and, as a matter of fact, two book proofs to the same theorem by the same person, <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/">Rom Pinchasi</a>.  One of the proofs, the one chosen for presentation, is by Rom Pinchasi and  <a href="http://polyanskii.com/">Alexandr Polyanskii</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/drg_1567-douglas-guthrie-photos.jpg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/drg_1567-douglas-guthrie-photos.jpg?w=640&amp;h=424" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13104" height="424" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rom Pinchasi has an immense proving power, both for difficult proofs at all costs, for book proofs, and for a large variety of proofs in between. (See, for example, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2010/02/03/a-discrepency-problem-for-planar-configurations/"> this post</a>.)</span></p>
<p>Before moving on, let me mention that there is a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/03/10/options-for-giving-math-talks-and-lectures-online/">timely blog post</a> by Terry Tao on Online teaching, and here is <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/349283/software-and-ideas-for-workshops-and-conferences-with-long-distance-participants">a related MO question about online conferences</a> that I asked last December.</p>
<h2>Proofs from the book</h2>
<p>Famously, the mathematician Paul Erdős, often referred to “The Book” in which God keeps the most elegant proof of each mathematical theorem. During a lecture in 1985, Erdős said, “You don’t have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.” (And you do not have even to believe in the book to enjoy proofs from the book.)</p>
<h2>The Theorem: a 1978 conjecture by Erdős and Purdy</h2>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong> Let <em>P</em> be a set of <em>n</em> points in general position in the plane. Suppose that <em>R</em> is a set of red points disjoint from <em>P</em> such that every line determined by <em>P</em> passes through a point in <em>R</em>. Then <em>|R|≥ n</em> for <em>n &gt; 6</em>.</p>
<p>This theorem settles a problem by Erdős and Purdy from 1978. Erdős and Purdy also asked about the case where the set of points is not required to be in general position. For that problem the best known lower bound, also proved by Rom Pinchasi, is <em>n/3</em>.</p>
<p>Book Proof I: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_genpos.pdf">An algebraic solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy</a>, by Rom Pinchasi</p>
<p>Book Proof II: <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EP_book.pdf">A one-page solution of a problem of Erdős and Purdy, by Rom Pinchasi and Alexandr Polyanskii</a></p>
<h2>Murty’s magic configurations conjecture.</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/magic.pdf">first proof of the Erdős-Purdy 1978 Conjecture</a> was achieved in 2008 by Eyal Ackerman, Kevin Buchin, Christian Knauer, Rom Pinchasi, and Günter Rote. They derived it from their solution to the 1971 conjecture on magic configurations by Murty. A planar set of points P is called magic if it possible to assign positive weights to the points so that the sum of weights in every line determined by the points is one. Murty conjectured that the only magic configurations are those in general position, and those which have a line missing at most one of the points, and a certain configuration of seven points.</p>
<h2>The Pinchasi-Polyanskii Book-Proof:</h2>
<p>Here, we very closely follow the Pinchasi-Polyanskii’s paper.</p>
<p>We say that a line is determined by a set of points in the plane if it contains at least two of the points. Since the points in P are in general position, each pair of points determines a different line.</p>
<p>Under the contrary assumption we must have <em>|R| = n−1</em>. Then it must be that every point in <em>R</em> is incident to precisely <em>n/2</em> lines determined by <em>P</em> and every line determined by <em>P</em> is incident to precisely one point in <em>R</em>. We would like to reach a contradiction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Preliminary step: apply a projective transformation to the plane such that the convex hull of <em>P</em> becomes a triangle.</span></p>
<p><strong>Observation 1:</strong>  No point of R lies outside the convex hull of P.</p>
<p>Such a point <em>r</em> should be incident to two lines supporting the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Each of these supporting lines must contain precisely two points of <em>P</em>. Since the convex hull of <em>P</em> is a triangle this is impossible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Regard the points in the plane as complex numbers. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(This is really cool. I am not aware of many examples in discrete geometry that thinking about planar points as complex numbers helps.)</span></p>
<p>Notation: for every point<em> p</em> in the plane we denote by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p_x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p_x" class="latex" title="p_x" />  the <em>x</em>-coordinate of <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>Crucial definition: For every point <em>p ∈ P</em> deﬁne</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p-r%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p-p%27%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')." class="latex" title="f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p-r) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p-p')." /></p>
<p><strong>Observation 2:</strong> <em>f(p)</em> is a real number!</p>
<p>The proof will surely make you smile: For every <em>p’ ∈ P \{p}</em> there is a unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and <em>r</em> are collinear. So <em>(p-r)/(p-p’)</em> is real. And the big ratio between products split to many small fractions that are all real.  <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Walla!</strong></span></p>
<p>Note that <em>f(p)</em> is thus also invariant under rotations of the plane.</p>
<p>Now, if the vertical line through p does not contain any other point in P ∪ R, then, for the unique <em>r ∈ R</em> such that <em>p, p’</em>, and<em> r</em> are collinear, we have that:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%29%7E%7E%7E%28p-r%29%2F%28p-p%27%29%7E%3D%7E%28p_x-r_x%29%2F%28p_x-p%27_x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)" class="latex" title="(1)~~~(p-r)/(p-p')~=~(p_x-r_x)/(p_x-p'_x)" />.</p>
<p>This leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 3:</strong>  if the vertical line through <em>p</em> does not contain any other point in <em>P ∪ R</em>, then</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%282%29%7E%7E%7E+f%28p%29+%3D+%5Cprod_%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D%28p_x-r_x%29+%2F+%5Cprod_%7Bp%27+%5Cin+P%5Cbackslash+%5C%7Bp%5C%7D%7D%28p_x-p%27_x%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)." class="latex" title="(2)~~~ f(p) = \prod_{r \in R}(p_x-r_x) / \prod_{p' \in P\backslash \{p\}}(p_x-p'_x)." /></p>
<p><strong>Crucial observation 4:</strong>  Let <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> be any two points in <em>P</em> and let <em>r</em> be the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em>. Then</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><em>f(p)/f(q)=-(p-r)/(q-r).</em></h3>
<p>To see this rotate the plane so that the x-coordinates of <em>p,q</em>, and <em>r</em> are equal (or nearly equal) and apply Equations (2) and (1). (You will get the same, or nearly the same, contributions for <em>r’ ≠ r</em>  and you are left with the contribution for <em>r</em>. ) This also leads to:</p>
<p><strong>Observation 5:</strong> <em>f(p)/f(q)</em> <em>&gt;0</em>  if and only if the unique point <em>r ∈ R</em> that is collinear with <em>p</em> and<em> q</em> lies in the straight line segment delimited by <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>.</p>
<h3>A complete graph with green and red edges.</h3>
<p>Consider the complete graph <em>G</em> whose vertices are the points in <em>P</em>. For every two points <em>p, q ∈ P</em> we color the edge connecting  <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>red</strong></span> if the unique point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> lies outside the straight line segment connecting <em>p</em> and<em> q. </em>Otherwise we color the edge <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>green</strong></span>. In other words, the edge is <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">red</span></strong> if<strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> f(p)/f(q) &lt; 0</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: #339966;">green</span></strong> if <strong><span style="color: #339966;">f(p)/f(q) &gt; 0</span></strong>.</p>
<p>The vertices of G can naturally be partitioned into two sets:<i> U = {p ∈ P | f(p) &gt; 0}</i> and<i> W = {p ∈ P | f(p) &lt; 0}</i>.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality assume that the three vertices of the convex hull of P belong to <em>U</em>. (Since no point of R is outside this convex hull all edges of the triangle forming the convex hull are green.)</p>
<p><strong>Observation 6:</strong> <em>|U| = n/2 + 1.</em></p>
<p>To see this let <em>a,b</em> ∈ <em>U</em> be two vertices of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Let <em>c</em> ∈ <em>R</em> be the point in <em>R</em> collinear with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. The point <em>c</em> must be between <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> on the boundary of the convex hull of <em>P</em>. Therefore, all the other n/2 −1 pairs of points of <em>P</em> that are collinear with c must form red edges. Consequently, precisely one point of every such pair belongs to U. Together with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, we obtain <em>|U| = n/2+1</em>.</p>
<p><strong>End of proof:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-19479"></span></p>
<p>Consider now any triangulation of the convex hull of <em>P</em> using all the vertices of <em>U</em>. This triangulation contains precisely <em>3|U|−6</em> edges all of which correspond to green edges in the graph <em>G</em>. Each edge in the triangulation contains a unique point in <em>R</em>. Therefore,</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>|R|≥ 3|1|−6 = 3n/2 −3.</em></p>
<p>This expression is greater than or equal to <em>n</em> for every <em>n ≥ 6</em>, as desired. <span style="color: #993366;"><strong>ahla!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;">(Good old Euler’s theorem is used.)</span></p>
<h2>Related things.</h2>
<p>Yesterday, our PM explained on TV what geometric (exponential) growth is.  If I try to describe related results and problems to the theorem presented here, and move on to related results and problems to those and so on, the amount of beautiful results from discrete geometry will grow exponentially but this post will never be completed.</p>
<p>So let me mention just a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>The result is related to the Motzkin-Rabin Colorful Sylvester-Gallai theorem. Given a set of red points and blue points in the plane, not all on a line, the Motzkin-Rabin theorem asserts that there is a line that contains two or more points in the set, such that all the points on the line have the same color.</li>
<li>Starting with the Sylvester-Gallai theorem itself, there is a rich Gallai-Sylvester theory, with recent deep connections to the theory of computing; My <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology">third MathOverflow question</a> was about a Sylvester-Gallai type problem and here is a link to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4661/the-sylvester-gallai-theorem-and-sections-of-varieties-with-simple-topology#comment8133_4661">Greg Kuperberg remark</a>‘s regarding potential Gylvester-Kalai theorems.</li>
<li>Let me mention the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2012/08/24/on-sets-defining-few-ordinary-lines/">2012 solution by Ben Green and Terry Tao</a> of the ordinary line conjecture and the Orchard conjecture.</li>
<li>Let me mention the proof of Andreii Kupavskii and Alexandr Polyanskii to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3694.pdf">Shur’s conjecture</a>.</li>
<li>Here is a <a href="http://www2.math.technion.ac.il/~room/ps_files/EPnCubic_s2.pdf">link to a very recent paper</a> by Chaya Keller and Rom Pinchasi. There they make the following <strong>bold conjecture</strong>: Let <em>P</em> be a set of n points in general position and and let <em>R</em> be a set of n points disjoint from P. If every line determined by P passes through a point in<em> R,</em> then <em>P </em>∪<em> R</em> is contained in a cubic curve.</li>
<li>There is, of course the famous book by Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler: Proofs from the book.</li>
<li>At some point I tried to interest Günter with a companion book: The book of examples. We did not proceed with this project but this motivated my successful <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/4994/fundamental-examples">MathOverflow questions about fundamental examples</a>.</li>
<li>Eventually, Günter and I decided to write instead: the book of examples of polytopes. We went as far as writing a list of chapters of the book! (Which is a very advanced stage of writing a book, I suppose.)</li>
<li>When I took a class for high-school students interested in mathematics, the Sylvester problem was a starred problem in the first problem set and the assertion of the Motzkin-Rabin colored theorem was a double starred problem. Among the 20-30 students none of us found a (correct) solution. (We referred to it in a trivia question in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/natis-influence/">this post</a>.) Years later, I gave the same class and gave the same starred problems, and one student managed to prove the Gallai-Sylvester theorem. Can you guess who he was?</li>
</ol>

<p>When I launched bit-player.org in 2006, displaying any sort of mathematical notation on the web was torture. I would typeset an equation in LaTeX, convert the output to a JPEG image, upload the image file to a directory on the server, and embed a reference to the file in an HTML <code>img</code> tag. The process was cumbersome and the product was ugly. In 2009 I wrote <a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2009-03-Hayes-webmath.pdf">an <em>American Scientist</em> article</a> whining about this sorry state of affairs—but at just that moment an elegant solution was coming on the scene. Davide Cervone of Union College had created a program called jsMath, which could process TeX commands placed directly in an HTML document. For example, I could write:</p>
<pre style="text-align: center;"><code>e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots</code></pre>
<p>and it would appear on your screen as:</p>
<p>\[e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots\]</p>
<p class="undent">All the work of parsing the TeX code and typesetting the math was done by a JavaScript program downloaded into your browser along with the rest of the web page.</p>
<p>Cervone’s jsMath soon evolved into <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/mathjax">open-source project</a> initially supported by the AMS and SIAM. There are now about two dozen sponsors, and the project is under the aegis of <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>. From the MathJax web page: “The MathJax team consists of Davide Cervone and Volker Sorge. Regular contributors include Christian Lawson-Perfect, Omar Al-Ithawi, and Peter Krautzberger.”Cervone remains the principal author, though not the only contributor.</p>
<p>MathJax has made a big difference in my working life, transforming a problem into a pleasure. Putting math on the web is fun! Sometimes I do it just to show off. Furthermore, the software has served as an inspiration as well as a helpful tool. Until I saw MathJax in action, it simply never occurred to me that interesting computations could be done within the JavaScript environment of a web browser, which I had thought was there mainly to make things blink and jiggle. With the example of MathJax in front of me, I realized that I could not only display mathematical ideas but also explore and animate them within a web page.</p>
<hr />
<p>Last fall I began hearing rumors about MathJax 3.0, “a complete rewrite of MathJax from the ground up using modern techniques.” It’s the kind of announcement that inspires both excitement and foreboding. What will the new version add? What will it take away? What will it fix? What will it break?</p>
<p>Before committing all of bit-player to the new version, I thought I would try a small-scale experiment. I have a standalone web page that makes particularly tricky use of MathJax. The page is a repository of the <a href="https://bit-player.github.io/dotster/">Dotster</a> programs extracted from a recent bit-player post, <a href="http://bit-player.org/2019/my-god-its-full-of-dots">My God, it’s full of dots</a>. In January I got the Dotster page running with MathJax 3.</p>
<p>Most math in web documents is static content: An equation needs to be formatted once, when the page is first displayed, and it never changes after that. The initial type­setting is handled automatically by MathJax, in both the old and the new versions. As soon as the page is downloaded from the server, MathJax makes a pass through the entire text, identifying elements flagged as TeX code and replacing them with typeset math. Once that job is done, MathJax can go to sleep.</p>
<p>The Dotster programs are a little different; they include equations that change dynamically in response to user input. Here’s an example:</p>


<p>The slider on the left sets a numerical value that gets plugged into the two equation on the right. Each time the slider is moved, the equations need to be updated and reformatted. Thus with each change to the slider setting, MathJax has to wake up from its slumbers and run again to typeset the altered content.</p>
<p>The MathJax program running in the little demo above is the older version, 2.7. Cosmetically, the result is not ideal. With each change in the slider value, the two equations contract a bit, as if pinched between somebody’s fingers, and then snap back to their original size. They seem to wink at us. The progress banner would normally appear in the lower left corner of the browser window, where it is less intrusive. It has a more prominent position here because the demo is encapsulated in an iFrame, which acts as a window within the window. This structure is necessary in order to run two versions of MathJax in a single page. Also, a small gray progress indicator pops up in the lower left corner and hangs around just long enough to grab your attention. It says: “Typesetting math: 100%.” I find these visual distractions pretty annoying. They are analogous to the dreaded FOUC—the “flash of unstyled content”—that appears when a web browser displays the text of a page before the associated stylesheets are fully loaded and processed.</p>
<p>The winking effect is caused by a MathJax feature called Fast Preview. The system does a quick-and-dirty rendering of the math content without calculating <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/math-settings-submenus.png" height="180" width="350" alt="Math settings submenus" border="0" class="alignright" /> the correct final sizes for the various typographic ele­ments. (Evi­dently that calculation takes a little time). You can turn off Fast Preview by right-clicking or control-clicking one of the equa­tions and then navigating through the sub­menus shown at right. How­ever, you’ll probably judge the result to be worse rather than better. Without Fast Preview, you’ll get a  glimpse of the raw TeX commands. Instead of winking, the equations do jumping jacks.</p>
<p>I am delighted to report that all of this visual noise has been eliminated in the new MathJax. On changing a slider setting, the equations are updated in place, with no unnecessary visual fuss. And there’s no need for a progress indication, because the change is so quick it appears to be instantaneous. See for yourself:</p>


<p>Thus version 3 looks like a big win. There’s a caveat: Getting it to work did not go quite as smoothly as I had hoped. Nevertheless, this is a story with a happy ending.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you have only static math content in your documents, making the switch to MathJax 3 is easy. In your HTML file you change a URL to load the new MathJax version, and convert any configuration options to a new format. As it happens, all the default options work for me, so I had nothing to convert. What’s most important about the upgrade path is what you <em>don’t</em> need to do. In most cases you should not have to alter any of the TeX commands present in the HTML files being processed by MathJax. (There are a <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/v2.html#input-changes">few small exceptions</a>.)</p>
<p>With dynamic content, further steps are needed. Here is the JavaScript statement I used to reawaken the typesetting engine in MathJax version 2.7:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.Hub.Queue(["Typeset", MathJax.Hub, mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>The statement enters a <code>Typeset</code> command into a queue of pending tasks. When the command reaches the front of the queue, MathJax will typeset any math found inside the HTML element designated by the identifier <code>mathjax_demo_box</code>, ignoring the rest of the document.</p>
<p>In MathJax 3, the <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/typeset.html#typesetting-math-in-a-web-page">documentation</a> suggested I could simply replace this command with a slightly different and more direct one:</p>
<pre class="language-js"><code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box]);
</code></pre>
<p>I did that. It didn’t work. When I moved the slider, the displayed math reverted to raw TeX form, and I found an error message in the JavaScript console:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/appendChild-null-error-530x170.png" height="170" width="530" alt="AppendChild null error 530x170" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>What has gone wrong here? JavaScript’s <code>appendChild</code> method adds a new node to the treelike structure of an HTML document. It’s like hanging an ornament from some specified branch of a Christmas tree. The error reported here indicates that the specified branch does not exist; it is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s not tarry over my various false starts and wrong turns as I puzzled over the source of this bug. I eventually found the cause and the solution in the “issues” section of the MathJax repository on GitHub. Back in September of last year Mihai Borobocea had <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues/2191">reported a similar problem</a>, along with the interesting observation that the error occurs only when an existing TeX expression is being replaced in a document, not when a new expression is being added. Borobocea had also discovered that invoking the procedure <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> before <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> would prevent the error.</p>
<p>A comment by Cervone explains much of what’s going on:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are correct that you should use <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> if you have removed previously typeset math from the page. (In version 3, there is information stored about the math in a list of typeset expressions, and if you remove typeset math from the page and replace it with new math, that list will hold pointers to math that no longer exists in the page. That is what is causing the error you are seeing . . . )</p></blockquote>
<p>I found that adding <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> did indeed eliminate the error. As a practical matter, that solved my problem. But Borobocea pointed out a remaining loose end. Whereas <code>MathJax.typeset([mathjax_demo_box])</code> operates only on the math inside a specific container, <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code> destroys the list of math objects for the entire document, an act that might later have unwanted consequences. Thus it seemed best to reformat all the math in the document whenever any one expression changes. This is inefficient, but with the 20-some equations in the Dotster web page the typesetting is so fast there’s no perceptible delay.</p>
<p>In January a fix for this problem was merged into MathJax 3.0.1, which is now the shipping version. Cervone’s comment on this change says that it “prevents the error message,” which left me with the impression that it might suppress the message without curing the error itself. But as far as I can tell the entire issue has been cleared up. There’s no longer any need to invoke <code>MathJax.typesetClear()</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my first experiments with version 3.0 I stumbled onto another bit of weirdness, but it turned out to be a quirk of my own code, not something amiss in MathJax. </p>
<p>I was seeing occasional size variations in typeset math that seemed reminiscent of the winking problem in version 2.7. <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/zs-large-and-small-math.png" height="99" width="159" alt="large and small math superimposed" border="0" class="alignright" />Sometimes the initial, automatic typesetting would leave the equations in a slightly smaller size; they would grow back to normal as soon as <code>MathJax.typeset()</code> was applied. In the image at right I have superimposed the two states, with the correct, larger image colored red. It looks like Fast Preview has come back to haunt us, but that can’t be right, because Fast Preview has been removed entirely from version 3.</p>
<p>My efforts to solve this mystery turned into quite a debugging debacle. I got a promising clue from an exchange on the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs/wiki/Dealing-with-display:none">MathJax wiki</a>, discussing size anomalies when math is composed inside an HTML element temporarily flagged <code>display: none</code>, a style rule that makes the math invisible. In that circumstance MathJax has no information about the surrounding text, and so it leaves the typeset math in a default state. The same mechanism might account for what I was seeing—except that my page has no elements with a <code>display: none</code> style.</p>
<p>I first observed this problem in the Chrome browser, where it is intermittent; when I repeatedly reloaded the page, the small type would appear about one time out of five. What fun! It takes multiple trials just to know whether an attempted fix has had any effect. Thus I was pleased to discover that in Firefox the shrunken type appears consistently, every time the page is loaded. Testing became a great deal easier.</p>
<p>I soon found a cure, though not a diagnosis. While browsing again in the MathJax issues archive and in a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/mathjax-users">MathJax user forum</a>, I came across suggestions to try a different form of output, with mathematical expressions constructed not from text elements in HTML and style rules in CSS but from paths drawn in Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG. I found that the SVG expressions were stable and consistent in size, and in other respects indistinguishable from their HTML siblings. Again my problem was solved, but I still wanted to know the underlying cause.</p>
<p>Here’s where the troubleshooting report gets a little embarrassing. Thinking I might have a new bug to report, I set out to build a minimal exemplar—the smallest and simplest program that would trigger the bug. I failed. I was starting from a blank page and adding more and more elements of the original program—<code>div</code>s nested inside <code>div</code>s in the HTML, various stylesheet rules in the CSS, bigger collections of more complex equations—but none of these additions produced the slightest glitch in typesetting. So I tried working in the other direction, starting with the complex misbehaving program and stripping away elements until the problem disappeared. But it didn’t disappear, even when I reduced the page to a single equation in a plain white box.</p>
<p>As often happens, I found the answer not by banging my head against the problem but by going for a walk. Out in the fresh air, I finally noticed the one oddity that distinguished the failing program from all of the correctly working ones. Because the Dotster program began life embedded in a WordPress blog post, I could not include a link to the CSS stylesheet in the <code>head</code> section of the HTML file. Instead, a JavaScript function constructed the link and inserted it into the <code>head</code>. That happened <em>after</em> MathJax made its initial pass over the text. At the time of typesetting, the elements in which the equations were placed had no styles applied, and so MathJax had no way of determining appropriate sizes.</p>
<hr />
<p>When Don Knuth unveiled TeX, circa 1980, I was amazed. Back then, typewriter-style word processing was impressive enough. TeX did much more: real typesetting, with multiple fonts (which Knuth also had to create from scratch), automatic hyphenation and justification, and beautiful mathematics.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, when Cervone created MathJax, I was amazed again—though perhaps not for the right reasons. I had supposed that the major programming challenge would be capturing all the finicky rules and heuristics for building up math expressions—placing and sizing superscripts, adjusting the height and width of parentheses or a radical sign to match the dimensions of the expression enclosed, spacing and aligning the elements of a matrix. Those are indeed nontrivial tasks, but they are just the beginning. My recent adventures have helped me see that another major challenge is making TeX work in an alien environment.</p>
<p>In classic TeX, the module that typesets equations has direct access to everything it might ever need to know about the surrounding text—type sizes, line spacing, column width, the amount of interword “glue” needed to justify a line of type. Sharing this information is easy because all the formatting is done by the same program. MathJax faces a different situation. Formatting duties are split, with MathJax handling mathematical content but the browser’s layout engine doing everything else. Indeed, the document is written in two different languages, TeX for the math and HTML/CSS for the rest. Coordinating actions in the two realms is not straightforward.</p>
<p>There are other complications of importing TeX into a web page. The classic TeX system runs in batch mode. It takes some inputs, produces its output, and then quits. Batch processing would not offer a pleasant experience in a web browser. The entire user interface (such as the buttons and sliders in my Dotster programs) would be frozen for the duration. To avoid this kind of rudeness to the user, MathJax is never allowed to monopolize JavaScript’s single thread of execution for more than a fraction of a second. To ensure this cooperative behavior, earlier versions relied on a hand-built scheme of queues (where procedures wait their turn to execute) and callbacks (which signal when a task is complete). Version 3 takes advantage of a new JavaScript construct called a <em>promise</em>. When a procedure cannot compute a result immediately, it hands out a promise, which it then redeems when the result becomes available.</p>
<p>Wait, there’s more! MathJax is not just a TeX system. It also accepts input written in MathML, a dialect of XML specialized for mathematical notation. Indeed, the internal language of MathJax is based on MathML. And MathJax can also be configured to handle <a href="http://asciimath.org/">AsciiMath</a>, a cute markup language that aims to make even the raw form of an expression readable. Think of it as math with emoticons: Type <code>`oo`</code> and you’ll get \(\infty\), or <code>`:-`</code> for \(\div\).</p>
<p>MathJax also provides an extensive suite of tools for accessibility. Visually impaired readers can have an equation read aloud. As I learned at the January Joint Math Meetings, there are even provisions for generating Braille output—but that’s a subject that deserves a post of its own.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I first encountered MathJax, I saw it as a marvel, but I also considered it a workaround or stopgap. Reading a short document that includes a single equation entails downloading the entire MathJax program, which can be much larger than the document itself. And you need to download it all again for every other mathy document (unless your browser cache hangs onto a copy). What an appalling waste of bandwidth. </p>
<p>Several alternatives seemed more promising as a long-term solution. The best approach, it seemed to me then, was to have support for mathematical notation built into the browser. Modern browsers handle images, audio, video, SVG, animations—why not math? But it hasn’t happened. Firefox and Safari have limited support for MathML; none of the browsers I know are equipped to deal with TeX.</p>
<p>Another strategy that once seemed promising was the browser plugin. A plugin could offer the same capabilities as MathJax, but you would download and install it only once. This sounds like a good deal for readers, but it’s not so attractive for the author of web content. If there are multiple plugins in circulation, they are sure to have quirks, and you need to accommodate all of them. Furthermore, you need some sort of fallback plan for those who have not installed a plugin.</p>
<p>Still another option is to run MathJax on the server, rather than sending the whole program to the browser. The document arrives with TeX or MathML already converted to HTML/CSS or SVG for display. This is the preferred modus operandi for several large websites, most notably Wikipedia. I’ve considered it for bit-player, but it has a drawback: Running on the server, MathJax cannot provide the kind of on-demand typesetting seen in the demos above.</p>
<p>As the years go by, I am coming around to the view that MathJax is not just a useful stopgap while we wait for the right thing to come along; it’s quite a good approximation to the right thing. As the author of a web page, I get to write mathematics in a familiar and well-tested notation, and I can expect that any reader with an up-to-date browser will see output that’s much like what I see on my own screen. At the same time, the reader also has control over how the math is rendered, via the context menu. And the program offers accessibility features that I could never match on my own.</p>
<p>To top it off, the software is open-source—freely available to everyone. That is not just an economic advantage but also a social one. The project has a community that stands ready to fix bugs, listen to suggestions and complaints, offer help and advice. Without that resource, I would still be struggling with the hitches and hiccups described above.</p></div>

<div class="content">
The refutation system ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ is a natural extension of resolution refutation system such that it operates with disjunctions of degree $d$ polynomials over ring $R$ with boolean variables. For $d=1$, this system is called ${Res}_R({lin})$. Based on properties of $R$, ${Res}_R({lin})$ systems can be too strong to prove lower bounds for CNFs with current methods. The reachable goal might be proving lower bounds for ${Res}_R({lin})$ when $R$ is a finite field such as $\mathbb{F}_2$. Interestingly, ${Res}_{\mathbb{F}_2}({lin})$ is also fairly strong, and there is no known nontrivial lower bound for it, but for ${Res}^*_R({lin})$ (tree-like ${Res}_R({lin})$) we know exponential lower bounds for every finite field.
 For the stronger systems ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}_R^*({PC}_d)$ for $d&gt;1$ on finite ring $R$, there is no known lower bounds till now. In this paper we will investigate these refutation systems and make some progress toward understanding these systems, including the case $d=1$. We prove a size-width relation for ${Res}_R({PC}_d)$ and ${Res}^*_R({PC}_d)$ for every finite ring $R$. This relation is proved by a new idea to reduce the problem to the original Ben-Sasson and Wigderson size-width relation for ${Res}$ and ${Res}^*$ using extension variables. As a by product, we get the following new lower bounds for every finite field $\mathbb{F}$:
(1) We prove the first nontrivial lower bounds for ${Res}_\mathbb{F}({PC}_d)$ for fixed $d$: a nearly quadratic lower bounds for mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$) for suitable graphs.
(2) We also prove superpolynomial and exponential lower bounds for ${Res}^*_\mathbb{F}({PC}_{d})$ where $d$ is not too large with respect to $n$ for the following principles:
 (a) mod $q$ Tseitin formulas ($char(\mathbb{F})\neq q$),
 (b) Random $k$-CNFs.</div>

<p>Besides unimaginable suffering and horror, the Black Death of the 1340’s also brought increased wages and better living standards.  It came back, among other times, in 1665.  Then like now, universities closed and students went home.  Among them was Newton, who spent his time alone in the countryside thus:</p>



<p><strong>In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the method of approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity [power] of any binomial into such a series. The same year in May I found the method of tangents of Gregory and Slusius, and in November had the direct method of fluxions and the next year [1666] in January had the theory of colours and in May following I had entrance into the inverse method of fluxions. And the same year I began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the moon … All this was in the two plague years of 1665 and 1666, for in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention and minded Mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since.</strong></p>



<p>Today’s Coronavirus pandemic is probably the first in history that’s been fought with telecommunication.  People are advised to work remotely, and many universities are switching to online courses.  Besides the suffering and horror, it is also an opportunity <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/working-remotely-will-be-the-most-significant-transformation-since-agriculture/">to realize that many things can be done remotely just as well if not better, change our lifestyle, and stop polluting the environment.</a></p></div>

<p>
Robert Dorfman was a professor of political economy at Harvard University, who helped create the notion of group testing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss this notion and its possible application to the current epidemic crisis. We also discuss other mathematical aspects that have clear and immediate value.</p>
<p>
The novel coronavirus (and its disease <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>) is the nasty issue we all face today. I live in New York City and can see the reduced foot traffic every day. The issue is discussed every minute on the news. I hope you are all safe, and well. But we are all worried about this. </p>
<p>
The point of group testing is that it can reduce the number of tests needed to find out who has the virus. I assume that we are not using Dorfman’s idea because it does not apply to today’s testing. But it seems like it could fit. One issue is the need for more individual testing kits. As we write this, the US is still well short of the needed supply of kits. Are there situations where group testing can still help economize?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Group Testing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dorfman created the notion of <em>group testing</em> in 1943. You could say he was driven by the need to test light bulbs:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png?w=300&amp;h=188" alt="" width="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16781" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>As Wikipedia group-testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">article</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [Suppose] one is searching for a broken bulb among six light bulbs. Here, the first three are connected to a power supply, and they light up (A). This indicates that the broken bulb must be one of the last three (B). If instead the bulbs did not light up, one could be sure that the broken bulb was among the first three. Continuing this procedure can locate the broken bulb in no more than three tests, compared to a maximum of six tests if the bulbs are checked individually. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Okay, Dorfman’s motivation was not light bulbs. It was testing soldiers during WWII for a certain disease, that will go unnamed. This type of testing reduced the number of blood samples needed. What was analogous to connecting groups of light bulbs into one circuit was combining portions of individual blood samples into one sample. If it tested negative then that entire group could be dismissed without further testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Fewer Kits </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The point of using group testing is made stark when you think about recent issues with cruise ships. On one ship there were around <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3500}" class="latex" title="{3500}" /> passengers who were eventually found to be almost all okay. I believe only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> were infected. This could have been checked by group testing with many fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3500}" class="latex" title="{3500}" /> tests. </p>
<p>
According to the current outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">maps</a>, known <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us">cases</a> in the US are still fairly sparse. Those in New York are mainly in the city, Westchester, and along the Hudson River to Albany. Let’s say we wish assurance that all non-virus related admits to a hospital are free of the virus. Can group testing apply?</p>
<p>
The original version of group testing would apply if it were deemed mandatory that all new admits give a blood sample. Some kinds of coronavirus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing">test kits</a> use blood samples. Taking blood samples might however be as costly and intrusive as having the individual tests to begin with. There are other kinds of tests involving taking swabs, but it is not apparent whether those samples can be combined at scale as readily as blood samples can.</p>
<p>
At least the <em>idea</em> of group testing has interesting connections to other parts of theory. Here is a 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/00-007.pdf">survey</a> by Ken’s former Buffalo colleague Hung Ngo with his PhD advisor, Ding-Zhu Du, where the application is to large scale screening of DNA samples. Hung and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra taught a <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2011/709/">course</a> in Buffalo on group testing in relation to <em>compressed sensing</em>. More recent is a 2015 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308980">paper</a> that tries to solve problems of counting the number of positive cases, not just whether they exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Mathematical Effects </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As we write, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has just declared a cap of 500 attendees for any assembly. This is forcing the suspension of Broadway shows among many other activities. Yesterday the entire SUNY system joined numerous other institutions in moving to distance-only learning after this week.  </p>
<p>
The cap is based on the likelihood of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> persons including someone who is already infected. That likelihood in turn is based on the density of known cases and what is known about the proportion of unknown to known cases. The virus has a long (two weeks) incubation time during which it is contagious but not symptomatic.</p>
<p>
Here is a graph from a PSA <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> posted just today by Alex Tabarrok for the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog (note that the calculations are by <a href="https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/joshua-weitz">Joshua</a> <a href="http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/">Weitz</a> of Georgia Tech):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg?w=550&amp;h=425" alt="" width="550" class="aligncenter wp-image-16782" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>
The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />-axis is the number of cases (in proportion to the US on the whole) and the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />-axis is the group size. Which axis is more important—has more effect on the danger? Tabarrok notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Now here is the most important point. It’s the size of the group, not the number of carriers that most drives the result. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This involves comparing two partial derivatives. The <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> gives a brief worked-out example without using calculus. </p>
<p>
I, Ken, have been connected this week to another example. I was statistically monitoring the World Senior Team Chess Championship, which began last Friday in Prague. Almost 500 players in teams of 4 or 5 players took part. Initially the players were roughly evenly divided between two halls. Effective Tuesday, a cap of 100 was declared for the Czech Republic, so more playing rooms were found and spectators were banned. Today, however, after an update on the density of cases in the Czech Republic, the cap was lowered to 30 effective tomorrow.  Thus the tournament was forced to finish today, two rounds earlier than planned. Even though chess events have a lower size footprint than all of the spectator sports whose seasons have been suspended in recent days, the growth of the outbreak is making cancellation the only reasonable policy for all but the smallest events.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these and other <em>social isolation</em> measures is to flatten out the growth of cases. The target is not just to contain the outbreak but also to stay below the number of serious cases that our treatment systems can bear at once. Here is one of numerous versions of a <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help">graphic</a> that is being widely circulated:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg?w=400&amp;h=223" alt="" width="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-16783" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>
The graphic is not necessarily talking about reducing the number of cases <em>total</em>. The area under both curves is the same. A sentence in accompanying article—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If individuals and communities take steps to slow the virus’s spread, that means the number of cases of COVID-19 will stretch out across a longer period of time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
—seems to imply that “the number of cases” is the same in both scenarios, but stretched out over time in the latter. The point is how the stretching keeps the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />-value bounded.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> To complete the thoughts here, we <i>should</i> be talking about reducing the number of cases—see <a href="https://medium.com/@joschabach/flattening-the-curve-is-a-deadly-delusion-eea324fe9727">this</a>.</p>
<p>
We certainly hope that isolation can reduce that number—i.e., that containment data out of Southeast Asia in particular holds true, as opposed to fears being voiced in the West that the virus will spread to a large percentage of the population over time. See charts <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">here</a>, especially chart 7.  This tracking <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true">map</a> has free access and is updated daily.</p>
<p>
What governs the spreading process? This is being understood via simple mathematical models of contagion, such as come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory">percolation theory</a> and its associated <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R_0}" class="latex" title="{R_0}" /> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895684/">factor</a>. Almost a month ago, the Washington Post made an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/coronavirus-how-epidemics-spread-and-end/">interactive</a> showing how epidemics spread according to the parameters in these models. How and whether the COVID-19 pandemic follows these models remains to be seen. Of course we hope it stays on the better side of the equations.  <b>Update 3/15:</b> This new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">animation</a> from the Washington Post shows how the “better side” can arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is group testing a practical <em>mechanism</em> for mapping and constraining the epidemic? How can we promote the understanding of mechanisms and equations and models, not only for those shaping policy but for us who must abide by it and know why.</p>
<p>

<p>Harvard University, as well most other places that I know of will be moving to remote lectures. I just gave the last in-person lecture in my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography course</a>. I would appreciate technical suggestions on the best format for teaching remotely. At the moment I plan to use Zoom and log-in from both my laptop (for the video) and from my iPad pro (for the interactive whiteboard).  </p>



<p>The one silver lining is that more lectures will be available online. In particular, if you’re teaching algorithms, you might find <a href="https://gt-algorithms.com/">Eric Vigoda’s videos helpful</a>. (If you know of more sources, please let us know.)</p>



<p>I was hoping that reducing meetings and activities will be good for research, but currently find it hard to concentrate on anything except this train-wreck of a situation. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff3affea-63c7-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5">financial times</a> has a chart that summarizes the progress of the  disease in several countries:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/http___com.ft_.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.png?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-7646" /></figure>



<p>The number of confirmed cases grows by about 33% each day. This growth in confirmed cases is partially due to increased testing  as cases increase – there is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext">some evidence</a>  that the doubling time of the disease (time between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> infected people to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2n" class="latex" title="2n" /> infected) is about 6 days (rather than the 2.4 days that this figure suggest). However, a doubling time of 6 days still means that the number of cases grows 10-fold in a month, and so if there are 10K actual cases in the U.S., today, there would be 100K by mid April and 1M by mid May.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Strong quarantine regimes, contact tracing, and drastically reducing activity and increasing “social distance” can very significantly reduce the base of this exponent. Reducing the base of the exponent is more than simply “delaying the inevitable”. The mortality statistics mask the fact that this can be a very serious illness even for the people who don’t die of it – about 5% of the cases need intensive care (see this <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/12/covid-19-is-rapidly-spreading-in-america-the-country-does-not-look-ready">Economist article</a>). Spreading the infections over time will enable the healthcare system to handle the increased caseload, which will completely overwhelm it otherwise.</p>



<p>Such steps are clearly much easier to achieve before the number of cases is too large to be manageable, but despite having “advance warning” from other countries, this lesson does not seem at the moment to have sunk in, at least here in the U.S. At the moment no such initiatives are taken at the federal level, the states are doing more but still not enough, and it’s up to private companies and institutions to come up with their own policies. As faculty and citizens there is not much we can do about it except support such decisions even when they are <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/12/parents-petition-coronavirus-measure/">unpopular</a>, and just try to make the remote experience as good as possible for us, our colleagues, and our students.</p></div>

Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.

  In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].</div>

People skip conferences because of the coronavirus or for <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">global</a> <a href="https://www.change.org/p/organizers-of-data-science-and-machine-learning-conferences-neurips-icml-aistats-iclr-uai-allow-remote-paper-poster-presentations-at-conferences">warming</a> or just because conferences are too expensive and time consuming. I'm certainly <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/fulltext">no fan</a> of the current conference structure but I would never want to virtualize all of them. Even if we could completely recreate the conference experience in virtual reality, people would not hang out in the halls without the commitment of having made the physical trip. I made this point in a tweet with a depressing response.<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr">
At least in CS theory, I don't see any crucial importance. These days it's easy to follow the latest developments online. If you're interested in someone's work, you just email them and start a collaboration. Sooner or later networking in hallways may become a thing of the past.</div>
— Mahdi Cheraghchi (@cheraghchi) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheraghchi/status/1235792583516975104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2020</a></blockquote>


<br />
<div>
I don't disagree with anything Mahdi says except for the "crucial importance". Great ideas come from chance encounters and random conversations. Many of my research papers would never have happened if not for a conversation had at a conference or on the plane or train rides that took me there. Harken Gilles Brassard's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604072">origin story</a> of quantum cryptography.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
One fine afternoon in late October 1979, I was swimming at the beach of a posh
hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Imagine my surprise when this complete stranger
swims up to me and starts telling me, without apparent provocation on my part,
about Wiesner’s quantum banknotes! This was probably the most bizarre, and
certainly the most magical, moment in my professional life<sup>6</sup>. Within hours, we had
found ways to mesh Wiesner’s coding scheme with some of the then-new concepts
of public-key cryptography.... The ideas that Bennett and I tossed around on the beach that day resulted
in the first paper ever published on quantum cryptography, indeed the paper
in which the term “Quantum Cryptography” was coined. </blockquote>
And Footnote 6 read as follows.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
At the risk of taking some of the magic away, I must confess that it was not by accident that
Bennett and I were swimming at the same beach in Puerto Rico. We were both there for the
20th Annual IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science. Bennett approached
me because I was scheduled to give a talk on relativized cryptography on the last day of the
Symposium and he thought I might be interested in Wiesner’s ideas. By an amazing coincidence,
on my way to San Juan, I had read Martin Gardner’s account of Bennett’s report on
Chaitin’s Omega, which had just appeared in the November 1979 “Mathematical Games” column
of Scientific American—so, I knew the name but I could not recognize Bennett in that swimmer
because I did not know what he looked like.</blockquote>
After we see a slate of conferences held virtually due to the virus, networking may indeed become a thing of the past. But we'll never know the research not done because of people who never connected.</div></div>

<p><strong>Update (March 13):</strong> One day after I put up this post—a post that many commenters criticized as too alarmist—the first covid cases were detected in Austin.  As a result, UT Austin closed its campus (including my son’s daycare), and at 3:30am, the Austin Independent School District announced its decision to suspend all schools until further notice.  All my remaining plans for the semester (including visits to Berkeley, Stanford, Harvard, CU Boulder, Fermilab, Yale, and CMU) are obviously cancelled.  My family is now on lockdown, in our house, probably at least until the summer.  The war on the virus has reached us.  The “1939” analogy that I mentioned in the post turned out to be more precise than I thought: then, as now, there were intense debates about how just serious the crisis would be, but those debates never even had a chance to get settled by argument; events on the ground simply rendered them irrelevant.</p>



<p><strong>Scott’s foreword:</strong> This week Steve Ebin, a longtime <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader (and occasional commenter) from the San Francisco tech world, sent me the essay below.  Steve’s essay fit too well with my own recent thoughts, and indeed with this blog’s title, for me not to offer to share it here—and to my surprise and gratitude, Steve agreed.</p>



<p>I guess there are only two things I’d add to what Steve wrote.  First, some commenters took me to task for a misplaced emphasis in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4671">my last coronavirus post</a>, and on further reflection, I now concede that they were right.  When a preventable catastrophe strikes the world, what’s always terrified me most are <em>not</em> the ranting lunatics and conspiracy theorists, even if some of those lunatics actually managed to attain the height of power, from where they played a central role in the catastrophe.  No, what’s terrified me more are the blank-faced bureaucrats who’ve signed the paperwork that amounted to death warrants.  Like, for example, the state regulators who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html?referringSource=articleShare">ordered the Seattle infectious disease expert to stop</a>, after she’d had enough of the government’s failure to allow corona tests, took it upon herself to start testing anyway, and found lots of positive results.  Notably, only some countries have empowered lunatics, but the blank-faced bureaucrats rule everywhere unless something stronger overrides them.</p>



<p>Second, I’ll forever ask myself what went wrong with me, that it took me until metaphorical 1939 to acknowledge the scale of an unfolding catastrophe (on more than a purely intellectual level)—even while others were trying to tell me way back in metaphorical 1933.  Even so, better metaphorical 1939 than metaphorical 1946.</p>



<p><strong>Without further ado, Steve’s essay:</strong></p>



<p>The most expensive meal I ever ate was in San Francisco at a restaurant called Eight Tables. As the name implies, the restaurant has only eight tables. The meal cost $1,000 and featured 12 courses, prepared by award-winning chefs.</p>



<p>The most expensive meal a person ever ate was in late 2019, in China, and consisted of under-cooked bat meat. It cost trillions of dollars. The person who ate it, possibly a peasant, changed the course of the 21st century. The bat he ate contained a virus, and the virus threatened to spread from this man to the rest of humanity.</p>



<p>I’m making up some details, of course. Maybe the man wasn’t a peasant. Or he could have been a woman. Or the bat could have been a pangolin. Or maybe, through a lucky accident (the guy was a loner perhaps), it could have not spread. That could have happened, but it didn’t. Or maybe sometimes that does happen and we don’t know it. These are just accidents of history.</p>



<p>I’m writing this on March 9, 2020. The good news is that the virus, in its current form, doesn’t kill children. I am so thankful for that. The bad news is that the virus does kill adults. The virus is like a grim reaper, culling the sick, the debilitated, and the elderly from the population. It attacks the pulmonary system. I heard a 25-year-old survivor describing how he became unable to control his breathing and could not fall asleep or he would die. Even for healthy young people, the prognosis is often poor. </p>



<p>There were Jews in Europe in the 1930s who sat around tables with the elders of their families and villages and debated whether to leave for America, or Palestine, or South America. Most of them, including my grandmother’s family, didn’t leave, and were largely exterminated. The virus of the time was Nazism, and it too attacked the pulmonary systems of the old and the debilitated, in that case with poisonous gasses.</p>



<p>When you grow up as I did, you are taught to have a paranoia in the back of your mind that there is a major disaster about to happen. That a holocaust, or something of that magnitude, might occur in your lifetime. And so you are never complacent. For your whole life, you’re looking and waiting for a history changing event. You try to ensure that you are willing to follow your thoughts to their logical conclusion and take the necessary actions as a result, unlike many of the Jews of 1930s Europe, who refused to confront the obstacle in front of them until it was too late, and unlike many politicians and world leaders today, who are doing the same.</p>



<p>And the conclusion we must now confront is clear. We are watching a once-in-a-century event unfold. Coronavirus–its mutations, its spawn–will change the course of human history. It will overwhelm our defense system and may kill millions. It may continue to mutate and kill millions more. We will develop painful social measures to slow its spread. We will produce vaccines and better treatment protocols. Some of this will help, but none of this will work perfectly. What will happen to society as this unfolds?</p>



<p>My favorite biblical verse comes from Ecclesiastes: To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck that which is planted. And so on.</p>



<p>The season has changed, and the seven years of famine have begun.</p></div>

In this paper, we are interested in understanding the complexity of computing multilinear polynomials using depth four circuits in which polynomial computed at every node has a bound on the individual degree of $r$ (referred to as multi-$r$-ic circuits). The goal of this study is to make progress towards proving superpolynomial lower bounds for general depth four circuits computing multilinear polynomials, by proving better and better bounds as the value of $r$ increases.
	
  Recently, Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018) showed that any depth four arithmetic circuit of bounded individual degree $r$ computing a multilinear polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $d=o(n)$, must have size at least $\left(\frac{n}{r^{1.1}}\right)^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{r}}\right)}$ when $r$ is $o(d)$ and is strictly less than $n^{1.1}$. This bound however deteriorates with increasing $r$. It is a natural question to ask if we can prove a bound that does not deteriorate with increasing $r$ or a bound that holds for a "larger" regime of $r$.

  We here prove a lower bound which does not deteriorate with $r$, however for a specific instance of $d = d(n)$ but for a wider range of $r$. Formally, we show that there exists an explicit polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ such that any depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $r&lt;n^{0.2}$ must have size at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^2 n))$. This improvement is obtained by suitably adapting the complexity measure of Kayal et al. (Theory of Computing, 2018). This adaptation of the measure is inspired by the complexity measure used by Kayal et al. (SIAM J. Computing, 2017).</div>

Nisan showed in 1991 that the width of a smallest noncommutative single-(source,sink) algebraic branching program (ABP) to compute a noncommutative polynomial is given by the ranks of specific matrices. This means that the set of noncommutative polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is Zariski-closed, an important property in geometric complexity theory. It follows that approximations cannot help to reduce the required ABP width.

It was mentioned by Forbes that this result would probably break when going from single-(source,sink) ABPs to trace ABPs. We prove that this is correct. Moreover, we study the commutative monotone setting and prove a result similar to Nisan, but concerning the analytic closure. We observe the same behavior here: The set of polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is closed for single-(source,sink) ABPs and not closed for trace ABPs. The proofs reveal an intriguing connection between tangent spaces and the vector space of flows on the ABP.
We close with additional observations on VQP and the closure of VNP which allows us to establish a separation between the two classes.</div>

<p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/07/20/updated-python-library.html">My first post on this blog</a>, lo these nearly 15 years ago, discussed a program I had written to try to solve Sudoku puzzles deductively (rather than by the easier computational method, backtracking), with the goal of being able to automatically grade the puzzles and automatically generate explanations for how to solve a given puzzle. And a few months later I posted again, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/10/15/assuming-uniqueness-in.html">deduction rules that take advantage of the assumption that a puzzle has a unique solution</a>, by ruling out choices that would cause any solution consistent with them to become non-unique. Since then, that part of my solver has been relatively stable, although I have added other rules for <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/02/23/solving-single-digit-sudoku.html">Nishio</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/04/26/sudoku-and-2sat.html">2SAT</a> and posted here about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/07/28/any-order-puzzle.html">more general uniqueness deduction rules in map-coloring puzzles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also occasionally been using my program to generate puzzles for me to work on, and today it found an interesting test case, a puzzle that it thought would be much more difficult than it turned out to be for me. This mis-rating happened because the uniqueness deduction rules I’m using in my own deductions are stronger than the ones in my program (although some of its other rules are stronger than I typically apply myself). In its initial state, the puzzle looks like:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-givens.svg" alt="Sudoku puzzle" /></p>

<p>My program tells me that it’s at the second highest level of difficulty that it knows about: it has to resort to using 2SAT, but it can successfully solve it that way. (The highest level is for puzzles where it is forced to use backtracking.) Usually, for me, puzzles at that level require me to use written notes to keep track of the deductions, rather than doing it all in my head, but not this time. Using more-or-less standard reasoning, one can fill in the cells of the puzzle to reach the state:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-partial.svg" alt="Partially solved Sudoku puzzle" /></p>

<p>This is where my program gets stuck and has to resort to more powerful deduction rules. But as a human solving this puzzle, here is what I see: In row 3, the two empty cells must contain the pair of digits 3 and 5. In the center right block of nine cells, the two empty cells must again be 3 and 5. And in the center block of cells, the 5 digit is confined to three cells aligned with those two pairs of empty cells. If the 3 digit were also confined to the same three cells in the center block, it and the five would have to occupy the two diagonally aligned cells out of the three, because otherwise they would line up and prevent one of the other pairs of 3-5 cells from having any value. But then the 3-5 cells in row 3, the center block, and column 7 would form a closed system (shown by the red squares below): nothing else outside those cells could affect which of those six cells contains 3, and which contains 5. Within that closed system, there are two solutions, obtained from each other by swapping the locations of the 3 and the 5. But that would violate the assumption of uniqueness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-closed.svg" alt="Closed system of cells in a partially solved Sudoku puzzle" /></p>

<p>Even if the 7 in the center cell weren’t there, the same reasoning would apply. Since this closed system with a non-unique solution would happen automatically if we confine the digit 3 to the same three center-block cells as the digit 5, the digit 3 must be elsewhere in the center block, which can only mean that it is in column 4. Once we make this deduction, the rest of the puzzle falls into place.</p>

<p>My program only has built into it a couple of ad-hoc rules to prevent closed systems of four cells with two solutions, and it misses the one in this example because it involves six cells. It’s making me think that I need a more general description of the possible closed systems (at least the ones involving only two digit values, like this), in order to match the deductions I’m making by hand and make my program’s difficulty estimates more accurate.</p>

<p>In this blog’s now 15-year-history, at Waterloo and then MIT and now UT Austin, I’ve tried to make it clear that I blog <em>always</em> as Scott, never as Dr. Aaronson of Such-and-Such Institution.  (God knows I’ve written a few things that a prudent dean might prefer that I hadn’t—though if I couldn’t honestly say that, in what sense would I even enjoy “academic freedom”?)  Today, though, for <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167">only about</a> the second time, I’m also writing as a professor motivated by a duty of care toward his students.</p>



<p>A week ago, most of my grad students were in the Bay Area for a workshop; they then returned and spent a week hanging around the CS building like normal.  Yesterday I learned that at least one of those students developed symptoms consistent with covid19.  Of course, it’s much more likely to be a boring cold or flu—but still, in any sane regime, just to be certain, such a person would <strong>promptly get tested</strong>.</p>



<p>After quarantining himself, my student called the “24/7 covid19 hotline” listed in an email from the university’s president, but found no one answering the phone over the weekend.  Yesterday he finally got through—only to be told, flatly, that he couldn’t be tested due to insufficient capacity.  When I heard this, I asked my department chair and dean to look into the matter, and received confirmation that yeah, it sucks, but this is the situation.</p>



<p>If it’s true that, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/coronavirus-testing-new-york.html?fbclid=IwAR24o0pcDW2n6usYpyIC-bPhGUhoIkYAcvS_R4QvPv8yEdp0KsEF1XJWQv8">as I’ve read</a>, the same story is currently playing itself out all over the country, then this presumably isn’t the fault of anyone in UT’s health service or the city of Austin.  Rather, as they say in the movies, it goes all the way to the top, to the CDC director and ultimately the president—or rather, to the festering wound that now sits where the top used to be.</p>


<p>Speaking of movies, over the weekend Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contagion-Marion-Cotillard/dp/B006IVBSBU">Contagion</a>, as apparently many people are now doing.  I confess that I’d missed it when it came out in 2011.  I think it’s a cinematic masterpiece.  It freely violates many of the rules of movie narrative: characters are neither done in by their own hubris, nor saved by their faith or by being A-list stars.  But <em>Contagion</em> is also more than a glorified public service announcement about the importance of washing your hands.  It wants to show you the reality of the human world of its characters, and <em>also</em> the reality of a virus, and how the two realities affect each other despite obeying utterly different logic.  It will show a scene that’s important to the charaters for human reasons, and then it will show you the same scene again, except this time making you focus on whose hand touched which surface in which order.<br /></p>
<p>But for all its excellence and now-obvious prescience, there are two respects in which Contagion failed to predict the reality of 2020.  The first is just a lucky throw of the RNA dice: namely, that the real coronavirus is perhaps an order of magnitude less fatal than the movie virus, and for some unknown reason it spares children.  But the second difference is terrifying.  All the public health authorities in the movie are ultra-empowered and competent.  They do badass things like injecting themselves with experimental vaccines.  If they stumble, it’s only in deeply understandable ways that any of us might (e.g., warning their own loved ones to evacuate a city before warning the public).</p>
<p>In other words, when the scriptwriters, writing their disaster movie, tried to imagine the worst, they failed to imagine a US government that would essentially abandon the public, by</p>
<p>(1) botching a simple test that dozens of other countries performed without issue,<br />(2) preventing anyone else from performing their own tests, and then<br />(3) turning around and using the lack of positive test results to justify its own inaction.</p>
<p>They failed to imagine a CDC that might as well not exist for all it would do in its hour of need: one that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1236967513008877568">didn’t even bother to update its website on weekends</a>, and stopped publishing data once the data became too embarrassing.  The scriptwriters <em>did</em> imagine a troll gleefully spreading lies about the virus online, endangering anyone who listened to him.  They failed to imagine a universe where that troll was the president.</p>


<p>“I mean, don’t get me wrong,” they told me.  “Trump is a racist con artist, a demagogue, the precise thing that Adams and Hamilton and Franklin tried to engineer our republic to avoid.  Just, don’t get so <em>depressed</em> about it all the time!  Moaning about how we’re trapped in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3294">freakishly horrible</a> branch of the wavefunction, blah blah.  I mean look on the bright side!  What an incredible run of luck we’ve had, that we elected a president with the mental horizons of a sadistic toddler, and yet <em>in three years he hasn’t caused even one apocalypse</em>.  You’re alive and healthy, your loved ones are alive and healthy.  It could be a lot worse!”</p>



<p>The above, I suspect, is a sentiment that will now forever date any writing containing it to January 2020 or earlier.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In the early days of theoretical computer science, say 1960-1990 the main tools used were logic.<br />
This made sense since, early on:<br />
<br />
a) Some of the basic notions like DTIME(T(n)), P, NP used Turing Machines in their definitions<br />
<br />
b) Some of the basic notions like reductions were modeled after similar concepts in<br />
computability theory.<br />
<br />
One of the people who did much work in the interface between Logic and TCS was Paul Young.<br />
He <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/03/05/remembering-paul-young-1936-2019/">passed away</a> in December. Here are some highlights of his work:<br />
<br />
1) One of the first books that covered both computability and complexity:<br />
<br />
An Introduction to the general theory of Algorithms<br />
by Machtey and Young.<br />
<br />
2) In Computability theory all many-one complete sets are computably isomorphic. Berman and<br />
Hartmanis conjectured that the poly-many-one degree of the NP-complete sets was the same. This<br />
would mean that all NP-complete sets were poly-isom (all of the known ones are).<br />
<br />
Mahaney and Young in the paper<br />
<br />
<i>Reductions Among Polynomial Isomorphism Types</i><br />
<br />
showed that every many-one poly degree either has one degree or has an infinite number of<br />
degrees in a very complicated way.<br />
<br />
3) Recall that a <i>Cook Reduction from A to B </i>allows many queries to B, whereas a <i>Karp Reduction</i><br />
only allows one query and your answer must be the same sense as the query.<br />
Are there  cases where a Cook reduction is faster? Yes, from the paper<br />
<br />
<i>Cook reducibility is faster than Karp Reducibility</i><br />
<br />
by Longpre and Young<br />
<br />
(The original title was going to be <i>Cook is Faster than Karp</i>, but it was changed since it invoked<br />
images of Cook and Karp in a footrace.  Hmmm. Which one would be faster?)<br />
<br />
<br />
4) The <i>Boolean Hierarchy </i>is a hierarchy of iterations of NP sets. What if instead of starting with P<br />
one started with RP (Randomized Poly time). What an intriguing notion! To find out read<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Generalized Boolean Hierarchies over RP</i><br />
<br />
by  Alberto Bertoni, Danilo Bruschi, Deborah Joseph, Meera Sitharam, Paul Young<br />
<br />
5) There are many more, mostly on the theme of the interaction of logic and computer science.<br />
<br />
                       I saw him speak on some of these topics and was inspired by how much one could<br />
take notions of computability and translate them into complexity theory.  The field has gone in a<br />
different direction since then (more combinatorial) but we still use many of the basic concepts<br />
like reducibility.  As such we all owe a debit to Paul Young.</div>

We prove that the method that has been used to construct the fastest algorithms for rectangular matrix multiplication cannot give optimal algorithms. In fact, we prove a precise numerical barrier for this method. Our barrier improves the previously known barriers, both in the numerical sense, as well as in its generality. We prove our result using the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. More precisely, we crucially make use of two families of real tensor parameters with special algebraic properties: the quantum functionals and the support functionals. In particular, we prove that any lower bound on the dual exponent of matrix multiplication $\alpha$ via the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensors cannot exceed 0.625.</div>

<p>As the coronavirus epidemic advances in Italy with a 25-30% growth rate (meaning that the numbers are doubling every 3-4 days), and after two weeks of “lockdown-lite” in Northern Italy seems to have made no difference, the Italian government imposed on Sunday morning a stricter lockdown on the region of Lombardy and some cities outside the region including Venice. Several people have reached out to ask how things are going, so here is a brief recap. </p>
<p><span id="more-4322"></span></p>
<p>First of all, I would like to give a shoutout to Taiwan, which is currently the country that has done the <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/other/pieces/how-taiwan-managed-to-avoid-a-coronavirus-outbreak/">best job stopping an outbreak</a>. The Taiwanese have several things going for them: the SARS scare made the government plan for the next epidemic, instead of making it up as it would go along, and their preparedness was impressive. The plan focused on isolation, contact-tracing, and people being careful: kudos to the Taiwanese for how well they complied. From the little that I have learned about Taiwan after living there for two months a couple of years ago, the Taiwanese are not rule-followers the way the Swiss or the Singaporean can be. But if they bend or break rules, they do that after a lot of consideration for how this impacts others. Basically, people <i>care about strangers</i>, a disposition that helps a lot in controlling an epidemic (and which is not a big part of the Italian national mood).</p>
<p>But let’s talk about me. This is my mood right now:<br />
<img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/self_isolate.png?w=584" alt="self_isolate" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4326" /></p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> by Randall Munroe)</p>
<p>Since we are past isolation-and-contact-tracing, the main goal is to reduce person-to-person contact so that we can stop the exponential growth. For the past two weeks, besides the usual recommendations (do not kiss hello and goodbye, do not shake hands, wash hands frequently, do not touch your face) the government recommended keeping a one-meter distance from other people. There has been some inventive ways to keep going under these requirements. For example cinemas (in the regions in which they were not required to shut down) sold tickets for at most a third of the seats, asking people to leave two empty seats between any occupied seats. </p>
<p>Last Saturday, before the newest set of regulations were in place, I went out for a drink. The bar had cordoned off the counter area</p>
<p> <img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/img_9383.jpg?w=584" alt="IMG_9383" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4328" /></p>
<p>They asked everybody who came in to seat down, at one of a few well-separated tables. Gloves-wearing servers took orders and brought some food (instead of the usual buffet). Once all tables were taken, a server stood outside preventing other people from coming in.</p>
<p>As we were drinking our aperitivi at a safe distance from each other, news began to leak of the new measures, which the government eventually announced at 2am Sunday morning. The leak suggested that Lombardy, Venice, and other places, would be included in the so-called <i>red zone</i>, which was a group of small towns that had been completely isolated for the past two weeks (nobody could go in and out except ambulances, trash collection trucks, and deliveries). In a development that might not have happened in Taiwan, a few hundred people rushed to train stations in Milan and Venice to flee South.</p>
<p>The actual regulations allowed travel in and out of the places affected by the new lockdown, but only for <i>demonstrated work or health reasons</i>. This is what the regulation said, but how would people prove their reason? The Italian genius for bureaucracy started cranking in the next few hours, and now, at train stations, people are required to sign an affidavit stating the existence of such a reason before boarding a train:</p>
<p><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/affidavit.jpeg?w=584" alt="affidavit" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4329" /></p>
<p>In the locked-down cities, all bars and restaurants have to close by 6pm, and all places where people may congregate (including churches, gyms, swimming pools, in addition to museums, schools and universities which were already closed) are closed all day. Even funeral and weddings are banned. Grocery stores will have to ensure that people stay within a meter of each other, making people wait outside and enter in small groups if necessary.</p>
<p>What about me? I am procrastinating on writing blog posts about online optimization and on reviewing papers for ICALP, I have started reading William Gibson’s latest novel <i>Agency</i> and watching the tv series <i>Pose</i>, and I am cooking every meal. Considering that I like to sleep and that I am spending a fair amount of time on the phone, I have got the whole day covered.</p>
<p>What is next? At this point in Lombardy about a person in 2,500, or 0.04% of the population, is infected, and we have run out of ICU beds. The rate of infection in Wuhan peaked at about 0.6% of the population, and this was well past the point at which they had run out of hospital beds in general. Hopefully, here we will peak well below that. On the other hand, left to its own devices, in the absence of any containment measures, I have seen estimates that the disease would peak a bit higher than a flu epidemic, at 20% or even 60% of the population.</p>
<p>So, find the Taiwanese in yourself, think about others, and wash those hands.</p></div>

<p>
Maryam Aliakbarpour and Sandeep Silwal are PhD students at MIT. They have a joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Testing Properties of Multiple Distributions with Few Samples.” Aliakbarpour is advised by Ronitt Rubinfeld. Silwal has a different advisor, Piotr Indyk. Could we test which advisor is better by sampling? Haha, not a chance…</p>
<p>
Today we will discuss this paper as an example of the power of computer science theory.<br />
<span id="more-16767"></span></p>
<p>
Aliakbarpour and Silwal (AS) prove results on property testing, which is of course a long studied area in statistics, in mathematics, and in complexity theory. Many problems of property testing are open; many are very hard problems, and some are really impossible—such as distinguishing slight differences between distributions. With all due respect, the brilliance of their paper is not in solving open problems. Rather it is how they modify property testing in a novel manner. </p>
<p>
Their proofs are clever, are technically strong, but we feel more importantly is how they change the problems. That is, they show how to add a new constraint to property testing, where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The constraint is reasonable and appears to be natural; <p></p>
</li><li>
The constraint is powerful and allows efficient algorithms where previously none were possible.
</li></ol>
<p>Let’s look at this more closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Opening a Closed Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We all know about open problems and closed problems. There are however two kinds of closed problems: ones that have been settled and ones that have been proved impossible to settle. We also know that one can often take an open problem and define a meaningful subcase of it that can be solved. What may be less obvious is how one can do the same with the latter kind of closed problem.</p>
<p>
The work of AS is a perfect example of this phenomenon. They take a problem that is unsolvable and change it to one that is solvable. The details of their results are less important than their change to the underlying problem. One of the key insights throughout theory is that we often have made major progress by changing the ground rules. The AS work is a particularly clear case of this. </p>
<p></p><h2> The New Condition </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
AS call it the <i>structural condition</i>. They postulate a consistency type of condition on property testing. Suppose that one is interesting in testing whether or not a collection of slot-machines are fair. That is, are they set to cheat players or not? This is known to be hard to do with few tests. But after adding their new constraint it becomes quite efficient.</p>
<p>
Among some examples to convey their definition, they postulate a row of slot machines in a casino that are supposed to give the same distribution of prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" /> with known <em>fair</em> probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%28j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(j)}" class="latex" title="{q(j)}" />. As usual with property testing we want to distinguish between two hypotheses that are some distance apart: one that the machines conform to the fair distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> and an alternative hypothesis that each is far from fair. There are two relevant factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
We do not get to make many tests on one machine of our choosing. The best we can do is watch people try the machines. They may try different machines and so give only a few sample results per machine. <p></p>
</li><li>
There are cases of this situation 1 where although each machine is far from fair the joint distribution of a few samples cannot be told apart from fair. The authors mention a trivial case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is uniform and we get just one result from each machine, results all different from each other. These cannot be told apart. But there are less-trivial cases.
</li></ol>
<p>
Such situations are common with real-word data. The authors mention cases of medical data when one gets just one or a few blood readings from patients with disparate situational factors that can bias their samples. The joint effect of the biases may completely mask the systematic population tendency one is trying to test for. This is the setting in which the problem of distinguishing has been regarded as impossible, case closed. In the slot-machine example, Aliakbarpour and Silwal state their structural condition informally as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Our goal is to test whether all the machines were fair … or they are far from being fair. In this case, we can naturally assume that if the machines are unfair, the house will assign a lower probability to the expensive prizes, and higher probability to cheap ones. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course, the house <em>could</em> cheat players without cheating in this uniform manner. More subtle rigging of the machines in different ways could mask the lowered expectation. But what AS are saying is: <i>Provided the house cheats in this consistent manner, then they can be discovered quickly</i>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Formal Definition and Proof Idea </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The formal definition is that each of the true source distributions is biased the same way in the same components as the expected (“fair”) distribution:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 1</b> <em> A sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E1%2C%5Cdots%2C+p%5Em%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" class="latex" title="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" /> of distributions on a discrete domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" /> obeys the structural condition relative to the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> if there is a subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubset+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A \subset [n]}" class="latex" title="{A \subset [n]}" /> such that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi+%5Cin+%5Bm%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i \in [m]}" class="latex" title="{i \in [m]}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+%5Cin+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j \in [n]}" class="latex" title="{j \in [n]}" />: </em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cgeq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+j+%5Cin+A%5C%5C+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cleq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D.+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The term “structural condition” is vanilla and perhaps saying the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> are “conformally biased” relative to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> would be more descriptive. A major point which the authors emphasize right afterward is that the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is <em>unknown</em>. There are exponentially many possibilities for what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> could be—so we cannot try to guess it. Rather, proofs using this condition need to exploit how all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^{i}}" class="latex" title="{p^{i}}" /> distributions conform to the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. The slot-machine example arguably does not reflect this point in full—because we can know in advance what the major and minor prizes of a slot machine are (including “no prize” among the latter). The medical-data examples and others certainly do, however.</p>
<p>
We can convey briefly and intuitively how this condition is used for the case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is uniform distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" />—which is quite general as testing for many distributions can be efficiently mapped into this case. A key property of uniform distribution is that among all distributions on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" />, it minimizes the probability of getting <em>collisions</em> from repeated samples. This idea has yielded the most effective test statistics for problems when there is only one distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />. When there are multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> the effectiveness can be blunted in instances like the one in the previous section—the instances that are impossible. </p>
<p>
However, AS show that their structural condition is just what’s needed to bridge the gap that keeps the impossible cases from being distinguished. Realizing that the compounded complications of having multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> can be resolved by this stroke is their act of brilliance. Their paper applies it successfully to two other problem settings—identity testing and closeness testing—and also shows meaningful instances that obey and are resolved by their definition but that escape an older condition involving product distributions. As usual, we say to see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> for the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Consequences in Crypto and Inference? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
It remains our place to ask, in which other cases might the AS condition arise and what uses might it have? I can think first of one implication for adversarial strategies in cryptography. It goes like this:</p>
<p>
We can view the AS theorems as saying that anyone who wishes to cheat others should <b>not</b> be consistent. Being consistent according to some utility criterion—<em>even an unknown one</em>—makes it easier for others to detect that they are cheating. </p>
<p>
Following their slot-machine example suggests this: Arrange the machines in total to cheat players. But make it so that they are not consistent. They can set some prizes up in probability and some lower, and importantly, do this differently on different machines. They could even make some machines pay out more than the legal expectation—while still giving a small profit to the casino so it does not become too obvious to customers that those machines are “lucky.” There is safety in non-conformity alone. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CS+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \S " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \S " /></p>
<p>
Ken notices a similarity to the chess-modeling situation he began describing in this recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/">post</a>. Instead of prizes of known value, in chess we have distributions over possible moves whose values are <em>not</em> so readily apparent to the player—that’s what makes chess challenging to play. </p>
<p>
In his case, giving any chess position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> and a player <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> having that position, he postulates a true distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^t}" class="latex" title="{p^t}" /> of moves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> would make and wants to compare that with the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q^t}" class="latex" title="{q^t}" /> projected by his model. Now there can be many positions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> with different characteristics, but Ken can treat the distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q^t}" class="latex" title="{q^t}" /> coming from his model as one fixed point of reference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" />, and he can give different positions the same ranks of legal moves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> (best), then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2C%5Cdots%2C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2,\dots, n}" class="latex" title="{2,\dots, n}" />. If positions have different numbers of legal moves he can pad them out by treating illegal moves the same as completely losing blunders. </p>
<p>
So he has a situation like this: different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^t}" class="latex" title="{p^t}" /> and one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> over a bunch of positions. Ken knows his model not only varies in accuracy but is biased in ways explained in that post. It appears that this bias is highly conformal. The model is trained to make the projection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(1)}" class="latex" title="{q(1)}" /> of the probability of the first move accurate on average. Then the tendency is that the projections of the second-best and third-best moves are off one way, and the projections of all the other moves are off the other way. This is like having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D+%5C%7B2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A = \{2,3\}}" class="latex" title="{A = \{2,3\}}" /> or its complement most of the time. The new statistical tests that Ken is crafting also live under the specter of impossibility. A co-worker has demonstrated that they <em>fail</em> in cases randomly generated from normal distributions. But so far they are appearing to succeed in Ken’s more-structured situations from his real-world chess data. On this we will stay tuned.</p>

<p>It’s International Women’s Day, and <em>The Aperiodical</em> has a new piece up on “<a href="https://aperiodical.com/2020/03/iwd-2020-books-about-maths-by-women/">Books about Maths by Women</a>”.

<p>There are many more I could include, but haven’t yet (including most of the <em>Aperiodical</em> list). Many of these books are award-winners, but to a large extent inclusion in this list is driven by my personal taste in books, so many of these are somewhat specialized rather than being general-audience books. But the main criterion for inclusion on Wikipedia is that everything must have multiple in-depth sources, and everything in the article must come from those sources. For books those sources are not the book itself, but (typically) published book reviews. The bare minimum is two reviews, but I’ve been aiming for books with at least four. So for instance I would have liked to include <em>Geometry: The Line and the Circle</em> (2019), by Maureen T. Carroll and Elyn Rykken, but I could find only <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-the-line-and-the-circle">one review of it</a>, and that’s not enough. To all the book reviewers out there: your efforts are appreciated, and helpful.</p>

<p>Despite a wealth of February conference deadlines, papers were fairly sparse. We found <s>two</s> <s>EDIT: three</s> EDIT EDIT: four papers for the month of February, please share if we missed any relevant papers.</p>



<p><strong>Monotone probability distributions over the Boolean cube can be learned with sublinear samples</strong>, by Ronitt Rubinfeld and Arsen Vasilyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03415">arXiv</a>). By now, it is well known that assuming an (unknown) distribution enjoys some sort of structure can lead to more efficient algorithms for learning and testing. Often one proves that the structure permits a convenient representation, and exploits this representation to solve the problem at hand. This paper studies the learning of monotone distributions over the Boolean hypercube. The authors exploit and extend a structural statement about monotone Boolean <em>functions</em> by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43948-7_20">Blais, Håstad, Servedio, and Tan</a>, using it to provide sublinear algorithms for estimating the support size, distance to uniformity, and the distribution itself.</p>



<p><strong>Locally Private Hypothesis Selection</strong>, by Sivakanth Gopi, Gautam Kamath, Janardhan Kulkarni, Aleksandar Nikolov, Zhiwei Steven Wu, and Huanyu Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09465">arXiv</a>). Given a collection of \(k\) distributions and a set of samples from one of them, can we identify which distribution it is? This paper studies this problem (and an agnostic generalization of it) under the constraint of <em>local differential privacy</em>. The authors show that this problem requires \(\Omega(k)\) samples, in contrast to the \(O(\log k)\) complexity in the non-private model. Furthermore, they give \(\tilde O(k)\)-sample upper bounds in various interactivity models.</p>



<p><strong>Efficient Distance Approximation for Structured High-Dimensional Distributions via Learning</strong>, by Arnab Bhattacharyya, Sutanu Gayen, Kuldeep S. Meel, and N. V. Vinodchandran (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05378">arXiv</a>). Given samples from two distributions, can you estimate the total variation distance between them? This paper gives a framework for solving this problem for <em>structured</em> distribution classes, including Ising models, Bayesian networks, Gaussians, and causal models. The approach can be decomposed properly learning the distributions, followed by estimating the distance between the two hypotheses. Challenges arise when densities are hard to compute exactly.</p>



<p><strong>Profile Entropy: A Fundamental Measure for the Learnability and Compressibility of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11665">arXiv</a>). The histogram of a dataset is the collection of frequency counts of domain elements. The <em>profile</em> of a dataset can be succinctly described as the histogram of the histogram. Recent works have shown that, in some sense, discarding information about your dataset by looking solely at the profile can be beneficial for certain problems in which it is “universal”. This work explores two new quantities, the entropy and dimension of the profile, which turn out to play a key role in quantifying the performance of estimators based on the profile.</p></div>

<p>Many people have suggested coating handles, doorknobs and so forth with <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LwcKYR8bykM6vDHyo/coronavirus-justified-practical-advice-thread">virus-killing copper tape</a>.  It’s a shame that this isn’t being tried on a wider scale.  In the meantime, though, here’s a related but different idea that I had last night.</p>



<p>Imagine we could coat every doorknob, every light switch, every railing, every other surface that people might touch in public buildings, with some long-lasting disgusting, sticky, slimy substance.  For a variety of reasons, one probably wouldn’t use actual excrement, although it wouldn’t hurt if the substance <em>looked like</em> that.  Or it could be a sickly neon green or red, to make it impossible to conceal when you’d gotten the substance on your hands.</p>



<p>What would be the result?  Of course, people would avoid touching these surfaces.  If they had to, they’d do so with a napkin or glove whenever possible.  If they had to touch them bare-handedly, they’d rush to wash their hands with soap as soon as possible afterwards.  Certainly they wouldn’t touch their faces before having washed their hands.</p>



<p>In short, they’d show exactly the behaviors that experts agree are among the most helpful, if our goal is to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  In effect, we’d be plugging an unfortunate gap in our evolutionary programming—namely, that the surfaces where viruses can thrive aren’t intuitively disgusting to us, as (say) vomit or putrid meat are—by <em>making</em> those surfaces disgusting, as they ought to be in the middle of a pandemic.</p>



<p>Note that, even if it <em>somehow</em> turns out to be infeasible to coat all the touchable surfaces in public buildings with disgusting goo, you might still derive great personal benefit from <em>imagining</em> them so covered.  If you manage to pull that off, it will yield just the right heuristic for when and how often you should now be washing your hands (and avoiding touching your face), without no need for additional conscious reflection.</p>



<p>Mostly, having the above thoughts made me grateful for my friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson">Robin Hanson</a>.  For as long Robin is around, <a href="https://twitter.com/robinhanson/status/1235020994110205953">tweeting</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/consider-controlled-infection.html">blogging</a> from his unique corner of mindspace, no one will ever be able to say that <em>my</em> ideas for how to control the coronavirus were the world’s weirdest or most politically tone-deaf.</p></div>

Motivated by problems in algebraic complexity theory (e.g., matrix multiplication) and extremal combinatorics (e.g., the cap set problem and the sunflower problem), we introduce the geometric rank as a new tool in the study of tensors and hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is an upper bound on the subrank of tensors and the independence number of hypergraphs. We prove that the geometric rank is smaller than the slice rank of Tao, and relate geometric rank to the analytic rank of Gowers and Wolf in an asymptotic fashion. As a first application, we use geometric rank to prove a tight upper bound on the (border) subrank of the matrix multiplication tensors, matching Strassen's well-known lower bound from 1987.</div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Several people asked me to comment on the recent announcement by Honeywell that they’ll soon have what they call “the most powerful” quantum computer (see <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/en-us/newsroom/news/2020/03/behind-the-scenes-of-a-major-quantum-breakthrough">here for press release</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2020/03/03/honeywell-surprisingly-announces-it-will-be-releasing-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-in-the-world/#c271c5114b4a">here for <em>Forbes</em> article</a>, <a href="https://www.honeywell.com/content/dam/honeywell/files/Beta_10_Quantum_3_3_2020.pdf">here for paper</a>).  </p>



<p>I’m glad that Honeywell, which many people might know as an air-conditioner manufacturer, has entered the race for trapped-ion QC.  I wish them success.  I’ve known about what they were doing in part because Drew Potter, my friend and colleague in UT Austin’s physics department, took a one-year leave from UT to contribute to their effort.</p>



<p>Here I wanted to comment about one detail in Honeywell’s announcement: namely, the huge emphasis on “quantum volume” as the central metric for judging quantum computing progress, and the basis for calling their own planned device the “most powerful.”  One journalist asked me to explain why quantum volume is such an important measure.  I had to give her an honest answer: I don’t know whether it is.</p>



<p>Quantum volume was invented a few years ago by a group at IBM.  According to one of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12926.pdf">their papers</a>, it can be defined roughly as 2<sup>k</sup>, where k is the largest number such that you can run a k-qubit random quantum circuit, with depth k and with any-to-any connectivity, and have at least (say) 2/3 probability of measuring an answer that passes some statistical test.  (In the paper, they use what Lijie Chen and I named <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05903">Heavy Output Generation</a>, though Google’s Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark is similar.)</p>



<p>I don’t know why IBM takes the “volume” to be 2<sup>k</sup> rather than k itself.  Leaving that aside, though, the idea was to invent a single “goodness measure” for quantum computers that can’t be gamed <em>either</em> by building a huge number of qubits that don’t maintain nearly enough coherence (what one might call “the D-Wave approach”), <em>or</em> by building just one perfect qubit, <em>or</em> by building qubits that behave well in isolation but don’t interact easily.  Note that the any-to-any connectivity requirement makes things harder for architectures with nearest-neighbor interactions only, like the 2D superconducting chips being built by Google, Rigetti, or IBM itself.</p>



<p>You know the notion of a researcher’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index">h-index</a>—defined as the largest h such that she’s published h papers that garnered h citations each?  Quantum volume is basically an h-index for quantum computers.  It’s an attempt to take several different yardsticks of experimental progress, none terribly useful in isolation, and combine them into one “consumer index.”</p>



<p>Certainly I sympathize with the goal of broadening people’s focus beyond the “but how many qubits does it have?” question—since the answer to that question is meaningless without further information about what the qubits can <em>do</em>.  From that standpoint, quantum volume seems like a clear step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Alas, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a> states that “as soon as a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”  That happened years ago with the h-index, which now regularly pollutes academic hiring and promotion decisions, to the point where <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09496">its inventor expressed regrets</a>.  Quantum volume is now looking to me like another example of Goodhart’s Law at work.</p>



<p>The position of Honeywell’s PR seems to be that, if they can build a device that can apply 6 layers of gates to 6 qubits, with full connectivity and good fidelity, that will then count as “the world’s most powerful quantum computer,” since it will have the largest volume.  One problem here is that such a device could be simulated by maintaining a vector of only 2<sup>6</sup>=64 amplitudes.  This is nowhere near quantum supremacy (i.e., beating classical computers at some well-defined task), which is a necessary though not sufficient condition for doing anything useful.</p>



<p>Think of a university that achieves an average faculty-to-student ratio of infinity by holding one class with zero students.  It gets the “best score” only by exploiting an obvious defect in the scoring system.</p>



<p>So what’s the alternative?  The policy <em>I</em> prefer is simply to tell the world all your system specs, as clearly as you can, with no attempts made to bury the lede.  How many qubits do you have?  With what coherence times?  With what connectivity?  What are the 1- and 2-qubit gate fidelities?  What depth of circuit can you do?  What resources do the standard classical algorithms need to simulate your system?  Most importantly: what’s the main drawback of your system, the spec that’s the <em>worst</em>, the one you most need to improve?  What prevents you from having a scalable quantum computer right now?  And are you going to tell me, or will you make me scour Appendix III.B in your paper, or worse yet, ask one of your competitors?</p>



<p>I confess that the answers to the above questions are hard to summarize in a single number (unless you, like, concatenated binary encodings of them or something).  But they <em>can</em> be ineffably combined, to produce a progress metric that one of my postdocs suggested calling “quantum scottness,” and which roughly equals the number of expressions of wide-eyed surprise minus the number of groans.</p></div>
