Mary Kay Farley, my dear wife’s mom, and Dorothy Lipton, my mom, have unfortunately both have passed away. Kathryn and I miss them greatly.</p>
<p>
Today is <b>not</b> Mother’s Day. We still hope all mothers everywhere are enjoying their day.</p>
<p>
We will take this time to thank all of you out there. We missed doing so last month, but the pandemic has distended time anyway. What we are hearing now are stories of mothers and children and grandchildren finally being able to think of seeing each other in person rather than via video.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Another Kind of Parentage </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This has blended with musings on our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/26/congrats-avi-and-laci-on-the-abel-prize/">post</a> in which I (Dick) noted that Dorit Aharonov is an academic grandchild of mine, in that Avi Wigderson co-supervised her doctoral thesis and I supervised Avi’s. </p>
<p>
Years ago we featured on Father’s Day a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/06/19/who's-your-doktorvater/">post</a> with the title “Who’s Your <em>Doktorvater</em>?”—which was a play on the <a href="https://bosoxinjection.com/2014/09/24/ten-years-gone-pedro-martinez-calls-yankees-daddy/">expression</a> “who’s your daddy?” Now it is high time to note that there are many “doctor mothers”—as Dorit has herself <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=102209">become</a>. </p>

One difference from human genealogy is that most often there is only one “doctor parent.” My <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=86340&amp;fChrono=1">advisor</a>, David Parnas, has two: Alan Perlis and Everard Williams. From Perlis it is a straight shot back to Siméon Poisson, whose 1800 dissertation was co-advised by Joseph Lagrange and Pierre Laplace. For Lagrange there is a strange <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=17864">note</a> of Leonhard Euler as a virtual advisor, but the real one is Giovanni Beccaria—who has no listed parent. Going through Laplace also dead-ends. But selecting Euler includes a chain that ends in the 1100s with Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharaf_al-Din_al-Tusi#Mathematics">improved</a> the complexity of approximately solving cubic equations.</p>
<p>
I appear not to have any female ancestors in my doctoral genealogy. I have two female PhD graduates, one of whom is a <em>Doktormutter</em>. Ken’s first female doctoral student, co-advised, had a successful thesis defense last week; he has another nearing the ABD stage. But I have known quite a few other “doctor mothers” personally. Today, Ken and I thought to recognize them.</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My Upbringing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Of these, the one with the most formative impact on me was Helena Rasiowa. I learned advanced logic from her when I was an undergraduate. </p>
<p>
Here is a tribute to <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/bookspapers/pdf/papers/Rasiowa.pdf">her</a> by Melvin Fitting: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I once heard Dana Scott criticize her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Metamathematics-Helena-SIKORSKI-RASIOWA/dp/B005JGKZXW">book</a>, <em>The Mathematics of Metamathematics</em> with Roman Sikorski, because, while it took an algebraic approach to logic, it did not carry the work further and consider set theory. If it had, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a> would have been discovered years earlier than it was. This is not, at heart, a criticism, but a tribute. The building of mathematics always goes on. Foundations, firmly laid, enable later construction, and the foundations laid by that book were powerfully firm. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken also points to logic as a formative influence—though from men at Oxford.  Both of us were attracted to Gödel-type undecidability issues in complexity theory in the early 1980s.  The nexus of logic and algebra has been important to us in different ways, Ken more with finite automata and descriptive complexity.  Courses in logic gave both of us a habit of framing problems along formal lines.</p>

Are there exceptions? </p><p>I have not seen any discussion of this point on the web. So here are my rules of thumb and some questions.(CORRECTION- a commenter points out that this IS discussed on the web. Even so, you can comment on my thoughts or give your thoughts or whatever you like.) </p><p>1) If  there are 3 or more people than use et al. Exception: If the three are VERY WELL KNOWN as a triple. E.g., <i>the double play was Tinkers to Evers to Chance. </i>Well, that would not really come up since in baseball nobody ever says <i>the double play was Tinkers et al.</i>  More relevant examples:</p><p>Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman</p><p>Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, also known as CLR</p><p>The more recent edition is</p><p>Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

Fox added the J and uses it since there was an actor named Michael Fox.)</p><p>I will soon give a quote from a math paper that amused me, but first some context.  The problem of determining if a poly in n variables over Z has an integer solution is called E(n). By the solution to Hilbert's 10th problem we know that there exists n such that E(n) is undecidable. E(9) is undecidable, but the status of E(8) is unknown (as of May 2021) and has been since the early 1980's. </p><p>Here is the quote (from <a href="http://maths.nju.edu.cn/~zwsun/14z.pdf">here</a>).</p><p><i>Can we replace 9 by a smaller number? It is believed so. In fact, A. Baker, Matijasevic and J.Robinson  even conjectured that E(3) is undecidable over N.</i></p><p>Note that Baker and Robinson get their first initial but Matijsaevic does not.</p><p>I suspect that they use J. Robinson since there is another mathematician with last name Robinson: Rafael Robinson who was Julia's Robinson's husband (to my younger readers--- there was a time when a women who got married took her husband's last name). There is at least one other Math-Robinson: Robert W Robinson. I do not think he is closely related. </p><p>Baker: I do not know of another mathematician named Baker. I tried Google, but the Bakers  I found were   not in the right time frame. I also kept finding hits to an anecdote about Poincare and a man whose profession was a baker (see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">here</a> though its later in that blog post). However, I suspect there was another mathematician named Baker which is why the author uses the first initial.  Its possible the author did not want to confuse Alan  Baker with Theodore Baker, one of the authors of Baker-Gill-Solovay that showed there were oracles that made P = NP and others that made P NE NP.  But somehow, that just doesn't seem right to me. I suspect there is only one mathematician with last name Matijsavic. </p><p>Thomas Alva Edison named his son Thomas Alva Edison Jr.  This was a bad idea but not for reasons of authorship, see <a href="http://edisontinfoil.com/taejr/edisonjr.htm">here</a>.</p><p><br /></p></div>

The stabilizer rank of a quantum state $\psi$ is the minimal $r$ such that $\left| \psi \right \rangle = \sum_{j=1}^r c_j \left|\varphi_j \right\rangle$ for $c_j \in \mathbb{C}$ and stabilizer states $\varphi_j$. The running time of several classical simulation methods for quantum circuits is determined by the stabilizer rank of the $n$-th tensor power of single-qubit magic states.

We prove a lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ on the stabilizer rank of such states, improving a previous lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ of Bravyi, Smith and Smolin [BSS16]. Further, we prove that for a sufficiently small constant $\delta$, the stabilizer rank of any state which is $\delta$-close to those states is $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound for approximate stabilizer rank.

Our techniques rely on the representation of stabilizer states as quadratic functions over affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and we use tools from analysis of boolean functions and complexity theory. The proof of the first result involves a careful analysis of directional derivatives of quadratic polynomials, whereas the proof of the second result uses Razborov-Smolensky low degree polynomial approximations and correlation bounds against the majority function.</div>

compute a measure of dissimilarity between two rooted trees with node labels.
The current best algorithm from more than a decade ago runs in $O(n ^ 3)$ time
[Demaine, Mozes, Rossman, and Weimann, ICALP 2007]. The same paper also showed
that $O(n ^ 3)$ is the best possible running time for any algorithm using the
so-called \emph{decomposition strategy}, which underlies almost all the known
algorithms for this problem. These algorithms would also work for the
\emph{weighted} tree edit distance problem, which cannot be solved in truly
sub-cubic time under the APSP conjecture [Bringmann, Gawrychowski, Mozes, and
Weimann, SODA 2018].
</p>
<p>In this paper, we break the cubic barrier by showing an $O(n ^ {2.9546})$
time algorithm for the \emph{unweighted} tree edit distance problem.
</p>
<p>We consider an equivalent maximization problem and use a dynamic programming
scheme involving matrices with many special properties. By using a
decomposition scheme as well as several combinatorial techniques, we reduce
tree edit distance to the max-plus product of bounded-difference matrices,
which can be solved in truly sub-cubic time [Bringmann, Grandoni, Saha, and
Vassilevska Williams, FOCS 2016].

that a problem having an O(n^3)-time or O(n^2)-time classic algorithm can be
solved by a known O(n^1.5)-time or O(n)-time quantum algorithm. The question
naturally arises: how much quantum speed-up is possible?
</p>
<p>The area of fine-grained complexity allows us to prove optimal lower-bounds
on the complexity of various computational problems, based on the conjectured
hardness of certain natural, well-studied problems. This theory has recently
been extended to the quantum setting, in two independent papers by Buhrman,
Patro, and Speelman (<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1911.05686">arXiv:1911.05686</a>), and by Aaronson, Chia, Lin, Wang, and
Zhang (<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1911.01973">arXiv:1911.01973</a>).
</p>
<p>In this paper, we further extend the theory of fine-grained complexity to the
quantum setting. A fundamental conjecture in the classical setting states that
the 3SUM problem cannot be solved by (classical) algorithms in time O(n^{2-a}),
for any a&gt;0. We formulate an analogous conjecture, the Quantum-3SUM-Conjecture,
which states that there exist no sublinear O(n^{1-b})-time quantum algorithms
for the 3SUM problem.
</p>
<p>Based on the Quantum-3SUM-Conjecture, we show new lower-bounds on the time
complexity of quantum algorithms for several computational problems. Most of
our lower-bounds are optimal, in that they match known upper-bounds, and hence
they imply tight limits on the quantum speedup that is possible for these
problems.

provide a unified framework for global optimization problems in the congest
model of distributed computing. Roughly speaking, for a given graph $G$ and a
collection of vertex-disjoint connected subsets $S_1,\ldots, S_\ell \subseteq
V(G)$, $(c,d)$ low-congestion shortcuts augment each subgraph $G[S_i]$ with a
subgraph $H_i \subseteq G$ such that: (i) each edge appears on at most $c$
subgraphs (congestion bound), and (ii) the diameter of each subgraph $G[S_i]
\cup H_i$ is bounded by $d$ (dilation bound). It is desirable to compute
shortcuts of small congestion and dilation as these quantities capture the
round complexity of many global optimization problems in the congest model. For
$n$-vertex graphs with constant diameter $D=O(1)$, Das-Sarma et al. (STOC 2011,
SIAM J. Comput. 2012) presented an (implicit) shortcuts lower bound with (As
usual, $\tilde{O}()$ and $\tilde{\Omega}()$ hide poly-logarithmic factors.)
$c+d=\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{(D-2)/(2D-2)})$. A nearly matching upper bound,
however, was only recently obtained for $D \in \{3,4\}$ by Kitamura et al.
(DISC 2019).
</p>
<p>In this work, we resolve the long-standing complexity gap of shortcuts in
constant diameter graphs, originally posed by Lotker et al. (PODC 2001). We
present new shortcut constructions which match, up to poly-logarithmic terms,
the lower bounds of Das-Sarma et al. As a result, we provide improved and
existentially optimal algorithms for several network optimization tasks in
constant diameter graphs, including MST, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum
cuts and more.

low-space model of Massively Parallel Computation (MPC). Recently Ghaffari,
Kuhn and Uitto (FOCS 2019) introduced the class of component-stable low-space
MPC algorithms, which are, informally, defined as algorithms for which the
outputs reported by the nodes in different connected components are required to
be independent. This very natural notion was introduced to capture most (if not
all) of the known efficient MPC algorithms to date, and it was the first
general class of MPC algorithms for which one can show non-trivial conditional
lower bounds. In this paper we enhance the framework of component-stable
algorithms and investigate its effect on the complexity of randomized and
deterministic low-space MPC. Our key contributions include:
</p>
<p>1) We revise and formalize the lifting approach of Ghaffari, Kuhn and Uitto.
This requires a very delicate amendment of the notion of component stability,
which allows us to fill in gaps in the earlier arguments.
</p>
<p>2) We also extend the framework to obtain conditional lower bounds for
deterministic algorithms and fine-grained lower bounds that depend on the
maximum degree $\Delta$.
</p>
<p>3) We demonstrate a collection of natural graph problems for which
non-component-stable algorithms break the conditional lower bound obtained for
component-stable algorithms. This implies that, for both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, component-stable algorithms are conditionally weaker
than the non-component-stable ones.
</p>
<p>Altogether our results imply that component-stability might limit the
computational power of the low-space MPC model, at least in certain contexts,
paving the way for improved upper bounds that escape the conditional lower
bound setting of Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Uitto.

generated group of matrices. The Zariski closure was previously shown to be
computable by Derksen, Jeandel and Koiran, but the termination argument for
their algorithm appears not to yield any complexity bound. In this paper we
follow a different approach and obtain a bound on the degree of the polynomials
that define the closure. Our bound shows that the closure can be computed in
elementary time. We describe several applications of this result, e.g.,
concerning quantum automata and quantum universal gates. We also obtain an
upper bound on the length of a strictly increasing chain of linear algebraic
groups, all of which are generated over a fixed number field.

pattern matching that detects fragments in a sequential data stream which have
a similar structure as a query pattern. Formally, Cartesian-tree pattern
matching seeks all substrings $S'$ of the text string $S$ such that the
Cartesian tree of $S'$ and that of a query pattern $P$ coincide. In this paper,
we present a new indexing structure for this problem called the Cartesian-tree
Position Heap (CPH). Let $n$ be the length of the input text string $S$, $m$
the length of a query pattern $P$, and $\sigma$ the alphabet size. We show that
the CPH of $S$, denoted $\mathsf{CPH}(S)$, supports pattern matching queries in
$O(m (\sigma + \log (\min\{h, m\})) + occ)$ time with $O(n)$ space, where $h$
is the height of the CPH and $occ$ is the number of pattern occurrences. We
show how to build $\mathsf{CPH}(S)$ in $O(n \log \sigma)$ time with $O(n)$
working space. Further, we extend the problem to the case where the text is a
labeled tree (i.e. a trie). Given a trie $T$ with $N$ nodes, we show that the
CPH of $T$, denoted $\mathsf{CPH}(T)$, supports pattern matching queries on the
trie in $O(m (\sigma^2 + \log (\min\{h, m\})) + occ)$ time with $O(N \sigma)$
space. We also show a construction algorithm for $\mathsf{CPH}(T)$ running in
$O(N \sigma)$ time and $O(N \sigma)$ working space.

Euclidean cubical complexes. One application of this is in the nontrivial task
of verifying the execution of concurrent programs. The classical definition of
collapsibility involves certain conditions on a pair of cubes of the complex.
The direction of the space can be taken into account by requiring that the past
links of vertices remain homotopy equivalent after collapsing. We call this
type of collapse a link-preserving directed collapse. In this paper, we give
combinatorially equivalent conditions for preserving the topology of the links,
allowing for the implementation of an algorithm for collapsing a directed
Euclidean cubical complex. Furthermore, we give conditions for when
link-preserving directed collapses preserve the contractability and
connectedness of directed path spaces, as well as examples when link-preserving
directed collapses do not preserve the number of connected components of the
path space between the minimum and a given vertex.

of successful learning models. They achieve this through in-depth theoretical
analyses and experiential heuristics. However, there is no known
general-purpose procedure for rigorously evaluating whether newly proposed
models indeed successfully learn from data. We show that such a procedure
cannot exist. For PAC binary classification, uniform and universal online
learning, and exact learning through teacher-learner interactions, learnability
is in general undecidable, both in the sense of independence of the axioms in a
formal system and in the sense of uncomputability. Our proofs proceed via
computable constructions of function classes that encode the consistency
problem for formal systems and the halting problem for Turing machines into
complexity measures that characterize learnability. Our work shows that
undecidability appears in the theoretical foundations of machine learning:
There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm for deciding whether a machine learning
model can be successful. We cannot in general automatize the process of
assessing new learning models.

Following the paper of Alekhnovich, Ben-Sasson, Razborov, Wigderson \cite{ABRW04} we call a pseudorandom generator $\mathrm{PRG}\colon \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ hard for for a propositional proof system $\mathrm{P}$ if $\mathrm{P}$ cannot efficiently prove the (properly encoded) statement $b \notin \mathrm{Im}(\mathrm{PRG})$ for any string $b \in \{0, 1\}^m$.

In \cite{ABRW04} authors suggested the ``functional encoding'' of considered statement for Nisan--Wigderson generator that allows the introduction of ``local'' extension variables. These extension variables may potentially significantly increase the power of the proof system. In \cite{ABRW04} authors gave a lower bound $\exp\left[\frac{n^2}{m \Omega\left(2^{2^{\Delta}}\right)}\right]$ on the length of Resolution proofs where $\Delta$ is the degree of the dependency graph of the generator. This lower bound meets the barrier for the restriction technique.

In this paper, we introduce a ``heavy width'' measure for Resolution that allows showing a lower bound $\exp\left[\frac{n^2}{m 2^{O(\varepsilon \Delta)}}\right]$ on the length of Resolution proofs of the considered statement for the Nisan--Wigderson generator. This gives an exponential lower bound up to $\Delta := \log^{2 - \delta} n$ (the bigger degree the more extension variables we can use). It is a solution to an open problem from \cite{ABRW04}.</div>

This demonstration data and the feedback has generated a lot of discussion, including media coverage on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/993247101/for-the-u-s-census-keeping-your-data-anonymous-and-useful-is-a-tricky-balance">National Public Radio</a>, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2020-census-differential-privacy-ipums/2021/06/01/6c94b46e-c30d-11eb-93f5-ee9558eecf4b_story.html">the Washington Post</a>, and via <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-census-2020-technology-e701e313e841674be6396321343b7e49">the Associated Press</a>. The DAS is also the subject of an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59728874/state-v-united-states-department-of-commerce/">ongoing lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a response from experts on differential privacy and cryptography to the <a href="https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-05-28-census-das/Harvard-DAS-Evaluation.pdf">working paper of Kenny et al.</a> on the impact of the 2020 U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) on redistricting.</p>

<p>This paper makes a <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-06-14.md">common but serious mistake</a>, from which the authors wrongfully conclude the Census Bureau should not modernize its privacy-protection technology.  Not only do the results not support this conclusion, but they instead show the power of the methodology, known as differential privacy, adopted by the Bureau, precisely the opposite of the authors’ erroneous conclusions.</p>

<p>Trust is essential; once destroyed it can be nearly impossible to rebuild, and getting privacy wrong in this Census will have an impact on all future government surveys.  The Census Bureau has shown that their <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/index.html">2010 (DAS) does not survive modern privacy threats</a>, and in fact was roughly equivalent to publishing nearly three quarters of the responses.  The Census Bureau’s decision to modernize its Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) for the 2020 Decennial Census to be differentially private is the correct response to decades of theoretical and empirical work on the privacy risks inherent in releasing large numbers of statistics derived from a dataset.</p>

<p>The importance of the Census, and the reality that no technology competing with differential privacy exists for meeting their confidentiality obligations, makes it very important that the public and policy makers have accurate information. We imagine you will be reporting on this topic in the future.  Others have <a href="https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/DAS-evaluation-Kenny-response">addressed flaws</a> in the paper regarding implications for redistricting; we want to provide you with an understanding of the privacy mistake in the study.</p>

<p>To understand the flaw in the paper’s argument, consider the role of smoking in determining cancer risk.  Statistical study of medical data has taught us that smoking causes cancer.   Armed with this knowledge, if we are told that 40 year old Mr. S is a smoker, we can conclude that he has an elevated cancer risk.  The statistical inference of elevated cancer risk—made before Mr. S was born—did not violate Mr. S’s privacy. To conclude otherwise is to define science to be a privacy attack.  This is the mistake made in the paper.</p>

<p>This is basically what Kenny et al. found.</p>

<p>The authors looked at three different predictors: one built directly from (swapped) 2010 Census data and the other two built using differential privacy applied to (swapped) 2010 Census data, and evaluated all three “on approximately 5.8 million registered voters included in the North Carolina February 2021 voter file.”  What did they find?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our analysis shows that across three main racial and ethnic groups, the predictions based on the [differential privacy based] DAS data appear to be as accurate as those based on the 2010 Census data.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes perfect sense. Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, or BISG, is a statistical method of building a predictor inferring ethnicity (or race) from name and geography.  Here, name and geography play the role of the information as to whether or not one smokes, and the prediction of ethnicity corresponds to the cancer risk prediction.  The predictor is constructed from census data on the ethnic makeup of individual census blocks and statistical information about the popularity of individual surnames within different ethnic groups.  With such a predictor, moving across the country can change the outcome, as can changing one’s name.  But a BISG prediction is not about the individual, it is about the statistical—population-level—relationship between name, geography, and ethnicity.</p>

<p>The differentially private DAS enabled learning to make statistical inferences about ethnicity from name and geography, without compromising the privacy of any Census respondent, exactly as it was intended to do.  In other words, the paper establishes fitness-for-use of the DAS data for the BISG statistical method!  Because differential privacy permits learning statistical patterns without compromising the privacy of individual members of the dataset, it should not interfere with learning the predictor, which is exactly what the authors found. Returning to our “smoking causes cancer” example, the researchers found that it was just as easy to detect this statistical pattern with a modern disclosure avoidance system in place as it was with the older, less protective system.</p>

<p>The authors’ conclusions –“ the DAS data may not provide universal privacy protection” – are simply not supported by their findings.</p>

<p>They have confused learning that smoking causes cancer—and applying this predictor to an individual smoker—with learning medical details of individual patients in the dataset. Change the input to the predictor—replace “smoker” with “non-smoker” or move across the country, for example—and the prediction changes.</p>

<p>The BISG prediction is not about the individual, it does not accompany her as she relocates from one neighborhood to another, it is a statistical relationship between name, geography, and ethnicity.  It is not a privacy compromise, it is science.</p>

We give an explicit construction of an affine extractor (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) that works for affine sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy $k \ge~  \log n \cdot (\log \log n)^{1 + o(1)}$. This improves prior work of Li (FOCS'16) that requires  min-entropy at least $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$.
    
Our construction is based on the framework of using correlation breakers and resilient functions, a paradigm that was also used by Li. On a high level, the key sources of our improvement are based on the following new ingredients: (i) A new construction of  an affine somewhere random extractor, that we use in a crucial step instead of a linear seeded extractor (for which optimal constructions are not known) that was used by Li. (ii) A near optimal construction of a correlation breaker for linearly correlated sources. The construction of our correlation breaker takes inspiration from an exciting line of recent work that constructs two-source extractors for near logarithmic min-entropy.</div>

<p>In 2014, I wrote a blog post about a fake company <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/07/elfdrive.html">Elfdrive</a>.</p><blockquote style="border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;"><p>With a near record-setting investment announced last week, the self-driving car service Elfdrive is the hottest, most valuable technology start-up on the planet. It is also one of the most controversial.</p><p>The company, which has been the target of protests across Europe this week, has been accused of a reckless attitude toward safety, of price-gouging its customers, of putting existing cabbies out of work and of evading regulation. And it has been called trivial. In The New Yorker last year, George Packer huffed that Elfdrive typified Silicon Valley’s newfound focus on “solving all the problems of being 20 years old, with cash on hand.”</p><p>It is impossible to say whether Elfdrive is worth the $117 billion its investors believe it to be; like any start-up, it could fail. But for all its flaws, Elfdrive is anything but trivial. It could well transform transportation the way Amazon has altered shopping — by using slick, user-friendly software and mountains of data to completely reshape an existing market, ultimately making many modes of urban transportation cheaper, more flexible and more widely accessible to people across the income spectrum.</p></blockquote><p>It was a spoof on Uber but now it looks more like Tesla, expect that Tesla's market value is over half a trillion, about six times larger than General Motors.</p><p>The post was really about self-driving cars which I thought at the time would be commonplace by 2020. We are mostly there but there are issues of silent communication between drivers or between a driver and a pedestrian on who goes first that's hard to duplicate for a self-driving car. There is the paradox that if we make a car that will always stop if someone runs in front of it, then some people will run in front of it.</p><p>There is also the man-bites-dog problem. Any person killed by a self-driving car will be a major news item while the person killed by a human-driven car while you've been reading this post will never be reported.</p><p>We'll get to self-driving cars eventually, it just won't be all at once. We're already have basically self-driving cars on highways and in many other roads as well. As the technology improves and people see that it's safe at some point people will say, "So why do we even need the steering wheel anymore?"</p></div>

We identify two new big clusters of proof complexity measures equivalent up to
polynomial and $\log n$ factors. The first cluster contains, among others,
the logarithm of tree-like resolution size, regularized (that is, multiplied
by the logarithm of proof length) clause and monomial space, and clause
space, both ordinary and regularized, in regular and tree-like resolution. As
a consequence, separating clause or monomial space from the (logarithm of)
tree-like resolution size is the same as showing a strong trade-off between
clause or monomial space and proof length, and is the same as showing a
super-critical trade-off between clause space and depth. The second cluster
contains width, $\Sigma_2$ space (a generalization of clause
space to depth 2 Frege systems), both ordinary and regularized, as well as
the logarithm of tree-like size in the system $R(\log)$. As an application of some of
these simulations, we improve a known size-space trade-off for polynomial calculus with resolution. In
terms of lower bounds, we show a quadratic lower bound on tree-like
resolution size for formulas refutable in clause space $4$. We introduce on
our way yet another proof complexity measure intermediate between depth and
the logarithm of tree-like size that might be of independent interest.</div>

Suppose that a distribution $S$ can be approximately sampled by an
efficient cell-probe algorithm. It is shown to be possible to restrict
the input to the algorithm so that its output distribution is still
not too far from $S$, and at the same time many output coordinates
are almost pairwise independent.

Building on this several results are obtained, including:

- A lower bound for sampling prefix sums.

- A lower bound for sampling a variant of the predecessor problem.

- A separation between AC0 and cell-probe sampling.

- A separation between sampling with $O(q)$ and $q$ probes.

- A new proof of the Patrascu-Viola data-structure lower bound for
prefix sums, demonstrating the feasibility of obtaining data-structure
lower bounds via sampling.

- A separation between data structures making $O(q)$ and $q$ probes.

The only previous cell-probe lower bounds for sampling followed from
the AC0 lower bounds and applied to pseudorandom objects like error-correcting
and extractors, making them inadequate for the above applications.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: For a while now the problem of robustly learning a high-dimensional mixture of Gaussians has had a target on its back. The first works in algorithmic robust statistics gave provably robust algorithms for learning a single Gaussian. Since then there has been steady progress, including algorithms for robustly learning mixtures of spherical Gaussians, mixtures of Gaussians under separation conditions, and arbitrary mixtures of two Gaussians. In this talk we will discuss two recent works that essentially resolve the general problem. There are important differences in their techniques, setup, and overall quantitative guarantees, which we will discuss.</p>
<p>The talk will cover the following independent works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liu, Moitra, “Settling the Robust Learnability of Mixtures of Gaussians”</li>
<li>Bakshi, Diakonikolas, Jia, Kane, Kothari, Vempala, “Robustly Learning Mixtures of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> Arbitrary Gaussians”</li>

On 24 September, in what seems to be his last letter home before he left Vienna, Frank wrote: </div><blockquote style="margin-left: 80px; text-align: left;">I don’t see how there can be any such inquisition into my conduct in Vienna as you suppose seem to want to guard against.... No one can suppose that you can’t research for six months without having a paper ready by the end.

However, I will try to remember Ramsey's words next time someone proposes to make academic hirings and promotions conditional to having a certain number of papers or citations or whatever per year on average. <br /></div></div>

<p><strong>WINE 2021: The 17th Conference on Web and Internet Economics </strong></p>



<p><strong>December 14-17, 2021</strong><br /><strong>Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam, Germany</strong></p>



<p></p><blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><a href="https://hpi.de/wine2021/">Overview</a></blockquote><p></p>



<p>Over the past two decades, researchers in theoretical computer science, artificial intelligence, operations research, and economics have joined forces to understand the interplay of incentives and computation. These issues are of particular importance in the Web and the Internet that enable the interaction of large and diverse populations. The Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE) is an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and results on incentives and computation arising from these various fields. WINE 2021 continues the successful tradition of the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (named Workshop on Internet &amp; Network Economics until 2013), which was held annually from 2005 to present.</p>



<p>The program will feature invited talks, tutorials, paper presentations, and a poster session. All paper submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of their contribution, originality, soundness, and significance. Submissions are invited in, but not limited to, the following topics:</p>



<ul><li>Algorithmic Game Theory</li><li>Algorithmic Mechanism Design</li><li>Auction Algorithms and Analysis</li><li>Computational Advertising</li><li>Computational Aspects of Equilibria</li><li>Computational Social Choice</li><li>Learning in Markets and Mechanism Design</li><li>Learning under Strategic Behavior</li><li>Coalitions, Coordination, and Collective Action</li><li>Economic Aspects of Security and Privacy</li><li>Economic Aspects of Distributed Computing and Cryptocurrencies</li><li>Econometrics, ML, and Data Science</li><li>Behavioral Economics and Behavioral Modeling</li><li>Fairness and Trust in Games and Markets</li><li>Price Differentiation and Price Dynamics</li><li>Revenue Management</li><li>Social Networks and Network Games</li></ul>



<p><strong>Authors of the accepted papers will have a choice to attend the conference virtually.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Important Dates</strong></p>



<p>Paper submission deadline: July 12, 2021, 11:59pm Pacific Time</p>



<p>Author notification: September (exact date TBA)</p>



<p><strong>Submission Format</strong></p>



<p>Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts presenting original research on any of the research fields related to WINE 2021.</p>



<p>An extended abstract submitted to WINE 2021 should start with the title of the paper, each author’s name, affiliation and e-mail address, followed by a one-paragraph summary of the results to be presented. This should then be followed by a technical exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve these results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work.</p>



<p>The extended abstract should not exceed 18 single-spaced pages (excluding references) using reasonable margins (at least one-inch margins all around) and at least 11-point font. If the authors believe that more details are essential to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix (with no space limit) that will be read at the discretion of the Program Committee. It is strongly recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. The above specifications are meant to provide more freedom to the authors at the time of submission. Note that accepted papers will be allocated 14 pages (including references) in the LNCS format in the proceedings (see below).</p>



<p>The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the ARCoSS/LNCS series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. Accepted papers will be allocated 14 pages total in the LNCS format in the proceedings. Submissions are encouraged, though not required, to follow the LNCS format (Latex, Word). More information about the LNCS format can be found on the <a href="https://www.springer.com/cn/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">author instructions page of Springer-Verlag</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Best Paper Award</strong></p>



<p>The program committee will decide upon a best paper award and a best student paper award.</p>



<p><strong>Important Notice</strong></p>



<p>To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper. The authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.</p>



<p>Simultaneous submission of results to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed. Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to WINE 2021, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline of WINE 2021, will not be considered. Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in WINE 2021. Papers that are accepted and appear as a one-page abstract can be subsequently submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other conference that has a published proceeding.</p>

The figure below uses the upper halfplane model to show two quadrants (dark yellow), their convex hull (light yellow, from which the lines cannot escape), and a circle of radius \(\ln(1+\sqrt2)\) centered at the crossing, separating the quadrants.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>(Thanks to Timothy Chow for inspiring this post.)</p><p>My survey on Hilbert's Tenth Problem(see  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07220">here</a>) is about variants of the problem. One of them is as follows: </p><p>For which degrees d and number-of-vars n, is Hilbert's tenth problem decidable? undecidable? unknown? </p><p> I wondered why there was not a website with this information. More generally, the problem didn't seem to be getting much attention. (My survey does report on the attention it has gotten.) </p><p>I got several emails telling me it was the wrong question. I didn't quite know what they meant until Timothy Chow emailed me the following eloquent explanation:</p><p>-----------------------------------</p><p><i>One reason there isn't already a website of the type you envision is that from a number-theoretic (or decidability) point of view, parameterization by  degree and number of variables is not as natural as it might seem at first glance. The most fruitful lines of research have been geometric, and so geometric concepts such as smoothness, dimension, and genus are more natural than, say, degree. A nice survey by a number theorist is the book Rational Points on Varieties by Bjorn Poonen. Much of it is highly technical; however, reading the preface is very enlightening. Roughly speaking, the current state of the art is that there is really only one known way to prove that a system of Diophantine equations has no rational solution.</i></p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>AGAINST THE NUMBER THEORISTS VIEWPOINT:</p><p>1) ALICE: Why are you looking for your keys under the lamppost instead of where you dropped them?</p><p>   BOB: The light is better here.</p><p>2) I can imagine the following conversation:</p><p>BILL: I want to know about what happens with degree 3, and number of variables 3.</p><p>MATHPERSON: That's the wrong question you moron. The real question is what happens for fixed length of cohomology subchains.</p><p>BILL: Why is that more natural?</p><p>MATHPERSON: Because that is what we can solve. And besides, I've had 10 papers on it.</p><p><br /></p><p>FOR THE NUMBER THEORISTS VIEWPOINT</p><p>1) They are working on really hard problems so it is natural to gravitate towards those that can be solved.</p><p>2) I suspect that the math that comes out of studying classes of equations based on smoothness, dimension, genus is more interesting than what comes out of degree and number of vars. Or at least it has been so far. </p><p>META QUESTION</p><p>Who gets to decide what problems are natural?</p><p>People outside the field (me in this case) are asking the kind of questions that a layperson would ask and there is some merit to that.</p><p>People inside the field KNOW STUFF and hence their opinion of what's interesting to study has some merit. But they can also mistake `I cannot solve X' for `X is not interesting'</p><div><br /></div></div>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyclic_coloring">acyclic colouring</a> of a graph is a colouring of its vertices so that the subgraph spanned on union of every two colour classes is acyclic (a forest). Grunbaum conjectured in 1973 that </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong><span style="color: #a30042;" class="has-inline-color">Every planar graph has acyclic colouring with five colours.</span> </strong></p>



<p>This was proved by Borodin in 1976.</p>



<p>Borodin made the following stronger conjecture. Recall that a graph is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" />-degenerate if every  subgraph has a vertex of degree at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" />. </p>

<p>As part of my Ph.D. qualifying exam, I gave a survey talk on some of the recent progress in practical multi-party computation (MPC). After the talk, Omer Reingold asked me why so much progress on MPC happened in the last decade or so, given that the main theoretical groundwork for multiparty computation was laid out in the 1980s.  Omer’s question got me interested, so I looked at some MPC papers from over the years and talked to a few people who have been working on MPC for some time now. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned about the history of the progress of MPC, a few answers to Omer’s question, and potentially a few takeaways on progress in science more broadly.</p>



<p>To give a bit of background, MPC is one of the most fundamental problems in cryptography. In particular, MPC protocols allow a set of parties, each of which holds its private input, to compute a joint function over their inputs, in a way that protects the confidentiality and integrity of the computation from an adversary that controls a subset of the parties and the communication channels. Defining this precisely requires a lot of care, yet for now, you can think of an MPC protocol as being secure, if the adversary can only cause as much damage as it can in an “ideal world” in which the computation is performed with the aid of a trusted incorruptible party. Intuitively, in such an ideal world, the adversary cannot do much more than choose its inputs, modify its output, or choose not to participate in the computation at all. </p>



<p>In the 1980s, a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4568207">sequence</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/28395.28420">of</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62213">works</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62214">initiated</a> the study of multiparty computation and established very powerful and general results, showing the feasibility of constructing protocols for securely computing any multi-party functionality in a variety of settings. Those results were mostly theoretical. In contrast, the last 15 years saw a growing interest in MPC from a more practical perspective. To put this rising interest in context, consider the following two graphs (data for the graphs is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzfKDRqv6C9hSeD9TyosvCl9fknN2V3Ja4tQjy54y0A/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="620" alt="" src="https://theorydish.files.wordpress.com/2021/05/comptime.png?w=620" class="wp-image-2245" height="372" /></figure></div>



<p>This graph shows the time of a two-party secure computation of the AES block cipher over the years. That is the time it takes to evaluate AES(k,x), where one party holds a 128-bit key k to the block cipher, the other party holds a 256-bit data block x, and the output is 256-bit long. The measurements are from the original papers. There are different variants of this “benchmark”, in terms of the number of parties (2PC/MPC), the number of corrupted parties (honest/dishonest majority), precise security model (semi-honest/fully malicious), hardware, network (LAN/WAN), and cost model (single/batch execution), but, for concreteness, the graph only includes results in the batch-evaluation setting in the fully malicious two-party setting. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img width="624" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lfa7-L5D3d5U8ZCHbAmUoqRH-RVaUmpFfSiFhBl7yF38ieoUmdo-LL0xH-gzXEaPauRXkCUmOYWDovfJvE792a0ikVxojM6g4P7EFD-mg4A2XbvzJWAslBug8UE6W4CnRhtIt4el" height="375" /></p>



<p>The second graph shows the number of papers on two-party computation, over the years. This is not a very well-defined characterization, but for simplicity, I looked at all the papers referenced from the relevant chapters in the <a href="https://securecomputation.org/">book on MPC</a> by Evans, Kolesnikov, and Rosulek. Admittedly, these are not all the papers in the area, there might be valuable indirect contributions that are missing, and, more importantly, the number of papers is a bit of a superficial metric. Yet, even with these caveats, I think this is helpful to get a general picture. On top of the flurry of academic research, MPC has also been thriving in the industry, with companies like <a href="https://www.curv.co/">Curv</a>, <a href="https://partisia.com/">Partisia</a>, <a href="https://sharemind.cyber.ee/">Sharemind</a>, <a href="https://www.unboundsecurity.com/">Unbound</a>, and others building MPC-based products and services.</p>



<p>The first graph shows quite impressive progress. In less than a decade, the time to securely compute AES in the two-party setting decreased by more than 60,000x, from more than 10 minutes to less than 10 milliseconds. (For reference, in the same period, CPU speeds increased <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-975+%40+3.33GHz&amp;id=841">roughly</a> <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-7740X+%40+4.30GHz&amp;id=3041">twofold</a>, and typical local-area network speeds increased from 1GB/S to 10GB/S.) The second graph illustrates the increase in the volume of research, which has enabled this progress. This includes advances such as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/100216.100287">various</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336992.337028">increasingly</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_40">efficient</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-46803-6_8">garbling</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3134053">techniques</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11745853_30">more</a> <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.2627&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">efficient</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72540-4_4">cut</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_22">and</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19571-6_20">choose</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40084-1_3">techniques</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00457-5_22">for</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516698">malicious security</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_11">protocols</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_38">based on</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_40">information-theoretic</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978357">message-authentication</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78372-7_6">codes</a>, <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf">homomorphic</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090262">encryption</a>, and many others. (See the EKR book for an overview of these techniques and more references.) The second graph also clearly shows the inflection point that happened about 15 years ago. This inflection point illustrates the premise of the question that has triggered this blog post.</p>



<p>I use the term inflection point, since progress in MPC never really stopped between the late 80s and the mid-2000s, and there was a lot of research in the interim period. For example, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/187.pdf">oblivious</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008908.1008920">transfer</a>–one of the fundamental primitives used <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3812.3818">to</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-47721-7_17.pdf">build</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62215">MPC</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44750-4_9">received</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/237814.237996">a</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00208002">lot</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0054139">of</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/301250.301312">attention</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44987-6_8">and</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/365411.365502">saw</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_9">significant</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-40061-5_27">progress</a>.

Other works developed special-purpose secure computation protocols for concrete applications such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/502223">secure auctions</a> and  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/293347.293350">private information retrieval</a>. Many of the techniques and ideas in these works were instrumental for the more recent progress.</p>



<p>Having said that, there still seems to have been a dip in the attention devoted to MPC for a certain period. One explanation that I’ve found interesting is that the powerful feasibility results from the early days made the problem seem “solved” from a theoretical point of view. As a result, interest in MPC within the theory community decreased. It took time before the interest ramped up again, this time more within the more-practically oriented crypto community. (Interestingly, since then, MPC found renewed interest in the theoretical cryptography community as well.)</p>



<p>One work that, to me, is a key point in the transition of MPC from theory to practice is the 2004 <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/13th-usenix-security-symposium/fairplay%E2%80%94-secure-two-party-computation-system">Fairplay paper</a>. This was the first full-fledged system that implemented generic secure function evaluation. I believe that, together with other early implementations of MPC-based systems (such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03549-4_20">the system</a> developed for the Danish sugar-beet auction and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_13">Sharemind system</a>), it played a pivotal role in accelerating practical research. I view it as a lesson on the value of “first systems”: they help to identify bottlenecks and discover new concerns, which are hard to predict without building an actual system. Moreover, such systems put “theory problems” on the radar of practitioners and demonstrate which ideas are closer to being practical.  In some sense, a system is an evidence that “the constants in the big-O have been worked out…and they are not astronomical.” Furthermore, when code is made public, follow-up works can build upon an initial system and improve on it more rapidly. A first system can mark the transition of an idea from pure theory to practice. It’s still fair to ask what determines the timing of the appearance of such a first system. One answer is that it often takes the right type of collaboration of researchers from different research communities, as seems to have been the case with “Fairplay”. </p>



<p>I think that external factors also played a role in the timing of events. Specifically, the growth of the Internet and the demand for security on the Internet stimulated a lot of interest and progress in applied cryptography. The late 1990s saw large-scale adoption of public-key cryptography with the successful development and deployment of SSL. More complex Internet applications began to appear later, including those that are inherently security-sensitive, like e-commerce. These applications stimulated interest in more advanced cryptographic tools, MPC being one of them. Indeed, MPC papers from that period discuss new Internet-driven applications as part of their motivation. </p>



<p>A final factor that I want to mention ties back to the first graph above. The fact that many works demonstrate their performance by measuring AES evaluation is, to me, an example of the value of standardized benchmarks. Such benchmarks help to evaluate new techniques and ideas within a certain area and can help progress on a particular dimension, partly because of the competitive element they add. As with any measurement, there is a risk of overfitting to the benchmark, rather than focusing on the true goal, but I think they are very helpful overall.</p>



<p>I am sure there are other valuable lessons to be learned from this case study. Moreover, I am quite certain that folks with more experience in the area have a much better perspective on the history of these developments than I do. I will be very happy to hear other perspectives!</p>

<p>
are researchers in the area of voting security. Some have worked in this area for decades, others for years, and some are new to the area. But they all signed a letter about election security—right after the last presidential election. The body of <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=118718">the letter</a> is also below.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might look into the main paradox surrounding voting security.<br />
<span id="more-18791"></span></p>
<p>
Peter G. Neumann and Rebecca Mercuri just published a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252836-the-risks-of-election-believability-or-lack-thereof/fulltext">paper</a> in the CACM on voting security. It is titled <i>The Risks of Election Believability (or Lack Thereof)</i>. </p>
<p>They say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Trustworthiness in elections is inherently a total-system problem <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" /> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
So let’s look at election security.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Paradox </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
<i>The people who cast the votes don’t decide an election, the people who count the votes do—Joseph Stalin</i></p>
<p>
I am reluctant in citing Stalin. But I believe that he hit the mark. The key in any election, in the US or elsewhere, is how and by whom the votes are counted.  </p>
<p>
The issue with the letter, with the recent paper, and more is that the researchers seem to be caught in the middle between two points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
There is no evidence of voter fraud in the last presidential election. None. Zero. <p></p>
</li><li>
There is no proof of voting security in the last presidential election. None. Zero.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is the problem. We would like to believe that voting is fair and secure. We would like to believe that our election—especially for president—is fair and correct. But we really have no proof that this is true. We are left with desire to make elections safer, but take the position that there is no issue with them. </p>
<p>
Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Letter </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is the letter. I think they miss saying things as bluntly as Stalin does. But they do say essentially the same.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We are specialists in election security, having studied the security of voting machines, voting systems, and technology used for government elections for decades.</em></p><em>
<p>
We and other scientists have warned for many years that there are security weaknesses in voting systems and have advocated that election systems be better secured against malicious attack. As the National Academies recently concluded, “There is no realistic mechanism to fully secure vote casting and tabulation computer systems from cyber threats.” However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election.</p>
<p>
Anyone asserting that a US election was “rigged” is making an extraordinary claim, one that must be supported by persuasive and verifiable evidence. Merely citing the existence of technical flaws does not establish that an attack occurred, much less that it altered an election outcome. It is simply speculation.</p>
<p>
The presence of security weaknesses in election infrastructure does not by itself tell us that any election has actually been compromised. Technical, physical, and procedural safeguards complicate the task of maliciously exploiting election systems, as does monitoring of likely adversaries by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Altering an election outcome involves more than simply the existence of a technical vulnerability.</p>
<p>
We are aware of alarming assertions being made that the 2020 election was “rigged” by exploiting technical vulnerabilities. However, in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent. To our collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth that supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome in any state has been altered through technical compromise.</p>
</em><p><em>
That said, it is imperative that the US continue working to bolster the security of elections against sophisticated adversaries. At a minimum, all states should employ election security practices and mechanisms recommended by experts to increase assurance in election outcomes, such as post-election risk-limiting audits. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The letter is well written, but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" /> They say in the letter: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election. </em>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>About one year ago, I became aware of the course "Ethics and Accountability in Computer Science" designed and taught by <a href="https://riceacademy.rice.edu/junior-fellows/dr-rodrigo-ferreira" target="_blank">Rodrigo Ferreira</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/" target="_blank">Moshe Y. Vardi</a> at Rice University. The goals and high-level structure of the course, as well as its context, are described in an informative and thoughtful <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/papers/sigcse21.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by Moshe and Rodrigo that appears in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3408877" target="_blank">Proceedings of the  52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE ’21)</a>, which I strongly recommend. You can also read a <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/tej/content/tej_2021_0999_3_31_87" target="_blank">journal paper</a> reporting on one of their course assignments, which was designed to make students focus on practising <a href="https://medium.com/@the_jennitaur/how-to-do-nothing-57e100f59bbb" target="_blank">"deep attention"</a> in the sense of artist and academic <a href="https://www.jennyodell.com/" target="_blank">Jenny Odell</a>.</p><p>I was smitten by the underlying tenet for their course, namely that "social justice is  the single  most important issue  confronting computer science  students today." That tenet is also very much in line with a reflection on the impact that digital technology has on social justice that the <a href="https://www.gssi.it/institute/organization" target="_blank">Scientific Advisory Board of the Gran Sasso Science Institute</a> asked the Computer Science group at that institute to undertake. Therefore, after having invited Rodrigo to deliver a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ficetcs.ru.is%2Fwebinars%2Fdeep_ethics.mp4&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9ux4zX7PThxWzwoNa_yyZNa-ILA" target="_blank">webinar on the course</a> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi/seminars-and-events/joint-ice-tcs-csgssi-virtual-seminar" target="_blank">ICE-TCS+GSSI webinar series</a>, I decided that, as an experiment, I would offer a version of the Rice University course to master students in computer science, language technology and software engineering at Reykjavik University during our spring semester 2021. </p><p>Mine was a foolhardy decision for a variety of reasons. However, I have always believed that computer scientists should strive to be the 21st century Renaissance men and women, and bridge the gap between C. P. Snow's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" target="_blank">"two cultures"</a>. Indeed, to quote <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/~eal/" target="_blank">Edward A. Lee</a> freely, to my mind technologists ought to be amongst the greatest humanists of our age. Despite my other commitments, offering a version of the Ferreira-Vardi course at Reykjavik University felt like the right thing to do at this time. </p><p>I taught the course over twelve weeks to a varied group of eight students, in cooperation with <a href="http://claudiopedica.com/" target="_blank">Claudio Pedica</a>. Thanks to the constant support I received from Rodrigo Ferreira, I lived to tell the tale and I hope that I managed to do some justice to the truly excellent course that Moshe and Rodrigo put together. Having a dream team of students with a variety of cultural backgrounds made the course extremely interesting and a learning experience for me. I had to refresh my memory of the philosophy I studied at high school in Italy in a previous life, learn some modern moral philosophy I had not met at school (such as the work by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/" target="_blank">Elisabeth Anscombe</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philippa-foot/" target="_blank">Philippa Foot</a>, amongst others), read a substantial amount of new material (some of it fresh off the press as the course was unfolding) and broaden my horizons. I could not have asked for a better intellectual experience and the students in the course, from Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland and the Netherlands taught me well, kept me on my toes and stimulated me to keep reading material related to ethics even now that the course is over. <br /></p><p>Teaching the course reinforced my belief that a course on ethics and on the impact that our field has on social justice should be required for all students in computer science. If you plan to run such a course, I strongly recommend that you consider the Ferreira-Vardi course as a blueprint. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>As we come out of a pandemic with online teaching and research collaborations, how much do we actually need the university?</p><p>Theoretical research in computer science, math and elsewhere it hardly slowed down with everyone hunkered down at home, and when it did it was more because of supervising kids with their on-line learning than being away from the university. Collaborating with those around the world was basically the same as collaborating with your colleagues on campus.</p><p>Many courses, especially the larger ones, worked about as well on-line as they do in person.</p><p>The pandemic is accelerating changes already in place. Before say 1960, the fastest travel for the masses was on train and boats and fast communication limited to expensive phone calls. You needed strong colleagues, a strong library and a strong support staff to be a successful academic. Traveling to meet colleagues and attend conferences was a luxury that few could do often.</p><p>The 60's gave us air travel though it wasn't until the 90's that we could readily send academic papers electronically. It's really only recently that we have the infrastructure to allow high-quality teaching and research collaboration online.</p><p>Suppose universities now just disappeared. Professors would be free agents, supported by grants and tuition from students taking their on-line courses and consulting. Students would pick and choose courses from the best instructors, their "transcript" being recorded on a blockchain-like database. PhD students would be more of an apprenticeship, a low salary in exchange for personalized mentoring from a professor. </p><p>For the experimental sciences, there would be a set of national labs that professors could join.</p><p>Startups would create apps to enable all these things, professors would just become yet another piece of the gig economy. Superstar academics can pull in large salaries, the rest would struggle to make a decent wage--not that different from actors and musicians. </p><p>Don't worry, universities aren't going anywhere soon. Or are they?</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Yesterday, I had fun doing an open-ended Q&amp;A at the <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">Astral Codex Ten</a> weekly online meetup.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEYUt1tJlck">See here</a> for the YouTube video.  The questions were mainly about quantum computing, but ranged over various other topics as well, including education policy, the Great Stagnation, and what my biggest disagreements with Scott Alexander are.</p>



<p>In other news, last week I gave my talk about quantum supremacy at the (virtual, of course) <a href="https://quantumscienceseminar.com/videos/">Quantum Science Seminar</a>, organized by Sebastian Blatt and others.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeF7T9Bc1B0">See here</a> for the YouTube video.  Since I (alas) needed to leave after an hour sharp, the organizers asked if they could send me additional questions in writing and have me answer them.  I said sure, as long as I could also post the Q&amp;A on this blog!  So without further ado…</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> As you said, in computer science it’s difficult to prove that things are hard. From a computer science perspective, to what extent is “quantum supremacy” something absolute, and to what extent is it a shifting bar that depends on how good our classical hardware and algorithms are?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> It’s kind of like the question “can computers beat the best humans at chess?” The latter question also involves a non-absolute shifting bar – maybe humans are getting better! Or maybe they simply haven’t figured out how to beat the computers yet! So how can we say “computer supremacy” has been decisively achieved? Nevertheless, one can clearly see a phase transition, with Deep Blue in 1996-1997, where the burden of proof shifted massively from one side to the other, and has stayed there ever since. Even if humans are getting better, the computers have also gotten better, and at such an insane rate that humans seem to have no chance of ever again catching up.</p>



<p>From a theoretical standpoint, that’s exactly what we might expect to happen with quantum supremacy experiments – simply because they involve tasks that have polynomial scaling for quantum computers, but (as far as we know) exponential scaling for classical computers, where each additional qubit roughly doubles the classical resources required. In analyzing concrete quantum supremacy experiments, I’d say that the goal is not to pin down the exact factor by which they’re beating this or that classical simulation (the answers will change rapidly anyway, and depend on all sorts of low-level details), but simply to figure out whether or not we’ve entered that phase transition.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you generally think about improvements in tensor network methods as a challenge to quantum supremacy and the recent simulation of the supremacy result in Beijing?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5371">blogged about this here</a>. It was a clever paper, which showed that if you focus narrowly on spoofing the linear cross-entropy benchmark used by Google, then there’s a classical algorithm to do that much faster than had been previously pointed out, by generating many samples that all share most of their bits in common (e.g., that all agree on the first 30 of the 53 bits). But many people remain unaware that, if you just changed the benchmark – for example, if you insisted that the returned samples not only pass the linear cross-entropy benchmark, but also be sufficiently different – then this classical spoofing strategy wouldn’t work and we’d be back to the previous status quo.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you need a random circuit to test the device, and also why is this more interesting/useful than doing something very specific many times to test the device?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> The reasons to use random quantum circuits are simply that<br />(1) they generate complicated entangled states on all the qubits nearly as rapidly as it’s possible to do so – indeed, we now have theoretical results that give a detailed understanding of this process, and<br />(2) random circuits seem to have about as little “usable structure” (which a classical simulation might exploit) as it’s possible to have.<br />Eventually, of course, we’d like to run actually useful circuits (say, those that arise in Shor’s factoring algorithm), which will typically have regular patterns and be extremely far from random! But then more qubits will be needed to get an advantage over classical computers. It’s not terribly surprising for the <em>first</em> advantage over classical to be via random quantum circuits, which in some sense “maximally exploit” the hardware resources available.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Have you heard of/what do you think about the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21119-1">recent NP-verification experiment</a> using a quantum optical setup from Paris?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> That experiment was actually based on a protocol that Beigi, Fefferman, Drucker, Shor, and I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0802">proposed back in 2008</a>. It’s crucial for people to understand that there’s no claimed speedup here for <em>solving</em> any NP-complete problem. We’re talking about a more arcane task: namely, proving to someone that an NP-complete problem has a solution by sending them a small number of qubits. Even there, the protocol depends on the ability to send two quantum states that are guaranteed <em>not</em> to be entangled with each other; also, the communication savings is “only” polynomial rather than exponential (in our original protocol, roughly √n qubits where n classical bits would have been needed). Nevertheless, it’s always fun to see a real experiment implementing some version of something that you worked out on paper, even if you already knew it would work!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> If the difficulty for classical simulation is related to the Hilbert space dimension, has it been formally proven that an ideal analog classical computer cannot outperform a quantum computer?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> This is not a question of “formal proof” but of physics. In my view, we already know deep reasons why, in our universe, analog classical computers are unlikely to be able to do anything that can’t be efficiently simulated using a standard digital computer. (In other words, why analog classical computers don’t violate the “Extended Church-Turing Thesis.”) Those reasons have to do with nonlinear dynamics chaotically amplifying even the tiniest errors in an analog device. Or, if you really want to push this discussion to the bitter end, they have to do with the breakdown in our picture of a smooth spacetime that’s expected to occur at the Planck scale, of ~10<sup>-33</sup> centimeters and ~10<sup>-43</sup> seconds, for reasons of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. Crucially, neither of these issues apply to quantum computation. The former doesn’t apply because of quantum error correction  and fault-tolerance, which have the effect of “discretizing” continuous errors; while the latter doesn’t apply because as far as anyone knows today, quantum mechanics (unlike theories that assume a smooth spacetime) is exactly true.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> [In the comparison between quantum and classical computation], what do we mean by “classical resources” here? Do we mean something parochial like “resources obeying non-quantum laws that are available to us humans on Earth?” Or is any classical resource fair game, no matter its size and classical equations of motion? In that case, doesn’t demonstrating quantum supremacy require demonstrating that the quantum computer exceeds the capabilities of, say, a classical computer the size of the solar system that exploits some CTC (closed timelike curve)?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> If CTCs were possible, that would be a revolution in physics even greater than quantum mechanics! Leaving CTCs aside, though, cosmology and quantum gravity seem to impose a limit of roughly 10<sup>122</sup> on the number of bits (and the number of operations on the bits) that any computer that fit inside the observable universe could possibly have. And if you envision that cosmological computer as a classical one, then it shouldn’t take impossibly long for us to build quantum computers that can outperform it on some tasks: indeed, a device with ~400 qubits should already be enough! But of course we’re not there yet: with 50-60 qubits, QCs right now are “merely” challenging the largest classical computers currently available on earth (again, on contrived sampling tasks), rather than the largest that could fit in the observable universe.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is a quantum state (superposition or entangled state) inherently more fragile than a classical state?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> Because when information from the state (say, whether a qubit is 0 or 1, or which path a photon takes through a beamsplitter network) “leaks out” into the environment, the information effectively becomes entangled with the environment, which damages the state in a measurable way.  Indeed, it now appears to an observer as a mixed state rather than a pure state, so that interference between the different components can no longer happen. This is a fundamental, justly-famous feature of quantum information that’s not shared by classical information.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Given that we have noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, what do you see as the fundamental role of noise in the discussion on quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. Is it simply a question of less noise is better, or are there things that cannot be done if there is noise?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> There will always be <em>some</em> noise. The big question, about any given platform, is whether the noise is low enough that you can start usefully error-correcting it away, or whether the noise is so high that there’s no point (i.e., whether you’re above or below the “fault-tolerance threshold”).  Until you start doing error-correction, most experts believe there’s a severe limit to how far you can scale: probably to quantum computations involving a few hundred qubits at most. Whereas once you have error-correction, at least in principle the sky’s the limit.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You used the Wright brothers as an example where an airplane that was not practically useful itself pioneered the path to useful flight. In what sense to the sampling experiments of Google and USTC also pioneer that path for what we need for the future of quantum computing, or to what extent do you see them as niche examples of quantum supremacy?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> I think the majority of what Google did, in integrating 53 superconducting qubits, making them programmable, etc. – and especially in characterizing the noise in a system at that scale – will be directly useful going forward. Indeed, that’s a large part of why they did it!  Likewise, a lot of what USTC did, in integrating hundreds of beamsplitters, photon sources, and photodetectors, could be directly relevant to building a universal optical quantum computer. On the other hand, it’s true that both groups took shortcuts with the immediate goal of quantum supremacy in mind. As an example, Google’s chip uses a particular 2-qubit gate that was chosen, not because it shows up naturally in any application, but simply because it’s extra-hard to simulate using tensor network contraction algorithms, so it let them get to quantum supremacy faster than if they’d used a more conventional 2-qubit gate like the CNOT.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> To what extent does the measured circuit fidelity of 0.2% in the Google experiment limit the usability of this system for other computations?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> Oh, we don’t know of anything particularly useful to do with Google’s Sycamore chip – that is, anything that you couldn’t do much more easily without it – other than<br />(1) quantum supremacy demonstrations,<br />(2) <em>possibly</em> the generation of cryptographically certified random bits, and<br />(3) of course, calibration experiments that tell you about the behavior of integrated superconducting qubits and thereby help you iterate to the next device.<br />But things are developing rapidly – the best circuit fidelity that was achievable in 2019 is not necessarily the best now, or the best that will be achieved in another year or two.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (May 25):</span></strong> <strong>Please, no new questions</strong>; just discussion of the existing questions and answers!

Ayanna Howard is this year’s winner of the ACM Athena Lecturer <a href="https://awards.acm.org/athena">Award</a>. She works in robotics and is <a href="https://engineering.osu.edu/about/office-dean/about-dean-ayanna-howard">Dean</a> of Engineering at Ohio State. She was previously Chair of the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I congratulate her and also recognize past winners of the award.<br />
<span id="more-18770"></span></p>
<p>
The award is not for lecturing. Here is the description:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Initiated in 2006, the ACM Athena Lecturer Award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science. The award carries a cash prize of $25,000, with financial support provided by Two Sigma. The Athena Lecturer gives an invited talk at a major ACM conference of her choice. </em>

<p>
</p><h2> Howard’s Research </h2><p></p>
<p>
Ayanna Howard’s research spans three interconnected areas of robotics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Outer Space Robotics:</b> She did early work for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Here is a 2002 <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/ayanna_howard.html">article</a> that leads with her work on the “Safe Navigation Rover.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Inner Space Robotics:</b> This work involves interaction and assistive technologies. It includes her co-founding the company <a href="http://zyrobotics.com/about/">Zyrobotics</a>, which creates mobile therapy and educational technology tools for children. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Inner Mindspace Robotics:</b> On what grounds can we <em>trust</em> robots? How can they be programmed to avoid biases in their interactions with human beings? Can the algorithms they use be certified for <em>fairness?</em> (We had some recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/10/making-algorithms-fair/">thoughts</a> of our own on the last subject.)

There are technical connections that flow from a whole-situation/whole-person approach. Her NASA landing and navigation systems were not designed simply to solve a computer-vision and calculus problem of finding the flattest terrain. Instead, the design expressly maps visual and sensor readings into a knowledge and logic-based system of human reasoning. Then the system either judges or makes recommendations to human controllers. This kind of approach naturally flows into assessing the robotic judgments for blind spots and bias. Most in particular, she tries to combat a human tendency of uncritical acceptance of personal assistants. She wants to facilitate humans to challenge the robots and have the robots modulate their reasoning and behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>
She was inspired as a child by the TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bionic_Woman">The Bionic Woman</a>. Adding “-nic” after “bio” took what could have been influence to go into medicine into an avenue that channeled her childhood love of mathematics.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> A Puzzle </h2><p></p>
<p>
I designed a word-search puzzle by feeding terms from the award to a web app for creating them. We wondered if it was silly to include it. But maybe the puzzle is not so silly—besides that it was created by a ‘bot—if you think in these terms:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How might a robot get the most out of solving it? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here is the grid—see if you can find the words in it. The key is at the end.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/24/acm-athena-lecturer-award/pu/" rel="attachment wp-att-18774"><img width="400" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pu.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-18774" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>
From a human standpoint, three minutes is award level. But for a robot:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Of course, a robot could solve the puzzle in three microseconds by brute-force string matching along every row, column, and diagonal. But there is no challenge in that—it is not what we think of as human <em>reading</em>. <p></p>
</li><li>
To be human fun, the puzzle should be fairly dense and have a “wordscape” where parallel rows, columns, and diagonals are used. Once we find one word, we can often find neighbors more quickly, and that feels rewarding.
</li></ul>
<p>
That’s what we’re asking: is there a way to teach robots to solve these puzzles in more human ways? OK, it’s too simple. But we like to put a peg down on a simple example, then run a line into the heart of the work, and ask: at what point does it cross the threshold of being nontrivial?</p>

Given polynomials $f,g,h\,\in \mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $f=g/h$, where both $g$ and $h$ are computable by arithmetic circuits of size $s$, we show that $f$ can be computed by a circuit of size  $\poly(s,\deg(h))$.  This solves a special case of division elimination for high-degree circuits (Kaltofen'87 \&amp; WACT'16). The result is an exponential improvement over Strassen's classic result (Strassen'73) when $\deg(h)$ is $\poly(s)$ and $\deg(f)$ is $\exp(s)$, since the latter gives an upper bound of $\poly(s, \deg(f))$.

Further, we show that any univariate polynomial family $(f_d)_d$, defined by the initial segment of the power series expansion of rational function $g_d(x)/h_d(x)$ up to degree $d$ (i.e.~$f_d = g_d/h_d \bmod x^{d+1}$), where circuit size of $g$ is $s_d$ and degree of $g_d$ is at most $d$, can be computed by a circuit of size $\poly(s_d,\deg(h_d),\log d)$.
We also show a hardness result when the degrees of the rational functions are high (i.e.~$\Omega (d)$), assuming hardness of the integer factorization problem.</div>

We show that given a quantum measurement, for an overwhelming majority of pure states, no meaningful information is produced. This is independent of the number of outcomes of the quantum measurement. Due to conservation inequalities, such random noise cannot be processed into coherent data.</div>

<p>Holy crap.</p>



<p>In case you’re wondering how I spent such a milestone of a day: well, I spent hours of it at an important virtual grant review meeting with the Department of Defense.  Alas, when it came time for my own big presentation at that meeting—about what my students and I had done over the past five years to lay the theoretical foundations for the recent achievement of quantum computational supremacy—I’d uploaded the completely wrong PowerPoint file (it was something.pptx rather than something.ppt, where they <em>weren’t</em> two versions of the same presentation).  Sorting this out took about 10 minutes, destroyed my momentum, and wasted everyone’s time.  I partly blame the Microsoft Teams platform, whose limitations as conferencing software compared to Zoom necessitated emailing my presentation in the first place.  But of course, part of the blame rests with me.</p>



<p>I had to explain apologetically to the US Department of Defense that I’m no good with tech stuff—being a mere computer science PhD.  And unlike many of my colleagues (who I envy), back in my youth—for at age 40 I’m no longer young—I never had enough time to become <em>both</em> the kind of person who might earn a big grant to do quantum computing theory, <em>and</em> the kind of person who’d be minimally competent at the logistics of a review meeting for such a grant.</p>



<p></p><hr /><p></p>



<p>Forty years.  Seven-eighths of those years, aware of the finiteness of the speed of light and of its value.  Four-fifths of them, aware of the grislier details of the Holocaust.  Three-quarters of them, aware of what it means to write code.  Two-thirds of them, aware of polynomial versus exponential time.  More than half of them trying to understand the capabilities and limitations of quantum computers as my day job.  And then, rounding the corner, more than a third of the years writing this blog, a third of them being a professor, a quarter of them married, a fifth of them raising kids, a thirtieth of them in the midst of a global pandemic.</p>



<p>I didn’t even come <em>close </em>to achieving everything I hoped I would in my thirties.  At least a half-dozen major papers, ones I expected would’ve been finished years ago (on the mixing of coffee and cream, on complexity and firewalls and AdS/CFT, on certified random numbers from sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments, on the implications of the Raz-Tal oracle separation, …), still need to be revised or even written.  Other projects (e.g., the graphic novel about teaching math to Lily) were excitedly announced and then barely even started.  I never wrote most of my promised blog post about the continuum hypothesis, <em>or</em> the one about Stephen Wolfram’s recrudescent claims of a unified theory of physics.  And covid, which determined the world’s working conditions while we were running out the clock, turned out <em>not</em> to be a hyper-productive time for me.  That’s how you know I’m not Newton (well, it’s the not the only way you know).</p>



<p>Anyway, during the runup to it, one’s 40th birthday feels like a temporal singularity, where you have to compress more and more of what you’d hoped to achieve before age 40 as you get closer and closer to it, because what the hell is there on the other side? <em> The</em>y<em>‘re</em> over-40 and hence “old”; <em>you’re</em> under-40 and hence still “young.”</p>



<p>OK, but here I am on the other side right now, <em>the “old” side</em>, and I’m still here, still thinking and writing and feeling fairly continuous with my pre-singularity embodiment!  And so far, in 16 hours on this side, the most senile thing I’ve done has been to email the wrong file attachment and thereby ruin an important funding presenta… you know what, let’s not even go there.</p>



<p>If you feel compelled to give me a 40<sup>th</sup> birthday present, then just make it a comment on this post, as short or long as you like, about what anything I said or did meant for you.  I’m a total softie for that stuff.</p></div>
