<div class="content">
We show that one-way functions exist if and only if there is some samplable distribution D such that it is hard to approximate the Kolmogorov complexity of a string sampled from D. Thus we characterize the existence of one-way functions by the average-case hardness of a natural \emph{uncomputable} problem on samplable distributions, extending a recent line of work by Liu and Pass (FOCS'20, STOC'21) and Ren and Santhanam (CCC'21).

    We also show that the average-case hardness of approximating Minimum Circuit Size on a locally samplable distribution (where the sampler runs in sub-linear time by using random access to its input) is equivalent to the existence of one-way functions. This is the first characterization of one-way functions by a natural average-case hardness assumption on the Minimum Circuit Size Problem. We present several other characterizations and connections between one-way functions and average-case hardness of meta-complexity problems (problems about complexity) on samplable distributions.

    We give various applications of these results to the foundations of cryptography and the theory of meta-complexity. We show that the average-case hardness of deciding k-SAT or Clique on any samplable distribution of high enough entropy implies the existence of one-way functions. Thus one-way functions follow from general assumptions on the average-case hardness of NP-complete problems. We observe that our assumptions are implied by standard cryptographic assumptions such as the Planted Clique hypothesis and the pseudorandomness of Goldreich's local functions.

    Our results imply a range of \emph{equivalences} between various meta-complexity problems, showing that the theory of meta-complexity is very \emph{robust} when considering average-case complexity. We use our results to unconditionally solve various meta-complexity problems in CZK (computational zero-knowledge) on average, and give implications of our results for the classic question of proving NP-hardness for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem.</div>

(LCS) of two strings of length $n$. While a simple quadratic algorithm has been
known for the problem for more than 40 years, no faster algorithm has been
found despite an extensive effort. The lack of progress on the problem has
recently been explained by Abboud, Backurs, and Vassilevska Williams [FOCS'15]
and Bringmann and K\"unnemann [FOCS'15] who proved that there is no
subquadratic algorithm unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
This has led the community to look for subquadratic approximation algorithms
for the problem.
</p>
<p>Yet, unlike the edit distance problem for which a constant-factor
approximation in almost-linear time is known, very little progress has been
made on LCS, making it a notoriously difficult problem also in the realm of
approximation. For the general setting, only a naive
$O(n^{\varepsilon/2})$-approximation algorithm with running time
$\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ has been known, for any constant $0 &lt;
\varepsilon \le 1$. Recently, a breakthrough result by Hajiaghayi, Seddighin,
Seddighin, and Sun [SODA'19] provided a linear-time algorithm that yields a
$O(n^{0.497956})$-approximation in expectation; improving upon the naive
$O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation for the first time.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we provide an algorithm that in time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$
computes an $\tilde{O}(n^{2\varepsilon/5})$-approximation with high
probability, for any $0 &lt; \varepsilon \le 1$. Our result (1) gives an
$\tilde{O}(n^{0.4})$-approximation in linear time, improving upon the bound of
Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Seddighin, and Sun, (2) provides an algorithm whose
approximation scales with any subquadratic running time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$,
improving upon the naive bound of $O(n^{\varepsilon/2})$ for any $\varepsilon$,
and (3) instead of only in expectation, succeeds with high probability.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Alexander Barvinok <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08119">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>By solving a positive semidefinite program, one can reduce a system of real
quadratic equations to a system of the type $q_i(x)=\alpha_i$, $i=1, \ldots,
m$, where $q_i: {\Bbb R}^n \longrightarrow {\Bbb R}$ are quadratic forms and
$\alpha_i=\operatorname{trace} q_i$. We prove a sufficient condition for the
latter system to have a solution $x \in {\Bbb R}^n$: assuming that the operator
norms of the $n \times n$ matrices $Q_i$ of $q_i$ do not exceed 1, the smallest
eigenvalue the $m \times m$ matrix with the $(i,j)$-th entry equal
$\operatorname{tr} (Q_i Q_j)$ is at least $\gamma n^{2/3} m^2 \ln n$ for an
absolute constant $\gamma &gt;0$. In particular, this happens when $n \gg m^6$ and
the forms $q_i$ are sufficiently generic. We prove a similar sufficient
condition for a homogeneous system of quadratic equations to have a non-trivial
solution.

structure and the functioning of living cells. The computation models obtained
in the field of membrane computing are usually called P systems. P systems have
been used to solve computationally hard problems efficiently on the assumption
that the execution of each rule is completed in exactly one time-unit (a global
clock is assumed for timing and synchronizing the execution of rules). However,
in biological reality, different biological processes take different times to
be completed, which can also be influenced by many environmental factors. In
this work, with this biological reality, we give a time-free solution to
independent set problemusing P systems with active membranes, which solve the
problem independent of the execution time of the involved rules.

order avoids (k+1)-rainbows, i.e., k+1 independent edges that pairwise form a
nested pair. The optimization goal is to determine the queue number of a graph,
i.e., the minimum value of k for which a k-queue layout is feasible. Recently,
Dujmovi\'c et al. [J. ACM, 67(4), 22:1-38, 2020] showed that the queue number
of planar graphs is at most 49, thus settling in the positive a long-standing
conjecture by Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg. To achieve this breakthrough
result, their approach involves three different techniques: (i) an algorithm to
obtain straight-line drawings of outerplanar graphs, in which the y-distance of
any two adjacent vertices is 1 or 2, (ii) an algorithm to obtain 5-queue
layouts of planar 3-trees, and (iii) a decomposition of a planar graph into
so-called tripods. In this work, we push further each of these techniques to
obtain the first non-trivial improvement on the upper bound from 49 to 42.

neural networks trained under least squares loss by gradient descent. Recent
works also report that NTK regression can outperform finitely-wide neural
networks trained on small-scale datasets. However, the computational complexity
of kernel methods has limited its use in large-scale learning tasks. To
accelerate learning with NTK, we design a near input-sparsity time
approximation algorithm for NTK, by sketching the polynomial expansions of
arc-cosine kernels: our sketch for the convolutional counterpart of NTK (CNTK)
can transform any image using a linear runtime in the number of pixels.
Furthermore, we prove a spectral approximation guarantee for the NTK matrix, by
combining random features (based on leverage score sampling) of the arc-cosine
kernels with a sketching algorithm. We benchmark our methods on various
large-scale regression and classification tasks and show that a linear
regressor trained on our CNTK features matches the accuracy of exact CNTK on
CIFAR-10 dataset while achieving 150x speedup.

solves the well-known heavy hitters identification problem. Consistent with

probability~$\beta$, the former achieves optimal worst-case estimation error
for every~$\beta$, while the latter is optimal when~$\beta$ is at least inverse
polynomial in~$n$, the number of users. In both algorithms, server running time
is~$\tilde{O}(n)$ while user running time is~$\tilde{O}(1)$. Our
frequency-oracle algorithm achieves lower estimation error than the prior works
of Bassily et al. (NeurIPS 2017). On the other hand, our heavy hitters
identification method is as easily implementable as as TreeHist (Bassily et

modern optimization algorithms into mechanisms where inputs come from
self-interested agents. We focus on aggregating preferences from $n$ players in
a context without money. Special cases of this setting include voting,
allocation of items by lottery, and matching. Our key technical contribution is
a new meta-algorithm we call \apex (Adaptive Pricing Equalizing Externalities).
The framework is sufficiently general to be combined with any optimization
algorithm that is based on local search. We outline an agenda for studying the
algorithm's properties and its applications. As a special case of applying the
framework to the problem of one-sided assignment with lotteries, we obtain a
strengthening of the 1979 result by Hylland and Zeckhauser on allocation via a
competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI). The [HZ79] result posits
that there is a (fractional) allocation and a set of item prices such that the
allocation is a competitive equilibrium given prices. We further show that
there is always a reweighing of the players' utility values such that running
unit-demand VCG with reweighed utilities leads to a HZ-equilibrium prices.
Interestingly, not all HZ competitive equilibria come from VCG prices. As part
of our proof, we re-prove the [HZ79] result using only Brouwer's fixed point
theorem (and not the more general Kakutani's theorem). This may be of
independent interest.

sample from a specified distribution. The objects to be sampled are assumed to
be represented by a number of random variables. In contrast to classical
rejection sampling, in which all variables are resampled until a feasible
solution is found, partial rejection sampling aims at greater efficiency by
resampling only a subset of variables that `go wrong'. Partial rejection
sampling is closely related to Moser and Tardos' algorithmic version of the
Lov\'asz Local Lemma, but with the additional requirement that a specified
output distribution should be met. This article provides a largely
self-contained account of the basic form of the algorithm and its analysis.

Alan Perlis, the first Turing Award winner, summarized the whole issue of program correctness in his single quote.  Maybe there is nothing more to say about it.</p>
<p>
But this coming Thursday, if you want to hear more about it, you can tune in for a debate with Rich de Millo and myself.  It will be 7:00–8:30pm Eastern time.</p>
<p>
Harry Lewis of Harvard University will moderate.  It will be broadcast <a href="https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/2021/05/26/debate-that-changed-programming-living-history/">LIVE HERE</a>. It’s free.</p>

</p><h2> The Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Perlis and Rich DeMillo and I wrote the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> “Social Processes and Proofs of Theorems<br />
and Programs” in the middle of the second half of the last century—pushing towards fifty years ago. We were responding to the then-common view that programs should be proved correct—proved in the same manner that one proves theorems like: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1 (Euclid)</b> <em> There are an infinite number of prime numbers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>We begged to object: We felt that correctness of programs was fundamentally a different issue. This is what the debate is all about. </p>
<p>
The debate will give us all a chance to reflect now almost 50 years later when programs enrich and regulate so much more of our lives.  Perhaps the real winner in society goes according to the proverb: “the one who ends up with the most toys.”  In that case, Harry the moderator will win hands down:</p>

</p><p></p><h2> The Writing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Mary-Claire van Leunen is an expert on writing, especially for technical articles. See her famous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&amp;rh=p_27%3AMary-Claire+van+Leunen&amp;s=relevancerank&amp;text=Mary-Claire+van+Leunen&amp;ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1">book</a>.</p>
<p>
The article was heavily written by Rich with input from Alan and myself. The ideas are due to all of us. The actual details, the words, the punctuation owe more to Rich with strong input from Mary-Claire. </p>
<p>
Our paper is one of forty-six papers included in the <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future">book</a> <i>Ideas That Created the Future: Classic Papers of Computer Science</i>, which was edited by Harry for MIT Press (2020).  They are presented in chronological order beginning with Aristotle (~350 BCE).  The median year is 1962-63.  </p>

An Algebraic Circuit for a polynomial $P\in F[x_1,\ldots,x_N]$ is a computational model for constructing the polynomial $P$ using only additions and multiplications. It is a \emph{syntactic} model of computation, as opposed to the Boolean Circuit model, and hence lower bounds for this model are widely expected to be easier to prove than lower bounds for Boolean circuits. Despite this, we do not have superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of depth 3 (except over constant-sized finite fields) and depth 4 (over any field), while constant-depth Boolean circuit lower bounds have been known since the early 1980s.

In this paper, we prove the first superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of all constant depths over all fields of characteristic $0$ (or large). We also prove the first lower bounds against homogeneous algebraic circuits of constant depth over any field.

Our approach is surprisingly simple. We first prove superpolynomial lower bounds for constant-depth Set-Multilinear circuits. While strong lower bounds were already known against such circuits, most previous lower bounds were of the form $f(d)\cdot poly(N)$, where $d$ denotes the degree of the polynomial.  In analogy with Parameterized complexity, we call this an FPT lower bound. We extend a well-known technique of Nisan and Wigderson (FOCS 1995) to prove non-FPT lower bounds against constant-depth set-multilinear circuits computing the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$ (which computes a fixed entry of the product of $d$ $n\times n$ matrices). More precisely, we prove that  any set-multilinear circuit of depth $\Delta$ computing $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size at least $n^{d^{\exp(-O(\Delta))}}.$ This result holds over any field.

We then show how to convert any constant-depth algebraic circuit of size $s$ to a constant-depth set-multilinear circuit with a blow-up in size that is exponential in $d$ but only polynomial in $s$ over fields of characteristic $0$. (For depths greater than $3$, previous results of this form increased the depth of the resulting circuit to $\Omega(\log s)$.) This implies our constant-depth circuit lower bounds for $d$ that is a slow-growing function of $n$.

Finally, we observe that our superpolynomial lower bound for constant-depth circuits  implies the first deterministic sub-exponential time algorithm for solving the Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT) problem for all small depth circuits  using the known connection between algebraic hardness and randomness.</div>

<p>In recent years there has been increasing interest in using machine<br />learning to improve the performance of classical algorithms in<br />computer science, by fine-tuning their behavior to adapt to the<br />properties of the input distribution. This “data-driven” or<br />“learning-based” approach to algorithm design has the potential to<br />significantly improve the efficiency of some of the most widely used<br />algorithms. For example, it has been used to design better data<br />structures, online algorithms, streaming and sketching algorithms,<br />market mechanisms and algorithms for combinatorial optimization,<br />similarity search and inverse problems. This virtual workshop will<br />feature talks from experts at the forefront of this exciting area.</p>



<p>The workshop will take place virtually on <strong>July 13-14, 2021</strong>. <br />Registration is <strong>free but mandatory</strong>. Link to register: <a href="https://fodsi.us/ml4a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://fodsi.us/ml4a.html</a></p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Selection </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Typically many candidates are available, but only the most dramatic cases will be considered. Nominations should include a vita along with a brief statement of why the nominee should be considered. Why they are <b>un</b>-worthy to be made into the editor-in-chief? A vision statement is highly encouraged. The relevant law is found here:</p>

</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>All kidding aside. We thank Éva for her hard work keeping the JACM one of the top journals in the world. We can only hope that the next chief will be nearly as sucessful as she has been.</p></font></font></div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip-firing_game">Chip-firing games</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model">sandpile models</a>, are systems described by a graph, with markers of some kind such as coins on its vertices. The graph may possibly be directed, although in the simplest examples it is undirected, and it may be infinite. Each vertex may have arbitrarily many coins on it. But, if a vertex has at least as many coins as it has outgoing edges, we can “fire” the vertex, moving one coin to each neighbor. This repeats until no more such events are possible. Doing this on an infinite square grid with an initial state that piles many coins on a single vertex leads to pretty fractals; here’s a detail of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sandpile_on_infinite_grid,_3e7_grains.png">the result of starting with 30 million coins</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="80%" alt="Detail of abelian sandpile model on square grid with 3x10^7 starting coins, extracted from CC-BY-SA image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sandpile_on_infinite_grid,_3e7_grains.png by colt_browning" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/sandpile-30M-detail.png" /></p>

<p>However, we’ll be looking at this sort of system on one-dimensional infinite graphs, where their behavior is not quite as complicated.</p>

<p>Chip-firing, on any graph and any placement of coins for which it terminates, forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>.<sup id="fnref:bls"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:bls" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:k"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:k" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> A vertex \(v\) can fire for the \(i\)th time, as long as it has already fired \(i-1\) times and a total of \(i\cdot\deg(v)\) coins have reached it. Once these conditions are met, they remain true until \(v\) fires. This idea, that once the item \((v,i)\) becomes available to be added to the sequence of firings it remains available until it is added, is the defining principle of an antimatroid. From it one can prove that, if any firing sequence terminates in a stable configuration, then all sequences terminate, they all fire the same vertices the same numbers of times, and they all end in the same stable configuration.</p>

<h1 id="binary-carrying-as-chip-firing">Binary carrying as chip-firing</h1>

<p>A binary representation of a number \(x\) is just a set of distinct powers of two, summing to \(x\). If you add two binary numbers \(x\) and \(y\), you can combine their sets into a single multiset; carrying can be thought of as a systematic method of getting rid of the duplicate powers of two in this multiset. Whenever you have two equal powers of two in a multiset, whose sum you are trying to represent, you can merge them with the fusion rule</p>

\[2^i+2^i \Rightarrow 2^{i+1}.\]

<p>This can be thought of as a chip-firing game on a graph where there is a vertex for every power of two, an edge to the next larger power of two, and an edge to a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_bucket">bit bucket</a>” vertex with no outgoing edges (which cannot be fired). Each instantiation of the fusion rule fires vertex \(2^i\), moving one coin to \(2^{i+1}\) and one to the bit bucket.</p>

<p>This is exactly what we are doing when we carry a term in binary addition: taking two powers of two from a column of the addition problem and fusing them into a single power of two in the next column. We can also think of this physically, using a one-dimensional array of cells with poker chips or coins on them, with a coin on cell \(i\) representing the number \(2^i\). The fusion rule takes two coins from any cell and replaces them by a single coin in the next cell. In binary addition of pairs of numbers, there are at most three coins per cell (the two that started out there and one carry), but you could use the same fusion rule for addition of more than two numbers, using an array of cells that can each contain a large pile of coins.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="80%" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" alt="Five stacks of coins. Image Money-2180330 1920.jpg on Wikimedia commons, uploaded by Stella Vogt from pixabay free images, described as &quot;probably free&quot; but tagged with a CC-BY-SA license." src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/stacks-of-coins.jpg" /></p>

<p>Carrying the coin analogy further, we might imagine that the coins have values that are powers of two, and that we are making change by replacing pairs of small coins by a single larger coin of equal value.</p>

<p>Conventional binary arithmetic does these fusion steps in a systematic order, from low-order bits of the binary representation (smaller powers of two) to higher-order bits (larger powers of two). It’s that systematic order, together with the observation that each pile has at most three coins, that makes this method suitable for a finite state machine. But actually, you could apply the fusion rule in any order, and it would work equally well. Each step reduces the number of coins by one, so you can never do more steps than your starting number of coins. We can only halt when we reach the binary representation of the sum, which is uniquely determined, so this process is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)">confluent</a>: every sequence of choices leads to the same eventual outcome. In this case, confluence can also be seen from the antimatroid property of chip-firing games.</p>

<p>This observation about reducing the number of powers of two gives an immediate proof of a fact about binary representations that you may not have known: the binary representation of \(x+y\) has at most as many nonzero bits as there are in \(x\) and \(y\) separately.</p>

<h1 id="chip-firing-for-fibonacci-numbers">Chip-firing for Fibonacci numbers</h1>

<p>Now, instead of coins with power-of-two values, let’s suppose that they have Fibonacci numbers as their values, representing any multiset of Fibonacci numbers. We can still combine pairs of Fibonacci numbers by a fusion rule, that now applies when we have two coins in adjacent piles:</p>

\[F_i + F_{i+1} \Rightarrow F_{i+2}.\]

<p>But in order to get the Zeckendorf representation of the sum of the multiset, we also need to deal with pairs of coins that have the same value, because repeated copies of the same Fibonacci number are not allowed in the Zeckendorf representation. We can accomplish this by a “fission” rule, that steps backwards according to the fusion rule in order to take a bigger step forwards:</p>

\[F_i+F_i \Rightarrow F_{i-2}+F_{i-1}+F_i\Rightarrow F_{i-2}+F_{i+1}.\]

<p>This makes sense even when \(F_i\) is \(1\) or \(2\): for \(F_i=1\), the \(F_{i-2}\) term is zero and can be dropped from the sum, and for \(F_i=2\) it equals one, a Fibonacci number. So as special cases of this rule we have \(1+1\Rightarrow 2\) and \(2+2\Rightarrow 1+3\).</p>

<p>Several issues complicate the analysis of this replacement system. First, although fission by itself is a chip-firing rule on an infinite graph with outdegree two, fission and fusion together make a more complicated system that is not an antimatroid, so different orderings of choosing what to do may lead to different numbers of steps. Second, the fission rule changes the piles of coins both to the left and to the right of the pile to which it applies, making it harder to find a consistent ordering in which to apply these rules. And third, fission preserves the number of coins rather than reducing them, making both the eventual termination of the system and the analysis of how many steps it takes less obvious. But assuming it does terminate, it can only terminate at the Zeckendorf representation, which is unique. So termination implies confluence.</p>

<h1 id="fission-without-fusion">Fission without fusion</h1>

<p>First let’s see what happens if we just use the fission rule, forgetting about the fusion rule. Because fission by itself is a chip-firing rule, any initial state has an invariant number of firings and an invariant final state, regardless of the order of operations. For an initial state with \(n\) copies of \(F_i\), the final state gives us an expansion of \(F_i\) into a sum of \(n\) distinct Fibonacci numbers:</p>

\[F_i = F_i\]

\[2\,F_i = F_{i-2}+F_{i+1}\]

\[3\,F_i=F_{i-2}+F_i+F_{i+1}\]

\[4\,F_i=F_{i-4}+F_{i-3}+F_i+F_{i+2}\]

\[\vdots\]

<p>The indexes appearing in these identities can be summarized in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Triangles_of_numbers">triangle of numbers</a>:</p>

\[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;\ 1\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 1\ &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;&amp;&amp;\\
&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;&amp;\\
&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-2&amp;&amp;0&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 2\ &amp;\\
-6&amp;&amp;-5&amp;&amp;-4&amp;&amp;-3&amp;&amp;-1&amp;&amp;1&amp;&amp;\ 3\ \\
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\vdots&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;\\
\end{array}\]

<p>The largest number in each row grows only logarithmically with \(n\), because of the way the values of the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially as a function of their index. The fission rule cannot create gaps of three or more empty cells,
so consecutive numbers in a row differ by at most three, implying that the smallest number in each row is greater than \(-3n\). Because of this linear bound on how far fission can move the coins, we get a quadratic bound on the total number of firing events: each firing decreases the total distance of the coins from cell \(-3n\). This total distance starts at \(3n^2\) and remains positive, so there can  be at most \(3n^2\) firings. In computational experiments up to \(n=10000\) the actual number of firings never exceeded \(n^2\) and appeared to be growing as \(n^2\bigl(1-o(1)\bigr)\). This is a big contrast from the behavior of the similar-looking chip-firing rule on a line of cells that replaces pairs of coins by a coin one cell to the left and a coin one cell to the right, which (with \(n\) chips starting in a pile on one cell) produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_pyramidal_number">square pyramidal number</a> of firings, cubic in \(n\).</p>

<p>For initial coins that are not all in one big pile, it remains impossible for fission to produce new long gaps, and we can decompose the sequence of cells into subsequences of linear length separated by gaps too long to be crossed. The same analysis of total distance of coins from the starts of sequences of cells shows that, regardless of starting state, and even if we also allow fusion rules, we get an \(O(n^2)\) bound on the total number of steps. In particular, this system always terminates.</p>

<h1 id="taking-few-steps">Taking few steps</h1>

<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to take quadratic time to simplify sums of Fibonacci numbers into their Zeckendorf representations using these rules. The problem with the previous analysis was that we were doing too much fission before we did any fusion. Suppose we sidestep that with the following prioritization:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If any fusion step would put a coin into a pile that is currently empty, do it.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, perform a fission step at the pile with the largest possible index.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any fusion steps are possible, there must be at least one (for instance, the one with the largest index) that is prioritized. To analyze these prioritized steps, define \(N\) to be the current number of coins, and \(M\) to be the number of coins that are at or below a pile with two or more coins on it. The key insight is that whenever a step moves a coin to a pile with a larger index, it cannot form a new larger-index multi-coin pile, so both \(M\) and \(N\) are non-decreasing. They can stay the same only for a fission step at a pile of three or more coins, but in that case the next step must be a fusion. \(M\) and \(N\) are both \(\le n\), and their sum decreases at least once for every two steps, so the total number of steps is \(\le 4n\). Thus, this prioritized chip-firing method can reduce any sum of Fibonacci numbers to its Zeckendorf representation in a linear number of steps. It’s also not difficult to implement so that it takes linear time.</p>

<h1 id="zeckendorf-arithmetic">Zeckendorf arithmetic</h1>

<p>Anyway, now that we have a way of simplifying sums of Fibonacci numbers to their Zeckendorf form, let’s use it for arithmetic on Zeckendorf representations, without the need to reduce them to simpler forms.</p>

<p>First, addition. This is very easy: Add the two Zeckendorf representations as multisets (producing piles of coins that might be adjacent, or might have two coins in them) and then simplify. The result is a linear time for adding two Zeckendorf representations, as was already known. But because it isn’t based on finite state machines, it can also handle more than two coins, for instance by adding multiple numbers at once rather than having to reduce the problem to multiple pairwise additions. As with binary arithmetic, the chip-firing method gives a quick proof of a non-obvious fact: the Zeckendorf representation of \(x+y\) has at most as many nonzero terms as there are in \(x\) and \(y\) put together.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use this technique (or really, any linear-time Zeckendorf addition algorithm) as part of a long multiplication algorithm for Zeckendorf representations. To multiply two numbers \(x\) and \(y\), both given by their Zeckendorf representations, first perform a sequence of additions to compute the representations of the numbers \(F_i\cdot x\), each computed as \((F_{i-1}\cdot x)+(F_{i-2}\cdot x)\) in a single addition from earlier numbers in the sequence. Then pick out the subset of these representations for which \(F_i\) belongs to the Zeckendorf representation of \(y\), and add them together. (Or interleave the computation of \(F_i\cdot x\) and the sum of these representations, to save space.) The total time for \(\ell\)-bit inputs is \(O(\ell^2)\), as it is for the usual long multiplication algorithm. I’m using the different variable \(\ell\), because the time here is a function of all the bits in the input Zeckendorf representation, rather than just the number of nonzero bits.</p>

<p>You can convert a binary number to Zeckendorf with the same idea, computing the sequence of powers of two and then picking out and adding together the subset of these powers used in the binary representation of the input. In the other direction, you can convert a Zeckendorf representation to binary by computing the Fibonacci sequence in binary, picking out the terms from the given Zeckendorf representation, and adding them. Both directions of conversion take time \(O(\ell^2)\). A recent paper by Sergeev shows how to do these conversions much more efficient, only logarithmically slower than binary-number multiplication.<sup id="fnref:s"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/06/12/carrying-chip-firing.html#fn:s" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Based on Sergeev’s results it would also be much more efficient (in theory at least, if not necessarily in practice) to multiply Zeckendorf representations by converting to binary, multiplying in binary, and converting back.</p>

<p>As the article I linked at the start hints, the direct algorithms described here are a bit unsatisfactory from the point of view of circuit complexity: the circuit size is ok but the circuit depth is much larger than it would be for binary arithmetic. I’m not convinced that this is a serious deficiency, because we’re not likely to build computers that use this arithmetic at the circuit level. Any algorithms like this are more likely to be used only in specialized situations where Zeckendorf arithmetic is relevant, like the analysis of certain combinatorial games.</p>

<h1>Causality</h1>



<p>We may have heard that <strong>“correlation does not imply causation”</strong>. How can we mathematically represent this statement, and furthermore differentiate the two rigorously?</p>



<p>Roughly speaking, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> are correlated if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28B%3Db%7CA%3Da%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(B=b|A=a)" class="latex" /> is different for different values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />. To represent causation, we change the second part of the formula: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> causes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> if <em>intervening</em> to change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> to some value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> changes the probability of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" />. That is,</p>

<h2>Example of Causality</h2>



<p>Suppose we have the random variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CW%2CH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X,W,H" class="latex" /> (taken over choice of a random person), which represent e<strong>X</strong>ercising, being over<strong>W</strong>eight and having <strong>H</strong>eart disease, respectively. We put forth the following (hypothetical! this is not medical advice!) scenarios for their relationships:</p>



<p><strong>Scenario 1.</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csim+Bern%281%2F2%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X\sim Bern(1/2)" class="latex" />. Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" />, the overweight indicator, follows the causal relation:</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W+%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X+%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%281%2F2%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X%3D0%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W \sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } X = 1\\ Bern(1/2) &amp; \text{if } X=0\end{cases}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>and the heart disease indicator <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> follows the same rule</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H+%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X+%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%281%2F2%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+X%3D0%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H \sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } X = 1\\ Bern(1/2) &amp; \text{if } X=0\end{cases}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>So, in this scenario, exercise prevents heart disease and being overweight, while if we don’t exercise, we may be overweight or suffer from heart disease with probability 1/2 independently..</p>



<p><strong>Scenario 2.</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W%5Csim+Bern%281%2F4%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W\sim Bern(1/4)" class="latex" /></p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%5Csim+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+0+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+W%3D+1%5C%5C+Bern%282%2F3%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+W%3D0+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X\sim \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } W= 1\\ Bern(2/3) &amp; \text{if } W=0 \end{cases}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> still depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> in the same rule in the previous scenario. So, in this scenario, people are naturally prone to being overweight with probability 1/4, and being overweight makes you less likely to exercise, rather than the causal relation being in the other way around. As before, exercise prevents heart disease, and someone who did not exercise will get heart disease with probability 1/2.</p>



<p>We find that in scenario 1, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7CX%3D0%29%3D1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(W=1|X=0)=1/2" class="latex" />. In scenario 2,</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7CX%3D0%29%3D%5Cfrac%7BP%28W%3D1%29P%28X%3D0%7CW%3D1%29%7D%7BP%28X%3D0%29%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cfrac14%5Ccdot+1%7D%7B%5Cfrac14%2B%5Cfrac34%5Cfrac13%7D%3D%5Cfrac12.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(W=1|X=0)=\frac{P(W=1)P(X=0|W=1)}{P(X=0)}=\frac{\frac14\cdot 1}{\frac14+\frac34\frac13}=\frac12." class="latex" /></p>



<p>In fact, as this table shows, the probabilities for all combinations of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%2CW%2CH&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X,W,H" class="latex" /> are identical in the two scenarios!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HGYQ4eh.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Now, consider the intervention of setting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X=0" class="latex" />, i.e. stop exercising. That is, we change the generating model for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3A%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X:=0" class="latex" />. In scenario 1, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)" class="latex" /> is still <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1/2" class="latex" />. In scenario 2, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X=0" class="latex" /> tells us nothing about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> now so we get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29%3D1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)=1/4" class="latex" />. Now that we added in an intervention, the two scenarios are different!</p>



<p>This is an example of why <strong>correlations are not causations</strong>: while the conditional probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr%28+W%3D1+%7CX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Pr( W=1 |X=0)" class="latex" /> identical in the two scenarios, the causal probabilities are diffent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28W%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DX%3D0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(W=1|\text{ do }X=0)" class="latex" />.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LGEGtvR.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p><strong><span style="color: #a30000;" class="has-inline-color">NOTE:</span></strong> Working out this example,  and understanding <strong>(a)</strong> why the two scenarios induce identical probabilities, and in particular all conditional probabilities are identical and <strong>(b)</strong> why the causal probabilities differ from the conditional probabilities in Scenario 2, is a great way to get intuition for causality and its pitfalls.</p>



<h2>Causal Probabilities and confounders</h2>



<p>Consider Scenario 1, where the causal structure is as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FJlQyaO.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Looking at the table above, we see that the unconditional probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(H=1)" class="latex" /> equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1/4" class="latex" />. Since in this scenario, there is no causal relation between being overweight and suffering from heat disease, the causal probability  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1+%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+W+%5Cleftarrow+0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(H=1 | \text{ do } W \leftarrow 0)" class="latex" />  is also equal to  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1/4" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>However, we can calculate the conditional probability from the table and see that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3D1%7CW%3D0%29%3D1%2F6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(H=1|W=0)=1/6" class="latex" />.<br />That means that even though in this scenario, there is no causal relation between being overweight and getting heart disease, conditioning on not being overweight reduces the probability of getting heart disease.<br />Once again we see here a <strong>gap</strong> between the <strong>conditional </strong>and <strong>causal</strong> probabilities.</p>



<p>The reason is for this gap is that there is a <strong>counfounding variable</strong>, namely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> that is a common cause of both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" />.</p>



<p><strong>Definition:</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H%2CW&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H,W" class="latex" /> are <em>confounded</em> if there are values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h%2Cw&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="h,w" class="latex" /> such that</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DW%3Dw%29%5Cneq+P%28H%3Dh%7CW%3De%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(H=h|\text{ do }W=w)\neq P(H=h|W=e)," class="latex" /></p>



<p>To fix the effect of a confounder, we condition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />. It also allows us to find the probability of an intervention. The general <strong>deconfounding formula</strong> is</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DW%3Dw%29%3D%5Csum_x+P%28H%3Dh%7CW%3Dw%2C+X%3Dx%29+P%28X%3Dx%29%5C%3B%5C%3B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(H=h|\text{ do }W=w)=\sum_x P(H=h|W=w, X=x) P(X=x)\;\;" class="latex" />   (★),</p>



<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> ranges over all the immediate causes of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the formula for computing the conditional probability which is</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28H%3Dh+%7C+W%3Dw%29+%3D+%5Csum_x+P%28H%3Dh+%7C+W%3Dw%2C+X%3Dx%29+P%28X%3Dx+%7C+W%3Dw%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(H=h | W=w) = \sum_x P(H=h | W=w, X=x) P(X=x | W=w)" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Using the deconfounding formula (★) requires <strong>(a)</strong> knowing the causal graph, and <strong>(b)</strong> observing the confounders. If we get this wrong and control for the wrong confounders we can get the causal probabilities wrong, as demonstrated by the following example.</p>



<p><br />One way to describe causality theory is that it aims to clarify the situations under which <strong>correlation does in fact equal causation</strong> (i.e., the <strong>conditional probabilities are equal to the causal probabilities</strong>), and how (by appropriately controlling for confounders) we can get to such a situation.</p>



<p><strong>Example (two diseases)</strong> Consider the diagram below where there are two diseases <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> such that each occurs independently with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" />. We assume each will send you to the hospital (variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />) and those are the only reason to arrive at the hospital.</p>



<p>If you control for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> (i.e look at only people who went to the hospital), we find that the probabilities are now correlated: A priori the probability is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2F%282p-p%5E2%29%5Capprox+1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p/(2p-p^2)\approx 1/2" class="latex" />, and conditioned on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X=1" class="latex" />, the probability is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5E2%2Fp%3Dp+%3C1%2F2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p^2/p=p &lt;1/2" class="latex" />.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9mETSEo.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This relates to the joke “the probability of having 2 bombs on a plane is very low, so if I bring a bomb then it is very unlikely that there will be another bomb.”</p>



<p>In general, the causal graph can look as one of the following shapes:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ARygORn.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> is a fork then controlling for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> can tease out the causal relation. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> is a mediator or collider then controlling for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> can actually make things worse. –&gt;</p>



<p><strong>Backdoor paths:</strong> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> are two random variables, we say that there is a “backdoor path” from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> if there is direct ancestor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> that is connected in the undirected version of the causal graph in a path not going through <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/n45KXt9.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>We can show the following theorem:</p>



<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> If there is no backdoor path then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28Y%3Dy+%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+X+%5Cleftarrow+X%29+%3D+P%28Y%3Dy%7CX%3Dx%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(Y=y | \text{ do } X \leftarrow X) = P(Y=y|X=x)" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Here is a “proof by picture”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UAC2lWE.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>If there isn’t a backdoor path, we sort the graph in topological order, so that all the events that happen before <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> are not connected to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> except through <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />. So we can first generate all the variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A" class="latex" /> that result in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />. Then the probability distribution of the events <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="B" class="latex" /> between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> only depends on the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="X" class="latex" />, and so similarly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> is generated from some probability distribution that only depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />.</p>

<p>When we design experiments, we often want to estimate <em>causal effects</em>, and to do so we try to make sure we eliminate backdoor paths.<br />Consider the example of a COVID vaccine trial.<br />We let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="V=1" class="latex" /> be the event that a trial participant obtained a vaccine, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C=1" class="latex" /> be the event that the participant was infected with COVID.<br />We want to figure out <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28C%3D1%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+%7DV%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(C=1|\text{ do }V=1)" class="latex" />.<br />However, there is a “backdoor path”.<br />You will not get the vaccine if you don’t participate in the trial (which we denote by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="V=1" class="latex" />), but particpating in the trial could change your behavior and hence have a causal effect on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>To fix this we can cut the backdoor path using a placebo: it cuts the backward path by removing the confounding variable of participation, since it ensure that (conditioning on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P=1" class="latex" />), <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=V&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="V" class="latex" /> is now an independent variable from any behavioral changes that might impact <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" />.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TfH4Bzn.png" alt="" /></figure>



<h2>Conditioning</h2>



<p>In general, how does conditioning on some variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> affect correlations? It may introduce correlations in events that occur before <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />, but cuts any path that depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" />.<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Qk5p0s7.png" alt="" /></p>



<h2>Average Treatment Effect and Propensity Score</h2>



<p>Suppose we have some treatment variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> that we don’t get to control (e.g. in a natural experiment). Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y_t+%3D+Y%7C+%5Ctext%7B+do+%7D+T%3Dt&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y_t = Y| \text{ do } T=t" class="latex" /> , and we hope to estimate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y_1%29-E%28Y_0%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="E(Y_1)-E(Y_0)" class="latex" /> which is known as the the <strong>treatment effect</strong>.<br />However, we worry that some underlying variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> (e.g. healthy lifestyle) can affect both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>The <em>propensity score</em>, defined as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e%28z%29%3DE%28T%7CZ%3Dz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="e(z)=E(T|Z=z)" class="latex" />, allows us to calculate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+T%7D%3D1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="E(Y|\text{ do T}=1)" class="latex" />. We claim that as long as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> is a valid confounder (for which the formula (★) holds)</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E%28Y%7C%5Ctext%7B+do+T%7D%3D1%29%3DE%28YT%2Fe%28Z%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="E(Y|\text{ do T}=1)=E(YT/e(Z))." class="latex" /></p>



<p>The proof is obtained by expanding out the claim, see below</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gyKYlZn.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Intuitively, knowing the probability that different groups of people get treatment allows us to make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T" class="latex" /> independent from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Y_0%2CY_1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(Y_0,Y_1)" class="latex" /> and calculate the treatment effect.</p>



<p><strong>Calculating treatment effect using ML.</strong> Suppose that the treatment effect is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\tau" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5Cpsi%28Z%29%2B%5Ctau+T%2B%5Ctext%7B+noise%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y=\psi(Z)+\tau T+\text{ noise}" class="latex" />. Now, if we learn a model <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28z%29%5Capprox+E%28Y%7CZ%3Dz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(z)\approx E(Y|Z=z)" class="latex" />, then</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y-f%28z%29%5Capprox+%5Ctau%28T-e%28z%29%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y-f(z)\approx \tau(T-e(z))." class="latex" /></p>



<p>Since both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y-f%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y-f(z)" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T-e%28z%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T-e(z)" class="latex" /> are calculable, we only need to do a linear regression.</p>



<h2>Instrumental Variables</h2>



<p>When we cannot observe the counfounding variable, we can still sometimes use <em>instrumental variables</em> to estimate a causal effect.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XHo3Q5e.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Assume a linear model <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y%3D%5Ctau+T%2Bf%28W%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Y=\tau T+f(W)" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="W" class="latex" /> is the stuff we don’t observe. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Z" class="latex" /> is some variable that satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Cov%28Z%2Cf%28W%29%29%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Cov(Z,f(W))=0" class="latex" /> then</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau%3D%5Cfrac%7BCov%28Z%2CY%29%7D%7BCov%28Z%2CT%29%7D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\tau=\frac{Cov(Z,Y)}{Cov(Z,T)}," class="latex" /></p>



<p>which is the ratio between two observable quantities.</p>



<h1>Fairness</h1>



<p>We focus on fairness in classification problems, rather than fairness in learning generative models or representation (which also have their own issues, see in particular <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922">this paper</a> by Bender, Gebru, McMillan-Major, and “Shmitchell”).</p>



<p>In the public image, AI has been perceived to be very successful for some tasks, and some people might hope that it is more “objective” or “impartial” than human decisions which are known to be <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873">fraught with bias</a>). However, there are some works suggesting this might not be the case:</p>



<ul><li>Usage in prediciting recidivism for bail decisions. For example in ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">Angwin, Larson, Mattu, and Kirchner</a> showed that 44.9% of African Americans who didn’t reoffend were labeled higher risk, whereas only 23.5% of white defendants who didn’t reoffend were labeled as such.</li><li>Machine vision can sometimes work better on some segments of population than others. For example, <a href="http://gendershades.org/">Buolamwini and Gebrue</a> showed that some “gender classifiers” achieve 99.7% accuracy on white men but only 65.3% accuracy (not much better than coin toss) on black women.</li><li><a href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2016.00960.x">Lum and Isaac</a> gave an example of a “positive feedback loop” in predictive policing in Oakland, CA. While drug use is fairly uniform across the city, the arrests are centered on particular neighborhood (that have more minority residents). In predictive policing, more police would be sent out to the places where arrests occured, hence only exercabating this disparate treatment.</li></ul>



<p>Drug use in Oakland:<br /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/nrH0dEy.png" alt="" /></p>



<p>Drug arrests in Oakland:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hIvgmEK.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>While algorithms can sometimes also help, the populations they help might not be distributed equally. For example, see this table from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10511482.2002.9521447">Gates, Perry and Zorn</a>. A more accurate underwriting model (that can better predict the default probability) enables a lender to use a more agressive risk cut off and so end up lending to more people.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xxms8Jk.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>However, this is true within each subpopulation too, so it may be that if the model is less accurate in a certain subpopulation, then a profit-maximizing lender will unfairly offer fewer loans to this subpopulation.</p>



<h2>Formalizing Unfairness</h2>



<p>In the case of employment discrimination in the U.S., we have the following components:</p>



<ul><li>Protected class<ul><li>categories such as race, sex, nationality, citizenship, veteran status, etc.</li></ul></li><li>An unfairness metric, measuring either:<ul><li>disparate treatment</li><li>disparate impact.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Employers are not allowed to discriminate across protected classes when hiring. The unfairness metric gives us a way to measure if there is discrimination with respected to a protected class. In particular, disparate impacts across different protected classes is often <em>necessary</em> but <em>not sufficient</em> evidence of discrimination.</p>



<h2>Algorithms for Fairness: an Example</h2>



<p>To see why algorithms, which at first glance seem agnostic to group membership, may exhibit disparate treatment or impact, we consider the following <a href="https://research.google.com/bigpicture/attacking-discrimination-in-ml/">Google visualization by Wattenberg, Viégas, and Hardt</a>.</p>



<p>Consider a blue population and an orange population for which there is no difference in the probability of a member of either population paying back the loan, but for which our model has different accuracies—in particular, the model is more accurate on the orange population. This is described by the plot below, in which the scores correspond to the model’s prediction of the probability of paying back the loan and opaque circles correspond to those who actually do not pay back the loan, whereas filled in circles correspond to those who do.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BEy6yqi.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Suppose we are in charge of making a lending decision given the model prediction.<br />A scenario in which we give everyone a loan would be fair, but would be bad us —we would go bankrupt!</p>



<p>Profit when giving everyone a loan:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1uCdp2Q.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>If we wanted to <strong>maximize profit</strong>, we would, however, give more loans to the orange population (since we’re more sure about which members of the orange population would actually pay back their loans) by setting a lower threshold (in terms of the score given by our algorithm) above which we give out loans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Njtg1FU.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This maximizes profit but is blatantly unfair. We are treating the identical blue and orange groups differently, just because our model is more accurate on one than the other, and we also have disparate impact on the two groups. A non-defaulting applicant would be 78% likely to get a loan if they are a member of the orange group, but only 60% likely to get a loan if they are a member of the orange group.</p>



<p>This “profit maximization” is likely the end result of any sufficiently complex lending algorithm in the absence of a fairness intervention. Even if the algorithm does not explicitly rely on the group membership attribute, by simply optimizing it to maximize profit, it may well pick up on attributes that are correlated with group membership.</p>



<p>Suppose on the other hand that we wanted to mandate “equal treatment” in the sense of keeping the same thresholds for the blue and orange group. The result would be the following:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c13O4Ly.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>In this case, since the threshold are identical, the algorithm will be <strong>calibrated</strong>. 79% of the decisions we make will be the correct ones, for both the blue and orange population. So, from our point of view, the algorithm is fair and treats the blue and orange populations identically. However, from the point of view of the applicants, this is not the case. If you are a blue applicant that will pay your loan, you have 81% chance of getting a loan, but if you are an orange customer you only have 60% of getting it. This demonstrates that defining fairness is quite delicate. In particular the above “color blind” algorithm is still arguable unfair.</p>



<p>This difference between the point of view of the lender and lendee also arose in the recidivism case mentioned above. From the point of view of the defendant that would not recidivate, the algorithm was more likely to label them as “high risk” if they were Black than if they were white. From the point of view of the decision maker, the algorithm was calibrated, and if anything it was a bit more likely that a white defendant labeled high risk would not recidivate than a Black defendant. See (slightly rounded and simplified) data below</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M73xLoe.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p></p>



<p>If we wanted to achieve demographic parity (both populations get same total number of loans) or equal opportunity (true positive rate same for both) then we can do so, but again using different thresholds for each group:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uMHsFPz.png" alt="" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pAnbY6m.png" alt="" /></figure>



<h2>Fico Scores and Different Types of Fairness</h2>



<p>While the above was a hypothetical scenario, a real life example was shown by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02413">Hardt, Price and Srebro</a> using credit (also known as FICO) scores, as described by the plot below:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/S8H0gjj.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>For a single threshold, around 75% of Asian candidates will get loans, whereas only around 20% of Black candidates will get loans. To ensure that all groups get loans at the same rate, we would need to set the thresholds differently. In order to equalize opportunity, we’d also need to initialize the thresholds differently as well.</p>



<p>We see that we have different notions of what it means to be <em>fair</em> and that each of these different notions result in different algorithms.</p>



<h2>Fairness and Causality</h2>



<p>Berkeley graduate admissions in 1973 had the following statistics:</p>



<ul><li>44% male applicants admitted, 35% female applicants admitted;</li><li>However, female acceptance rate was higher at the <em>department level</em>, for most departments.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MizH3NY.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>This paradox is commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox">Simpson’s Paradox</a>.</p>



<p>A “fair” causal model for this scenario might be as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sVG4l7l.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>In the above, perhaps gender has a causal impact on the choice of department to which the applicant applies. However, a fair application process would, conditional on the department, be independent of gender of the applicant.</p>



<p>However, not all models that follow this causal structure are necessarily <em>fair</em>. In the case Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 1971, the court ruled that decision-making under the following causal model was <em>unfair</em>:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9f6iEKH.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>While the model appears to be fair, since the job offer is conditionall independent of race, given the diploma, the court ruled that the job did not actually require a high school diploma. Hence, using the diploma as a factor in hiring decisions was really just a proxy for race, resulting in essentially purposeful unfair discrimination based on race. This creation of proxies is referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a>.</p>



<h1>Bottom Line</h1>



<p>We cannot come up with universal fairness criteria. The notion of fairness itself is based on assumptions about:</p>



<ul><li>representation of data</li><li>relationships to unmeasured inputs and outcomes</li><li>causal relation of inputs, predictions, outcomes.</li></ul>



<p>Fairness depends on what we choose to measure to observe, in both inputs and outputs, and how we choose to act upon them. In particular, we have the following causal structure, wherein measure inputs, decision-making, and measured outcomes all play a role in affecting the real-world and function together in a feedback cycle:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LcW07id.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>A more comprehensive illustration is given in this paper of <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/4/251365-the-impossibility-of-fairness/fulltext">Friedler, Scheidegger, and Venkatasubramanian</a>:</p>

<p>I just heard that Benny Chor died this morning. Chor did very important work on computational biology and distributed algorithms, but I (and probably many of my readers) know him primarily for his work on cryptography, for his work on randomness extraction and for introducing the notion of private information retrieval.</p>



<p>I only met him once, at the event for <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/04/20/fests/">Oded Goldreich’s 60th birthday</a>. On the occasion, he gave a talk on the Chor-Goldreich paper, which introduced the problem of randomness extraction from independent sources, and which introduced min-entropy as the right parameter by which to quantify the randomness content of random sources. He did so using the original slides used for the FOCS 1985 talk.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6726.jpg"><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_6726.jpg?w=768" alt="" class="wp-image-3735" /></a></figure>



<p>I took a picture during the talk, which I posted online, and later he sent me an email asking for the original. Sadly, this was the totality of our correspondence. I heard that besides being a brilliant and generous researchers, he was a very playful, likeable and nice person. My thoughts are with his family and his friends.</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>The other night Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ">“The Internet’s Own Boy,”</a> the 2014 documentary about the life and work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>, which I’d somehow missed when it came out.  Swartz, for anyone who doesn’t remember, was the child prodigy who helped create RSS and Reddit, who then became a campaigner for an open Internet, who was arrested for using a laptop in an MIT supply closet to download millions of journal articles and threatened with decades in prison, and who then committed suicide at age 26.  I regret that I never knew Swartz, though he did once send me a fan email about <em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em>.</p>



<p>Say whatever you want about the tactical wisdom or the legality of Swartz’s actions; it seems inarguable to me that he was <em>morally</em> correct, that certain categories of information (e.g. legal opinions and taxpayer-funded scientific papers) need to be made freely available, and that sooner or later our civilization will catch up to Swartz and regard his position as completely obvious.  The beautifully-made documentary filled me with rage and guilt not only that the world had failed Swartz, but that I personally had failed him.</p>



<p>At the time of Swartz’s arrest, prosecution, and suicide, I was an MIT CS professor who’d previously <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.html">written</a> in strong support of open access to scientific literature, and who had the platform of this blog.  Had I understood what was going on with Swartz—had I <em>taken the time to find out</em> what was going on—I could have been in a good position to help organize a grassroots campaign to pressure the MIT administration to urge prosecutors to drop the case (like JSTOR had already done), which could plausibly have made a difference.  As it was, I was preoccupied in those years with BosonSampling, getting married, etc., I didn’t bother to learn whether anything was being done or <em>could</em> be done about the Aaron Swartz matter, and then before I knew it, Swartz had joined Alan Turing in computer science’s pantheon of lost geniuses.</p>



<p>But maybe there was something deeper to my inaction.  If I’d strongly defended the substance of what Swartz had done, it would’ve raised the question: <em>why wasn’t I doing the same?</em>  Why was I merely complaining about paywalled journals from the comfort of my professor’s office, rather than putting my own freedom on the line like Swartz was?  It was as though I <em>had</em> to put some psychological distance between myself and the situation, in order to justify my life choices to myself.</p>



<p>Even though I see the error in that way of “thinking,” it keeps recurring, keeps causing me to make choices that I feel guilt or at least regret about later.  In February 2020, there were a few smart people saying that a new viral pneumonia from Wuhan was about to upend life on earth, but the people around me certainly weren’t <em>acting</em> that way, and <em>I</em> wasn’t acting that way either … and so, “for the sake of internal consistency,” I didn’t spend much time thinking about it or investigating it.  After all, if the fears of a global pandemic had a good chance of being true, I should be dropping everything else and panicking, shouldn’t I?  But I <em>wasn’t</em> dropping everything else and panicking … so how could the fears be true?</p>



<p>Then I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">publicly repented</a>, and resolved not to make such an error again.  And now, 15 months later, I realize that I <em>have</em> made such an error again.</p>



<p>All throughout the pandemic, I’d ask my friends, privately, why the hypothesis that the virus had accidentally leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology wasn’t being taken far more seriously, given what seemed like a shockingly strong <em>prima facie</em> case.  But I didn’t discuss the lab leak scenario on this blog, except once in passing.  I could <em>say</em> I didn’t discuss it because I’m not a virologist and I had nothing new to contribute.  But I worry that I also didn’t discuss it because it seemed incompatible with my self-conception as a cautious scientist who’s skeptical of lurid coverups and conspiracies—and because I’d already spent my “weirdness capital” on other issues, and didn’t relish the prospect of being sneered at on social media yet again.  Instead I simply waited for discussion of the lab leak hypothesis to become “safe” and “respectable,” as today it finally has, thanks to writers who were more courageous than I was.  I became, basically, another sheep in one of the conformist herds that we rightly despise when we read about them in history.</p>



<p>(For all that, it’s still plausible to me that the virus had a natural origin after all.  What’s become clear is simply that, <em>even if so</em>, the failure to take the possibility of a lab escape more seriously back when the trail of evidence was fresher will stand as a major intellectual scandal of our time.)</p>



<p>Sometimes people are wracked with guilt, but over completely different things than the world <em>wants</em> them to be wracked with guilt over.  This was one of the great lessons that I learned from reading Richard Rhodes’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Atomic-Bomb-Richard-Rhodes/dp/1451677618">The Making of the Atomic Bomb</a></em>.  Many of the Manhattan Project physicists felt lifelong guilt, <em>not</em> that they’d participated in building the bomb, but only that they hadn’t <em>finished</em> the bomb by 1943, when it could have ended the war in Europe and the Holocaust.</p>



<p>On a much smaller scale, I suppose some readers would still like me to feel guilt about comment 171, or some of the other stuff I wrote about nerds, dating, and feminism … or if not that, then maybe about my defense of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, or of standardized tests and accelerated math programs, or maybe my vehement condemnation of Trump and his failed insurrection.  Or any of the dozens of other times when I stood up and said something I actually believed, or when I recounted my experiences as accurately as I could.  The truth is, though, I don’t.</p>



<p>Looking back—which, now that I’m 40, I confess is an increasingly large fraction of my time—the pattern seems consistent.  I feel guilty, not for having stood up for what I strongly believed in, but for having <em>failed</em> to do so.  This suggests that, if I want fewer regrets, then I should click “Publish” on more potentially controversial posts!  I don’t know how to force myself to do that, but maybe this post itself is a step.</p></div>

<p>Faculty hiring in computer science is a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2016/12/fixing-academic-job-market.html">process long due for an overhaul</a>. The pandemic certainly changed some of the dynamics moving most of the interviews online and saving a ton of money and time. Will this be the start of a fresh approach to recruiting?</p><p>A typical search in the past few years had some schools flying in 30-40 candidates, typically costing over a $1000 each and a full-time job for a staff member during the search. We'd justify the expense as small compared to the millions we'd invest in a faculty member throughout their career, but it is generally the largest discretionary expense for a CS department. It also gives advantages to rich departments over others.</p><p>During the pandemic all those interviews moved online and worked reasonably well at virtually no additional cost. Also no need to scrounge around to find faculty willing to skip family meals to have dinner with the candidates. And if a faculty had a conflict with a candidate on the interview day, they could schedule on a different day. There really is no reason to have all the meetings on the same day.</p><p>With the pandemic mostly behind us, will we go back to in-person interviews moving forward. I suspect the <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/whiffing-the-airport-interview/">airport interview</a>, where you fly out 20 or so candidates to have hour long interviews in a hotel near an airport with a search committee for an administrative position, will be the first to go completely virtual. </p><p>Even for regular faculty interviews, there will be great pressure to reduce the number of in-person visits, perhaps to just the top candidates, or just the ones who have offers--make the "second visit" the only visit. Richer departments may find the expense worthwhile to make a bigger impression on the candidates and that will only expand the advantage of wealthier universities.</p><p>Times like this are the perfect opportunity for CS leadership to come in and give some sanity to the hiring process but I'm not holding my breath.</p></div>

<div class="content">
We propose a new approach to the hardness-to-randomness framework and to the promise-BPP=promise-P conjecture. Classical results rely on non-uniform hardness assumptions to construct derandomization algorithms that work in the worst-case, or rely on uniform hardness assumptions to construct derandomization algorithms that work only in the average-case. In both types of results, the derandomization algorithm is ``black-box'' and uses the standard PRG approach. In this work we present results that closely relate **new and natural uniform hardness assumptions** to **worst-case derandomization** of promise-BPP, where the algorithms underlying the latter derandomization are **non-black-box**.

In our main result, we show that promise-BPP=promise-P if the following holds: There exists a multi-output function computable by logspace-uniform circuits of polynomial size and depth $n^2$ that cannot be computed by uniform probabilistic algorithms in time $n^c$, for some universal constant $c&gt;1$, on **almost all inputs**. The required failure on ``almost all inputs'' is stronger than the standard requirement of failing on one input of each length; however, the same assumption without the depth restriction on $f$ is **necessary** for the conclusion. This suggests a potential equivalence between worst-case derandomization of promise-BPP of any form (i.e., not necessarily by a black-box algorithm) and the existence of efficiently computable functions that are hard for probabilistic algorithms on almost all inputs.

In our second result, we introduce a new and uniform hardness-to-randomness tradeoff for the setting of **superfast average-case derandomization**; prior to this work, superfast average-case derandomization was known only under non-uniform hardness assumptions. In an extreme instantiation of our new tradeoff, under appealing uniform hardness assumptions, we show that for every polynomial $T(n)$ and constant $\epsilon&gt;0$ it holds that $BPTIME[T]\subseteq heur-DTIME[T\cdot n^{\epsilon}]$, where the ``heur'' prefix means that no polynomial-time algorithm can find, with non-negligible probability, an input on which the deterministic simulation errs.

Technically, our approach is to design **targeted PRGs and HSGs**, as introduced by Goldreich (LNCS, 2011). The targeted PRGs/HSGs ``produce randomness from the input'', as suggested by Goldreich and Wigderson (RANDOM 2002); and their analysis relies on non-black-box versions of the reconstruction procedure of Impagliazzo and Wigderson (FOCS 1998). Our main reconstruction procedure crucially relies on the ideas underlying the proof system of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum (J. ACM 2015).</div>

We prove that there exists an absolute constant $\delta&gt;0$ such any binary code $C\subset\{0,1\}^N$ tolerating $(1/2-\delta)N$ adversarial deletions must satisfy $|C|\le 2^{\poly\log N}$ and thus have rate asymptotically approaching $0$. This is the first constant fraction improvement over the trivial bound that codes tolerating $N/2$ adversarial deletions must have rate going to $0$ asymptotically.  Equivalently, we show that there exists absolute constants $A$ and $\delta&gt;0$ such that any set $C\subset\{0,1\}^N$ of $2^{\log^A N}$ binary strings must contain two strings $c$ and $c'$ whose longest common subsequence has length at least $(1/2+\delta)N$. As an immediate corollary, we show that $q$-ary codes tolerating a fraction $1-(1+2\delta)/q$ of adversarial deletions must also have rate approaching $0$.
 
Our techniques include string regularity arguments and a structural lemma that classifies binary strings by their oscillation patterns.  Leveraging these tools, we find in any large code two strings with similar oscillation patterns, which is exploited to find a long common subsequence.</div>

<p>After 16 months without lecturing to an audience in my same location, I gave yesterday two lectures at the Technion in front of a live audience (and some additional audience in remote locations). The main lecture was in <a href="https://comsoc2021.net.technion.ac.il/">COMSOC 2021,</a> an international conference on computational social choice,  and earlier I gave a guest lecture in Roy Meshulam’s class about simple polytopes. I also met many friends. </p>
<p><a href="https://reshef.net.technion.ac.il/">Reshef Meir</a> who organized (with Bill Zwicker) COMSOC 2021 wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: #993366;"><em>Hi all, </em></span></div>
<div><span style="color: #993366;"><em>today was beyond expectations – the first feeling of a real actual conference after almost a year and a half!  We had about 40 people attending, viewing posters, and listening to talks. I truly hope this will return to be a common scene and that we can all meet face to face soon.</em></span></div>
</blockquote>
<div> </div>
<p>In my COMSOC lecture I talked about some earlier ideas and results in my work on social choice, starting with my paper with Ariel Rubinstein and Rani Spiegler on rationalizing individual choice by multiple rationals, and my subsequent attempt to use learnability as a tool for understanding choices of economic agents. This led to interesting questions on social choice <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/06/02/social-choice-preview/">that are discussed in this 2009 post.</a></p>
<p>In Roy’s course I explained <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="h" class="latex" />-vectors of polytopes and the Dehn-Sommerville relations based on counting outdegrees of the graph of the polytope when we direct its edges based on a generic abstract objective function. I moved on to present a proof of Blind-Mani’s theorem that the graph of the polytope determines the full combinatorics. This proof is probably the one proof I presented the most and it is given in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/telling-a-simple-polytope-from-its-graph/">this 2009 post</a>.</p>

<p>We hope you are all staying safe. With massive vaccination programs across the globe we hope you and your loved ones are getting back to what used to be normal. With that out of the way, let us circle back to Property Testing. This month was less sleepy as compared to the two preceding months and we saw six papers in total (two of them explore problems in quantum property testing). Without further ado, let us take a deeper dive.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>GSF-locality is not sufficient for proximity-oblivious testing</strong>, by Isolde Adler, Noleen Kohler, Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08490">arXiv</a>) The notion of proximity oblivious testers was made explicit in the seminal work of Goldreich and Ron in 2009 [GR09]. A proximity oblivious tester for a graph property is a constant query tester that rejects a graph with probability that monotonically increases with distance to the property. (<strong>Edit</strong>: <em>Correction</em>) A property is called proximity oblivious testable (or PO testable) if it has a one sided proximity oblivious tester. [GR09] gave a characterization of which properties \(\Pi\) are PO testable in the bounded degree model <em>if and only if</em> it is a “local” property of some kind which satisfies a certain non propagation condition. [GR09] conjectured that all such “local” properties satisfy this non propagation condition. This paper refutes the above conjecture from [GR09].</p>



<p></p>



<p>Coming up next. More action on triangle freeness.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Triangle Freeness in the General Model in Graphs with Arboricity \(O(\sqrt n)\)</strong>, by Reut Levi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04809">arXiv</a>) PTReview readers are likely to be aware that triangle freeness has been a rich source of problems for developing new sublinear time algorithms. This paper considers the classic problem of testing triangle freeness in general graphs. In the dense case, algorithms with running time depending only on \(\varepsilon\) are known thanks to the work of Alon, Fischer, Krivelevich and Szegedy. In the bounded degree case, Goldreich and Ron gave testers with query complexity \(O(1/\varepsilon)\). This paper explores the problem in general graph case and proves an upper bound of \(O(\Gamma/d_{avg} + \Gamma)\) where \(\Gamma\) is the arboricity of the graph. The author also shows that this upperbound is tight for graphs with arboricity at most \(O(\sqrt n)\). Curiously enough, the algorithm does not take arboricity of the graph as an input and yet \(\Gamma\) (the arboricity) shows up in the upper and lower bounds.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Testing Dynamic Environments: Back to Basics</strong>, by Yonatan Nakar and Dana Ron (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00759">arXiv</a>) Goldreich and Ron introduced the problem of testing “dynamic environments” in 2014. Here is the setup for this problem. You are given an environment that evolves according to a local rule.  Your goal is to query some of the states in the system at some point of time and determine if the system is evolving according to some fixed rule or is far from it. In this paper, the authors consider environments defined by elementary cellular automata which evolve according to threshold rules as one of the first steps towards understanding what makes a dynamic environment tested efficiently.  The main result proves the following: if your local rules satisfy some <em>conditions</em>, you can use a meta algorithm with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\) which is non adaptive and has one sided error. And all the threshold rules indeed satisfy these <em>conditions</em> which means they can be tested efficiently. </p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Identity testing under label mismatch</strong>, by Clement Canonne and Karl Wimmer (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01856">arXiv</a>) This paper considers a classic problem distribution testing with the following twist. Let \(q\) denote a distribution supported on \([n]\). You are given access to samples from another distribution \(p\) where \(p  = q \circ \pi\) where \(\pi\) is some unknown permutation. Thus, I relabel the data and I give you access to samples from the relabeled dataset. Under this promise, note that identity testing becomes a trivial problem if \(q\) is known to be uniform over \([n]\). The authors develop algorithms for testing and tolerant testing of distributions under this additional promise of \(p\) being a permutation of some known distribution \(q\). The main result shows as exponential gap between the sample complexity of testing and tolerant testing under this promise. In particular, identity testing under the promise of permutation has sample complexity \(\Theta(\log^2 n)\) whereas tolerant identity testing under this promise has sample complexity \(\Theta(n^{1-o(1)})\).</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Testing symmetry on quantum computers</strong>, by Margarite L. LaBorde and Mark M. Wilde (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12758">arXiv</a>) This paper develops algorithms which test symmetries of a quantum states and changes generated by quantum circuits. These tests additionally also quantify how symmetric these states (or channels) are. For testing what are called “Bose states” the paper presents efficient algorithms. The tests for other kinds of symmetry presented in the paper rely on some aid from a quantum prover.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Quantum proofs of proximity</strong>, by Marcel Dall’Agnol, Tom Gur, Subhayan Roy Moulik, Justin Thaler (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/068/">ECCC</a>) The sublinear time (quantum) computation model has been gathering momentum steadily over the past several years. This paper seeks to understand the power of \({\sf QMA}\) proofs of proximity for property testing (recall \({\sf QMA}\) is the quantum analogue of \({\sf NP}\)). On the algorithmic front, the paper develops sufficient conditions for properties to admit efficient \({\sf QMA}\) proofs of proximity. On the complexity front, the paper demonstrates a property which admits  an efficient \({\sf QMA}\) proof but does not admit a \({\sf MA}\) or an interactive proof of proximity.</p></div>

<p>I now have a feature article up at <em>Quanta</em> magazine, entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-quantum-computing-so-hard-to-explain-20210608/">“What Makes Quantum Computing So Hard To Explain?”</a>  I.e., why do journalists, investors, etc. so consistently get central points wrong, even after the subject has been in public consciousness for more than 25 years?  Perhaps unsurprisingly, I found it hard to discuss that meta-level question, as <em>Quanta</em>‘s editors asked me to do, without also engaging in the object-level task of actually explaining QC.  For regular <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers, there will be nothing new here, but I’m happy with how the piece turned out.</p>



<p>Accompanying the <em>Quanta</em> piece is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHoEjvuPoB8&amp;t=6s">10-minute YouTube explainer on quantum computing</a>, which (besides snazzy graphics) features interviews with me, John Preskill, and Dorit Aharonov.</p>



<p>On a different note, my colleague <a href="https://www.markwilde.com/">Mark Wilde</a> has recorded a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mark-m-wilde/quantum-computer">punk-rock song about BosonSampling</a>.  I can honestly report that it’s some of the finest boson-themed music I’ve heard in years.  It includes the following lyrics:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Quantum computer, Ain’t no loser<br />Quantum computer, Quantum computer</p><p>People out on the streets<br />They don’t know what it is<br />They think it finds the cliques<br />Or finds graph colorings<br />But it don’t solve anything<br />Said it don’t solve anything<br />Bosonic slot machine<br />My lil’ photonic dream</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking of BosonSampling, A. S. Popova and A. N. Rubtsov, of the Skolkovo Institute in Moscow, have a new preprint entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01445">Cracking the Quantum Advantage threshold for Gaussian Boson Sampling</a>.  In it, they claim to give an efficient classical algorithm to simulate noisy GBS experiments, like the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5159">one six months ago</a> from USTC in China.  I’m still unsure how well this scales from 30-40 photons up to 50-70 photons; which imperfections of the USTC experiment are primarily being taken advantage of (photon losses?); and how this relates to the earlier proposed classical algorithms for simulating noisy BosonSampling, like the one by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3093">Kalai and Kindler</a>.  Anyone with any insight is welcome to share!</p>



<p>OK, one last announcement: the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, in Berkeley, has a new online lecture series called <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/institute-launches-breakthroughs-lecture-series">“Breakthroughs,”</a> which many readers of this blog might want to check out.</p></div>

We give a direct product theorem for the entanglement-assisted interactive quantum communication complexity of an $l$-player predicate $V$. In particular we show that for a distribution $p$ that is product across the input sets of the $l$ players, the success probability of any entanglement-assisted quantum communication protocol for computing $n$ copies of $V$, whose communication is $o(\log(\mathrm{eff}^*(V,p))\cdot n)$, goes down exponentially in $n$. Here $\mathrm{eff}^*(V, p)$ is a distributional version of the quantum efficiency or partition bound introduced by Laplante, Lerays and Roland (2014), which is a lower bound on the distributional quantum communication complexity of computing a single copy of $V$ with respect to $p$.
  As an application of our result, we show that it is possible to do device-independent quantum key distribution (DIQKD) without the assumption that devices do not leak any information after inputs are provided to them. We analyze the DIQKD protocol given by Jain, Miller and Shi (2017), and show that when the protocol is carried out with devices that are compatible with $n$ copies of the Magic Square game, it is possible to extract $\Omega(n)$ bits of key from it, even in the presence of $O(n)$ bits of leakage. Our security proof is parallel, i.e., the honest parties can enter all their inputs into their devices at once, and works for a leakage model that is arbitrarily interactive, i.e., the devices of the honest parties Alice and Bob can exchange information with each other and with the eavesdropper Eve in any number of rounds, as long as the total number of bits or qubits communicated is bounded.</div>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, in collaboration with Microsoft Research, we introduce
3DB: an extendable, unified framework for debugging and analyzing vision models
using photorealistic simulation. We’re releasing 3DB as a package, accompanied
by extensive API documentation, guides, and demos.</i></p>

<p>Identifying failure modes and biases in vision models is a rapidly
emerging challenge in machine learning. In high-stakes
applications, simply deploying models and collecting failures that arise in
the wild is often difficult, expensive, and irresponsible. To this end, a
recent line of work in vision focuses on identifying model failure
modes via in-depth analyses of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02779">image transformations</a> and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261">corruptions</a>, <a href="https://objectnet.dev">object orientations</a>,
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">backgrounds</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">shape-texture conflicts</a>. These studies 
(and other similarly important ones) reveal a variety of patterns of
performance degradation in vision models. Still, performing each such study
requires time, developing (often complex)
toolingFor <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">our study of image backgrounds</a>, for example, we used a
combination of bounding boxes and classical computer vision tools to crop out
image backgrounds. We then had to manually filter out the images for which
the tools failed. Even for the images where the toolkit succeeded, there
remained inevitable cropping artifacts., and a willingness to settle for less than perfect simulations of each
potential failure mode. Our question is: can we support reliable discovery of model failures in a systematic,
automated, and unified way?</p>

<div style="margin-top: 0;" class="caption">
A sampling of the analyses enabled by 3DB.
</div>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, we try to make progress on this question and propose
3DB, a platform for automatically identifying and analyzing the failure modes
of computer vision models using 3D rendering. 3DB aims to allow users to go
from a testable, robustness-based hypothesis to concrete, photorealistic
experimental evidence with minimal time and effort.</p>

<p>The platform revolves around the modular workflow pictured below. First,
users specify a set of 3D objects and environments, as well as a set of 3D
(or 2D) transformations called controls that determine the space of
admissible object-environment configurations. 3DB then renders a myriad of
admissible scenes and feeds them through the user’s computer vision model of
choice. The user can finally stratify, aggregate, or otherwise analyze the
results either by reading the outputted JSON, or through the pre-packaged
dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/workflow.png" alt="An illustration of the 3DB workflow." class="bigimg" /></p>

<p>3DB easily adapts to a variety of use cases: in particular, users can
modify and swap out any part of this pipeline (e.g., the renderer, the
logger, the model type, or the controls) for their own custom-written
components, without needing to modify any of the 3DB codebase. We’ve compiled <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/">guides</a>,
extensive <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/api_doc.html">API documentation</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/3db/demo">full demo</a> showing how 3DB streamlines model debugging.</p>

<p><strong>In fact, this blog post will double as another demo! We’ll present the (short) code
necessary to reproduce every plot in the post below using 3DB. You can download 
the aggregated code for this blog post <a href="https://github.com/3db/blog_demo">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="using-3db">Using 3DB</h2>

<p>Prior works have already used 3D rendering (to great effect) to study biases
of machine learning models, including pose and context-based biases. Our goal
is not to propose a specific 3D-rendering based analysis, but
rather to provide an easy-to-use, highly extendable framework that unifies
prior analyses (both 3D and 2D) while enabling users to (a) conduct a host of
new analyses with the same ease and with realistic results; and (b)
effortlessly <em>compose</em> different factors of variation to understand their
interplay.</p>

<p>We’ll dedicate the rest of this post to illustrating how one
might actually use 3DB in practice, focusing on a single example 3D
model3DB works with any 3D model, and we refer the reader to 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">our paper</a> for more examples and details.:</p>

<p>In what follows, we will walk through example applications of 3DB to discover biases of
ML models (some previously documented, others not). For the sake of brevity,
we’ll highlight just a few of these (re-)discoveries—to see more, check out
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">paper</a>. We’ll then demonstrate that the discoveries of 3DB
transfer pretty reliably to the real world!</p>

<p>Our experiments will all operate on an ImageNet-pretrained
ResNet-18The classifier has a ~70% validation-set
accuracy. that has 42% accuracy on images from the
“coffee mug” ImageNet subclass. While we only study classification in this blog post,
3DB also supports object detection and can be easily extended to support other
image-based tasks, such as semantic segmentation, too.</p>

<h2 id="image-background-sensitivity">Image Background Sensitivity</h2>

<p>In one of our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">previous posts</a>,
we continued a long line of prior work (see, e.g.,
<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00171412/file/ZhangMarszalekLazebnikSchmid-IJCV07-ClassificationStudy.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731">here</a>, etc.) showing that models can be
over-reliant on image backgrounds, and demonstrated that they are easily
broken by adversarially chosen backgrounds. To accomplish this, our prior
analysis used classical computer vision tools to separate foregrounds from
backgrounds, then pasted foregrounds from one image onto backgrounds from
another. This process was slow and required extensive quality control to
ensure that backgrounds and foregrounds were being extracted properly—and
even when they were, a few artifacts remained:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;">
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/1.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;" />
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/2.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;" />

</div>

<p>3DB lets us reproduce these findings effortlessly and without introducing
such artifacts. To demonstrate this, we use 3DB to render our mug 3D model on
hundreds of HDRI backgrounds, resulting in images such as:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden;">
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/background-renders/1.png" style="float: right; width: 20%;" />

</div>

<p>We then analyze the performance of a pretrained ResNet-18Recall that this model
obtains 42% accuracy on the corresponding "coffee mug" ImageNet class subset.on these images. We
find that the performance of the classifier varies significantly across
backgrounds, and that accuracy correlates with a crude measure of
“background simplicity” (the JPEG compressed size of the image—with smaller size corresponding to being more simple).</p>

<p><strong>A note on compositionality</strong>: An important part of 3DB that we don’t discuss here is compositionality, i.e., the ability to put together multiple controls and study their joint effect. For example, in our paper we studied how a model’s prediction vary with various zoom levels and backgrounds of an object. We found that the optimal zoom level varies a lot by background.</p>

<h2 id="texture-bias">Texture Bias</h2>
<p>Another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">recent study</a> of neural network biases showed that in
contrast to humans, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely more on texture
to recognize objects than on shape. The example below typifies this
phenomenon—a cat with an elephant texture is recognized as a cat by humans,
but as an elephant by CNNs:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/cue_conflict.png" alt="Cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al." /></p>
<div class="caption">
An example of the cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al. Combining the
elephant texture with the cat shape results in a mixed image on which CNNs
consistently predict with the texture signal.
</div>

<p>This example and others like it (dubbed ‘cue-conflict’ images) provide a
striking illustration of the contrast between human and CNN-based
classification mechanisms. Still, just as in the case of image backgrounds,
creating such images typically necessitates time, technical skill,
quality control, and/or introduction of unwanted artifacts (for example, in the above figure,
ideally we would modify only the texture of the cat without altering the background).</p>

<p>However, using 3DB we can easily collect photorealistic empirical evidence of
texture bias. Without modifying the internal 3DB codebase at all,
one can write a <a href="https://github.com/3db/3db/blob/main/threedb/controls/blender/material.py">custom control</a> that modifies the texture of
objects in the scene while keeping the rest intact. With this custom control
in placeIn fact, the texture-swapping control for this experiment is now 
pre-packaged with 3DB, since we already wrote it ourselves!, one can simply 
randomize the texture of the mug across various
backgrounds, poses and camera parameters before stratifying results:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/texture_swap_histograms.png" alt="Chungus" /></p>

<p>The performance of the pretrained model on mugs (and other objects)
deteriorates severely upon replacing the mug’s texture with a “wrong” one,
providing clear corroborating evidence of the texture bias! We noticed in our
experiments that for some textures (e.g., zebra), the coffee mug was
consistently misclassified as the corresponding animal, whereas for others
(e.g., crocodile), the mug is misclassified as either a related class (e.g.,
turtle or other reptile), or as an unrelated object (e.g., a trash can).</p>

<h2 id="part-of-object-attribution">Part-of-Object Attribution</h2>

<p>Beyond general hypotheses about model biases, 3DB allows us to test vision
systems on a more fine-grained level. In the case of our running mug example,
for instance, we can use the platform to understand which specific parts of
its 3D mesh correlate with classifier accuracy. Specifically, below we
generate (and classify) scenes with random mug positions, rotations, and
backgrounds. Since 3DB stores texture-coordinate information for each
rendering, we can reconstruct a three-dimensional heatmap that encodes, for
each point on the surface of the mug, the classifier’s accuracy conditioned
on that point being visible:</p>

<p>Now that we have hypotheses regarding model performance, we can test them! Inspecting
the ImageNet validation set, we found that our classifier indeed (a) struggles on coffee mugs when the
handle is not showing (providing a feasible explanation for (1), since the side
opposite the handle is only visible when the handle itself isn’t), and (b)
performs worse at higher camera angles (providing a plausible explanation for
(2)). We want to focus, however, on the third phenomenon,
i.e., that the classifier performs quite poorly whenever the inside of the
mug is visible. Why could this be the case? We can use 3DB to gain insight into the
phenomenon. Specifically, we want to test the following hypothesis: when
classifying mugs, does our ImageNet model rely on the exact liquid inside the
cup?</p>

<p>We investigate this hypothesis by writing a custom control that fills
our mug with various liquids (more precisely, a parameterized mixture of
water, milk, and coffee):</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_samples.png" alt="Examples of the mugs rendered in this experiment" /></p>
<div class="caption">
Our running example mug, filled with different parameterized liquids: 100% water
(top left), 100% coffee (top right), 100% milk (bottom right), and a coffee-milk
mixture (bottom left)
</div>

<p>In contrast to the last experiment (where we varied the orientation of the
mug), we render scenes containing the mug in a fixed set of poses that reveal
the contents—just as in the last experiment, however, we still vary
background and mug location. We visualize the results below—each cell in
the heatmap corresponds to a fixed mixture of coffee, water, and milk (i.e.,
the labeled corners are 100% coffee, 100% milk, and 100% water, and the other
cells are linear interpolations of these ratios) and the color of the cell
encodes the relative accuracy of the classifier when the mug is filled with
that liquid:</p>



<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_simplex.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="caption">
Measuring the relative effect of the liquid mixture in the mug on model
predictions. Each cell represents a specific liquid mixture, and the color of
the cell represents the tendency of the model (averaged over random viewpoints
and relative to the other cells) to predict "cup"/"pill bottle," "bucket," or
"mug."
</div>

<p>It turns out that mug content indeed highly impacts classification:
our model is much less likely to correctly classify a mug that doesn’t contain coffee!
This is just one example of how 3DB can help in proving or disproving hypotheses
about model behavior.</p>

<h2 id="from-simulation-to-reality">From Simulation to Reality</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve used 3DB to discover ML models’ various failure modes and biases
via photorealistic rendering. To what extent though do the insights
gleaned from simulated 3DB experiments actually “transfer” to the physical
world?</p>

<p>To test such transferability, we began by creating a 3D model of a physical room we
had access to. We also collected eight different 3D models with closely matching
physical world counterparts—including the mug analyzed above. Next, we used 3DB to find correctly and incorrectly classified
configurations (pose, orientation, location) of these eight objects inside that
room. Finally, we replicated these poses (to
the best of our abilities) in the physical room, and took photos with a
cellphone camera:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/real_life_exp_samples.png" alt="Samples from our physical-world experiment." class="bigimg" /></p>

<div class="caption">
Examples of simulated scenes (top) and their re-created counterparts (bottom)
from our physical-world experiment.
</div>

<p>We classified these photos with the same vision model as before and measured
how often the simulated classifier correctness matched correctness on the
real photographs. We observed an ~85% match! So the failure
modes identified by 3DB are not merely simulation artifacts, and can indeed arise in
the real world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>3DB is a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensible framework for
identifying model failure modes, uncovering biases, and testing fine-grained
hypotheses about model behavior. We hope it will prove to be a useful tool
for debugging vision models.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-object-detection-web-dashboard-and-more">Bonus: Object Detection, Web Dashboard, and more!</h2>

<p>We’ll wrap up by highlighting some additional capabilities of 3DB that we didn’t
get to demonstrate in this blog post:</p>

<h3 id="3dboard-a-web-interface-for-exploring-results">3DBoard: a web interface for exploring results</h3>

<p>In all of the code examples above, we showed how to analyze the results of a 3DB
experiment by loading the output into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code> dataframe. For additional
convenience, however, 3DB also comes with a web-based dashboard for exploring
experimental results. The following command suffices to visualize the texture swaps experiment from earlier:</p>

<pre style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"><code class="bash">

<h3 id="object-detection-and-other-tasks">Object detection and other tasks</h3>

<p>In this blog post, we focused on using 3DB to analyze image classification
models. However, the library also supports object detection out-of-the-box, and
can easily be extended to support a variety of image-based tasks (e.g.,
segmentation or regression-based tasks). For example, below we provide a simple
end-to-end object detection example:</p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, in collaboration with Microsoft Research, we introduce
3DB: an extendable, unified framework for debugging and analyzing vision models
using photorealistic simulation. We’re releasing 3DB as a package, accompanied
by extensive API documentation, guides, and demos.</i></p>

<p><em>Note: this post contains some interactive plots and 3D models that use

<p>Identifying failure modes and biases in vision models is a rapidly
emerging challenge in machine learning. In high-stakes
applications, simply deploying models and collecting failures that arise in
the wild is often difficult, expensive, and irresponsible. To this end, a
recent line of work in vision focuses on identifying model failure
modes via in-depth analyses of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02779">image transformations</a> and 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12261">corruptions</a>, <a href="https://objectnet.dev">object orientations</a>,
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">backgrounds</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">shape-texture conflicts</a>. These studies 
(and other similarly important ones) reveal a variety of patterns of
performance degradation in vision models. Still, performing each such study
requires time, developing (often complex)
toolingFor <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">our study of image backgrounds</a>, for example, we used a
combination of bounding boxes and classical computer vision tools to crop out
image backgrounds. We then had to manually filter out the images for which
the tools failed. Even for the images where the toolkit succeeded, there
remained inevitable cropping artifacts., and a willingness to settle for less than perfect simulations of each
potential failure mode. Our question is: can we support reliable discovery of model failures in a systematic,
automated, and unified way?</p>

<h2 id="3db-a-rendering-based-debugging-platform">3DB: A Rendering-based Debugging Platform</h2>

A sampling of the analyses enabled by 3DB.
</div>

<p>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">latest paper</a>, we try to make progress on this question and propose
3DB, a platform for automatically identifying and analyzing the failure modes
of computer vision models using 3D rendering. 3DB aims to allow users to go
from a testable, robustness-based hypothesis to concrete, photorealistic
experimental evidence with minimal time and effort.</p>

<p>The platform revolves around the modular workflow pictured below. First,
users specify a set of 3D objects and environments, as well as a set of 3D
(or 2D) transformations called controls that determine the space of
admissible object-environment configurations. 3DB then renders a myriad of
admissible scenes and feeds them through the user’s computer vision model of
choice. The user can finally stratify, aggregate, or otherwise analyze the
results either by reading the outputted JSON, or through the pre-packaged
dashboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/workflow.png" alt="An illustration of the 3DB workflow." class="bigimg" /></p>

<p>3DB easily adapts to a variety of use cases: in particular, users can
modify and swap out any part of this pipeline (e.g., the renderer, the
logger, the model type, or the controls) for their own custom-written
components, without needing to modify any of the 3DB codebase. We’ve compiled <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/">guides</a>,
extensive <a href="https://3db.github.io/3db/api_doc.html">API documentation</a>, and a
<a href="https://github.com/3db/demo">full demo</a> showing how 3DB streamlines model debugging.</p>

<h2 id="using-3db">Using 3DB</h2>

<p>Prior works have already used 3D rendering (to great effect) to study biases
of machine learning models, including pose and context-based biases. Our goal
is not to propose a specific 3D-rendering based analysis, but
rather to provide an easy-to-use, highly extendable framework that unifies
prior analyses (both 3D and 2D) while enabling users to (a) conduct a host of
new analyses with the same ease and with realistic results; and (b)
effortlessly <em>compose</em> different factors of variation to understand their
interplay.</p>

<p>We’ll dedicate the rest of this post to illustrating how one
might actually use 3DB in practice, focusing on a single example 3D
model3DB works with any 3D model, and we refer the reader to 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">our paper</a> for more examples and details.:</p>





<div style="text-align: center;" id="mug-blocker">
    
        
            
        
        
    
</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px;" class="caption">
    The 3D mug model that we'll be using throughout this post. <strong>
    Click to <a id="mug-interact">enable 
    interactivity</a>.</strong>
</div>

<p>In what follows, we will walk through example applications of 3DB to discover biases of
ML models (some previously documented, others not). For the sake of brevity,
we’ll highlight just a few of these (re-)discoveries—to see more, check out
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805">paper</a>. We’ll then demonstrate that the discoveries of 3DB
transfer pretty reliably to the real world!</p>

<p>Our experiments will all operate on an ImageNet-pretrained
ResNet-18The classifier has a ~70% validation-set
accuracy. that has 42% accuracy on images from the
“coffee mug” ImageNet subclass. While we only study classification in this blog post,
3DB also supports object detection and can be easily extended to support other
image-based tasks, such as semantic segmentation, too.</p>

<h2 id="image-background-sensitivity">Image Background Sensitivity</h2>

<p>In one of our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/background/">previous posts</a>,
we continued a long line of prior work (see, e.g.,
<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00171412/file/ZhangMarszalekLazebnikSchmid-IJCV07-ClassificationStudy.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06596">here</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08731">here</a>, etc.) showing that models can be
over-reliant on image backgrounds, and demonstrated that they are easily
broken by adversarially chosen backgrounds. To accomplish this, our prior
analysis used classical computer vision tools to separate foregrounds from
backgrounds, then pasted foregrounds from one image onto backgrounds from
another. This process was slow and required extensive quality control to
ensure that backgrounds and foregrounds were being extracted properly—and
even when they were, a few artifacts remained:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden; text-align: center;">
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/1.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;" />
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/2.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;" />

        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/backgrounds-manual/6.JPEG" style="width: 15%; margin: 2px; display: inline;" />
    
</div>

<p>3DB lets us reproduce these findings effortlessly and without introducing
such artifacts. To demonstrate this, we use 3DB to render our mug 3D model on
hundreds of HDRI backgrounds, resulting in images such as:</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 15px; overflow: hidden;">
    
        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/background-renders/1.png" style="float: right; width: 20%;" />

        <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/background-renders/10.png" style="float: right; width: 20%;" />
    
</div>

<p>We then analyze the performance of a pretrained ResNet-18Recall that this model
obtains 42% accuracy on the corresponding "coffee mug" ImageNet class subset.on these images. We
find that the performance of the classifier varies significantly across
backgrounds, and that accuracy correlates with a crude measure of
“background simplicity” (the JPEG compressed size of the image—with smaller size corresponding to being more simple).</p>

<p><strong>A note on compositionality</strong>: An important part of 3DB that we don’t discuss here is compositionality, i.e., the ability to put together multiple controls and study their joint effect. For example, in our paper we studied how a model’s prediction vary with various zoom levels and backgrounds of an object. We found that the optimal zoom level varies a lot by background.</p>

<h2 id="texture-bias">Texture Bias</h2>
<p>Another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231v2">recent study</a> of neural network biases showed that in
contrast to humans, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely more on texture
to recognize objects than on shape. The example below typifies this
phenomenon—a cat with an elephant texture is recognized as a cat by humans,
but as an elephant by CNNs:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/cue_conflict.png" alt="Cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al." /></p>
<div class="caption">
An example of the cue-conflict images introduced by Geirhos et al. Combining the
elephant texture with the cat shape results in a mixed image on which CNNs
consistently predict with the texture signal.
</div>

<p>This example and others like it (dubbed ‘cue-conflict’ images) provide a
striking illustration of the contrast between human and CNN-based
classification mechanisms. Still, just as in the case of image backgrounds,
creating such images typically necessitates time, technical skill,
quality control, and/or introduction of unwanted artifacts (for example, in the above figure,
ideally we would modify only the texture of the cat without altering the background).</p>

<p>However, using 3DB we can easily collect photorealistic empirical evidence of
texture bias. Without modifying the internal 3DB codebase at all,
one can write a <a href="https://github.com/3db/3db/blob/main/threedb/controls/blender/material.py">custom control</a> that modifies the texture of
objects in the scene while keeping the rest intact. With this custom control
in placeIn fact, the texture-swapping control for this experiment is now 
pre-packaged with 3DB, since we already wrote it ourselves!, one can simply 
randomize the texture of the mug across various
backgrounds, poses and camera parameters before stratifying results:</p>

<p>The performance of the pretrained model on mugs (and other objects)
deteriorates severely upon replacing the mug’s texture with a “wrong” one,
providing clear corroborating evidence of the texture bias! We noticed in our
experiments that for some textures (e.g., zebra), the coffee mug was
consistently misclassified as the corresponding animal, whereas for others
(e.g., crocodile), the mug is misclassified as either a related class (e.g.,
turtle or other reptile), or as an unrelated object (e.g., a trash can).</p>

<h2 id="part-of-object-attribution">Part-of-Object Attribution</h2>

<p>Beyond general hypotheses about model biases, 3DB allows us to test vision
systems on a more fine-grained level. In the case of our running mug example,
for instance, we can use the platform to understand which specific parts of
its 3D mesh correlate with classifier accuracy. Specifically, below we
generate (and classify) scenes with random mug positions, rotations, and
backgrounds. Since 3DB stores texture-coordinate information for each
rendering, we can reconstruct a three-dimensional heatmap that encodes, for
each point on the surface of the mug, the classifier’s accuracy conditioned
on that point being visible:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" id="heatmap-blocker">

<p>Now that we have hypotheses regarding model performance, we can test them! Inspecting
the ImageNet validation set, we found that our classifier indeed (a) struggles on coffee mugs when the
handle is not showing (providing a feasible explanation for (1), since the side
opposite the handle is only visible when the handle itself isn’t), and (b)
performs worse at higher camera angles (providing a plausible explanation for
(2)). We want to focus, however, on the third phenomenon,
i.e., that the classifier performs quite poorly whenever the inside of the
mug is visible. Why could this be the case? We can use 3DB to gain insight into the
phenomenon. Specifically, we want to test the following hypothesis: when
classifying mugs, does our ImageNet model rely on the exact liquid inside the
cup?</p>

<p>We investigate this hypothesis by writing a custom control that fills
our mug with various liquids (more precisely, a parameterized mixture of
water, milk, and coffee):</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_samples.png" alt="Examples of the mugs rendered in this experiment" /></p>
<div class="caption">
Our running example mug, filled with different parameterized liquids: 100% water
(top left), 100% coffee (top right), 100% milk (bottom right), and a coffee-milk
mixture (bottom left)
</div>

<p>In contrast to the last experiment (where we varied the orientation of the
mug), we render scenes containing the mug in a fixed set of poses that reveal
the contents—just as in the last experiment, however, we still vary
background and mug location. We visualize the results below—each cell in
the heatmap corresponds to a fixed mixture of coffee, water, and milk (i.e.,
the labeled corners are 100% coffee, 100% milk, and 100% water, and the other
cells are linear interpolations of these ratios) and the color of the cell
encodes the relative accuracy of the classifier when the mug is filled with
that liquid:</p>



<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/mug_liquid_experiment_simplex.png" alt="" /></p>

<div class="caption">
Measuring the relative effect of the liquid mixture in the mug on model
predictions. Each cell represents a specific liquid mixture, and the color of
the cell represents the tendency of the model (averaged over random viewpoints
and relative to the other cells) to predict "cup"/"pill bottle," "bucket," or
"mug."
</div>

<p>It turns out that mug content indeed highly impacts classification:
our model is much less likely to correctly classify a mug that doesn’t contain coffee!
This is just one example of how 3DB can help in proving or disproving hypotheses
about model behavior.</p>

<h2 id="from-simulation-to-reality">From Simulation to Reality</h2>

<p>So far, we’ve used 3DB to discover ML models’ various failure modes and biases
via photorealistic rendering. To what extent though do the insights
gleaned from simulated 3DB experiments actually “transfer” to the physical
world?</p>

<p>To test such transferability, we began by creating a 3D model of a physical room we
had access to. We also collected eight different 3D models with closely matching
physical world counterparts—including the mug analyzed above. Next, we used 3DB to find correctly and incorrectly classified
configurations (pose, orientation, location) of these eight objects inside that
room. Finally, we replicated these poses (to
the best of our abilities) in the physical room, and took photos with a
cellphone camera:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/real_life_exp_samples.png" alt="Samples from our physical-world experiment." class="bigimg" /></p>

<div class="caption">
Examples of simulated scenes (top) and their re-created counterparts (bottom)
from our physical-world experiment.
</div>

<p>We classified these photos with the same vision model as before and measured
how often the simulated classifier correctness matched correctness on the
real photographs. We observed an ~85% match! So the failure
modes identified by 3DB are not merely simulation artifacts, and can indeed arise in
the real world.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>3DB is a flexible, easy-to-use, and extensible framework for
identifying model failure modes, uncovering biases, and testing fine-grained
hypotheses about model behavior. We hope it will prove to be a useful tool
for debugging vision models.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-object-detection-web-dashboard-and-more">Bonus: Object Detection, Web Dashboard, and more!</h2>

<p>We’ll wrap up by highlighting some additional capabilities of 3DB that we didn’t
get to demonstrate in this blog post:</p>

<h3 id="3dboard-a-web-interface-for-exploring-results">3DBoard: a web interface for exploring results</h3>

<p>In all of the code examples above, we showed how to analyze the results of a 3DB
experiment by loading the output into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code> dataframe. For additional
convenience, however, 3DB also comes with a web-based dashboard for exploring
experimental results. The following command suffices to visualize the texture swaps experiment from earlier:</p>

<pre style="padding: 0; margin: 0;"><code class="bash">
python -m threedboard results_texture/ --port 3000

</code>
</pre>

<p>Navigating to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YOUR_IP:3000</code> should lead you to a page that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/3db/dashboard_screenshot.png" alt="Dashboard screenshot" /></p>

<h3 id="object-detection-and-other-tasks">Object detection and other tasks</h3>

<p>In this blog post, we focused on using 3DB to analyze image classification
models. However, the library also supports object detection out-of-the-box, and
can easily be extended to support a variety of image-based tasks (e.g.,
segmentation or regression-based tasks). For example, below we provide a simple
end-to-end object detection example:</p>

Consider the basic data-structure problem of storing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> bits of data <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x\in \{0,1\}^{m}" class="latex" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%2Br&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m+r" class="latex" /> bits so that the <em>prefix-sum queries</em></p>
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D+%5Cmathbb+%7B%5Ctext+%7B%5Ctextsc+%7BRank%7D%7D%7D%28i%29%3A%3D%5Csum+_%7Bj%5Cle+i%7Dx_%7Bj%7D+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned} \mathbb {\text {\textsc {Rank}}}(i):=\sum _{j\le i}x_{j} \end{aligned}" class="latex" /></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   can be computed by probing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> <em>cells</em> (or <em>words</em>) of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w" class="latex" /> bits each. (You can think <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D%5Clog+m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="w=\log m" class="latex" /> throughout this post.) The paper <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> with Pǎtraşcu shows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%5Cge+m%2Fw%5E%7BO%28q%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r\ge m/w^{O(q)}" class="latex" />, and this was recently shown to be tight by Yu <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/conf/stoc/Yu19">Yu19</a>]</span> (building on the breakthrough data structure <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascu08Succincter">Pǎt08</a>]</span> which motivated the lower bound and is not far from it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   As is common in data-structure lower bounds, the proof in <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> is an <em>encoding argument</em>. In the recently posted paper, an alternative proof is presented which avoids the encoding argument and is perhaps more in line with other proofs in complexity lower bounds. Of course, <em>everything</em> is an encoding argument, and <em>nothing </em>is an encoding argument, and this post won’t draw a line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   The new proof establishes an <em>intrinsic property</em> of efficient data structures, whereas typical proofs including <span class="cite">[<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/feed/#XPatrascuV10">PV10</a>]</span> are somewhat tailored to the problem at hand. The property is called the <em>separator</em> and is a main technical contribution of the work. At the high level the separator shows that in any efficient data structure you can restrict the input space a little so that many queries are nearly <em>pairwise independent</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Also, the new proof rules out a stronger object: a <em>sampler</em> (<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2014/11/09/is-nature-a-low-complexity-sampler/">see previous post here</a> on sampling lower bounds). Specifically, the distribution Rank<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28U%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(U)" class="latex" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="U" class="latex" /> is the uniform distribution cannot be sampled, not even slightly close, by an efficient cell-probe algorithm. This implies the data-structure result, and it can be informally interpreted as saying that the “reason” why the lower bound holds is not that the data is compressed, but rather that one can’t generate the type of dependencies occurring in Rank via an efficient cell-probe algorithm, regardless of what the input is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   Building on this machinery, one can prove several results about sampling, like showing that cell-probe samplers are strictly weaker than AC0 samplers. While doing this, it occurred to me that one gets a corollary for data structures which I had not seen in the literature. The corollary is a <em>probe hierarchy</em>, showing that some problem can be solved with zero redundancy (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3D0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r=0" class="latex" />) with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28q%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(q)" class="latex" /> probes, while it requires almost linear <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> probes. For example I don’t know of a result yielding this for small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="q" class="latex" /> such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%3DO%281%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="q=O(1)" class="latex" />; I would appreciate a reference. (As mentioned in the                                                                                                                                                        paper, the sampling viewpoint is not essential and just like for Rank one can prove the data-structure corollaries directly. Personally, and obviously, I find the sampling viewpoint useful.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">   One of my favorite open problems in the area still is: can a uniform distribution over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bm%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[m]" class="latex" /> be approximately sampled by an efficient cell-probe algorithm? I can’t even rule out samplers making <em>two </em>probes!</p>

Mary Kay Farley, my dear wife’s mom, and Dorothy Lipton, my mom, have unfortunately both passed away. Kathryn and I miss them greatly. Both women shared keen mathematical skills, a fascination with the game of baseball and a commitment to living a well-ordered life.  </p>
<p>
Today is <b>not</b> Mother’s Day. We still hope all mothers everywhere are enjoying their day.</p>
<p>
We will take this time to thank all of you out there. We missed doing so last month, but the pandemic has distended time anyway. What we are hearing now are stories of mothers and children and grandchildren finally being able to think of seeing each other in person rather than via video.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Another Kind of Parentage </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This has blended with musings on our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/26/congrats-avi-and-laci-on-the-abel-prize/">post</a> in which I (Dick) noted that Dorit Aharonov is an academic grandchild of mine, in that Avi Wigderson co-supervised her doctoral thesis and I supervised Avi’s. </p>
<p>
Years ago we featured on Father’s Day a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/06/19/who's-your-doktorvater/">post</a> with the title “Who’s Your <em>Doktorvater</em>?”—which was a play on the <a href="https://bosoxinjection.com/2014/09/24/ten-years-gone-pedro-martinez-calls-yankees-daddy/">expression</a> “who’s your daddy?” Now it is high time to note that there are many “doctor mothers”—as Dorit has herself <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=102209">become</a>. </p>
<p>
One difference from human genealogy is that most often there is only one “doctor parent.” My <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=86340&amp;fChrono=1">advisor</a>, David Parnas, has two: Alan Perlis and Everard Williams. From Perlis it is a straight shot back to Siméon Poisson, whose 1800 dissertation was co-advised by Joseph Lagrange and Pierre Laplace. For Lagrange there is a strange <a href="https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=17864">note</a> of Leonhard Euler as a virtual advisor, but the real one is Giovanni Beccaria—who has no listed parent. Going through Laplace also dead-ends. But selecting Euler includes a chain that ends in the 1100s with Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharaf_al-Din_al-Tusi#Mathematics">improved</a> the complexity of approximately solving cubic equations.</p>
<p>
I appear not to have any female ancestors in my doctoral genealogy. I have two female PhD graduates, one of whom is a <em>Doktormutter</em>. Ken’s first female doctoral student, co-advised, had a successful thesis defense last week; he has another nearing the ABD stage. But I have known quite a few other “doctor mothers” personally. Today, Ken and I thought to recognize them.</p>
<p>

Here are some that I have had the honor to know. They are in a certain order—do you see what it is? I give only the surname on purpose—click the second name and note its URL for a singular reflection of this.</p>

The last gives us an all-female tree, not just one branch, of people we know.

<p>
There are others I could mention who went into research labs where there are different relationships besides PhD advising. They include Irene Greif, Tal Rabin, Lynn Conway, and Jean Sammet. I could include Jamie Morgenstern, whom we recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/10/making-algorithms-fair/">featured</a> and who his <a href="https://jamiemorgenstern.com/">advising</a> her first students at the University of Washington—do they have to be “born” yet to count you as a <em>Doktormutter</em>? I’ve left others out—apologies for that—but the ones I’ve listed make a nice <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4+%5Ctimes+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{4 \times 4}" class="latex" /> collage:</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My Upbringing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Of these, the one with the most formative impact on me was Helena Rasiowa. I learned advanced logic from her when I was an undergraduate. </p>
<p>
Here is a tribute to <a href="http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/fitting/bookspapers/pdf/papers/Rasiowa.pdf">her</a> by Melvin Fitting: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I once heard Dana Scott criticize her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Metamathematics-Helena-SIKORSKI-RASIOWA/dp/B005JGKZXW">book</a>, <em>The Mathematics of Metamathematics</em> with Roman Sikorski, because, while it took an algebraic approach to logic, it did not carry the work further and consider set theory. If it had, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_(mathematics)">forcing</a> would have been discovered years earlier than it was. This is not, at heart, a criticism, but a tribute. The building of mathematics always goes on. Foundations, firmly laid, enable later construction, and the foundations laid by that book were powerfully firm. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken also points to logic as a formative influence—though from men at Oxford.  Both of us were attracted to Gödel-type undecidability issues in complexity theory in the early 1980s.  The nexus of logic and algebra has been important to us in different ways, Ken more with finite automata and descriptive complexity.  Courses in logic gave both of us a habit of framing problems along formal lines.</p>

That is not really my rule- the point of this post was to get a discussion going about the issue, which I am happy to say has happened.) </p><p>----------</p><p>There are other issues along these lines: when to include the first name (when there is more than one person with that last name, e.g. Ryan Williams and Virginia  Vassilevska Williams), when to use middle initials (in the rare case where there is someone with the same first and last name- Michael  J. Fox added the J and uses it since there was an actor named Michael Fox.)</p><p>I will soon give a quote from a math paper that amused me, but first some context.  The problem of determining if a poly in n variables over Z has an integer solution is called E(n). By the solution to Hilbert's 10th problem we know that there exists n such that E(n) is undecidable. E(9) is undecidable, but the status of E(8) is unknown (as of May 2021) and has been since the early 1980's. </p><p>Here is the quote (from <a href="http://maths.nju.edu.cn/~zwsun/14z.pdf">here</a>).</p><p><i>Can we replace 9 by a smaller number? It is believed so. In fact, A. Baker, Matiyasevich and J.Robinson  even conjectured that E(3) is undecidable over N.</i></p><p>Note that Baker and Robinson get their first initial but Matiyasevich does not.</p><p>I suspect that they use J. Robinson since there is another mathematician with last name Robinson: Rafael Robinson who was Julia's Robinson's husband (to my younger readers--- there was a time when a women who got married took her husband's last name). There is at least one other Math-Robinson: Robert W Robinson. I do not think he is closely related. </p><p>Baker: I do not know of another mathematician named Baker. I tried Google, but the Bakers  I found were   not in the right time frame. I also kept finding hits to an anecdote about Poincare and a man whose profession was a baker (see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">here</a> though its later in that blog post). However, I suspect there was another mathematician named Baker which is why the author uses the first initial.  Its possible the author did not want to confuse Alan  Baker with Theodore Baker, one of the authors of Baker-Gill-Solovay that showed there were oracles that made P = NP and others that made P NE NP.  But somehow, that just doesn't seem right to me. I suspect there is only one mathematician with last name Matijsavic. </p><p>Thomas Alva Edison named his son Thomas Alva Edison Jr.  This was a bad idea but not for reasons of authorship, see <a href="http://edisontinfoil.com/taejr/edisonjr.htm">here</a>.</p><p><br /></p></div>

The stabilizer rank of a quantum state $\psi$ is the minimal $r$ such that $\left| \psi \right \rangle = \sum_{j=1}^r c_j \left|\varphi_j \right\rangle$ for $c_j \in \mathbb{C}$ and stabilizer states $\varphi_j$. The running time of several classical simulation methods for quantum circuits is determined by the stabilizer rank of the $n$-th tensor power of single-qubit magic states.

We prove a lower bound of $\Omega(n)$ on the stabilizer rank of such states, improving a previous lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ of Bravyi, Smith and Smolin [BSS16]. Further, we prove that for a sufficiently small constant $\delta$, the stabilizer rank of any state which is $\delta$-close to those states is $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound for approximate stabilizer rank.

Our techniques rely on the representation of stabilizer states as quadratic functions over affine subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and we use tools from analysis of boolean functions and complexity theory. The proof of the first result involves a careful analysis of directional derivatives of quadratic polynomials, whereas the proof of the second result uses Razborov-Smolensky low degree polynomial approximations and correlation bounds against the majority function.</div>

Following the paper of Alekhnovich, Ben-Sasson, Razborov, Wigderson \cite{ABRW04} we call a pseudorandom generator $\mathrm{PRG}\colon \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^m$ hard for for a propositional proof system $\mathrm{P}$ if $\mathrm{P}$ cannot efficiently prove the (properly encoded) statement $b \notin \mathrm{Im}(\mathrm{PRG})$ for any string $b \in \{0, 1\}^m$.

In \cite{ABRW04} authors suggested the ``functional encoding'' of considered statement for Nisan--Wigderson generator that allows the introduction of ``local'' extension variables. These extension variables may potentially significantly increase the power of the proof system. In \cite{ABRW04} authors gave a lower bound $\exp\left[\frac{n^2}{m \Omega\left(2^{2^{\Delta}}\right)}\right]$ on the length of Resolution proofs where $\Delta$ is the degree of the dependency graph of the generator. This lower bound meets the barrier for the restriction technique.

In this paper, we introduce a ``heavy width'' measure for Resolution that allows showing a lower bound $\exp\left[\frac{n^2}{m 2^{O(\varepsilon \Delta)}}\right]$ on the length of Resolution proofs of the considered statement for the Nisan--Wigderson generator. This gives an exponential lower bound up to $\Delta := \log^{2 - \delta} n$ (the bigger degree the more extension variables we can use). It is a solution to an open problem from \cite{ABRW04}.</div>

<p>On April 28, 2021, the US Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/process/disclosure-avoidance/2020-das-updates.html">released</a> a new demonstration of its differentially private Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) for the 2020 US Census. The public were given a month to submit feedback before the system is finalized.
This demonstration data and the feedback has generated a lot of discussion, including media coverage on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/19/993247101/for-the-u-s-census-keeping-your-data-anonymous-and-useful-is-a-tricky-balance">National Public Radio</a>, in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/2020-census-differential-privacy-ipums/2021/06/01/6c94b46e-c30d-11eb-93f5-ee9558eecf4b_story.html">the Washington Post</a>, and via <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-census-2020-technology-e701e313e841674be6396321343b7e49">the Associated Press</a>. The DAS is also the subject of an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59728874/state-v-united-states-department-of-commerce/">ongoing lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>The following is a response from experts on differential privacy and cryptography to the <a href="https://alarm-redist.github.io/posts/2021-05-28-census-das/Harvard-DAS-Evaluation.pdf">working paper of Kenny et al.</a> on the impact of the 2020 U.S. Census Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) on redistricting.</p>

<p>This paper makes a <a href="https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2016-06-14.md">common but serious mistake</a>, from which the authors wrongfully conclude the Census Bureau should not modernize its privacy-protection technology.  Not only do the results not support this conclusion, but they instead show the power of the methodology, known as differential privacy, adopted by the Bureau, precisely the opposite of the authors’ erroneous conclusions.</p>

<p>Trust is essential; once destroyed it can be nearly impossible to rebuild, and getting privacy wrong in this Census will have an impact on all future government surveys.  The Census Bureau has shown that their <a href="https://desfontain.es/privacy/index.html">2010 (DAS) does not survive modern privacy threats</a>, and in fact was roughly equivalent to publishing nearly three quarters of the responses.  The Census Bureau’s decision to modernize its Disclosure Avoidance System (DAS) for the 2020 Decennial Census to be differentially private is the correct response to decades of theoretical and empirical work on the privacy risks inherent in releasing large numbers of statistics derived from a dataset.</p>

<p>The importance of the Census, and the reality that no technology competing with differential privacy exists for meeting their confidentiality obligations, makes it very important that the public and policy makers have accurate information. We imagine you will be reporting on this topic in the future.  Others have <a href="https://gerrymander.princeton.edu/DAS-evaluation-Kenny-response">addressed flaws</a> in the paper regarding implications for redistricting; we want to provide you with an understanding of the privacy mistake in the study.</p>

<p>To understand the flaw in the paper’s argument, consider the role of smoking in determining cancer risk.  Statistical study of medical data has taught us that smoking causes cancer.   Armed with this knowledge, if we are told that 40 year old Mr. S is a smoker, we can conclude that he has an elevated cancer risk.  The statistical inference of elevated cancer risk—made before Mr. S was born—did not violate Mr. S’s privacy. To conclude otherwise is to define science to be a privacy attack.  This is the mistake made in the paper.</p>

<p>This is basically what Kenny et al. found.</p>

<p>The authors looked at three different predictors: one built directly from (swapped) 2010 Census data and the other two built using differential privacy applied to (swapped) 2010 Census data, and evaluated all three “on approximately 5.8 million registered voters included in the North Carolina February 2021 voter file.”  What did they find?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our analysis shows that across three main racial and ethnic groups, the predictions based on the [differential privacy based] DAS data appear to be as accurate as those based on the 2010 Census data.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes perfect sense. Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding, or BISG, is a statistical method of building a predictor inferring ethnicity (or race) from name and geography.  Here, name and geography play the role of the information as to whether or not one smokes, and the prediction of ethnicity corresponds to the cancer risk prediction.  The predictor is constructed from census data on the ethnic makeup of individual census blocks and statistical information about the popularity of individual surnames within different ethnic groups.  With such a predictor, moving across the country can change the outcome, as can changing one’s name.  But a BISG prediction is not about the individual, it is about the statistical—population-level—relationship between name, geography, and ethnicity.</p>

<p>The differentially private DAS enabled learning to make statistical inferences about ethnicity from name and geography, without compromising the privacy of any Census respondent, exactly as it was intended to do.  In other words, the paper establishes fitness-for-use of the DAS data for the BISG statistical method!  Because differential privacy permits learning statistical patterns without compromising the privacy of individual members of the dataset, it should not interfere with learning the predictor, which is exactly what the authors found. Returning to our “smoking causes cancer” example, the researchers found that it was just as easy to detect this statistical pattern with a modern disclosure avoidance system in place as it was with the older, less protective system.</p>

<p>The authors’ conclusions –“ the DAS data may not provide universal privacy protection” – are simply not supported by their findings.</p>

<p>They have confused learning that smoking causes cancer—and applying this predictor to an individual smoker—with learning medical details of individual patients in the dataset. Change the input to the predictor—replace “smoker” with “non-smoker” or move across the country, for example—and the prediction changes.</p>

<p>The BISG prediction is not about the individual, it does not accompany her as she relocates from one neighborhood to another, it is a statistical relationship between name, geography, and ethnicity.  It is not a privacy compromise, it is science.</p>
