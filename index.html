We show that Cutting Planes (CP) proofs are hard to find: Given an unsatisfiable formula $F$,

(1) it is NP-hard to find a CP refutation of $F$ in time polynomial in the length of the shortest such refutation; and

(2) unless Gap-Hitting-Set admits a nontrivial algorithm, one cannot find a tree-like CP refutation of $F$ in time polynomial in the length of the shortest such refutation.

The first result extends the recent breakthrough of Atserias and Muller (FOCS 2019) that established an analogous result for Resolution. Our proofs rely on two new lifting theorems: (1) Dag-like lifting for gadgets with many output bits. (2) Tree-like lifting that simulates an $r$-round protocol with gadgets of query complexity $O(\log r)$ independent of input length.</div>

<div class="content">
Lifting theorems are a generic way to lift lower bounds in query complexity to lower bounds in communication complexity, with applications in diverse areas, such as combinatorial optimization, proof complexity, game theory. Lifting theorems rely on a gadget, where smaller gadgets give stronger lower bounds. However, existing proof techniques are known to require somewhat large gadgets.

We focus on one of the most widely used gadgets, the index gadget. For this gadget, existing lifting techniques are known to require at least a quadratic gadget size. We develop a new approach to prove lifting theorems for the indexing gadget, based on a novel connection to the recently developed robust sunflower lemmas. We show that this allows to reduce the gadget size to linear. We conjecture that it can be further improved to poly logarithmic, similar to the known bounds for the corresponding robust sunflower lemmas.</div>

We consider codes for space bounded channels. This is a model for communication under noise that was introduced by Guruswami and Smith (J. ACM 2016) and lies between the Shannon (random) and Hamming (adversarial) models. In this model, a channel is a space bounded procedure that reads the codeword in one pass, and modifies at most a $p$ fraction of the bits of the codeword.

Explicit uniquely decodable codes for space bounded channels: Our main result is that for every $0 \le p \le \frac{1}{4}$, there exists a constant $\delta\ge 0$ and a \emph{uniquely decodable} code that is \emph{explicit} (meaning that encoding and decoding are in poly-time) and has rate $1-H(p)$ for channels with space $n^{\delta}$.

This improves upon previous explicit codes by Guruswami and Smith, and Kopparty, Shaltiel and Silbak (FOCS 2019). Specifically, we obtain the same space and rate as earlier works, even though prior work gave only list-decodable codes (rather than uniquely decodable codes).

Complete characterization of the capacity of space bounded channels: Together with a result by Guruswami and Smith showing the impossibility of unique decoding for $p \ge \frac{1}{4}$, our techniques also give a complete characterization of the capacity $R(p)$ of space $n^{1-o(1)}$ channels, specifically: $R(p)=1-H(p)$ for $0 \le p \le 1/4$ and $R(p)=0$ for $p \ge 1/4$.

In particular, $R(\cdot)$ is not continuous at $p=1/4$. This capacity is strictly larger than the capacity of Hamming channels for every $0 \le p \le \frac{1}{4}$, and matches the capacity of list decoding, and binary symmetric channels in this range.


Our results are incomparable to recent work on casual channels. Casual channels are stronger channels in which the channel reads the codeword in one pass, but there is no space restriction. The best known codes for casual channels, due to Chen, Jaggi and Langberg (STOC 2015), are shown to exist by the probabilistic method, and no explicit codes are known. Furthermore, our results imply that for $p\ge p_0 \approx 0.0804$, there is a separation between the capacities of space bounded channels and casual channels, and the capacity of the former is strictly larger than that of the latter.


Our approach builds on previous explicit list decodable codes for space bounded channels. We introduce and study a notion of ``\emph{evasivenss}'' of codes, which is concerned with whether a decoding algorithm rejects a word that is obtained when a channel induces few errors to a \emph{uniformly chosen} string. We use evasiveness (as well as several additional new ideas related to coding theory and pseudorandomness) to identify the ``correct'' message in the list. Loosely speaking, this is achieved by arguing that on ``incorrect messages'' the decoding algorithm cannot distinguish the codeword from a uniform string.</div>

matroids, determinantal distributions, and more generally distributions
associated with log-concave polynomials. For a matroid of rank $k$ on a ground
set of $n$ elements, or more generally distributions associated with
log-concave polynomials of homogeneous degree $k$ on $n$ variables, we show
that the down-up random walk, started from an arbitrary point in the support,
mixes in time $O(k\log k)$. Our bound has no dependence on $n$ or the starting
point, unlike the previous analyses [ALOV19, CGM19], and is tight up to
constant factors. The main new ingredient is a property we call approximate
exchange, a generalization of well-studied exchange properties for matroids and
valuated matroids, which may be of independent interest.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we show how to leverage down-up random walks to approximately
sample spanning trees in a graph with $n$ edges in time $O(n\log^2 n)$,
improving on the almost-linear time algorithm by Schild [Sch18]. Our analysis
works on weighted graphs too, and is the first to achieve nearly-linear running
time.

problem. It can be reduced to enumerating minimal dominating sets in a graph,
in fact even to enumerating minimal dominating sets in an incomparability
graph. We provide an output-polynomial time algorithm for incomparability
graphs whose underlying posets have bounded dimension. Through a different
proof technique, we also provide an output-polynomial algorithm for their
complements, i.e., for comparability graphs of bounded dimension posets.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm for incomparability graphs is based on flashlight search and
relies on the geometrical representation of incomparability graphs with bounded
dimension, as given by Golumbic et al. in 1983. It runs with polynomial delay
and only needs polynomial space. Our algorithm for comparability graphs is
based on the flipping method introduced by Golovach et al. in 2015. It performs
in incremental-polynomial time and requires exponential space.
</p>
<p>In addition, we show how to improve the flipping method so that it requires
only polynomial space. Since the flipping method is a key tool for the best
known algorithms enumerating minimal dominating sets in a number of graph
classes, this yields direct improvements on the state of the art.

problem to verifying a local probabilistic property of the independent sets.
</p>
<p>With this we give, for any fixed $k\ge 3$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a randomised
polynomial-time algorithm for colouring graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ in
which each vertex is contained in at most $t$ copies of a cycle of length $k$,

<p>This generalises and improves upon several notable results including those of
Kim (1995) and Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov (1999), and more recent ones of
Molloy (2019) and Achlioptas, Iliopoulos and Sinclair (2019). This bound on the
chromatic number is tight up to an asymptotic factor $2$ and it coincides with
a famous algorithmic barrier to colouring random graphs.

degree polynomials. Consider an $n$-variate degree-$d$ polynomial $f$ which can
be written as $$f = c_1Q_1^{m} + \ldots + c_s Q_s^{m},$$ where each $c_i\in
\mathbb{F}^{\times}$, $Q_i$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $t$, and $t m

for finding the $Q_i$'s given (black-box access to) $f$, if the $Q_i's$ satisfy
certain non-degeneracy conditions and $n$ is larger than $d^2$. The set of
degenerate $Q_i$'s (i.e., inputs for which the algorithm does not work) form a
non-trivial variety and hence if the $Q_i$'s are chosen according to any
reasonable (full-dimensional) distribution, then they are non-degenerate with
high probability (if $s$ is not too large).

<p>Our algorithm is based on a scheme for obtaining a learning algorithm for an
arithmetic circuit model from a lower bound for the same model, provided
certain non-degeneracy conditions hold. The scheme reduces the learning problem
to the problem of decomposing two vector spaces under the action of a set of
linear operators, where the spaces and the operators are derived from the input
circuit and the complexity measure used in a typical lower bound proof. The
non-degeneracy conditions are certain restrictions on how the spaces decompose.

over $n$-bit strings given query access to independent noisy samples of strings
drawn from the distribution. Recently, Ban et. al. [BCF+19] studied the problem
where the unknown distribution over $n$-bit strings is known to be
$\ell$-sparse for some fixed $\ell$, and the noise is induced through the
deletion channel. The deletion channel is a noise model where each bit of the
string is independently deleted with some fixed probability, and the retained
bits are concatenated. We note that if $\ell = 1,$ i.e., we are trying to learn
a single string, learning the distribution is equivalent to the famous trace
reconstruction problem. The best known algorithms for trace reconstruction
require $\exp\left(O(n^{1/3})\right)$ samples.
</p>
<p>For population recovery under the deletion channel, Ban et. al. provided an
algorithm that could learn $\ell$-sparse distributions over strings using
$\exp\left(n^{1/2} \cdot (\log n)^{O(\ell)}\right)$ samples. In this work, we
provide an algorithm that learns the distribution using only
$\exp\big(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}) \cdot \ell^2\big)$ samples, by developing a
higher-moment analog of the algorithms of [DOS17, NP17]. We also give the first
algorithm with a runtime subexponential in $n$, which solves population
recovery in $\exp\big(\tilde{O}(n^{1/3}) \cdot \ell^3\big)$ samples and time.
</p>
<p>Notably, our dependence on $n$ nearly matches the known upper bound when
$\ell = 1$, and we reduce the dependence on $\ell$ from doubly to nearly singly
exponential. Therefore, we are able to learn the mixture even for much larger
values of $\ell$. For instance, Ban et. al.'s algorithm can only learn a
mixture of $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ strings with a subexponential number of
queries, whereas we are able to learn a mixture of up to $n^{o(1)}$ strings in
subexponential queries and time.

The workshop in the link is on low-dimensional topology, but the story would be the same for many other subjects. In late March, instead of attending a Bellairs workshop, we all collaborated remotely. I think we got a fair amount of research accomplished, but I didn’t have the same sense of all being brought together to do that one thing.</p>

Spheres kiss by touching with no overlap. The kissing number is how many unit spheres can touch a central one, and lattice kissing number is how many can touch in a lattice packing; both are 12 in 3d. Average kissing number is for finitely many non-unit spheres. It is ≥ lattice kissing number and ≤ 2x kissing number. One of my papers has a slightly better lower bound in 3d, and now we have better upper bounds in many dimensions.</p>

<div class="content">
Heged\H{u}s's lemma is the following combinatorial statement regarding polynomials over finite fields. Over a field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ and for $q$ a  power of $p$, the lemma says that any multilinear polynomial $P\in \mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ of degree less than $q$ that vanishes at all points in $\{0,1\}^n$ of Hamming weight $k\in [q,n-q]$ must also vanish at all points in $\{0,1\}^n$ of weight $k + q$. This lemma was used by Heged\H{u}s (2009) to give a solution to \emph{Galvin's problem}, an extremal problem about set systems; by Alon, Kumar and Volk (2018) to improve the best-known multilinear circuit lower bounds; and by Hrube\v{s}, Ramamoorthy, Rao and Yehudayoff (2019) to prove optimal lower bounds against depth-$2$ threshold circuits for computing some symmetric functions. 
		
		In this paper, we formulate a robust version of Heged\H{u}s's lemma. Informally, this version says that if a polynomial of degree $o(q)$ vanishes at most points of weight $k$, then it vanishes at many points of weight $k+q$. We prove this lemma and give the following three different applications.
		
		1. Degree lower bounds for the coin problem: The \emph{$\delta$-Coin Problem} is the problem of distinguishing between a coin that is heads with probability $((1/2) + \delta)$ and a coin that is heads with probability $1/2$. We show that over a field of positive (fixed) characteristic, any polynomial that solves the $\delta$-coin problem with error $\varepsilon$ must have degree $\Omega(\frac{1}{\delta}\log(1/\varepsilon)),$ which is tight up to constant factors.
		
		2. Probabilistic degree lower bounds: The \emph{Probabilistic degree} of a Boolean function is the minimum $d$ such that there is a random polynomial of degree $d$ that agrees with the function at each point with high probability. We give tight lower bounds on the probabilistic degree of \emph{every} symmetric Boolean function over positive (fixed) characteristic. As far as we know, this was not known even for some very simple functions such as unweighted Exact Threshold functions, and constant error.
		
		3. A robust version of the combinatorial result of Heged\H{u}s (2009) mentioned above.</div>

<i>Guest post by the TCS4F initiative
(Antoine Amarilli, Thomas Colcombet, Hugo Férée, Thomas Schwentick) </i><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://tcs4f.org/">TCS4F</a> is an initiative by theoretical computer scientists who are
concerned about that other major crisis of our time: climate change. We
anticipate that the climate crisis will be a major challenge of the
decades to come, that it will require major changes at all levels of
society to mitigate the harm that it will cause, and that researchers in
theoretical computer science, like all other actors, must be part of the
solution and not part of the problem.</div>
<div><br /></div><div>Our initiative is to propose a <a href="https://tcs4f.org/">manifesto</a> to commit
to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions: following <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/2018/10/08/summary-for-policymakers-of-ipcc-special-report-on-global-warming-of-1-5c-approved-by-governments/">IPCC goals</a>, the
objective is to reduce by at least 50% before 2030 relative to pre-2020
levels. The manifesto is more than a simple expression of concern,
because it is a pledge with concrete objectives. However, it does not
prescribe specific measures, as we believe this discussion is not
settled yet and the right steps to take can vary depending on everyone's
practices. </div><div><br />
The manifesto can be signed by individual researchers (like you, dear
reader!), by research groups, and by organizers of conferences and
workshops. Currently, over 50 researchers have signed it. The goal of
TCS4F is also to start organizing a community of concerned researchers,
across theoretical computer science, to think about the issue of climate
change and how to adjust what we do, in particular our travel habits. </div><div><br />
We need your help to make this initiative a success and help theoretical
CS lead the way towards a sustainable, carbon-neutral future:</div><div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>If you agree with our concerns and are ready to commit to reducing
 your carbon footprint, consider <a href="https://tcs4f.org/">signing the manifesto</a>. Signing is open to all researchers in
 theoretical CS in the broadest possible sense.</li><li>Advertise your support of the manifesto (e.g., by putting one of our
 badges on your webpage). Talk in your research teams and departments
 about the manifesto, and see if you can gather support for signing the
 manifesto collectively as a research group.</li><li>If you are involved in conferences and workshops, start a discussion
 about the carbon footprint of the event, and whether the event could
 commit to the manifesto's goal. Indeed, now that conferences across
 the globe are moving online because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is a
 good time to discuss how conferences could evolve towards more
 sustainable models.</li><li>Spread the word about the issue of climate change and the TCS4F
 initiative, and encourage discussion of this important challenge in
 our communities. </li></ul></div><div>
As theoretical researchers, we are not used to discussing uncomfortable
non-scientific questions like the effects of our activities on the
world. However, we believe that the magnitude of the climate crisis
obliges us to act now as a community. We are confident that great
changes can be achieved if we do not limit our creativity to our
specific research areas and also use it to re-think our way to do
research.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
We develop algorithms for writing a polynomial as sums of powers of low degree polynomials. Consider an $n$-variate degree-$d$ polynomial $f$ which can be written as
$$f = c_1Q_1^{m} + \ldots + c_s Q_s^{m},$$
where each $c_i\in \mathbb{F}^{\times}$, $Q_i$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $t$, and $t m = d$. In this paper, we give a $\text{poly}((ns)^t)$-time learning algorithm for finding the $Q_i$'s given (black-box access to) $f$, if the $Q_i's$ satisfy certain non-degeneracy conditions and $n$ is larger than $d^2$. The set of degenerate $Q_i$'s (i.e., inputs for which the algorithm does not work) form a non-trivial variety and hence if the $Q_i$'s are chosen according to any reasonable (full-dimensional) distribution, then they are non-degenerate with high probability (if $s$ is not too large). This problem generalizes symmetric tensor decomposition, which corresponds to the $t = 1$ case and is widely studied, having many applications in machine learning. Our algorithm (for $t=2$) allows us to solve the moment problem for mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians in the non-degenerate case.

Our algorithm is based on a scheme for obtaining a learning algorithm for an arithmetic circuit model from a lower bound for the same model, provided certain non-degeneracy conditions hold. The scheme reduces the learning problem to the problem of decomposing two vector spaces under the action of a set of linear operators, where the spaces and the operators are derived from the input circuit and the complexity measure used in a typical lower bound proof. The non-degeneracy conditions are certain restrictions on how the spaces decompose. Such a scheme is present in a rudimentary form in an earlier work of Kayal and Saha. Here, we make it more general and detailed, and potentially applicable to learning other circuit models.

An exponential lower bound for the representation above (also known as homogeneous $\Sigma \wedge \Sigma \Pi^{[t]}$ circuits) is known using the shifted partials measure. However, the number of linear operators in shifted partials is exponential and also the non-degeneracy condition emerging out of this measure is unlikely to be satisfied by a random $\Sigma \wedge \Sigma \Pi^{[t]}$ circuit when the number of variables is large with respect to the degree. We bypass this hurdle by proving a lower bound (which is nearly as strong as the previous bound) using a novel variant of the partial derivatives measure, namely affine projections of partials (APP). The non-degeneracy conditions appearing from this new measure are satisfied by a random $\Sigma \wedge \Sigma \Pi^{[t]}$ circuit. The APP measure could be of independent interest for proving other lower bounds.</div>

<p>This is my first post in more than a month that’s totally unrelated to the covid crisis.  Or rather, it’s related only insofar as it’s about a Hulu miniseries, the sort of thing that many of us have more occasion to watch while holed up at home.</p>



<p>Three weeks ago, a journalist named Ben Lindbergh—who’d previously asked me to <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4184">comment on the scientific accuracy of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>—asked me the same question about the miniseries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devs_(miniseries)">Devs</a>, which I hadn’t previously heard of.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">[Warning: Spoilers follow]</span></strong></p>



<p>‘Devs,’ I learned, is a spooky sci-fi action thriller about a secretive Silicon Valley company that builds a quantum computer that can perfectly reconstruct the past, down to what Jesus looked like on the cross, and can also (at least up to a point) predict the future.</p>



<p>And I was supposed, not only to endure such a show, but to comment on the <em>accuracy</em> of its invocations of quantum computing?  This didn’t sound promising.</p>



<p>But, y’know, I was at home quarantined.  So I agreed to watch the first episode.  Which quickly turned into the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh episodes (the eighth and final one isn’t out yet).</p>



<p>It turns out that ‘Devs’ isn’t too bad, <em>except</em> that it’s not particularly about quantum computers.  The latter is simply a buzzword chosen by the writers for a plot concept that would’ve been entirely familiar to the ancient Greeks, who called it the Delphic Oracle.  You know, the mysterious entity that prophesies your fate, so then you try to escape the prophecy, but your very evasive maneuvers make the prophecy come true?  Picture that, except with qubits—and for some reason, in a gleaming golden laboratory that has components that float in midair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn1-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-09-at-2.52.52-PM.png" alt="Devs Trailer Reveals New Look at FX-Hulu's Upcoming Limited Series" />If you’re never visited a real quantum computing lab: they’re messier and a lot less golden.</figure>



<p>At this point, I’ll just link you to Ben Lindbergh’s article about the show: <a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2020/4/10/21216149/devs-hulu-quantum-physics-philosophy-alex-garland">Making Sense of the Science and Philosophy of ‘Devs.’</a>  His long and excellent piece quotes me extensively enough that I see no need <em>also</em> to analyze the show in this blog post.  (It also quotes several academic philosophers.)</p>



<p>Instead, I’ll just share a few tidbits that Ben left out, but that might be amusing to quantum computing fans.</p>



<ul><li>The first episode opens with a conversation between two characters about how even “elliptical curve” cryptography is insecure against attack by quantum computers.  So I immediately knew <em>both</em> that the writers had one or more consultants who actually knew something about QC, and also that those consultants were not as heavily involved as they could’ve been.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Similarly: in a later scene, some employees at the secretive company hold what appears to be a reading group about Shor’s algorithm.  They talk about waves that interfere and cancel each other out, which is great, but beyond that their discussion sounded to me like nonsense.  In particular, their idea seemed to be that the waves would reinforce at the prime factors p and q themselves, rather than at inverse multiples of the period of a periodic function that only indirectly encodes the factoring problem.  (What do you say: should we let this one slide?)</li></ul>



<ul><li>“How many qubits does this thing have?” “A number that there would be no point in describing as a number.”  ROFL</li></ul>



<ul><li>In the show, a crucial break comes when the employees abandon a prediction algorithm based on the deBroglie-Bohm pilot wave interpretation, and substitute one based on Everett’s many-worlds interpretation.  Which I could actually <em>almost</em> believe, except that the many-worlds interpretation seems to contradict the entire premise of the rest of the show?</li></ul>



<ul><li>A new employee, after he sees the code of the superpowerful quantum computer for the first time, is so disoriented and overwhelmed that he runs and vomits into a toilet.  I, too, have had that reaction to the claims of certain quantum computing companies, although in some sense for the opposite reason.</li></ul>



<p>Anyway, none of the above addresses the show’s central conceit: namely, that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon">Laplace demon</a> can be made real, the past and future rendered fully knowable (with at most occasional breaks and exceptions) by a machine that’s feasible to build.  This conceit is fascinating to explore, but also <em>false</em>.</p>



<p>In the past, if you’d asked me to justify its falsity, I would’ve talked about chaos, and quantum mechanics, and the unknowability of the fine details of the universe’s state; I might’ve even pointed you to my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0159">Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine</a> essay.  I also would’ve mentioned the severe conceptual difficulties in forcing Nature to find a fixed-point of a universe where you get to see your own future and act on that information (these difficulties are just a variant of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox">Grandfather Paradox</a>).</p>



<p>But it occurs to me that, just as the coronavirus has now made plain the nature of exponential growth, even to the world’s least abstract-minded person, so too it’s made plain the universe’s unpredictability.  Let’s put it this way: do you find it plausible that the quantum computer from ‘Devs,’ had you booted it up six months ago, would’ve known the exact state of every nucleotide in every virus in every bat in Wuhan?  No?  Then it wouldn’t have known our future.</p>



<p>And I see now that I’ve violated my promise that this post would have nothing to do with covid.</p></div>

John Horton Conway just passed away from complications of COVID-19. We are all saddened by this news, and we hope you all are doing your best to stay safe and help others cope.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I thought we would reflect on some of Conway’s many contributions and emphasize three in which we see connections to computational complexity. </p>
<p>
Conway was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was the first recipient of the London Mathematical Society’s Pólya Prize. His nomination to the Royal Society reads:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A versatile mathematician who combines a deep combinatorial insight with algebraic virtuosity, particularly in the construction and manipulation of “off-beat” algebraic structures which illuminate a wide variety of problems in completely unexpected ways. He has made distinguished contributions to the theory of finite groups, to the theory of knots, to mathematical logic (both set theory and automata theory) and to the theory of games (as also to its practice). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Life Force </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Conway may be most noted for his game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Life</a>. This is a two-dimensional cellular automaton. Conway invented it in 1970, which he rounded up from 1969. The game—and Martin Gardner’s 1970 column on it in <em>Scientific American</em>—made him famous in the wider community. The website <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/">conwaylife.com</a> and <a href="https://catagolue.appspot.com/home">several</a> <a href="https://tebs-game-of-life.com/">others</a> link to more information than we could digest in a lifetime.</p>
<p>
We want to emphasize instead how Conway was a special force in mathematics. He applied an almost elementary approach to deep hard problems of mathematics. This is a unique combination. There have been mathematicians who worked on deep problems and also on recreational math, but few who established integral flows across the boundary between them. Conway infused both with magic in a way conveyed by an iconic photograph of his Princeton office in 1993:</p>

What Ken remembers is how accessible Conway was <em>outside</em> his office. “I know I met him at least once while I was an undergraduate at Princeton in 1979 or 1980, though this is overlaid by a memory of finding just him and a few others in the Fine Hall tea room when I was there for my tenth reunion in 1991. My most evocative memory is when Conway gave an evening talk to the undergraduate mathematics club at Oxford when I was there sometime after 1981. It was relatively sparsely attended, perhaps because it was literally a dark and stormy winter night. But after his lecture we all got to huddle around him for another hour in the tea room as he regaled us with stories and mathematical problems.” </p>
<p>
We also remember that Conway was one of Andrew Wiles’s main confidants during the months before Wiles announced his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem in June 1993. Here is a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2414proof.html">transcript</a> of a PBS Nova documentary on the proof in which Conway appears prominently. Ken has picked out two of Conway’s other contributions that we feel may have untapped use for research in complexity theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Conway’s Numbers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One of this blog’s “invariants” is first-name last-name style, thus “Godfrey Hardy” not “G.H. Hardy.” But we make an exception in Conway’s case. Partly this owes to how his initials were amplified by Donald Knuth in his novella <em>Surreal Numbers</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In the beginning, everything was void, and J.H.W.H. Conway began to create numbers. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Besides the void (that is, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cemptyset%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\emptyset}" class="latex" title="{\emptyset}" />), the creation uses the idea of a <em>left set</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> and a <em>right set</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" />. Every number has the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+L%7E%7C%7ER+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle L~|~R \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle L~|~R \rangle}" />. The initial number is </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Clangle+%5Cemptyset+%7E%7C%7E+%5Cemptyset%5Crangle+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \langle \emptyset ~|~ \emptyset\rangle = 0. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \langle \emptyset ~|~ \emptyset\rangle = 0. " /></p>
<p>
Once a number is generated, it can be in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> of other numbers. Thus, next come </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++%5Clangle+0+%7E%7C%7E+%5Cemptyset+%5Crangle+%26%3D%26+1%5C%5C+%5Clangle+%5Cemptyset+%7E%7C%7E+0+%5Crangle+%26%3D%26+-1.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}  \langle 0 ~|~ \emptyset \rangle &amp;=&amp; 1\\ \langle \emptyset ~|~ 0 \rangle &amp;=&amp; -1. \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}  \langle 0 ~|~ \emptyset \rangle &amp;=&amp; 1\\ \langle \emptyset ~|~ 0 \rangle &amp;=&amp; -1. \end{array} " /></p>
<p>
You might think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+0+%7E%7C%7E+0+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle 0 ~|~ 0 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle 0 ~|~ 0 \rangle}" /> next, but it violates the invariant </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28%5Cforall+%5Cell+%5Cin+L%29%28%5Cforall+r+%5Cin+R%29%5Cneg+%28r+%5Cleq+%5Cell%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (\forall \ell \in L)(\forall r \in R)\neg (r \leq \ell). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (\forall \ell \in L)(\forall r \in R)\neg (r \leq \ell). " /></p>
<p>which defines an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+L%7E%7C%7ER+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle L~|~R \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle L~|~R \rangle}" /> <em>form</em> to be a <em>number</em>. </p>
<p>
The relation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cleq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\leq}" class="latex" title="{\leq}" /> is inductively defined for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+%5Clangle+L_a+%7E%7C%7E+R_a+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a = \langle L_a ~|~ R_a \rangle}" class="latex" title="{a = \langle L_a ~|~ R_a \rangle}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%3D+%5Clangle+L_b+%7E%7C%7E+R_b+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b = \langle L_b ~|~ R_b \rangle}" class="latex" title="{b = \langle L_b ~|~ R_b \rangle}" /> by </p>

<p>
That is, no member of the left-set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> “bumps” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" /> (in the sense of rowing races) and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> does not bump any member of the right-set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />.  Note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R_a}" class="latex" title="{R_a}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_b%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L_b}" class="latex" title="{L_b}" /> are not involved—they already behave correctly owing to the invariant. The numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a,b}" class="latex" title="{a,b}" /> are equal if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cleq+b%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a \leq b}" class="latex" title="{a \leq b}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%5Cleq+a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b \leq a}" class="latex" title="{b \leq a}" /> both hold. The rule for addition is </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a+%2B+b+%3D+%5Clangle+%28L_a+%5Cboxplus+b%29+%5Ccup+%28a+%5Cboxplus+L_b%29+%7E%7C%7E+%28a+%5Cboxplus+R_b%29+%5Ccup+%28R_a+%5Cboxplus+b%29+%5Crangle%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  a + b = \langle (L_a \boxplus b) \cup (a \boxplus L_b) ~|~ (a \boxplus R_b) \cup (R_a \boxplus b) \rangle, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  a + b = \langle (L_a \boxplus b) \cup (a \boxplus L_b) ~|~ (a \boxplus R_b) \cup (R_a \boxplus b) \rangle, " /></p>
<p>
where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL_a+%5Cboxplus+b+%3D+%5C%7B%5Cell_a+%2B+b%3A+%5Cell_a+%5Cin+L_a%5C%7D+%3D+b+%5Cboxplus+L_a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L_a \boxplus b = \{\ell_a + b: \ell_a \in L_a\} = b \boxplus L_a}" class="latex" title="{L_a \boxplus b = \{\ell_a + b: \ell_a \in L_a\} = b \boxplus L_a}" /> and so on. The logical rule <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cemptyset+%5Cboxplus+a+%3D+%5Cemptyset%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\emptyset \boxplus a = \emptyset}" class="latex" title="{\emptyset \boxplus a = \emptyset}" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> makes the definition of addition well-founded. This yields the numerical fact </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0+%2B+0+%3D+%5Clangle+%28%5Cemptyset+%5Cboxplus+0%29+%5Ccup+%280+%5Cboxplus+%5Cemptyset%29+%7E%7C%7E+%28%5Cemptyset+%5Cboxplus+0%29+%5Ccup+%280+%5Cboxplus+%5Cemptyset%29+%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle%5Cemptyset+%7E%7C%7E+%5Cemptyset%5Crangle+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  0 + 0 = \langle (\emptyset \boxplus 0) \cup (0 \boxplus \emptyset) ~|~ (\emptyset \boxplus 0) \cup (0 \boxplus \emptyset) \rangle = \langle\emptyset ~|~ \emptyset\rangle = 0.

<p>
It is immediate that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{+}" class="latex" title="{+}" /> is commutative. There is also a rule for multiplication but addition gives us enough to talk about here.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Redundancy and Simplicity </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
It is straightforward to compute that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%2B+1+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0 + 1 = 1}" class="latex" title="{0 + 1 = 1}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1+%2B+0+%3D+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{-1 + 0 = -1}" class="latex" title="{-1 + 0 = -1}" />. Now consider: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++-1+%2B+1+%3D+%5Clangle+%28%5Cemptyset+%5Cboxplus+1%29+%5Ccup+%28-1+%5Cboxplus+%5C%7B0%5C%7D%29+%7E%7C%7E+%28-1+%5Cboxplus+%5Cemptyset+%29+%5Ccup+%28%5C%7B0%5C%7D+%5Cboxplus+1%29%5Crangle+%3D+%5Clangle+-1+%7E%7C%7E+1%5Crangle.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  -1 + 1 = \langle (\emptyset \boxplus 1) \cup (-1 \boxplus \{0\}) ~|~ (-1 \boxplus \emptyset ) \cup (\{0\} \boxplus 1)\rangle = \langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  -1 + 1 = \langle (\emptyset \boxplus 1) \cup (-1 \boxplus \{0\}) ~|~ (-1 \boxplus \emptyset ) \cup (\{0\} \boxplus 1)\rangle = \langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle. " /></p>
<p>This is a legal number. You can check that the relations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+-1+%7E%7C%7E+1%5Crangle+%5Cleq+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle \leq 0}" class="latex" title="{\langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle \leq 0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%5Cleq+%5Clangle+-1+%7E%7C%7E+1%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0 \leq \langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle}" class="latex" title="{0 \leq \langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle}" /> both hold. Thus—as a number rather than a “form”—the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+-1+%7E%7C%7E+1%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle -1 ~|~ 1\rangle}" /> equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />. </p>
<p>
That seems to make sense since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> is the average of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{-1}" class="latex" title="{-1}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, but now compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%3D+1+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2 = 1 + 1}" class="latex" title="{2 = 1 + 1}" /> as a formal Conway number and consider <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%3D+%5Clangle+-1+%7E%7C%7E+2%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c = \langle -1 ~|~ 2\rangle}" class="latex" title="{c = \langle -1 ~|~ 2\rangle}" />. This also satisfies the relations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cleq+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c \leq 0}" class="latex" title="{c \leq 0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0+%5Cleq+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0 \leq c}" class="latex" title="{0 \leq c}" />, so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c}" class="latex" title="{c}" /> must likewise equal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+L+%7E%7C%7E+R+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle L ~|~ R \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle L ~|~ R \rangle}" /> is not some kind of numerical interpolation between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" />. The interpretation that grabbed my imagination as a teenager in 1976 is that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+L+%7E%7C%7E+R+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle L ~|~ R \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle L ~|~ R \rangle}" /> equals the <b>simplest</b> number that is between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This is especially evocative in cases like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+1+%7E%7C%7E+%5Cemptyset+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle 1 ~|~ \emptyset \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle 1 ~|~ \emptyset \rangle}" />, which is what one gets by computing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1 + 1}" class="latex" title="{1 + 1}" />. In general, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m+1}" class="latex" title="{m+1}" /> is the simplest number between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cemptyset%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\emptyset}" class="latex" title="{\emptyset}" />. Conway made this a theorem by giving each number a set-theoretic ordinal for its “time of generation” and proved that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+L+%7E%7C%7E+R+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle L ~|~ R \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle L ~|~ R \rangle}" /> always equals a (the) least-ordinal number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c}" class="latex" title="{c}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%5Cleq+c+%5Cleq+r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell \leq c \leq r}" class="latex" title="{\ell \leq c \leq r}" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell+%5Cin+L%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell \in L}" class="latex" title="{\ell \in L}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cin+R%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r \in R}" class="latex" title="{r \in R}" />. </p>
<p>
Conway’s rules allow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> to be infinite sets—any sets of numbers built by the rules of set theory. Then not only do all real numbers emerge at ordinal times, so do infinitesimals and further richness of structure. We should remember that Conway began as a set theorist with a dissertation under Harold Davenport titled <em>Homogeneous ordered sets</em>. All Conway numbers with finite creation times are dyadic rational numbers, which may seem trivial from the standpoint of set theory, but those are akin to binary strings. </p>
<p>
What became magic was how Conway’s rules characterize <em>games</em>. Through games we can also interpret forms like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clangle+0+%7E%7C%7E+0+%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\langle 0 ~|~ 0 \rangle}" class="latex" title="{\langle 0 ~|~ 0 \rangle}" /> that are not numbers. I did not know about complexity when I purchased Conway’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Numbers_and_Games">book</a> <em>On Numbers and Games</em> around 1980, let alone the connections between games and complexity. The book has a lot of depth that might be useful to complexity theory. To quote Peter Sarnak, per this <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2015/roberts-john-horton-conway">article</a> by Conway’s biographer Siobhan Roberts on Conway’s meeting with Kurt Gödel:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The surreal numbers will be applied. It’s just a question of how and when. </em>
</p></blockquote>

</p><p></p><h2> Modular Programming </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Most of us know that the conditional-jump instruction</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"><tt><b><br />
if (x == 0) goto k<br />
</b></tt></font></p>
<p></p><p><br />
where <tt><b>k</b></tt> is the label of another instruction, creates a universal programming language when added to the usual programming primitives of assignment, sequencing, and simple arithmetic. Conway was a maven of the “modular-jump”:</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"><tt><b><br />
if (x == 0 mod m) goto k.<br />
</b></tt></font></p>
<p></p><p><br />
In complexity theory we know that mod-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> gates having 0-1 inputs define the idea of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BACC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{ACC}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{ACC}}" /> circuits, with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BACC%7D%5E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{ACC}^0}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{ACC}^0}" /> denoting problems solved by families of these circuits having fixed depth and polynomial size. If we don’t insist on fixed depth and unary inputs, we get modular programs. They are more complex than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BACC%7D%5E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{ACC}^0}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{ACC}^0}" /> circuits, but we can learn from what can be done <em>concretely</em> with them.</p>
<p>
Conway created a particular form of modular programs in a language he called <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-4808-8_2">FRACTRAN</a>. A program is just a list of positive fractions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Ba_r%7D%7Bb_r%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{a_r}{b_r}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{a_r}{b_r}}" /> in lowest terms. The input is an integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> held in a separate register. Each fraction represents the code line</p>
<p></p><p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+%28n%2Aa_r+%5Cequiv+0+%5Cpmod%7Bb_r%7D%29+%5C%7B+n+%3D+n%5Cfrac%7Ba_r%7D%7Bb_r%7D%3B+%5Ctext%7Bgoto+start%7D+%5C%7D%3B+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \text{if } (n*a_r \equiv 0 \pmod{b_r}) \{ n = n\frac{a_r}{b_r}; \text{goto start} \}; " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \text{if } (n*a_r \equiv 0 \pmod{b_r}) \{ n = n\frac{a_r}{b_r}; \text{goto start} \}; " /></p>
<p>
In other words, each iteration takes the first fraction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bnf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{nf}" class="latex" title="{nf}" /> is an integer and updates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bnf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{nf}" class="latex" title="{nf}" />; if there is no such fraction then the program exits and outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />.</p>
<p>
For example, the following FRACTRAN program given in Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRACTRAN">article</a> implicitly computes integer division: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B91%7D%7B66%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B11%7D%7B13%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B33%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B85%7D%7B11%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B57%7D%7B119%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B17%7D%7B19%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B11%7D%7B17%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B3%7D%5Cright%5D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \left[\frac{91}{66},~\frac{11}{13},~\frac{1}{33},~\frac{85}{11},~\frac{57}{119},~\frac{17}{19},~\frac{11}{17},~\frac{1}{3}\right]. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \left[\frac{91}{66},~\frac{11}{13},~\frac{1}{33},~\frac{85}{11},~\frac{57}{119},~\frac{17}{19},~\frac{11}{17},~\frac{1}{3}\right]. " /></p>
<p>The notation is unary: The input <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> has the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En+3%5Ed+11%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n 3^d 11}" class="latex" title="{2^n 3^d 11}" /> and the ouput is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%5Eq+7%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5^q 7^r}" class="latex" title="{5^q 7^r}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+qd+%2B+r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n = qd + r}" class="latex" title="{n = qd + r}" /> with remainder <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3C+d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r &lt; d}" class="latex" title="{r &lt; d}" />. This already hints the fact that FRACTRAN is a universal programming language. Powers of primes serve as memory registers. The following program computes the Hamming weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> of the binary expansion of a natural number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> encoded as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^x}" class="latex" title="{2^x}" />, returning the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B13%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{13^k}" class="latex" title="{13^k}" />: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B33%7D%7B20%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B11%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B13%7D%7B10%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B5%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B2%7D%7B3%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B10%7D%7B7%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B7%7D%7B2%7D%5Cright%5D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \left[\frac{33}{20},~\frac{5}{11},~\frac{13}{10},~\frac{1}{5},~\frac{2}{3},~\frac{10}{7},~\frac{7}{2}\right].

<p>This might help bridge to our notions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BACC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{ACC}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{ACC}}" />. The Wikipedia article does a good job of de-mystifying the fractions in terms of their actions on the prime-power registers under the unary-style encoding. We wonder what happens when we try to work directly with binary encodings. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> The Collatz Example </h2><p></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++T%28n%29+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+%5Cfrac%7B3n%2B1%7D%7B2%7D+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+n+%5Ctext%7B+is+odd%7D+%5C%5C+%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7B2%7D+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+n+%5Ctext%7B+is+even%7D+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D++&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  T(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{3n+1}{2} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\ \frac{n}{2} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even} \end{cases}  " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  T(n) = \begin{cases} \frac{3n+1}{2} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\ \frac{n}{2} &amp; \text{if } n \text{ is even} \end{cases}  " /></p>
<p>The following FRACTRAN program <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00958971/document">given</a> by Kenneth Monks iterates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T(n)}" class="latex" title="{T(n)}" /> under the unary encoding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" title="{2^n}" />: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cleft%5B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B11%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B136%7D%7B15%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B17%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B4%7D%7B5%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B26%7D%7B21%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B7%7D%7B13%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B7%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B33%7D%7B4%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B5%7D%7B2%7D%2C%7E%5Cfrac%7B7%7D%7B1%7D%5Cright%5D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \left[\frac{1}{11},~\frac{136}{15},~\frac{5}{17},~\frac{4}{5},~\frac{26}{21},~\frac{7}{13},~\frac{1}{7},~\frac{33}{4},~\frac{5}{2},~\frac{7}{1}\right].

<p>Note that since the last fraction is an integer the program runs forever. If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n = 1}" class="latex" title="{n = 1}" /> so that the input is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />, it would go <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%5Crightarrow+5+%5Crightarrow+4+%5Crightarrow+33+%5Crightarrow+3+%5Crightarrow+21+%5Crightarrow+26+%5Crightarrow+14+%5Crightarrow+2+%5Ccdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 33 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 21 \rightarrow 26 \rightarrow 14 \rightarrow 2 \cdots}" class="latex" title="{2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 33 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 21 \rightarrow 26 \rightarrow 14 \rightarrow 2 \cdots}" /> and thus cycle, unless we stop it. The powers of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> that appear in its output give the desired sequence. </p>
<p>
More natural to us, however, is the following modular program—which can use binary or any notation:</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"><tt><b><br />
start: if (n == 1) { halt; }<br />
if (n == 0 mod 2) { goto div; }<br />
n = 3*n + 1;<br />
div: n = n/2;<br />
goto start;<br />
</b></tt></font></p>
<p></p><p><br />
One can generalize the Collatz problem to moduli <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3E+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m &gt; 2}" class="latex" title="{m &gt; 2}" />. For each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3C+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k &lt; m}" class="latex" title="{k &lt; m}" /> we have a linear transformation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cmapsto+c_k+n+%2B+d_k%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \mapsto c_k n + d_k}" class="latex" title="{n \mapsto c_k n + d_k}" /> that always gives an integer value when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cequiv+k+%5Cpmod%7Bm%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \equiv k \pmod{m}}" class="latex" title="{n \equiv k \pmod{m}}" />.

In fact, this is exactly what FRACTRAN does. Take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> to be the least common multiple of the denominators <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b_r}" class="latex" title="{b_r}" /> in a FRACTRAN program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B%5Cfrac%7Ba_r%7D%7Bb_r%7D%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[\frac{a_r}{b_r}]}" class="latex" title="{[\frac{a_r}{b_r}]}" />. Then for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> we can list the remainders <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> that are multiples of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b_r}" class="latex" title="{b_r}" /> and we get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_k+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Ba_r%7D%7B%5Cgcd%28k%2Cm%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c_k = \frac{a_r}{\gcd(k,m)}}" class="latex" title="{c_k = \frac{a_r}{\gcd(k,m)}}" />, with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_k+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_k = 0}" class="latex" title="{d_k = 0}" />. The Turing-universality of FRACTRAN then proves a general theorem Conway stated in 1972:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> Generalized Collatz-type problems for moduli <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3E+2%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m &gt; 2}" class="latex" title="{m &gt; 2}" /> are undecidable. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72504-6_49">Several</a> <a href="http://julienmalka.me/collatz.pdf">followup</a> <a href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Lagarias3-23.pdf">papers</a> have proved stronger and more particular forms of the undecidability. The paper by Monks linked above leverages the unary encoding to show that having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd_k+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d_k = 0}" class="latex" title="{d_k = 0}" /> is essentially without loss of generality for universality; it is titled “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3x+1}" class="latex" title="{3x+1}" /> Minus the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%2B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{+}" class="latex" title="{+}" />.” </p>
<p>
Having digested universality, it is natural to wonder about complexity. Can we use modular programming to achieve stronger connections between number theory and complexity classes—classes above the level of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BACC%7D%5E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{ACC}^0}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{ACC}^0}" />, say? One possible mode of connection is exemplified by this <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220994869_One_Binary_Horn_Clause_is_Enough">paper</a> from STACS 1994, which both Dick and I attended. We wonder whether the kind of connection noted by Terry Tao in his <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/04/12/john-conway/">tribute</a> to Conway can also smooth the way to understanding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BMIP%5E%2A+%3D+RE%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{MIP^* = RE}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{MIP^* = RE}}" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Conway posed many open problems himself. Here is a <a href="https://oeis.org/A248380/a248380.pdf">list</a> of five for which he posted cash rewards in the manner of Paul Erdős. The fifth was recently solved. The fourth can be stated in one sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If a set of points in the plane intersects every convex region of area 1, then must it have pairs of points at arbitrarily small distances? </em>
</p></blockquote>

Our condolences go out to his family and all who were enthralled by him in the mathematical world. We could talk endlessly about his impact on mathematics education—even about simple things like how to <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=3111964">prove</a> that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{2}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{2}}" /> is irrational—or try to tangle with his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine">applications</a> of the “Monster” group to modular forms, but those must be for another time.

<p>Differentially private statistics is a very lively research area, and has seen a lot of activity in the last couple years. While the phrasing is a slight departure from previous work which focused on estimation with worst-case datasets, it turns out that the differences are often superficial. In a short series of blog posts, we hope to educate readers on some of the recent advancements in this area, as well as shed light on some of the connections between the old and the new. We’ll describe the settings, cover a couple of technical examples, and give pointers to some other directions in the area. Thanks to <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/ads22/">Adam Smith</a> for helping kick off this project, <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ccanonne/">Clément Canonne</a>, <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/">Aaron Roth</a>, and <a href="http://www.thomas-steinke.net/">Thomas Steinke</a> for helpful comments, and <a href="https://lucatrevisan.github.io/">Luca Trevisan</a> for his <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/latex-to-wordpress/">LaTeX2WP script</a>.</p>
<p><b>1. Introduction </b></p>
<p>Statistics and machine learning are now ubiquitous in data analysis. Given a dataset, one immediately wonders what it allows us to infer about the underlying population. However, modern datasets don’t exist in a vacuum: they often contain sensitive information about the individuals they represent. Without proper care, statistical procedures will result in gross violations of privacy. Motivated by the shortcomings of ad hoc methods for data anonymization, Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith introduced the celebrated notion of differential privacy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DMNS06">DMNS06</a>].</p>
<p>From its inception, some of the driving motivations for differential privacy were applications in statistics and the social sciences, notably disclosure limitation for the US Census. And yet, the lion’s share of differential privacy research has taken place within the computer science community. As a result, the specific applications being studied are often not formulated using statistical terminology, or even as statistical problems. Perhaps most significantly, much of the early work in computer science (though definitely not all) focus on estimating some property <em>of a dataset</em> rather than estimating some property <em>of an underlying population</em>.</p>
<p>Although the earliest works exploring the interaction between differential privacy and classical statistics go back to at least 2009 [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#VS09">VS09</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#FRY10">FRY10</a>], the emphasis on differentially private statistical inference in the computer science literature is somewhat more recent. However, while earlier results on differential privacy did not always formulate problems in a statistical language, statistical inference was a key motivation for most of this work. As a result many of the techniques that were developed have direct applications in statistics, for example establishing minimax rates for estimation problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this series of blog posts is to highlight some of those results in the computer science literature, and present them in a more statistical language. Specifically, we will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tight minimax lower bounds for privately estimating the mean of a multivariate distribution over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}^d}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}^d}" />, using the technique of <em>tracing attacks</em> developed in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>].
<p> </p>
</li>
<li>Upper bounds for estimating a distribution in Kolmogorov distance, using the ubiquitous <em>binary-tree mechanism</em> introduced in [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DNPR10">DNPR10</a>,<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CSS11">CSS11</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, we hope to encourage computer scientists working on differential privacy to pay more attention to the applications of their methods in statistics, and share with statisticians many of the powerful techniques that have been developed in the computer science literature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b> 1.1. Formulating Private Statistical Inference </b></p>
<p>Essentially every differentially private statistical estimation task can be phrased using the following setup. We are given a dataset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%3D+%28X_1%2C+%5Cdots%2C+X_n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)}" class="latex" title="{X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)}" /> of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />, and we wish to design an algorithm <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M \in \mathcal{M}}" class="latex" title="{M \in \mathcal{M}}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{M}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{M}}" /> is the class of mechanisms that are both:</p>
<ol>
<li>differentially private, and</li>
<li>accurate, either in expectation or with high probability, according to some task-specific measure.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few comments about this framework are in order. First, although the accuracy requirement is stochastic in nature (i.e., an algorithm might not be accurate depending on the randomness of the algorithm and the data generation process), the privacy requirement is worst-case in nature. That is, the algorithm must protect privacy for every dataset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, even those we believe are very unlikely.</p>
<p>Second, the accuracy requirement is stated rather vaguely. This is because the notion of accuracy of an algorithm is slightly more nuanced, depending on whether we are concerned with <em>empirical</em> or <em>population</em> statistics. A particular emphasis of these blog posts is to explore the difference (or, as we will see, the lack of a difference) between these two notions of accuracy. The former estimates a quantity of the observed dataset, while the latter estimates a quantity of an unobserved distribution which is assumed to have generated the dataset.</p>
<p>More precisely, the former can be phrased in terms of empirical loss, of the form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cmin_%7BM+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D%7E%5Cmax_%7BX+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%7D%7E%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D_M%28%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2C+f%28X%29%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{X \in \mathcal{X}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_M(\ell(M(X), f(X))), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{X \in \mathcal{X}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_M(\ell(M(X), f(X))), " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{M}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{M}}" /> is some class of <em>randomized estimators</em> (e.g., differentially private estimators), <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{X}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{X}}" /> is some class of <em>datasets</em>, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f}" class="latex" title="{f}" /> is some quantity of interest, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell}" class="latex" title="{\ell}" /> is some <em>loss function</em>. That is, we’re looking to find an estimator that has small expected loss on <em>any dataset</em> in some class.</p>
<p>In contrast, statistical minimax theory looks at statements about population loss, of the form:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cmin_%7BM+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BM%7D%7D%7E%5Cmax_%7BP+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D%7E%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D_%7BX+%5Csim+P%2C+M%7D%28%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2Cf%28P%29%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{P \in \mathcal{P}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_{X \sim P, M}(\ell(M(X),f(P))), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle \min_{M \in \mathcal{M}}~\max_{P \in \mathcal{P}}~\mathop{\mathbb E}_{X \sim P, M}(\ell(M(X),f(P))), " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{P}}" /> is some family of <em>distributions</em> over datasets (typically consisting of i.i.d. samples). That is, we’re looking to find an estimator that has small expected loss on random data from <em>any distribution</em> in some class. In particular, note that the randomness in this objective additionally includes the data generating procedure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%5Csim+P%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X \sim P}" class="latex" title="{X \sim P}" />.</p>
<p>These two formulations are formally very different in several ways. First, the empirical formulation requires an estimator to have small loss on <em>worst-case</em> datasets, whereas the statistical formulation only requires the estimator to have small loss <em>on average</em> over datasets drawn from certain distributions. Second, the statistical formulation requires that we estimate the unknown quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(P)}" class="latex" title="{f(P)}" />, and thus necessitates a solution to the non-private estimation problem. On the other hand, the empirical formulation only asks us to estimate the known quantity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(X)}" class="latex" title="{f(X)}" />, and thus if there were no privacy constraint it would always be possible to compute <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(X)}" class="latex" title="{f(X)}" /> exactly. Third, typically in the statistical formulation, we require that the dataset is drawn i.i.d., which means that we are more constrained when proving lower bounds for estimation than we are in the empirical problem.</p>
<p>However, in practice (more precisely, in the practice of doing theoretical research), these two formulations are more alike than they are different, and results about one formulation often imply results about the other formulation. On the algorithmic side, classical statistical results will often tell us that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28f%28X%29%2Cf%28P%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell(f(X),f(P))}" class="latex" title="{\ell(f(X),f(P))}" /> is small, in which case algorithms that guarantee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2Cf%28X%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell(M(X),f(X))}" class="latex" title="{\ell(M(X),f(X))}" /> is small also guarantee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%28M%28X%29%2Cf%28P%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell(M(X),f(P))}" class="latex" title="{\ell(M(X),f(P))}" /> is small.</p>
<p>Moreover, typical lower bound arguments for empirical quantities are often statistical in nature. These typically involving constructing some simple “hard distribution” over datasets such that no private algorithm can estimate well on average for this distribution, and thus these lower bound arguments also apply to estimating population statistics for some simple family of distributions. We will proceed to give some examples of estimation problems that were originally studied by computer scientists with the empirical formulation in mind. These results either implicitly or explicitly provide solutions to the corresponding population versions of the same problems—our goal is to spell out and illustrate these connections.</p>
<p><b>2. DP Background </b></p>
<p>Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%3D+%28X_1%2CX_2%2C%5Cdots%2CX_n%29+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X = (X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n) \in \mathcal{X}^n}" class="latex" title="{X = (X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n) \in \mathcal{X}^n}" /> be a collection of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> samples where each individual sample comes from the domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{X}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{X}}" />. We say that two samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%2CX%27+%5Cin+%5Cmathcal%7BX%7D%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X,X' \in \mathcal{X}^*}" class="latex" title="{X,X' \in \mathcal{X}^*}" /> are <em>adjacent</em>, denoted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX+%5Csim+X%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X \sim X'}" class="latex" title="{X \sim X'}" />, if they differ on at most one individual sample.

<p><b>Remark 2</b> <em> In these blog posts, we stick to the most general formulation of differential privacy, so-called <em>approximate differential privacy</em>, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cepsilon%2C%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\epsilon,\delta)}" class="latex" title="{(\epsilon,\delta)}" />-differential privacy for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\delta &gt; 0}" /> essentially because this is the notion that captures the widest variety of private mechanisms. Almost all of what follows would apply equally well, with minor technical modifications, to slightly stricter notions of <em>concentrated differential privacy [</em><a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DR16">DR16</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BS16">BS16</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BDRS18">BDRS18</a>], Rényi differential privacy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#Mir17">Mir17</a>], or <em>Gaussian differential privacy [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DRS19">DRS19</a>]</em>. While so-called <em>pure differential privacy</em>, i.e. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cepsilon%2C0%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\epsilon,0)}" class="latex" title="{(\epsilon,0)}" />-differential privacy has also been studied extensively, this notion is artificially restrictive and excludes many differentially private mechanisms. </em></p>

<p>Let’s take a dive into the problem of <em>private mean estimation</em> for some family <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{P}}" /> of multivariate distributions over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}^d}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}^d}" />. This problem has been studied for various families <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{P}}" /> and various choices of loss function. Here we focus on perhaps the simplest variant of the problem, in which <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{P}}" /> contains distributions of bounded support <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B%5Cpm+1%5D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[\pm 1]^d}" class="latex" title="{[\pm 1]^d}" /> and the loss is the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_2^2}" class="latex" title="{\ell_2^2}" /> error. We emphasize, however, that the methods we discuss here are quite versatile and can be used to derive minimax bounds for other variants of the mean-estimation problem.</p>

<p><a name="eqRd-minimax"></a> Recall that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde+%5CTheta%28f%28n%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde \Theta(f(n))}" class="latex" title="{\tilde \Theta(f(n))}" /> refers to a function which is both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28f%28n%29+%5Clog%5E%7Bc_1%7D+f%28n%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(f(n) \log^{c_1} f(n))}" class="latex" title="{O(f(n) \log^{c_1} f(n))}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5COmega%28f%28n%29+%5Clog%5E%7Bc_2%7D+f%28n%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Omega(f(n) \log^{c_2} f(n))}" class="latex" title="{\Omega(f(n) \log^{c_2} f(n))}" /> for some constants <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc_1%2C+c_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c_1, c_2}" class="latex" title="{c_1, c_2}" />. The proof of this lower bound is based on <em>robust tracing attacks</em>, also called <em>membership inference attacks</em>, which were developed in a chain of papers [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BUV14">BUV14</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSUV15">DSSUV15</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#BSU17">BSU17</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17a">SU17a</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#SU17b">SU17b</a>, <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#KLSU19">KLSU19</a>]. We remark that this lower bound is almost identical to the minimax bound for mean estimation proven in the much more recent work of Cai, Wang, and Zhang [<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#CWZ19">CWZ19</a>], but it lacks tight dependence on the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" />, which we discuss in the following remark.</p>

<p><b>Remark 3</b> <em> The choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3D+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta = 1/n}" class="latex" title="{\delta = 1/n}" /> in <a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#eqRd-minimax">(2)</a> may look strange at first. For the upper bound this choice is arbitrary—as we will see, we can upper bound the rate for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\delta &gt; 0}" /> at a cost of a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog%281%2F%5Cdelta%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log(1/\delta))}" class="latex" title="{O(\log(1/\delta))}" />. The lower bound applies only when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cleq+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta \leq 1/n}" class="latex" title="{\delta \leq 1/n}" />. Note that the rate is qualitatively different when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cgg+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta \gg 1/n}" class="latex" title="{\delta \gg 1/n}" />. However, we emphasize that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cepsilon%2C%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\epsilon,\delta)}" class="latex" title="{(\epsilon,\delta)}" />-differential privacy is not a meaningful privacy notion unless <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cll+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta \ll 1/n}" class="latex" title="{\delta \ll 1/n}" />. In particular, the mechanism that randomly outputs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta n}" class="latex" title="{\delta n}" /> elements of the sample satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%280%2C%5Cdelta%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(0,\delta)}" class="latex" title="{(0,\delta)}" />-differential privacy. However, when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cgg+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta \gg 1/n}" class="latex" title="{\delta \gg 1/n}" />, this mechanism completely violates the privacy of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\gg 1}" class="latex" title="{\gg 1}" /> person in the dataset. Moreover, taking the empirical mean of these <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta n}" class="latex" title="{\delta n}" /> samples gives rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%2F%5Cdelta+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d/\delta n}" class="latex" title="{d/\delta n}" />, which would violate our lower bound when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" /> is large enough. On the other hand, we would expect the minimax rate to become slower when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%5Cll+1%2Fn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta \ll 1/n}" class="latex" title="{\delta \ll 1/n}" />. This expectation is, in fact, correct, however the proof we present does not give the tight dependence on the parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" />.

<p><b>Tracing Attacks.</b></p>
<p>Before giving the formal proof, we will try to give some intuition for the high-level proof strategy. The proof can be viewed as constructing a <em>tracing attack </em>[<a href="https://kamathematics.wordpress.com/feed/#DSSU17">DSSU17</a>] (sometimes called a <em>membership inference attack</em>) of the following form. There is an attacker who has the data of some individual <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> chosen in one of the two ways: either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is a random element of the sample <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is an independent random sample from the population <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />. The attacker is given access to the true distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> and the outcome of the mechanism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M(X)}" class="latex" title="{M(X)}" />, and wants to determine which of the two is the case. If the attacker can succeed, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> cannot be differentially private. To understand why this is the case, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is a member of the dataset, then the attacker should say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is in the dataset, but if we consider the adjacent dataset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X'}" class="latex" title="{X'}" /> where we replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> with some independent sample from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />, then the attacker will now say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is independent of the dataset. Thus, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M(X)}" class="latex" title="{M(X)}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28X%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M(X')}" class="latex" title="{M(X')}" /> cannot be close in the sense required by differential privacy.</p>
<p>Thus, the proof works by constructing a test statistic <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ+%3D+Z%28M%28X%29%2CY%2CP%29%2C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z = Z(M(X),Y,P),}" class="latex" title="{Z = Z(M(X),Y,P),}" /> that the attacker can use to distinguish the two possibilities for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. In particular, we show that there is a distribution over populations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D%28Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}" class="latex" title="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}" /> is small when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is independent of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, but for <em>every</em> sufficiently accurate mechanism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+E%7D%28Z%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}" class="latex" title="{\mathop{\mathbb E}(Z)}" /> is large when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is a random element of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />.</p>

<div class="content">
John Conway passed away on April 11, 2020 of the Coronovirus. He is the first person I knew (for some definition of `know') who has died of it. I suspect this is true of many readers of this blog.<br />
(Fellow bloggers Scott Aaronson and Terry Tao have already posted about John Conway,<br />
<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/">here</a> and <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/04/12/john-conway/">here</a>. I suspect there will be others and when they do I will add it here.<br />
ADDED LATER: nice xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/2293/">here</a><br />
<br />
John Conway is a great example of how the line between recreational math and serious math is .... non-existent? not important? Take our pick.<br />
<br />
Examples<br />
<br />
1) Conway invented Surreal Numbers. These can be used to express infinitely big and infinitely small numbers. One can even make sense of things like square root of infinity.  Conway's book is called On Numbers and Games (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Numbers_and_Games">here</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Numbers-Games-John-H-Conway/dp/1568811276">here</a>) Two free sources: <a href="https://thatsmaths.com/2012/11/22/the-root-of-infinity-its-surreal/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Academics/Mathematics/Grimm.pdf">here</a>.<br />
<br />
<div>
Note that Conway defined surreals in terms of games. Are they fun games? Probably not, but they are games!</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
2)  Conway's Game of Life (you really do need to use his name, note the contrast between <i>The game</i> <i>of life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life">here</a> </i>and <i>Conway's Game of Life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">here</a></i></div>
<div>
<i><br /></i></div>
<div>
<div>
The game is simple (and this one IS fun). You begin with some set of dots placed at lattice points, and a set of rules to tell how they live, die, or reproduce.  The rules are always the same. Different initial patterns form all kinds of patterns.  Sounds fun! Is it easy to tell, given pattern P1 and P2 whether, starting with P1 you can get to P2. No. Its undecidable.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
So this simple fun game leads to very complicated patterns.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
And nice to have an undecidable problem that does not mention Turing Machines. (I will tell the students it is undecidable this semester, though I won't be proving it.)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
3)  Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy wrote <i>Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays  </i>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Ways_for_your_Mathematical_Plays">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Ways-Your-Mathematical-Plays/dp/1568811446">here</a></div>
</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
This is the ultimate book on NIM games.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
4) The above is probably what the readers of this blog are familiar with; however, according to his Wikipedia page (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">here</a>) he worked in Combinatorial Game Theory, Geometry, Geometric Topology, Group Theory, Number Theory, Algebra, Analysis, Algorithmics and Theoretical Physics.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
He will be missed.</div></div>

Or for the finest tribute I’ve seen so far, see a MathOverflow thread entitled <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/357197/conways-lesser-known-results">Conway’s lesser known results</a>.  Virtually everything there is a gem to be enjoyed by amateurs and experts alike.  And if you actually click through to any of Conway’s papers … oh my god, what a rebuke to the way most of us write papers!</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Horton Conway</a>, one of the great mathematicians and math communicators of the past half-century, has died at age 82.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> John’s widow, Diana Conway, left a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4732#comment-1836789">nice note</a> in the comments section of this post.  I wish to express my condolences to her and to all of the Conway children and grandchildren.</p></blockquote>



<p>Just a week ago, as part of her quarantine homeschooling, I introduced my seven-year-old daughter Lily to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>.  Compared to the other stuff we’ve been doing, like fractions and right triangles and the distributive property of multiplication, the Game of Life was a <em>huge</em> hit: Lily spent a full hour glued to the screen, watching the patterns evolve, trying to guess when they’d finally die out.  So this first-grader knew who John Conway was, when I told her the sad news of his passing.</p>



<p>“Did he die from the coronavirus?” Lily immediately asked.</p>



<p>“I doubt it, but I’ll check,” I said.</p>



<p>Apparently it <em>was</em> the coronavirus.  Yes, the self-replicating snippet of math that’s now terrorizing the whole human race, in part because those in power couldn’t or wouldn’t understand exponential growth.  Conway is perhaps the nasty bugger’s most distinguished casualty so far.</p>



<p>I regrettably never knew Conway, although I did attend a few of his wildly popular and entertaining lectures.  His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Numbers-John-H-Conway/dp/038797993X">The Book of Numbers</a> (coauthored with Richard Guy, who himself recently passed away at age 103) made a huge impression on me as a teenager.  I worked through every page, gasping at gems like e<sup>π√163</sup> (“no, you can’t be serious…”), embarrassed to be learning so much from a “fun, popular” book but grateful that my ignorance of such basic matters was finally being remedied.</p>



<p>A little like Pascal with his triangle or Möbius with his strip, Conway was fated to become best-known to the public not for his deepest ideas but for his most accessible—although for Conway, a principal puzzle-supplier to Martin Gardner for decades, the boundary between the serious and the recreational may have been more blurred than for any other contemporary mathematician.  Conway invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surreal_number">surreal number system</a>, discovered three of the 26 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporadic_group">sporadic simple groups</a>, was instrumental in the discovery of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine">monstrous moonshine</a>, and did many other things that bloggers more qualified than I will explain in the coming days.</p>



<p>Closest to my wheelhouse, Conway together with Simon Kochen waded into the foundations of quantum mechanics in 2006, with their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_theorem">“Free Will Theorem”</a>—a result Conway liked to summarize provocatively as “if human experimenters have free will, then so do the elementary particles they measure.”  I confess that I wasn’t a fan at the time—partly because Conway and Kochen’s theorem was really about “freshly-generated randomness,” rather than free will in any sense related to agency, but also partly because I’d already known the conceptual point at issue, but had considered it folklore (see, e.g., my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206089">2002 review</a> of Stephen Wolfram’s <em>A New Kind of Science</em>).  Over time, though, the “Free Will Theorem” packaging grew on me.  Much like with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem">No-Cloning Theorem</a> and other simple enormities, sometimes it’s worth making a bit of folklore so memorable and compelling that it will never be folklore again.</p>



<p>At a lecture of Conway’s that I attended, someone challenged him that his proposed classification of knots worked only in special cases.  “Oh, of course, this only classifies 0% of knots—but 0% is a start!” he immediately replied, to roars from the audience.  That’s just one line that I remember, but nearly everything out of his mouth was of a similar flavor.  I noted that part of it was in the delivery.</p>



<p>As a mathematical jokester and puzzler who could delight and educate anyone from a Fields Medalist to a first-grader, Conway had no equal.  For no one else who I can think of, even going back centuries and millennia, were entertainment and mathematical depth so closely marbled together.  Here’s to a well-lived Life.</p>

<p>The third Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place next Friday, April 17th at 11:00 AM Pacific Time (2:00 pm Eastern Time, 20:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC).  <strong>Shachar Lovett</strong> from UC San Diego will speak about “<em>The power of asking more informative questions about the data</em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Many supervised learning algorithms (such as deep learning) need a large collection of labelled data points in order to perform well. However, what is easy to get are large amounts of unlabelled data. Labeling data is an expensive procedure, as it usually needs to be done manually, often by a domain expert. Active learning provides a mechanism to bridge this gap. Active learning algorithms are given a large collection of unlabelled data points. They need to smartly choose a few data points to query their label. The goal is then to automatically infer the labels of many other data points.</p>



<p>In this talk, we will explore the option of giving active learning algorithms additional power, by allowing them to have richer interaction with the data. We will see how allowing for even simple types of queries, such as comparing two data points, can exponentially improve the number of queries needed in various settings. Along the way, we will see interesting connections to both geometry and combinatorics, and a surprising application to fine grained complexity.</p>



<p>Based on joint works with Daniel Kane, Shay Moran and Jiapeng Zhang.</p>

Nina Balcan is a leading researcher in the theory of machine learning. Nina is at Carnegie-Mellon and was previously at Georgia Tech—it was a major loss to have her leave Tech.</p>
<p>
Today we applaud her winning the ACM Hopper Award.<br />
<span id="more-16921"></span></p>
<p>
ACM President Cherri Pancake <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/news/news-archive/2020/april/machine-learning-professor-balcan-receives-acm-grace-hopper-award.html">says</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Although she is still in the early stages of her career, she has already established herself as the world leader in the theory of how AI systems can learn with limited supervision. More broadly, her work has realigned the foundations of machine learning, and consequently ushered in many new applications that have brought about leapfrog advances in this exciting area of artificial intelligence. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Hopper Award </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The ACM Grace Murray Hopper <a href="https://awards.acm.org/hopper/award-winners">Award</a> is given to: An outstanding young computer professional, on the basis of a single major contribution before the age of 35. Here are five of the most recent winners: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Constantinos Daskalakis, 	(<a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/daskalakis_4121823">2018</a>)	 <p></p>
</li><li>
Michael Freedman, 		(<a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/freedman_6665293">2018</a>)	 <p></p>
</li><li>
Amanda Randles, 		(<a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/randles_0365390">2017</a>)	 <p></p>
</li><li>
Jeffrey Heer, 			(<a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/heer_1520709">2016</a>)	 <p></p>
</li><li>
Brent Waters,			(<a href="https://awards.acm.org/award_winners/waters_3058089.cfm">2015</a>)
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Nina’s Contribution </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The Hopper award says it is for a “single” major contribution. I believe that Nina is almost a disproof of this statement: I fail to see how she only did one major contribution. In fact, the <a href="https://awards.acm.org/hopper">citation</a> lists three. In any event I thought we might look at one of her top results on learning. It is a <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/papers/agnostic-active.pdf">paper</a> from 2006 with over 400 citations. The ttile is “Agnostic Active Learning” and is joint with Alina Beygelzimer and John Langford.</p>
<p>
<em>Active learning</em> follows a classic idea in computer theory: Making a protocol interactive can often decrease the cost, and almost always makes the protocol more complex to understand. In active learning one is given unlabeled examples. As usual the goal is to classify the samples. However, as the samples are unlabelled, the learning can ask for labels for elected samples—this is the active part of the learning. As you might imagine asking for labels has a cost, so the learner strives to ask for the fewest labels possible. </p>
<p>
The savings can be large when the labels are perfect—that is, noise-free. In general it is much more complex to understand when active learning helps. Nina’s work found examples where noise can be tamed. Her award citation says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Balcan established performance guarantees for active learning that hold even in challenging cases when “noise” is present in the data. These guarantees hold under arbitrary forms of noise, that is, anything that distorts or corrupts the data. This can include anything from a blurry photo, a unit of data that is improperly labeled, meaningless information, or data that the algorithm cannot interpret. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
See her papers for the details. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Awards </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There are various awards for computer scientists, many are from the ACM. Since Alan Perlis won the first Turing award, there have been 69 more winners. Only three have been women:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Shafi Goldwasser, (2012) <p></p>
</li><li>
Barbara Liskov, (2008) <p></p>
</li><li>
Frances Allen, (2006)
</li></ul>
<p>Here is another quote from the president of the ACM: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We typically receive one woman nominee [for the Turing Award] every five years. It’s very disturbing. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The number of nominations is too small. There are plenty of strong women candidates for the Turing award, and for other awards. We need to do a better job. See <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/01/turing-award-acm-women-recipients.html">this</a> for more thoughts on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We do not know about the situation with nominations for the Hopper Award. Nina is only the seventh woman to win since 1971, but four of the last ten Hopper Award winners have been women. How can we recognize more women under 35 who are doing great work?</p>
<p>
Again we congratulate Nina Balcan on her richly deserved honor. </p>
<p>[Fixed typo “Congrats” ]</p></font></font></div>

<p><em>(If you’re not already following him, I highly recommend reading <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/">Luca Trevisan’s dispatches from Milan</a>, much more interesting than what I write below.)</em></p>



<p>On the topic of my <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/04/04/in-defense-of-expertise/">last post</a>, Ross Douthat writes in the New York Times that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/opinion/coronavirus-science-experts.html?smid=fb-share&amp;fbclid=IwAR1KIcMblvNsaKaAQTh2vCpB2yARYL8O5TVy9j3ZxSqsXsRAMK2GGcvF81o">“In the fog of coronavirus, there are no experts”</a>, even citing <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">Scott Aaronson’s post</a>. Both Aaronson and Douthat make the point that the COVID-19 crisis is so surprising and unprecedented, and experts were so much in the dark, that there is no reason to trust them over non expert “common sense” or “armchair epidemiologists”. <br /><br />It’s true that the “expert models” have significant uncertainty, hardwired constants, noisy data, and dubious assumptions. It is also true that many countries (especially those that didn’t learn from the 2003 SARS epidemic) bungled their initial response. But do we really need to challenge the notion of expertise itself? To what extent was this pandemic not predicted by experts or progressed in ways defying their expectations?</p>



<p>Here is what some of these experts and institutions were saying in the recent past:</p>



<p><em>“The thing I’m most concerned about … is the emergence of a new virus that the body doesn’t have any background experience with, that is very transmissible, highly transmissible from person to person, and has a high degree of morbidity and mortality … a respiratory illness that can spread even before someone is so sick that you want to keep them in bed.”</em>  <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dr-fauci-has-been-dreading-a-pandemic-like-covid-19-for-years/">Dr. Anthoni Fauci, 2019</a>.</p>



<p><em>“High-impact respiratory pathogens … pose particular global risks … [they] are spread via respiratory droplets; they can infect a large number of people very quickly and with today’s transportation infrastructure, move rapidly across multiple geographies. … There is insufficient R&amp;D investment and planning for innovative vaccine development and manufacture, broad-spectrum antivirals, … In addition, such a pandemic requires advance planning across multiple sectors … Epidemic control costs would completely overwhelm the current financing arrangements for emergency response.” </em><a href="https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/annual_report/GPMB_annualreport_2019.pdf">WHO world at risk report</a>, 2019.</p>



<p><em>“respiratory transmission …. is the transmission route posing the greatest pandemic risk   … [since it] can occur with coughing or simply breathing (in aerosol transmission), making containment much more challenging. …  If a pathogen is capable of causing asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections that either do not or only minimally interrupt activities of daily living, many individuals may be exposed. Viruses that cause the common cold, including coronaviruses, have this attribute.”</em> <a href="https://apps.who.int/gpmb/assets/thematic_papers/tr-6.pdf">JHU report</a>, 2019.</p>



<p>As an experiment, I also tried to compare the response of experts and “contrarians” in real time as the novel coronavirus was discovered, trying to see if it’s really the case that, as Douthat says, <em>“up until mid-March you were better off trusting the alarmists of anonymous Twitter than the official pronouncements from the custodians of public health”</em>.  I chose both experts and contrarians that are active on Twitter. I was initially planning to look at several people but due to laziness am just taking Imperial college’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Imperial_JIDEA/">J-IDEA institute</a> for the expert, and <a href="https://twitter.com/robinhanson">Robin Hanson</a> for the contrarian.  I also looked at <a href="https://twitter.com/DouthatNYT">Douthat’s twitter feed</a>, to see if he followed his own advice. Initially I thought I would go all the way to March but have no time so just looked at the period from January 1 till February 14th. I leave any conclusions to the reader.</p>



<h2><strong>January 1-19:</strong> </h2>



<p>(Context: novel coronavirus confirmed in Wuhan, initially unclear if there is human to human transmission – this was confirmed by China on January 20 though suspected before.)</p>



<p>Here is one of the many tweets by Imperial from this period:</p>

<p>I didn’t see any tweets from Hanson or Douthat on this topic.</p>



<h2><strong>January 20-31:</strong> </h2>



<p>(Context: first confirmed cases in several countries, including the US, WHO declares emergency in Jan 30, US restricts travel from China on Jan 31. By then there are about 10K confirmed cases and 213 deaths worldwide.)</p>



<p>On January 25th Imperial college estimated the novel coronavirus “R0” parameter as 2.6:</p>

<p>Still no tweet from Douthat on this topic though he did say in January 29th that compared to issues in the past the U.S.’s problems in the 2020’s are “problem of decadence” rather than any crisis like the late 1970’s:</p>

<p>Robin Hanson correctly realizes this is going to spread wide:</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Hanson tweets quite a lot about this, including potential social implications. Up to February 13th there is nothing too “contrarian” at this point, but also no information that could not be gotten from the experts:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>In February 14 Hansons makes a very contrarian position when he proposes “controlled infection” as a solution:</p>

<p>To the anticipated “you first” objection he responds <em>“I proposed compensating volunteers via cash or medical priority for associates, &amp; I’d seriously consider such offers.”</em>.  He doesn’t mention that he is much less strapped for cash than some of the would be “volunteers”. </p>



<p>Still no tweet from Douthat about COVID-19 though he does write that we live in an “age of decadence”:</p>

<p>What has been happening in Italy in the last few days, and what can other Western countries expect in the next week or two?</p>
<p>The national discourse has been obsessed with “The Peak,” that is, the time when things reach their worst point, and start improving after that. For the last several days, all indicators, such as new cases, deaths, and ICU occupancy, have been improving. Apparently, then,  “The Peak” is behind us. Virologists have been cautious to say that “peak” is the wrong mountain metaphor to use, and that we have rather reached a “plateau” in which things will change very slowly for a while. </p>
<p>Below is the number of confirmed covid-19 deaths in Italy updated with today’s data, showing that we reached the plateau a couple of weeks ago, meaning that the number of new cases started to plateau about a month ago, when the lockdown started.</p>
<p><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/italy-deaths.png?w=584" alt="italy-deaths" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4365" /></p>
<p>The data from New York City continues to track the data from Lombardy, so NYC should be just a few days away from its own plateau, if the match continues.</p>

<p>Given all this, people have been wondering when and how we will get out of the lockdown, and reach what everybody has been calling the “Phase Two” of this emergency.</p>
<p><span id="more-4361"></span></p>
<p>The lockdown is set to expire this coming Monday, and it is expected that tomorrow or Saturday the prime minister will announce new measures. (Perhaps, according to precedent, he will do so on Sunday night.) It is expected that the stay-at-home order will be extended to early May, or even mid-May, but that the definition of “essential activities” will be relaxed to allow some manufacturing to restart sooner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an infrastructure to isolate new cases and trace their contacts, which should have been frantically under construction over the last month, is still non-existent. Last week, the government nominated a committee of 70+ experts to “begin thinking about mapping out possibilities” for what such an infrastructure might be like.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not too confident that the “Phase Two” will be organized with Taiwanese, or even Korean, efficiency, and my only hope is that the number of cases in Lombardy has been so under-reported that we may already be close to herd immunity.</p>
<p>This is probably not the case, but not by a wide margin. The Italian Institute of Statistics has released 2019 vs 2020 all-cause mortality data from a representative sample of Italian towns. Apparently, during the worst days of March, all-cause mortality roughly doubled nation-wide, while the reported deaths caused by covid-19 account for only about half of the excess deaths. This might mean that there have been 20,000 covid-19 deaths and maybe 2 million infected people out of 10 million in Lombardy. A study of the Imperial College estimates, at the high end, that 6 million Italians have been infected, and since Lombardy’s  data has consistently accounted for half the national data on all measures, it would mean 3 million infected people in Lombardy, or 30%, which is within a factor of two of what might suffice for herd immunity. In any case we will not know until there is a randomized serologic study, which is something else for which experts are almost ready to begin mapping out ways of thinking about how to explore plans for … </p>
<p>What will life be like in “Phase Two”? If the epidemic continues at a slow burn, will we have to continue to keep a one-meter distance from strangers? Will trains and planes run with only every third seat occupied? Will tickets cost three times as much? Will beaches be open during the summer? Will there be riots if Italians are not allowed to go to the beach in August? Apart from the last question, whose answer is obviously yes, everything is up in the air.</p>
<p>What about me, after 32 days of lockdown? I was already in need of a haircut at the end of February, and lately the hair situation had become untenable, so I used my beard trimmer to blindly cut my hair. Mistakes were made, but I would not even rate it among my top ten worst haircuts ever. </p></div>

Reductions between problems, the mainstay of theoretical computer science, efficiently map an instance of one problem to an instance of another in such a way that solving the latter allows solving the former. The subject of this work is ``lossy'' reductions, where the reduction loses some information about the input instance. We show that such reductions, when they exist, have interesting and powerful consequences for lifting hardness into ``useful'' hardness, namely cryptography.

Our first, conceptual, contribution is a definition of lossy reductions in the language of mutual information. Roughly speaking, our definition says that a reduction $C$ is $t$-lossy if, for any distribution $X$ over its inputs, the mutual information $I(X;C(X)) \leq t$. Our treatment generalizes a variety of seemingly related but distinct notions such as worst-case to average-case reductions, randomized encodings (Ishai and Kushilevitz, FOCS 2000), homomorphic computations (Gentry, STOC 2009), and instance compression (Harnik and Naor, FOCS 2006).

We then proceed to show several consequences of lossy reductions:

1. We say that a language $L$ has an $f$-reduction to a language $L'$ for a Boolean function $f$ if there is a (randomized) polynomial-time algorithm $C$ that takes an $m$-tuple of strings $X = (x_1,\ldots,x_m)$, with each $x_i\in\{0,1\}^n$, and outputs a string $z$ such that with high probability, L'(z) = f(L(x_1),L(x_2),...,L(x_m))
        
2. Suppose a language $L$ has an $f$-reduction $C$ to $L'$ that is $t$-lossy. Our first result is that one-way functions exist if $L$ is worst-case hard and one of the following conditions holds:
   - $f$ is the OR function, $t \leq m/100$, and $L'$ is the same as $L$
   - $f$ is the Majority function, and $t \leq m/100$
   - $f$ is the OR function, $t \leq O(m\log{n})$, and the reduction has no error

This improves on the implications that follow from combining (Drucker, FOCS 2012) with (Ostrovsky and Wigderson, ISTCS 1993) that result in auxiliary-input one-way functions.

3. Our second result is about the stronger notion of $t$-compressing $f$-reductions -- reductions that only output $t$ bits. We show that if there is an average-case hard language $L$ that has a $t$-compressing Majority reduction to some language for $t=m/100$, then there exist collision-resistant hash functions.

This improves on the result of (Harnik and Naor, STOC 2006), whose starting point is a cryptographic primitive (namely, one-way functions) rather than average-case hardness, and whose assumption is a compressing OR-reduction of SAT (which is now known to be false unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses).

Along the way, we define a non-standard one-sided notion of average-case hardness, which is the notion of hardness used in the second result above, that may be of independent interest.</div>

<p>This post is simply to say the following (and thereby to make it common knowledge that I said it, and that I no longer give a shit who thinks less of me for saying it):</p>



<p>If the pandemic has radicalized you, I won’t think that makes you crazy.  It’s radicalized me, noticeably shifted my worldview.  And in some sense, I no more apologize for that, than I apologize for my worldview presumably differing from what it would’ve been in some parallel universe with no WWII.</p>



<p>If you suspect that all those earnest, well-intentioned plans and slogans about “flattening the curve” are wonderful and essential, but still, <em>“flattening” is only a desperate gambit to buy some time and nothing more</em>; still, flattening or no flattening, the fundamentals of the situation are that either</p>



<p>(1) a vaccine or cure gets discovered and deployed, or else</p>



<p>(2) we continue in quasi-lockdown mode for the rest of our lives, or else</p>



<p>(3) the virus spreads to the point where it definitely kills some people you know,</p>



<p>—if you suspect this, then at least in my book you’re not crazy.  I suspect the same.</p>



<p>If you still don’t understand, no matter how patiently it’s explained to you, why ~18 months is the <em>absolute bare minimum</em> needed to get a vaccine out; if all the talk of Phase 1, 2, and 3 trials and the need to learn more about rare side effects and so forth seems hard to square with the desperate world war that this is; if you wonder whether the Allied commanders and Allied medical authorities in WWII, transported to the present, would <em>agree</em> that 18 months is the bare minimum, or whether they’d already be distributing vaccines a month ago that probably work well enough and do bounded damage if they don’t—I hereby confess that I don’t understand it either.</p>



<p>If you wonder how the US will possibly hold an election in November that the world won’t rightly consider a sham—given that the only safe way will be universal vote-by-mail, but Trump and his five Vichy justices will never allow it—know that I wonder this too.</p>



<p>If you think that all those psychiatrists now doing tele-psychiatry should tell their patients, “listen, I’ve been noticing an unhealthy absence of panic attacks, obsessions about the government trying to kill your family, or compulsive disinfecting of doorknobs, so I think we’d better up your dose of pro-anxiety medication”—I’m with you.</p>



<p>If you see any US state that wants to avoid &gt;2% deaths, being pushed to the brink of openly defying the FDA, smuggling in medical supplies to escape federal confiscation, using illegal tests and illegal masks and illegal ventilators and illegal everything else, and you also see military commanders getting fired for going outside the chain of command to protect their soldiers’ lives, and you wonder whether this is the start of some broader dissolution of the Union—well, <em>I</em> don’t intend to repeat the mistake of underestimating this crisis.</p>



<p>If you think that the feds who <em>literally confiscate medical supplies before they can reach the hospitals</em>, might as well just shoot the patients as they’re wheeled into the ICU and say “we’re sorry, but this action was obligatory under directive 48c(7)”—I won’t judge you for feeling that way. </p>



<p>If you feel like, while there are still pockets of brilliance and kindness and inspiration and even heroism all over US territory, still, as a federal entity the United States <em>effectively no longer exists or functions</em>, at least not if you treat “try to stop the mass death of the population” as a nonnegotiable component of the “life, liberty, and happiness” foundation for the nation’s existence—if you think this, I won’t call you crazy.  I feel more like a citizen of nowhere every day.</p>



<p>If you’d jump, should the opportunity arise (as it won’t), to appoint Bill Gates as temporary sovereign for as long as this crisis lasts, and thereafter hold a new Constitutional Convention to design a stronger democracy, attempting the first-ever Version 2.0 (as opposed to 1.3, 1.4, etc.) of the American founders’ vision, this time with <em>even more</em> safeguards against destruction by know-nothings and demagogues—if you’re in for that, I don’t think you’re crazy.  I’m wondering where to sign up.</p>



<p>Finally, if you’re one of the people who constantly emails me wrong P=NP proofs or local hidden-variable explanations of quantum mechanics … sorry, I still think you’re crazy.  That stuff hasn’t been affected.</p>



<p>Happy Passover and Easter!</p></div>

July 17, 2020, Budapest, Hungary<br />
At the 21st ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (ACM EC ’20)</span></div>
<div><span>**In the event the in-person conference does not happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will hold the workshop virtually.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">SUBMISSIONS DUE May 18, 2020, 11:59pm PDT.</span></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Call for Papers: the 2nd Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>We solicit research contributions and participants for the 2nd Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation, to be held in conjunction with the Twenty-First ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (ACM EC ’20). </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>Based on the successful workshop last year, we aim to bring together again researchers and practitioners from diverse subareas of EC, who are interested in the intersection of human economic behavior and computation, to share new results and to discuss future directions for behavioral research related to economics and computation. It will be a full-day workshop, and will feature invited speakers, contributed paper presentations and a panel discussion. </span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>The gap between rationality-based analysis that assumes utility-maximizing agents and actual human behavior in the real world has been well recognized in economics, psychology and other social sciences. In recent years, there has been growing interest in conducting behavioral research across many of the sub-areas related to economics and computation to address this gap. In one direction, some of these studies leverage insights on human decision making from the behavioral economics and psychology literature to study economic and computational systems with human users. In the other direction, computational tools are used to study and gain insights on human behavior and a data-driven approach is used to learn behavior models from user-generated data.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
The 2nd Behavioral EC workshop aims to provide a venue for researchers and practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to computer science, economics, psychology and sociology, to exchange ideas related to behavioral research in economics and computation. In addition to sharing new results, we hope the workshop will foster a lively discussion of future directions and methodologies for behavioral research related to economics and computation as well as fruitful cross-pollination of behavioral economics, cognitive psychology and computer science. </span></div>
<div><span><br />
We welcome studies at the intersection of economic behavior and computation from a rich set of theoretical, experimental and empirical perspectives. The topics of interest for the workshop are behavioral research in all settings covered by EC, including but not limited to:</span></div>
<ul>
<li><span>Behavioral mechanism design and applied mechanism design</span></li>
<li><span>Boundedly-rational models of economic decision making</span></li>
<li><span>Empirical studies of human economic behavior</span></li>
<li><span>Model evaluation and selection based on behavioral data</span></li>
<li><span>Data-driven modelling</span></li>
<li><span>Online prediction markets, online experiments, and crowdsourcing platforms</span></li>
<li><span>Hybrid human-machine systems</span></li>
<li><span>Models and experiments about social considerations (e.g. fairness and trust) in decision making</span></li>
<li><span>Methods for behavioral EC: information aggregation, probability elicitation, quality control</span></li>
</ul>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><span><strong>Submission Instructions</strong><br />
</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #ff0000;">Submission deadline: May 18, 2020, 11:59pm PDT.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #ff0000;">Notification: June 11, 2020</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span>All submissions will be peer reviewed. We will give priority to new (unpublished) research papers but will also consider ongoing research and recently published papers that may be of interest to the workshop audience. For submissions of published papers, authors must clearly state the venue of publication. Position papers and panel discussion proposals are also welcome. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, significance, originality, research contribution, and likelihood to catalyze discussion. </span></div>
<div><span><br />
Submissions can be in any format and any length. We recommend the EC submission format. </span><span>The workshop will not have archival proceedings but will post accepted papers on the workshop website. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend and present their findings at the workshop.<p></p>
<p></p></span></div>
<div><span>Submissions should be uploaded to Easychair no later than May 18th, 2020, 11:59pm PDT. </span></div>

Shinichi Mochizuki is about to have his proof of the ABC conjecture <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mathematicians-shocked-paper-published">published</a> in a journal. The proof needs more than a ream of paper—that is, it is over 500 pages long. </p>
<p>
Today I thought we would discuss his claimed proof of this famous conjecture.</p>
<p>
The decision to published is also discussed in an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00998-2">article</a> in <em>Nature</em>. Some of the discussion we have seen <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11709">elsewhere</a> has been about personal factors. We will just comment briefly on the problem, the proof, and how to tell if a proof has problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Number theory is hard because addition and multiplication do not play well together. Adding numbers is not too complex by its self; multiplication by its self is also not too hard. For those into formal logic the theory of addition for example is decidable. So in principle there is no hard problem that only uses addition. None. A similar point follows for multiplication. </p>
<p>
But together addition and multiplication is hard. Of course Kurt Gödel proved that the formal theory of arithmetic is hard. It is not complete, for example. There must be statements about addition and multiplication that are unprovable in Peano Arithmetic. </p>
<p>
The ABC conjecture states a property that is between addition and multiplication. Suppose that 	</p>

The function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" title="{F(X)}" /> depends not on the size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> but on the multiplicative structure of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. That is the function depends on the multiplicative structure of the integers. Note, the bound 	</p>

<p>only needed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%2CC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A,B,C}" class="latex" title="{A,B,C}" /> were numbers larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. The stronger bound 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+F%28ABC%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " /></p>
<p>relies essentially on the finer structure of the integers. </p>
<p>
Roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X)}" class="latex" title="{F(X)}" /> operates as follows: Compute all the primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> that divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> be the product of all these primes. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28X%29+%5Cle+Q%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(X) \le Q^{2}}" class="latex" title="{F(X) \le Q^{2}}" /> works: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+Q%5E%7B2%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le Q^{2}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le Q^{2}. " /></p>
<p>The key point is: <i>Even if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7B100%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^{100}}" class="latex" title="{p^{100}}" />, for example, divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, we only include <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> in the product <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" />.</i> This is where the savings all comes from. This is why the ABC conjecture is hard: repeated factors are thrown away.</p>
<p>
Well not exactly, there is a constant missing here, the bound is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+%5Calpha+Q%5E%7B2%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le \alpha Q^{2} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le \alpha Q^{2} " /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\alpha&gt;0}" /> is a universal constant. We can replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%5E%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Q^{2}}" class="latex" title="{Q^{2}}" /> by a smaller number—the precise statement can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">here</a>. This is the ABC conjecture. </p>
<p>
The point here is that in many cases <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28ABC%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(ABC)}" class="latex" title="{F(ABC)}" /> is vastly smaller than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BABC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{ABC}" class="latex" title="{ABC}" /> and so that inequality 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+F%28ABC%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le F(ABC), " /></p>
<p>is much better than the obvious one of 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++C+%5Cle+ABC.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  C \le ABC. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  C \le ABC. " /></p>
<p>For example, suppose that one wishes to know if 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++5%5E%7Bz%7D+%3D+2%5E%7Bx%7D+%2B+3%5E%7By%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  5^{z} = 2^{x} + 3^{y}, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  5^{z} = 2^{x} + 3^{y}, " /></p>
<p>is possible. The ABC conjecture shows that this cannot happen for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{z}" class="latex" title="{z}" /> large enough. Note 	</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Is He Correct? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Eight years ago Mochizuki announced his <a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/papers-english.html">proof</a>. Now it is about to be published in a journal. He is famous for work in part of number theory. He solved a major open problem there years ago. This gave him instant credibility and so his claim of solving the ABC conjecture was taken seriously. </p>
<p>
For example, one of his papers is <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-kato/mochizuki.dm.pdf">The Absolute Anabelian Geometry of Canonical Curves</a>. The paper says: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How much information about the isomorphism class of the variety <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> is contained in the knowledge of the étale fundamental group? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A glance at this paper shows that it is for specialists only. But it does seem to be math of the type that we see all the time. And indeed the proof in his paper is long believed to be correct. This is in sharp contrast to his proof of the ABC conjecture. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Indicators of Correctness </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The question is: Are there ways to detect if a proof is (in)correct? Especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_long_mathematical_proofs">long</a> proofs? Are there ways that rise above just checking the proof line by line? By the way:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The length of unusually long proofs has increased with time. As a rough rule of thumb, 100 pages in 1900, or 200 pages in 1950, or 500 pages in 2000 is unusually long for a proof. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There are some ways to gain confidence. Here are some in my opinion that are useful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Is the proof understood by the experts? <p></p>
</li><li>
Has the proof been generalized? <p></p>
</li><li>
Have new proofs been found? <p></p>
</li><li>
Does the proof have a clear roadmap?
</li></ol>
<p>
The answer to the first question (1) seems to be no for the ABC proof. At least two world experts have raised concerns—see this <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/">article</a> in <em>Quanta</em>—that appear serious. The proof has not yet been generalized. This is an important milestone for any proof. Andrew Wiles famous proof that the Fermat equation 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E%7Bp%7D+%2B+y%5E%7Bp%7D+%3D+z%5E%7Bp%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x^{p} + y^{p} = z^{p}, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x^{p} + y^{p} = z^{p}, " /></p>
<p>has no solutions in integers for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bxyz+%5Cneq+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{xyz \neq 0}" class="latex" title="{xyz \neq 0}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp+%5Cge+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p \ge 3}" class="latex" title="{p \ge 3}" /> a prime has been extended. This certainly adds confidence to our belief that it is correct.</p>
<p>
Important problems eventually get other proofs. This can take some time. But there is almost always success in finding new and different proofs. Probably it is way too early for the ABC proof, but we can hope. Finally the roadmap issue: This means does the argument used have a nice logical flow. Proofs, even long proofs, often have a logic flow that is not too complex. A proof that says: Suppose there is a object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> with this property. Then it follows that there must be an object <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> Is more believable than one with a much more convoluted logical flow. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ivan Fesenko of Nottingham has written an <a href="https://www.maths.nottingham.ac.uk/plp/pmzibf/rpp.pdf">essay</a> about the proof and the decision to publish. Among factors he notes is “the potential lack of mathematical infrastructure and language to communicate novel concepts and methods”—noting the steep learning curve of trying to grasp the language and framework in which Mochizuki has set his proof. Will the decision to publish change the dynamics of this effort?</p>

Despite the interest in the complexity class MA, the randomized analog of NP, there is just a couple of known natural (promise-)MA-complete problems, the first due to Bravyi and Terhal (SIAM Journal of Computing 2009) and the second due to Bravyi (Quantum Information and Computation 2015). Surprisingly, both problems are stated using terminology from quantum computation. This fact makes it hard for classical complexity theorists to study these problems, and prevents possible progress, e.g., on the important question of derandomizing MA.

In this note we define a natural combinatorial problem called SetCSP and prove its MA-completeness. The problem generalizes the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) into constraints on sets of strings. This note is, in fact, a combination of previously known works: the brilliant work of Bravyi and Terhal, together with an observation made in our previous work (Aharonov and Grilo, FOCS 2019) that a restricted case of the Bravyi and Terhal's MA complete problem (namely, the uniform case) is already complete, and moreover, that this restricted case can be stated using a classical, combinatorial description. Here we flesh out this observation.

This note, along with a translation of the main result of Aharonov and Grilo to the SetCSP language, implies that finding a gap-amplification procedure for SetCSP problems (namely a generalization to SetCSPs of the gap-amplification used in Dinur's PCP proof) would imply MA=NP. This would provide a resolution of the major problem of derandomizing MA; in fact, the problem of finding gap-amplification for SetCSP is in fact equivalent to the MA=NP problem.</div>

<p>I hope all of you are keeping safe and healthy in these difficult times. Thank heavens we have our research and our math to keep our sanity…</p>



<p>This month has seen two papers, one on testing variable partitions and one on distributed isomorphism testing.</p>



<p><strong>Learning and Testing Variable Partitions</strong> by Andrej Bogdanov and Baoxiang Wang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12990">arXiv</a>). Consider a function \(f:\Sigma^n \to G\), where \(G\) is Abelian group. Let \(V\) denote the set of variables. The function \(f\) is \(k\)-separable if there is a partition \(V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\) of $V$ such that \(f(V)\) can be expressed as the sum \(f_1(V_1) + f_2(V_2) + \ldots + f_k(V_k)\). This is an obviously natural property to study, though the specific application mentioned in the paper is high-dimensional reinforcement learning control. There are a number of learning results, but we’ll focus on the main testing result. The property of \(k\)-separability can be tested with \(O(kn^3/\varepsilon)\) queries, for \(\Sigma = \mathbb{Z}_q\) (and distance between functions is the usual Hamming distance). There is an analogous result (with different query complexity) for \(\Sigma = \mathbb{R}\). It is also shown that testing 2-separability requires \(\Omega(n)\) queries, even with 2-sided error. The paper, to its credit, also has empirical studies of the learning algorithm with applications to reinforcement learning.</p>



<p><strong>Distributed Testing of Graph Isomorphism in the CONGEST model </strong>by Reut Levi and Moti Medina (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00468.pdf">arXiv</a>). This result follows a recent line of research in distributed property testing algorithms. The main aim is to minimize the number of rounds of (synchronous) communication for a property testing problem. Let \(G_U\) denote the graph representing the distributive network. The aim is to test whether an input graph \(G_K\) is isomorphic to \(G_U\). The main property testing results are as follows. For the dense graph case, isomorphism can be property tested (with two-sided error) in \(O(D + (\varepsilon^{-1}\log n)^2) \) rounds, where \(D\) is the diameter of the graph and \(n\) is the number of nodes. (And, as a reader of this blog, you probably know what \(\varepsilon\) is already…). There is a standard \(\Omega(D)\) lower bound for distributed testing problems. For various classes of sparse graphs (like bounded-degree minor-free classes), constant time isomorphism (standard) property testers are known. This paper provides a simulation argument showing that standard/centralized \(q\)-query property testers can be implemented in the distributed model, in \(O(Dq)\) rounds (this holds for any property, not just isomorphism). Thus, these simulations imply \(O(D)\)-round property testers for isomorphism for bounded-degree minor-free classes.</p></div>

<p>I’m thinking of writing a novel where human civilization is threatened by a global pandemic, and is then almost singlehandedly rescued by one man … a man who reigned for decades as the world’s prototypical ruthless and arrogant tech billionaire, but who was then transformed by the love of his wife.  That is, <em>if</em> the billionaire can make it past government regulators as evil as they are stupid.  I need some advice: how can I make my storyline a bit subtler, so critics don’t laugh it off as some immature nerd fantasy?</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Updates (April 5):</span></strong> Thanks to several commenters for emphasizing that the wife needs to be a central character here: I agree!  The other thing is, I don’t want Fox News cheering my novel for its <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> vibe.  So maybe the pandemic is only surging out of control in the US because of the incompetence of a Republican president?  I don’t want to go ridiculously overboard, but like, maybe the president is some thuggish conman with the diction of a 5-year-old, who the deluded Republicans cheer anyway?  And maybe he’s also a Bible-thumping fundamentalist?  OK, that’s too much, so maybe the fundamentalist is like the <em>vice</em> president or something, and he gets put in charge of the pandemic response and then sets about muzzling the scientists?  As I said, I really need advice on making the messages subtler.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In Banach space theory, Rademacher type is an important invariant that controls many geometric and probabilistic properties of normed spaces. It is of considerable interest in various settings to understand to what extent such powerful tools extend to general metric spaces. A natural metric analogue of Rademacher type was proposed by Enflo in the 1960s-70s, and has found a number of interesting applications. Despite much work in the intervening years, however, the relationship between Rademacher type and Enflo type has remained unclear. This basic question is settled in joint work with Paata Ivanisvili and Sasha Volberg: in the setting of Banach spaces, Rademacher type and Enflo type coincide. The proof is based on a very simple but apparently novel insight on how to prove dimension-free inequalities on the Boolean cube. I will not assume any prior background in Banach space theory in the talk.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>Scott Aaronson blogged in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4695">defense of “armchair epidemiology”</a>. Scott makes several points I agree with, but he also advocates that rather than discounting ideas from “contrarians” who have no special expertise in the matter, each one of us should evaluate the input of such people on its merits.</p>



<p>I disagree. I can judge on their merits the validity of a proposed P vs NP proof or a quantum algorithm for SAT, but I have seen time and again smart and educated non-experts misjudge such proposals. As much as I’d like to think otherwise, I would probably be fooled just as easily by a well-presented proposal in area X that “brushes under the rug” subtleties that experts in X would immediately notice.</p>



<p>This is not to say that non experts should stay completely out of the matter. Just like scientific journalists such as Erica Klarreich and Kevin Hartnett of quanta can do a great job of explaining computer science topics to lay audience, so can other well-read people serve as “signal boosters” and highlight works of experts in epidemiology. Journalist Helen Branswell of <a href="https://www.statnews.com/">stat news</a> has been following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/media/stat-news-boston-coronavirus.html">novel coronavirus since January 4th</a>. </p>



<p>The difference is that these journalists don’t pretend to see what the experts are missing but rather to highlight and simplify the works that experts are already doing. This is unlike “contrarians” such as Robin Hanson that do their own analysis on a spreadsheet and come up with a “home brewed” policy proposal such as <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/02/consider-controlled-infection.html">deliberate infection</a> or <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/03/variolation-may-cut-covid19-deaths-3-30x.html">variolation</a> (with “hero hotels” in which people go to be deliberately infected). I am not saying that such proposals are necessarily wrong, but I am saying that I (or anyone else without the experience in this field) am not qualified to judge them. Even if they did “make sense” to me (they don’t) I would not feel any more confident in judging them than I would in reviewing a paper in astronomy. There is a reason why Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research">“no original research”</a> policy.</p>



<p>Moreover, the attitude of dismissing expertise can be dangerous, whether it comes in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teach_the_Controversy">“teach the debate”</a> in the context of evolution, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy">“ClimateGate”</a> in the context of climate change. Unlike the narrative of few brave “dissenters” or “contrarians”, in the case of COVID-19, experts as well as the world health organization have been literally sounding the alarm (see also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html">timeline</a>, as well as this NPR story on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/03/826945368/how-the-united-states-failed-to-see-the-coronavirus-crisis-coming">US response</a>). Yes, some institutions, and especially the U.S., failed in several aspects (most importantly in the early production of testing). But one of the most troubling aspects is the constant sense of  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-medical-advisers.html">“daylight”</a>  and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/26/trump-backers-coronavirus-conspiracy-117781">distrust</a> between the current U.S. administration and its own medical experts. Moreover, the opinions of people such as  <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-contrarian-coronavirus-theory-that-informed-the-trump-administration">law professor Richard Epstein</a> are listened to even when they are far out of their depth. It is one thing to entertain the opinion of non-expert contrarians when we have all the time in the world to debate, discuss and debunk. It’s quite another to do so in the context of a fast-moving health emergency.  COVID-19 is an emergency that has medical, social, economical, and technological aspects, but it would best be addressed if each person contributes according to their skill set and collaborates with people of complementary backgrounds.</p>

This post is devoted to the second interview with the <a href="https://concur2020.forsyte.at/test-of-time/index.html">colleagues</a> who were selected for the first edition of the CONCUR  Test-of-Time Award. (See <a href="https://processalgebra.blogspot.com/2020/04/an-interview-with-davide-sangiorgi.html">here</a> for the interview with Davide Sangiorgi.) I asked <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lynch/">Nancy Lynch</a> (MIT, USA) and <a href="http://profs.sci.univr.it/~segala/">Roberto Segala</a> (University of Verona, Italy) a few questions via email and I copy their answers below. Let  me thank Nancy and Roberto for their answers. I trust that readers of this blog will find them interesting and inspiring.<br /><br />Luca:  You receive one of the two CONCUR ToT Awards for the period 1992-1995 for your paper "<a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Segala/CONCUR94.pdf">Probabilistic simulations for probabilistic processes</a>", presented at CONCUR 1994. Could you tell us briefly what spurred you to develop the “simple” probabilistic automaton model introduced in that paper and how the ideas underlying that notion came about?<br /><br />Roberto: We were studying randomized distributed algorithms and we noted that several algorithms suffered from subtle errors. We were looking for a formal, rigorous way to study the correctness of those algorithms and in particular we were trying to extend the hierarchical approach used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_automaton">I/O automata</a>.  We knew that there was already an extensive literature within concurrency theory, but we were not able to use the theory to express even the simple idea that you may choose internally between flipping a fair or a biased coin; the existing approaches were extending labeled transition systems by adding probabilities to the arcs, losing the ability to distinguish between probabilistic and nondeterministic choice. The fact that the axioms for nondeterministic choice were not valid in most probabilistic calculi was further evidence of the problem. Starting from the observation that in the non-probabilistic world a step of a distributed algorithm corresponds to a transition of an I/O automaton, we tried to extend the notion of transition so that the process of flipping a coin could be represented by the "new" entity.  This led to the idea of "replacing points with measures" within ordinary automata and/or ordinary labeled transition systems. The idea worked very well for our analysis of randomized distributed algorithms, but we also wanted to validate it by checking whether it would simplify the concurrency-theoretical approach to probability. We decided to use simulation relations for our test, and indeed it worked and led to the CONCUR 1994 paper.<br /><br />Nancy: For background for this paper, we should recall that, at the time,  there was a divergence in styles of modeling for distributed systems, between different concurrency theory research communities.   The style I had been using since the late 70s for modeling distributed algorithms involved interactive state machines, such as I/O automata, which are based on a set-theoretic foundation.  Such models are good for describing distributed algorithms, and for analyzing them for both correctness and costs.  On the other hand, the predominant style in the European concurrency community was more syntactic, based on logical languages like PCTL or various process algebras.  These were good for formal verification, and for studying expressive power of different formalisms, but not great for analyzing complicated distributed algorithms.  Our models were in the general spirit of the Labeled Transition System (LTS) models previously studied in Europe.  When Roberto came to MIT, he and I set about to extend prior modeling work for distributed systems to the probabilistic setting.  To do this, we considered both the set-theoretic and logical approaches.  We   needed to bridge the gap between them, which led us to the ideas in this paper.<br /><br />Luca:  How much of your later work has built on your CONCUR 1994 paper? What follow-up results of yours are you most proud of and why?<br /><br />Roberto: Besides using the results of the paper for the analysis of several randomized distributed algorithms, we worked jointly as well as independently on the study of the theory and on the analysis of security protocols. In collaboration with <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~fvaan/">Frits Vaandrager</a>, we were able to discover different ways to analyze security in a hierarchical and compositional way. Furthermore, since in simple probabilistic automata probability and nondeterminism are well separated, it was easy to include computational complexity into the analysis of security protocols. This is work I did in collaboration with Andrea Turrini. The clear separation between probability and nondeterminism turned out to extend our approach to real-time models, leading to notions like Probabilistic Timed Automata and to several of the elements behind the first sketches of the probabilistic model checker <a href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">PRISM</a> in collaboration with the group of <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/marta.kwiatkowska/">Marta Kwiatkowska</a>.<br /><br />Nancy: Roberto and I continued working on probabilistic models, in the set-theoretic style, for several years.  As Roberto notes, Frits Vaandrager also became  a major collaborator.  Some of our more recent papers following this direction are:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.sws.cs.ru.nl/publications/papers/fvaan/CPA.html">Compositionality for Probabilistic Automata</a>, CONCUR 2003, </li><li><a href="https://www.sws.cs.ru.nl/publications/papers/fvaan/LSVsiam/">Observing Branching Structure through Probabilistic Contexts</a>, SIAM  Journal of Computing 2007, </li><li><a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Kirli/dilsun-icalp-tr.pdf">Task-Structured Probabilistic I/O Automata</a>, JCSS 2018.  </li></ul>This last  paper provides a kind of compositional foundation for combining  security protocols.  The key idea was to weaken the power of the adversary, making it more "oblivious".  In other related work, my students and I have worked extensively on  probabilistic distributed algorithms since then.  The models are similar to those developed in this early paper.  Examples include  wireless network algorithms, and more recently, biologically-inspired  algorithms, such as insect colony algorithms and neural network   algorithms.  I can't pinpoint a specific result that relies heavily on  the 1994 paper, but that paper certainly provided inspiration and foundation for the  later work.<br /><br />Luca:  Did you imagine at the time that the CONCUR 1994 paper and its journal version would have so much impact? In your opinion, what is the most interesting or unexpected use in the literature of the notions and techniques you developed in your award-winning paper?<br /><br />Roberto: We knew that the change of view proposed in the paper would have simplified the study and extension of several other concepts within concurrency theory, but we did not have any specific expectations. The collaboration on the PRISM project and on Probabilistic Timed Automata made more evident that there was a connection with Markov Decision Processes, which lead to a fruitful cross-fertilization between artificial intelligence, model checking, and concurrency theory.  It was a long exchange of ideas between a world interested in existential quantification, that is, find an optimal policy to achieve a goal, and universal quantification, that is to make sure that under any scheduler, policy, adversary, a system behaves correctly. The consequences of such exchange were many and unexpected.<br /><br />Nancy: No, I did not anticipate that it would have broad impact, though of course I thought the ideas were important.  But in general, I am  bad at predicting what will appeal to others and inspire them to further work.<br /><br />Luca:  The journal version of your paper appears in the Nordic Journal on Computing, which is not a prime venue. Did you ever regret not publishing that work somewhere else?  What is your take on the trend of using the perceived quality of a publication venue to evaluate research quality?<br /><br />Roberto: Within semantics I know of a few technical reports that are much more influential than most journal papers; I do not think that the venue of a paper should be given much importance. On the other hand, venue as an evaluation tool is more objective, allows an evaluator to consider many papers without reading them, and protects the evaluator from any type of claim against decisions, which sometimes may have even legal consequences.  Needless to say that I do not agree with any of the ideas above.  I do not agree as well with the other emerging trend of counting papers to evaluate quality. One good paper is much better than ten mediocre papers. What worries me the most is that young researchers may have a hard time to concentrate on quality if they have to focus on venue and quantity. I feel I was lucky not to have to worry about these issues when we submitted our paper for the special issue of the Nordic Journal of Computing.<br /><br />Nancy:   I certainly never regretted the venue for this paper.  In general, I haven't paid too much attention to choice of publication venue.  The main thing is to reach the audience you want to reach, which can be done through prestigious journals, less prestigious journals, conferences, or even ArXiv technical reports and some publicity.  It’s good to get feedback from referees, though. For evaluations, say for hiring or promotion, I think it’s fair to take many factors into account in evaluating research quality.  Venues, number of citations, special factors about different fields,… all can be discussed by hiring and promotion committees.  But I hope that those committees also take the time to actually read and consider the work itself.<br /><br />Luca:  The last thirty years have seen a huge amount of work on probabilistic models of computation and on the development of proof techniques and tools based on them. What advice would you give to a young researcher interested in working on probabilistic models in concurrency today?<br /><br />Roberto: My first advice would be to keep things simple and to focus on key ideas, possibly under the guidance of multiple application scenarios. When we study probabilistic concurrency, especially in contexts where the external world is governed by non-discrete laws, the interplay between different features of the model may become overwhelmingly complex. Of course it is a nice exercise to dive into all the details and see what it leads to, or to extend known results to the new scenarios, but how about checking whether some simple changes to one of the building blocks could make life easier?  Unfortunately, working on building blocks is risky. So, my second advice is to dive into details and write papers, but take some breaks and think whether there may be nicer ways to solve the same problems.<br /><br />Nancy: Pick some particular application domain, and make sure that the models  and techniques you develop work well for that application.  Don't work  on the theory in a vacuum.  The models will turn out much better!  Perhaps simpler, as Roberto says.<br /><br />Luca:  What are the research topics that currently excite you the most?<br /><br />Roberto: Difficult question. There are many things I like to look at, but at the moment I am very curious about how quantum computing can fit in a nice and elementary way into a concurrency framework.<br /><br />Nancy: Probabilistic algorithms, especially those that are flexible (work in  different environments), robust to failures and noise, and adaptive to  changes.  This includes such topics as wireless network algorithms,   robot swarms, and biologically-inspired algorithms.<br /><br /><b>Acknowledgements:</b> Many thanks to <a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Ilaria.Castellani/">Ilaria Castellani</a>, who pointed out some typos in the original version of this text.</div>

<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I want to illustrate how computers can be great allies in designing (and verifying) convergence proofs for first-order optimization methods. This task can be daunting, and highly non-trivial, but nevertheless usually unavoidable when performing complexity analyses. A notable example is probably the convergence analysis of the stochastic average gradient (SAG) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.2388.pdf">1</a>], whose original proof was computer assisted.</p>



<p class="justify-text">To this end, we will mostly spend time on what is referred to as <em>performance estimation problems</em> (PEPs), introduced by Yoel Drori and Marc Teboulle [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-013-0653-0">2</a>]. Performance estimation is also closely related to the topic of <em>integral quadratic constraints</em> (IQCs), introduced in the context of optimization by Laurent Lessard, Benjamin Recht and Andrew Packard [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>]. In terms of presentations, IQCs  leverages control theory, whereas PEPs might seem more natural in the optimization community. This blog post essentially presents PEPs from the point of view of [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>], instantiated on a running example.</p>



<h2>Overview, motivations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">First-order methods for continuous optimization belong to the large panel of algorithms that are usually approached via worst-case analyses. In this context, analyses rely on combining inequalities (that are due to assumptions on the problem classes), in potentially long, non-intuitive, and technical, proofs. For the insiders, those proofs all look very similar. For the outsiders, those proofs all look rather repelling, technical (long pages of chained inequalities), probably not interesting, and like computer codes: usually intuitive mostly for their authors.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, I want to show how (and why) those proofs are indeed all very similar. On the way, I want to emphasize how those combinations of inequalities are related to the “true essence” of worst-case analyses (which rely on computing worst-case scenarios), and to provide examples on how to constructively obtain them.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We take the stand of illustrating the PEP approach on a single iteration of gradient descent, as it essentially contains all necessary ingredients to understand the methodology in other contexts as well. Certain details of the following text are (probably unavoidably) a bit technical. However, going through the detailed computations is not essential, and the text should contain the necessary ingredients for understanding the essence of the methodology.</p>



<h2>Running example: gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us consider a naive, but standard, example: unconstrained convex minimization $$x_\star= \underset{x\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\mathrm{arg min}} f(x)$$with gradient descent: \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\). Let us assume \(f(\cdot)\) to be continuously differentiable, to have a \(L\)-Lipschitz gradient (a.k.a., \(L\)-smoothness), and to be \(\mu\)-strongly convex. Those functions satisfy, for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\):<br />– strong convexity, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Definition 2.1.2]: $$\tag{1}f(x) \geqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{\mu}{2} \lVert x-y\rVert^2,$$- smoothness, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.5]: $$\tag{2} f(x) \leqslant      f(y)+\langle{\nabla f(y)}; {x-y}\rangle+\tfrac{L}{2}\lVert x-y\rVert^2.$$Let us recall that in the case of twice continuously differentiable functions, smoothness and strong convexity amount to requiring  that $$\mu I \preccurlyeq \nabla^2 f(x) \preccurlyeq L I,$$ for some \(0&lt; \mu&lt;L&lt; \infty\) and for all \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) (in other words, all eigenvalues of \(\nabla^2 f(x)\) are between \(\mu\) and \(L\)). In what follows, we denote by \(\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}\) the class of \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions (irrespective of the dimension \(d\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="473" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/SmoothStronglyConvex.png" height="204" />Figure 1: the blue function is \(L\)-smooth and \(\mu\)-strongly convex (it is possible to create respectively global upper and lower quadratic bounds from every \(x\in\mathbb{R}^d\) with respectively curvatures \(L\) and \(\mu\)).</figure></div>
</div></div>



<p class="justify-text">In this context, convergence of gradient descent can be studied in many ways. Here, for the sake of the example, we will do it in terms of two base quantities: distance to optimality \(\lVert x_k-x_\star\rVert\), and function value accuracy \(f(x_k)-f(x_\star)\). There are, of course, infinitely many other possibilities, such as gradient norm \(\rVert \nabla f(x_k)\lVert\), Bregman divergence \(f(x_\star)-f(x_k)-\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\), or even best function value observed throughout the iterations \(\min_{0\leq i\leq k} \{f(x_i)-f(x_\star)\}\): the reader can adapt the lines below for his/her favorite criterion. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For later reference, let us provide another inequality that is known to  hold for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^d\) for any \(L\)-smooth \( \mu\)-strongly convex function: <br />– bound on inner product, see, e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>,  Theorem 2.1.11]: $$\langle{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)};{x-y}\rangle  \geqslant        \tfrac{1}{L+\mu} \lVert{\nabla f(x)-\nabla f(y)}\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu  L}{L+\mu}\lVert{x-y}\rVert^2.\tag{3}$$ In the case \(\mu=0\) this inequality is known as “cocoercivity”. This (perhaps mysterious) inequality happens to play an important role in convergence proofs.</p>



<h3>A standard convergence result</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by stating two known results along with their simple proofs (see, e.g.,  [<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-8853-9">5</a>, Theorem 2.1.14] or [6, Section 1.4.2, Theorems 2 &amp; 3]):<br />– convergence in distance:  $$\begin{array}{rl}    \rVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\lVert^2&amp;= \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma^2\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert-2\gamma\langle{\nabla f(x_k)};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \     &amp; \leqslant      \left(1-\tfrac{2\gamma L \mu}{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2+\gamma\left(\gamma-\tfrac2{L+\mu}\right)\lVert{\nabla f(x_k)}\rVert^2, \end{array} $$ where the second line follows from smoothness and strong convexity of \(f\) via the bound (3) on the inner product (with \(x=x_k\) and \(y=x_\star\)). For the particular choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), the second term on the right hand side disappears, and we end up with<br />     $$\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^2\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,$$ which, following from \(0&lt;\mu&lt;L&lt;\infty\), satisfies \(0&lt; \tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}&lt;1\), hence proving linear convergence of gradient descent in this setup, by recursively applying the previous inequality: $$ \lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{2k}\lVert{x_0-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$ – Convergence in function values: one can simply use the result in distance along with the previous basic inequalities (1) and (2) characterizing smoothness and strong convexity (both with \(y=x_\star\)):<br />     $$f(x_k)-f(x_\star) \leqslant \hspace{-.15cm}\tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2  \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}    \tfrac{L}{2}\hspace{-.1cm}\left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k} \rVert{x_0-x_\star}\lVert^2 \leqslant  \hspace{-.15cm}     \tfrac{L}{\mu}\hspace{-.1cm} \left(\tfrac{L-\mu}{L+\mu}\right)^{\hspace{-.1cm}2k}(f(x_0)-f(x_\star)).$$  It is also possible to directly look for convergence in terms of function values, but it is then usually unclear in the literature what inequalities to use, and I am not aware of any such proof leading to the same rate without the leading \(\tfrac{L}{\mu}\) (except the proof presented below).</p>



<p class="justify-text">At this point, even in this toy example, a few very legitimate questions can be raised:<br />– can we improve anything? Can gradient descent really behaves like that on this class of functions?<br />– How could we have guessed the inequality to use, and the shape of the corresponding proof? Obviously, the obscure fact is to arrive to inequality (1).  Therefore, is there a principled way for choosing the right inequalities to use, for example for studying convergence in terms of other quantities, such as  function values?<br />– Is this the unique way to arrive to the desired result? If yes, how likely are we to find such proofs for more complicated cases (algorithms and/or function class)?</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the specific step size choice \(\gamma=\tfrac2{L+\mu}\), a partial answer to the first question is obtained by the observation that the rate is actually achieved on the quadratic function<br /> $$f(x)=\tfrac12 \, x^\top \begin{bmatrix}<br /> L &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \mu<br /> \end{bmatrix}x.$$ The following lines precisely target the missing answers.</p>



<h2>Worst-case analysis through worst-case scenarios</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let us start by rephrasing our goal, and restrict ourselves to the study of a single iteration. We fix our target to finding the smallest possible value of \(\rho\) such that the inequality<br /> $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant       \rho^2 \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 $$ is valid for all \(x_k\) and \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k)\) (hence \(\rho\) is a function of \(\gamma\)). In other words, our goal is to solve<br />$$ \rho^2(\gamma):= \sup \left\{ \frac{\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0\right\}.$$<br />Alternatively, we could be interested in studying convergence in other forms: for function values, we could target to solve the slightly modified problem:<br /> $$ \sup  \left\{ \frac{f(x_{k+1})-f(x_\star)}{f(x_{k})-f(x_\star)}\, \big|\, f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma \nabla f(x_k),\, \nabla f(x_\star)=0 \right\}.$$ It turns out that in both cases, the problem can be solved both numerically to high precision, and analytically, and that the answer is \(\rho^2(\gamma)=\max\{(1-\mu\gamma)^2,(1-L\gamma)^2\}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The only thing we did, so far, was to explicitly reformulate the problem of finding the best (smallest) convergence rate as the problem of finding the worst-case scenario, nothing more. In what follows, some parts might become slightly technical, but the overall idea is only to reformulate this problem of finding the worst-case scenarios, for solving it.</p>



<h3>Dealing with an infinite-dimensional variable: the function \(f\)</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The first observation is that the problem of computing \(\rho\) is stated as an infinite-dimensional optimization problem: we are looking for the worst possible problem instance (a function \(f\) and an initial point \(x_k\)) within a predefined class of problems. The first step we take to work around this is to reformulate it in the following equivalent  form (note that we maximize also over the dimension \(d\)—we discuss later how to remove it):<br />$$\begin{array}{rl} \rho^2:= \underset{f,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}{\sup} &amp;\displaystyle \frac{\lVert{x_{k}-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\\<br /> \text{s.t. }    &amp; \exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}:\, g_k= \nabla f(x_k),\, 0=\nabla f(x_\star).<br />\end{array}$$<br />This problem intrinsically does not look better (it contains an  existence constraint), but it allows using mathematical tools which are referred to as  <em>interpolation,</em> or <em>extension</em>, theorems [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00241.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01530908/file/DHLL_appendix.pdf">8</a>]. The problem is depicted on Figure 2:</p>

<p class="justify-text">It turns out that convex interpolation (that is, neglecting smoothness and strong convexity) is actually rather simple:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>given a convex function and an index set \(I\), any set of samples \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) of the form \(\{(\text{coordinate}, \text{(sub)gradient}, \text{function value})\}\)) satisfies, for all \(i,j\in I\): $$f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle g_j; x_i-x_j\rangle,$$ by definition of subgradient, as illustrated on Figure 3.</li></ul>

<ul class="justify-text"><li>In the other direction, given a set of triplets \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) satisfying the previous inequality for all pairs \(i,j\in I\), one can simply recover a  convex function by the following construction: $$f(x)=\underset{i\in I}{\max}\{ f_i+\langle g_i;x-x_i\rangle\},$$ which is depicted on Figure 4.</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="487" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/InterpolateCvx.png" height="207" />Figure 4: some set \(\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) and its piecewise affine interpolant \(f(x)=\underset{i\in I}{\max}\{ f_i+\langle g_i;x-x_i\rangle\}\).</figure></div>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Formally, the reasoning allows arriving to the following “convex interpolation” (or “convex extension”) result, where we denote the set of (closed, proper) convex functions by \(\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}\) (to be understood as \(L\)-smooth \(\mu\)-strongly convex functions with \(\mu=0\) and \(L=\infty\)): $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{0,\infty}: \,  g_k\in\partial f(x_k) \text{ and } f_k=f(x_k) \ \ \forall k\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\ f_i \geqslant       f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle\quad \forall i,j\in I,\end{array}$$ where \(\partial f(x)\) denotes the subdifferential of \(f\) at \(x\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In the next section, we use a similar interpolation result for taking smoothness and strong convexity into account. The result is a bit more technical, but follows from similar constructions as those for convex interpolation—the main difference being that the interpolation is done on the Fenchel conjugate instead, in order to incorporate smoothness, see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Section 2].</p>



<h3>Reformulation through convex interpolation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Back to the problem of computing worst-case scenarios, we can now reformulate the existence constraint <em>exactly</em> using the following result (see [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>,  Theorem 4]): let \(I\) be a finite index set and let \( S=\{(x_i,g_i,f_i)\}_{i\in I}\) be a set of triplets, then<br />  $$\begin{array}{c}\exists f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L}: \,  g_i=\nabla f(x_i) \text{ and } f_i=f(x_i) \text{ for all } i\in  I\\ \Leftrightarrow\\  f_i \geqslant      f_j+\langle{g_j};{x_i-x_j}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_i-g_j}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_i-x_j-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_i-g_j)}\rVert^2  \,\,\, \forall i,j\in I.\end{array}$$ Therefore, the previous problem can be reformulated as (recalling that \(g_\star=0\))<br />$$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle\frac{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br />      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br />      &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2.<br />\end{array}$$ </p>



<h3>Quadratic reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The next step is to remove the ratio appearing in the objective function, which we do via an homogeneity argument, as follows.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Starting from a feasible point, scale \(x_k,\,x_\star,g_k\) by some \(\alpha&gt;0\) and \(f_k,\,f_\star\) by \(\alpha^2\) and observe it does not change the value of the objective, while still being a feasible point. Therefore, the problem can be reformulated as a nonconvex QCQP (quadratically constrained quadratic program): $$  \begin{array}{rl} \underset{{f_k,\,f_\star,\, x_k,\,x_\star,\, g_k,\,d}} {\sup}&amp;\displaystyle{\rVert{x_{k}-\gamma  g_k-x_\star}\lVert^2}\\<br />       \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\<br />       &amp; f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2\\ &amp;{\rVert{x_k-x_\star}\lVert^2} \leqslant      1,<br /> \end{array}$$  which is quadratic in \(x_k\), \(x_\star\) and  \(g_k\), and linear in \(f_\star\) and \(f_k\). Actually, in the current form, nonconvexity comes from the term “\(\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle\)” in the second constraint (and from the objective, due to maximization). It turns out that this problem can be reformulated <em>losslessly</em> using semidefinite programming (this is due to the maximization over \(d\), as commented at the end of the next section). </p>



<h3>Semidefinite reformulation</h3>



<p class="justify-text">At the end of this section, we will be able to compute, numerically, the values of the rate \(\rho^2(\gamma)\) for given values of the parameters \(\mu,\,L\), and \(\gamma\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">The last step in the reformulation goes as follows: the previous problem can be reformulated as a semidefinite program, as it is linear in terms of the entries of the following Gram matrix<br />$$G = \begin{pmatrix}<br />     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle \\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2<br />     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0,$$ and in terms of the function values \(f_k\) and \(f_\star\). From those variables, one reformulate the previous problem as $$\begin{array}{rl} \underset{f_k,\,f_\star,\, G\succeq 0}{\sup} \, &amp;{\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{num} G)}\\<br />      \text{s.t. }    &amp; f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0\\<br />      &amp;  f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0 \\<br />      &amp;\mathrm{Tr} (A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant      1,\end{array}$$ which is a gentle semidefinite program where we picked matrices \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) for encoding the previous terms. That is, we choose those matrices such that<br /> $$\begin{array}{rl}<br />\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\  \mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}} G)&amp;=\lVert{x_k-\gamma g_k-x_\star}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)&amp;=\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2,\\ \mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)&amp;=\tfrac{1}{2L}\lVert g_k\rVert^2+\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert x_k-x_\star-\tfrac1L g_k\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ One possibility is to choose \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\) as symmetric matrices, as follows: $$\begin{array}{cc}<br /> A_{\text{denom}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0     \end{pmatrix}, &amp; A_{\text{num}}=\begin{pmatrix}     1 &amp; -\gamma\\ -\gamma &amp; \gamma^2     \end{pmatrix}, \\ A_1=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac12-\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)}\end{pmatrix}, &amp;  A_2=\begin{pmatrix}\tfrac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)} &amp; -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} \\ -\tfrac{\mu}{2(L-\mu)} &amp; \tfrac{1}{2L}+\tfrac{\mu}{2L(L-\mu)} \end{pmatrix}.\end{array}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">All those steps can be carried out in the exact same way for the problem of computing the convergence rate for function values, reaching a similar problem with \(6\) inequality constraints instead—because interpolation conditions have to be imposed on all pairs of points in a set of \(3\) points: \(x_k\), \(x_{k+1}\) and \(x_\star\), instead of only \(2\) for the distance problem. The objective function is then \(f_{k+1}-f_\star\), the de-homogenization constraint (arising from the denominator of the objective function) is \(f_{k}-f_\star \leqslant     1\), and the Gram matrix is \(3\times 3\):<br />$$G=\begin{pmatrix}<br />     \lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle&amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle\\ \langle{g_k};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_k}\rVert^2 &amp; \langle{g_k};{g_{k+1}}\rangle \\<br />     \langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle &amp; \langle{g_{k+1}};{g_k}\rangle &amp; \lVert{g_{k+1}}\rVert^2<br />     \end{pmatrix}\succcurlyeq 0, $$ and the function values variables are \(f_k\), \(f_{k+1}\) and \(f_\star\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We provide the numerical optimal values of those semidefinite programs on Figure 5 for both convergence in distances and in function values. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="534" alt="" src="https://www.di.ens.fr/~ataylor/BlogPost/ObjectiveValues.png" height="324" />Figure 5: worst-cases of the ratio \(\frac{\lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2}{\lVert{x_k-x_\star}\rVert^2}\) (red) and \(\frac{f(x_{k+1})-f_\star}{f(x_k)-f_\star}\) (dashed blue) as functions of the step size \(\gamma\), for the case where \(f\) is \(1\)-smooth and \(0.1\)-strongly convex. The results match exactly the expected \(\max\{(1-\gamma L)^2,(1-\gamma\mu)^2\}\) in both cases. Note that the corresponding SDPs can be solved both for “good and bad” choices of step sizes: if the step size is chosen wisely then \(\rho(\gamma)&lt;1\), and otherwise \(\rho(\gamma)\geqslant 1\). The SDP confirms the common knowledge that \(\gamma\in (0,2/L)\Rightarrow \rho(\gamma)&lt; 1\). Numerical values obtained through YALMIP [<a href="https://yalmip.github.io/">9</a>] and Mosek [<a href="https://www.mosek.com/">10</a>].</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">As a conclusion for this section, let us note that we showed how to compute the “best” rates that are dimension independent. In general, requiring the iterates and gradient (e.g., \(x_k\) and \(g_k\) for the problem in terms of distance, and \(x_k\), \(g_k\) and \(g_{k+1}\) for function values, and potentially more vectors when dealing with more complex settings) to lie in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) is equivalent to adding a rank constraint in the SDP. </p>



<h2>Duality between worst-case scenarios and combinations of inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Any feasible point to the previous SDP corresponds to a <em>lower bound</em>: a sampled version of a potentially difficult function for gradient descent. If we want to find <em>upper bounds</em> on the rate, a natural way to proceed is to go to the dual side of the previous SDPs, where any feasible point will naturally correspond to an upper bound on the convergence rate (by <em>weak duality</em>). As the primal problems were SDPs, their Lagrangian duals are SDPs as well. Let us associate one multiplier per constraint: $$ \begin{array}{rl}<br />f_k-f_\star+\mathrm{Tr} (A_1 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_1\\<br />f_\star-f_k+\mathrm{Tr} (A_2 G)\leqslant 0&amp;:\lambda_2\\<br />\mathrm{Tr}(A_\text{denom} G) \leqslant 1&amp;: \tau.<br />\end{array}$$The dual is then<br />$$\begin{array}{rl}<br /> \underset{\tau,\,\lambda_1,\,\lambda_2}{\min} &amp; \, \tau \\<br /> \text{s.t. } &amp; \lambda_1=\lambda_2,\\<br /> &amp; S:=A_\text{num}-\tau A_\text{denom}-\lambda_1A_1-\lambda_2A_2 \preccurlyeq 0,\\<br /> &amp;\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2 \geqslant  0.<br /> \end{array}$$ Hence, by weak duality, any feasible point to this last SDP corresponds to an upper bound on the rate: \(\tau \geqslant \rho^2\). A mere rephrasing of weak duality can be obtained through the following reasoning: assume we received some feasible \(\tau,\lambda_1,\lambda_2\) (and hence \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\) and a corresponding \(S\preccurlyeq 0\)), we then get, for any primal feasible \(G\succcurlyeq0\):<br />$$\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{Tr}(SG)&amp;=\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{num}}G)-\tau\mathrm{Tr}(A_{\text{denom}}G)-\lambda_1\mathrm{Tr}(A_1G)-\lambda_2\mathrm{Tr}(A_2G)\\&amp;=\lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\\ \,&amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_1[     f_k-f_\star+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\,\,\,-\lambda_2 [f_\star-f_k+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}g_k}\rVert^2]\\ &amp;\geqslant \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2, \end{array}$$ where the first equality follows from the definition of \(S\), the second equality corresponds to the definitions of \(A_{\text{num}}\), \(A_{\text{denom}}\), \(A_1\) and \(A_2\), and the last inequality follows from the sign of the interpolation inequalities (constraints in the primal) for any primal feasible point. Hence, we indeed have that any feasible \(\tau\) corresponds to a valid upper bound on the convergence rate, as $$S\preccurlyeq 0 \,\,\Rightarrow \,\, \mathrm{Tr}(SG)\leqslant 0\,\,\Rightarrow  \lVert x_{k+1}-x_\star\rVert^2-\tau\lVert x_{k}-x_\star\rVert^2\leqslant 0.$$ In order to obtain analytical proofs, we therefore need to find analytical dual feasible points, and numerics can of course help in this process! Let’s look at what the optimal dual solutions look like for our two running examples.</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li> in Figure 6, we provide the numerical values for \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) for the distance problem.</li></ul>

<ul class="justify-text"><li>For function values, the SDP is slightly more complicated, as more inequalities are involved (6 interpolation inequalities). We provide raw numerical values for the six multipliers in Figure 7.</li></ul>

<p>For those who want a bit more details, here are a few additional pointers:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>Strong duality holds—a way to prove it is to show that there exists a Slater point in the primal, see e.g., [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, Theorem 6]—, and hence primal and dual optimal values match.</li><li>There might be different ways to optimaly combine the interpolation inequalities for proving the desired results. In other words: dual optimal solutions are often not unique—which is, in fact, quite a good news: I am sure nobody want to find the analytical version of the multipliers provided in Figure 7.</li><li>It is often possible to simplify the proofs by using fewer, or weaker, inequalities. This might lead to ”cleaner” results, typically (but not always) at the cost of ”weaker” rates. This was done for designing the proof for function values, later in this text.</li></ul>



<h2>Combinations of inequalities: same proofs without SDPs</h2>



<p class="justify-text">So far, we showed that computing convergence rates can be done in a very principled way. To this end, one can solve semidefinite programs—which may have arbitrarily complicated analytical solutions. Here, I want to emphasize that the process of <em>verifying</em> a solution can be quite different to that of<em> finding</em> a solution. Put in other words, although the dual certificates (a.k.a., the proofs) might have been found by solving SDPs, they can be formulated in ways that do not require the reader to know anything about the PEP methodology, nor on any SDP material, for verifying them. This fact might actually not be very surprising to the reader, as many proofs arising in the first-order optimization literature actually “only consists” in linear combinations of (quadratic) inequalities. On the one hand, those proofs can be seen as feasible points to “dual SDPs”, although generally not explicitely proved as such. On the other hand, proofs arising from the SDPs might therefore be expected to be writable without any explicit reference to semidefinite programing and performance estimation problems.<br /></p>



<p class="justify-text">In what follows, we provide the proofs for gradient descent, using the previous numerical inspiration, but without explicitly relying on any semidefinite program. The reader is not expected to verify any of those computations, as our goal is rather to emphasize that the principles underlying both proofs are exactly the same: reformulating linear combinations of inequalities.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For both proofs below, we limit ourselves to the step size regime \(0\leq   \gamma \leq \tfrac{2}{L+\mu}\), and we prove  that, in  this regime, \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\)—actually we only proof the upper bounds, but one can easily verify that they are <em>tight</em> on simple quadratic functions.  The complete proofs (for the proximal gradient method),  can be found in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>]. </p>



<h3>Example 1: distance to optimality</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Recall the notations: \(g_k:=\nabla f(x_k)\), \(f_k:= f(x_k)\), \(g_\star:=\nabla f(x_\star)\), and \(f_\star:= f(x_\star)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">For distance to optimality, sum the following inequalities with their corresponding weights: $$\begin{array}{r}     f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  :\lambda_1,  \\     f_k \geqslant      f_\star+\langle{g_\star};{x_k-x_\star}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{{1}}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2:\lambda_2.     \end{array}$$ We use the following values for the multipliers: \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2=2\gamma\rho(\gamma) \geqslant      0\) (see Figure 6). </p>



<p class="justify-text">After appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), and with little effort, one can check that the previous weighted sum of inequalities can be written in the form: $$ \begin{array}{rl}    \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2  \leqslant      &amp; \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2 -\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2. \end{array}$$ This statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation) and verifying that all terms indeed match.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, using $$\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0,  \text{ and } L-\mu \geqslant      0,$$ which are nonnegative by assumptions on the values of \(L\in(0,\infty)\), \(\mu\in (0,L)\) and \(\gamma\in(0,2/(L+\mu))\), we arrive to the desired $$ \lVert{x_{k+1}-x_\star}\rVert^2 \leqslant      \left(1-\gamma \mu \right)^2\lVert{x_{k}-x_\star}\rVert^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that, by using \(\lambda_1=\lambda_2\), the weighted sum exactly corresponds to the (scaled by a positive constant) inequality introduced in the early stage of this note for studying distance to optimality. However, the resulting expression is tight for all values of the step size here, whereas it was only tight for \(\gamma=2/(L+\mu)\) earlier, due to a different choice of weights! </p>



<p class="justify-text">The curious reader might wonder how to find such a reformulation. Actually, back in terms of SDPs, and using the expressions for the multipliers, it simply corresponds to $$\mathrm{Tr}(SG)=-\frac{\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu))}{L-\mu} \lVert{\mu {(x_k  -x_\star)} – g_k}\rVert^2.$$ In the example below, the reformulation is a bit more tricky—as \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)  has two nonnegative terms, which were simply obtained by doing an analytical Cholesky factorization of the term \(\mathrm{Tr}(SG)\)—, but the idea is exactly the same.</p>



<h3>Example 2: function values</h3>



<p class="justify-text">For function values, we combine the following inequalities after multiplication with their respective coefficients:    </p>



<p class="justify-text">$$\scriptsize \begin{array}{lr}     f_k \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_k-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2    &amp;:\lambda_1,\\<br />f_\star \geqslant      f_k+\langle{g_k};{x_\star-x_k}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_k-g_\star}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_k-x_\star-\frac{1}{L}(g_k-g_\star)}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_2, \\<br />f_\star \geqslant      f_{k+1}+\langle{g_{k+1}};{x_\star-x_{k+1}}\rangle+\frac{1}{2L}\lVert{g_\star-g_{k+1}}\rVert^2+\frac{\mu}{2(1-\mu/L)}\lVert{x_\star-x_{k+1}-\frac{1}{L}(g_\star-g_{k+1})}\rVert^2  &amp;:\lambda_3.     \end{array}$$ We use the following multipliers \(\lambda_1=\rho(\gamma)\), \(\lambda_2=(1-\rho(\gamma))\rho(\gamma)\), and  \(\lambda_3=1-\rho(\gamma)\) (obtained by greedily trying to set different combinations of multipliers to \(0\) in the SDP—see Figure 7 for the values without such simplifications).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Again, after appropriate substitutions of \(g_\star\), \(x_{k+1}\), and \(\rho(\gamma)\), using respectively \(g_\star=0\), \(x_{k+1}=x_k-\gamma g_k\) and \(\rho(\gamma)=(1-\gamma\mu)\), we obtain that the weighted sum of inequalities can be reformulated exactly as $$  \begin{array}{rl}          f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant      &amp;\left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right)\\&amp;-\frac{1}{2 (L-\mu)}\lVert \nabla f(x_{k+1})-(1-\gamma  (L+\mu))\nabla f(x_k) +\gamma  \mu  L (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2\\<br />&amp;-\frac{\gamma  L(2- \gamma  (L+\mu))}{2 (L-\mu )}\lVert \nabla f(x_k)+\mu  (x_\star-x_k)\rVert^2.\end{array}$$ Again, this statement can be checked simply by expanding both expressions (i.e., the weighted sum and its reformulation), and verifying that all terms match. The desired conclusion $$ f(x_{k+1})-f_\star \leqslant \left(1-\gamma \mu\right)^2 \left(f(x_k)-f_\star\right), $$ follows from the signs of the leading coefficients: \(\gamma(2-\gamma (L+\mu)) \geqslant      0\), and \(L-\mu \geqslant      0\).</p>



<h3>To go further</h3>



<p class="justify-text">Before finishing, let us mention that we only dealt with linear convergence through a single iteration of gradient descent.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There are quite a few ways to handle both more iterations and sublinear convergence rates. Using SDPs, probably the most natural approach is to directly incorporate several iterations in the problem by  studying, for example, ratios of the form  $$\sup_{f\in\mathcal{F}_{\mu,L},\, x_0}  \frac{f(x_{N})-f_\star}{\lVert x_0-x_\star\rVert^2}. $$ This type of approach was used in the work of Drori and Teboulle [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>] and in most consecutive PEP-related works: it has the advantage of providing  comfortable “non-improvable results” [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1009-3">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>]   (by providing matching lower bounds) for any given \(N\), but requires solving larger and larger SDPs. Alternatively, simpler proofs can often be obtained through the use of  Lyapunov (or potential) functions—i.e., study a single iteration to produce recursable inequalities; a nice introduction is provided in [<a href="http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v015a004/v015a004.pdf">13</a>]. This idea can be exploited in PEPs [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00947.pdf">14</a>] by enforcing the proofs to have a certain structure. Those principles are also at the heart of the related approach using integral quadratic constraints [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/15M1009597">3</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/hu17a/hu17a.pdf">15</a>]. </p>



<h2>Take-home message and conclusions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The overall message of this note is that first-order methods can often be studied directly using the definition of their “worst-cases” (i.e., by trying to find worst-case scenarios), along with their dual counterparts (linear combinations of inequalities), by translating them into semidefinite programs.</p>



<p class="justify-text">What we saw might look like an overkill for studying gradient descent. However, as long as we deal with Euclidean spaces, the same approach actually works beyond this simple case. In particular, the same technique applies to first-order methods performing explicit, projected, proximal, conditional, and inexact (sub)gradient steps [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.07516.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Finally, let us mention a few previous works illustrating that the use of such computer-assisted proofs allowed obtaining results that are apparently too complicated for us to find bare-handed—even in apparently simple contexts.  Reasonable examples include the direct proof for convergence rates in  function values [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.04398.pdf">11</a>] presented above, but also proofs arising in the context of optimized numerical schemes [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3209.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2636">16</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.5468.pdf">17</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>]—in particular [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.06600.pdf">18</a>] presents a method for minimizing the gradient norm at the last iterate, in smooth convex minimization—,  in the context of monotone inclusions,  and even for more general fixed-point problems (e.g., for Halpern iterations [<a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2017/11/6336.pdf">19</a>]).</p>



<h3>Toolbox</h3>



<p class="justify-text">The PErformance EStimation TOolbox (PESTO) [<a href="https://perso.uclouvain.be/julien.hendrickx/availablepublications/PESTO_CDC_2017.pdf">20</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/graphs/traffic">Github</a>] allows a quick access to the methodology without worrying about details of semidefinite reformulations. The toolbox contains many  examples (about 50) in different settings, and include progresses on the approach, and results, by other groups (which are much more thoroughly referenced in the <a href="https://github.com/AdrienTaylor/Performance-Estimation-Toolbox/blob/master/UserGuide.pdf">user guide</a>). In particular, we included standard classes of functions and operators, along with examples for analyzing recent optimized methods.</p>

<p>This post is devoted to a few memories of Boris Tsirelson who passed away at the end of January. I would like to mention that a few days ago graph theorist Robin Thomas passed away after long battle with ALS. I hope  to tell about Robin’s stunning mathematics in a future post.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tsirelson_boris.jpg"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tsirelson_boris.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-19552" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Boris Tsirelson (1950 – 2020); <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~tsirel/">Boris’ home-page</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Tsirelson">Wikipedia</a>. (More links, below.)</p>
<p>The title of the post is taken from the title of a very interesting 1999 paper by Boris Tsirelson and Oded Schramm: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9902116">Trees, not cubes: hypercontractivity, cosiness, and noise stability</a></p>
<p>I was very sad and shocked to hear that Boris Tsirelson had passed away. Boris was one of the greatest Israeli mathematicians, and since 1997 or so we established mathematical connections surrounding several matters of common interest.  Here are a few memories.</p>
<h3>Love for coding</h3>
<p>1) One thing that Boris told me was that he loves to code. Being a “refusnik”, he could not get into Academia and (luckily) he could work as a programmer. And he told me that afterwards deciding what he liked more – programming or doing mathematical research – was no longer a trivial question for him.  Boris chose to go back to mathematical research, but he continued to enjoy programming, and when he needed it in his mathematical research, he could easily program.</p>
<h3>Love for quantum</h3>
<p>2) Another thing that Boris loved is “quantum”, the mathematics and physics of quantum mechanics and various connections to mathematics. Early on he proved his famous Tsirelson’s bound related to Bell’s inequalities, and later he was enthusiastic about the area of quantum computing. (And he learned it quickly, taught a course about it in 1997, and his 1997 lecture notes are still considered very useful.)</p>
<h3>Black Noise and noise sensitivity</h3>
<p>3) Perhaps the most significant mathematical connection between us was in the late 90s, and was centered around the theory of noise stability and noise sensitivity by Benjamini, Schramm and myself, which was closely related to a theory initiated by Boris Tsirelson and Anatoly Vershik. The translation between the different languages that we used and that Boris used was awkward, since the analog of Boolean functions that we studied was the “noise” that Boris studied, and the analog of noise sensitive Boolean functions in our language was “black noise” in Boris’s language. In any case, we had email discussions and we also met a few times with Itai and Oded regarding this connection.</p>
<h3>Black Noise and noise sensitivity II</h3>
<p>4)  Boris developed a very rich theory of black noise with relations to various areas of probability theory and operator algebras. He also found hypercontractivity that we used in our work quite useful to his applications, and also in this theory, he considered both classical and quantum aspects. I know only a little about Boris Tsirelson’s theory and its applications, but as far as tangent points with our Boolean interests are concerned, I can mention that Boris was enthusiastic by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5820">result</a> of Schramm and Stas Smirnov that percolation is a “black noise” and also that, in 1999, Boris and Oded Schramm wrote a paper whose title started with “Trees not cubes!”, presenting a different angle on this theory.</p>
<p>Tsirelson saw white noise (what we call noise stability) as manifesting “linearity” while “black noise” (what we call noise sensitivity) as manifesting “non-linearity”. Over the years, I often asked him to explain this to me.</p>
<h3>Tsireslon’s Banach spaces</h3>
<p>5) Geometry of Banach spaces is a very strong area in Israel so naturally I heard as a graduate student about “Tsirelson’s space” from 1974 and some subsequent developments in the 80s. Boris Tsirelson constructed a  Banach space that does not contain an imbedding of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell_p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell_p" class="latex" title="\ell_p" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_0" class="latex" title="c_0" />.</p>
<h3>Bible codes</h3>
<p>6) My first personal connection with Boris was related to claims regarding a hidden Bible Code, and a 1994 paper claiming a statistical proof of the existence of these Bible codes. For many years my attitude was that these claims should be ignored, but around 1997, I changed my mind and did some work to see what was going on. Now, Boris kept a site linked in his homepage devoted to developments regarding the Bible Code claims. In this site Boris kindly reported about my first 1997 paper on the topic, my observation that the proximity of two reported p-values for the two Bible code experiments was “too good to be true”, and my interpretation that this suggests that the claimed results manifest naïve statistical expectations rather than scientific reality.  A few weeks later, Boris reported about a much stronger evidence (by McKay and Bar Nathan) against the Bible Code claims (they demonstrated codes of similar quality in Tolstoy’s “War and Peace”) and subsequently after some time he lost interest in this topic.</p>
<h3>Quantum computing skepticism</h3>
<p>6) In 2005 we had some correspondence and meetings regarding my quantum computing skepticism. In his first email he told me that my reference to “decoherence” seemed strange and I realized that I consistently referred to “entanglement” as “decoherence” and to “decoherence” as “entanglement”.</p>
<p>7) In his 1997 lecture notes on quantum computing (that I cannot find on the web, so I count on my memory), Boris addressed the concerns of early quantum computers skeptics like Rolf Landauer. He did not accept the analogy between quantum computing and analog computation, but he also regarded the analogy with digital computation as problematic. Rather, he regarded quantum information based on qubits as something (at least a priori) different from both these examples. (Update: I found one non-broken link to the lecture notes; indeed the subtitle of Chapter 9 is “neither analog nor digital”.)</p>
<p>A joke that I heard from Boris at that time</p>
<p>8) I remember that once when I asked him about some aspects of quantum fault tolerance he told me the following joke: A student is entitled to a special exam, he arrives at the professor’s office, is given three questions to answer and he fails to do so. He request and is granted a make-up exam two weeks later. When the student shows up at the office two weeks later the professor, who forgot all about it, gave him the same three questions. “This is extremely unfair”, said the student “you ask me questions that you already know that I cannot answer.”</p>
<h3>Noise sensitivity and high energy physics</h3>
<p>9) In 2006 I came up with the idea that noise sensitivity might be a great idea for physics. Knowing very little physics, I wrote a little manifesto with this idea and tried it, among other people, on Boris. As it turned out, Boris had the idea that noise sensitivity could add a useful modeling power to physics (especially high energy physics) well before that time. (And by 2006 he was already a bit skeptical regarding his own idea.) He also told me that one of the motivations of his 1998 paper with Tolya Vershik came from some mathematical ideas related to physics of the big bang. When I asked him if this was written somewhere in the paper itself, he answered: “Of course, not!”</p>
<h3>Boris Tsirelson’s lecture at Oded’s memorial school</h3>
<p>10) in 2009 we organized a meeting in memory of Oded Schramm and Boris gave a lecture related to the Schramm-Smirnov “percolation is black noise” result with a single theorem. And what was remarkable about it that it was that he presented a classical theorem with a quantum proof. You can find the videotaped lecture here  (And here are the slides. Boris never wrote up this result.) Following this lecture we had a short correspondence with Scott A. and Greg K. about quantum proofs to classical theorems. (Namely theorems that do not mention quantum in the statement).</p>
<h3>Tsirelson’s problem</h3>
<p>11) Our last correspondence in 2019 was about Thomas Vidick’s  Notices AMS article about Tsirelson’s problem. (This was a couple of months before the announcement of the solution.) Boris was pleased to hear about these developments, as he was regarding earlier developments in this area. He humorously refers to the history of his problem on his homepage and this interview.</p>
<p>12) People who knew Boris regarded him as a genius from a very early age, and former students have fond memories of his classes.</p>

<h3>Dec 2006 (about noise sensitivity and physics)</h3>
<p>(Dec 2006) My very first idea in this field (inspired by conversations with Vershik) was<br />
rather physical (that Big Bang could be a natural occurrence of black noise),<br />
and in fact the main example of “Tsirelson and Vershik 1998” follows this line<br />
(not explicitly, of course).</p>
<p>In local (not Big Bang related) physics, I think, nonlinearity could produce<br />
such effect. And then the very idea of `the field operator at a point’ (on<br />
the level of operator-valued Schwartz distributions or something like that)<br />
will fail. However, physicists do not want to consider this possibility<br />
without very serious indications that it really is used by the nature. And<br />
they are right…</p>
<h3>2005 quantum computer skepticism</h3>
<p>Subject: Re: Noise and more</p>
<p>Dear Gil:<br />
Yes, of course, we can meet and speak.</p>
<p>For now, I am not much bothered. I am not an expert in quantum error<br />
correction, but anyway, my feeling is that all physically reasonable<br />
“attacks” of Nature are repelled. Especially, your three-qubit attack<br />
looks to me not dangerous. And, “der Herr Gott is raffiniert, aber<br />
boschaft ist er nicht”; Nature never attacks like an enemy.</p>

<h3>Quick 2000 comments on a (sloppy) draft of my survey paper</h3>
<p>Dear Gil:</p>
<p>Thank you for the text; I am reading it.<br />
For now, only a trivial remark: “Tsilerson” should be “Tsirelson” in<br />
[133] and [134]; and in [132] “” should be “Tsirelson”…</p>
<p>Shabat shalom,<br />

<h3>November 1998: Noise sensitivity and black noise</h3>
<p>Dear Gil,</p>
<p>I am reading your (with Itai and Oded) paper. Thanks.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am thinking about changing the title of my future talk in<br />
Vien accordingly: from “The five noises” to “The six noises” (or even<br />
more).<br />
To this end, however, I need to answer the following question.</p>
<p>Is there a mesh refinement limit for the percolation?</p>
<p>That is, take the lattice with a small pitch \eps. Choose two<br />
“electrodes”, say, two vertical intervals on two parallel vertical<br />
lines, and ask about the probability that they are connected (via the<br />
bond percolation on the whole band between the two vertical lines).<br />
Let the electrodes be macroscopic; that is, they do not depend on<br />
\eps. Does the probability of the event have a limit for \eps \to 0 ?<br />
If it does, then one more question: what about the joint distribution<br />
for a finite collection of such events? That is, I want to see a weak<br />
limit of these “discrete” random processes. It seems to me, the<br />
question is well-known and was discussed. However, do you know the<br />
answer?</p>
<p>Yours, Boris.</p>
<p>Dear Itai, Oded, and Gil,</p>
<p>Thank you for the information. I see that for now we have a<br />
conditional result: if there exists “the noise of percolation”, then<br />
it is not a white noise.<br />
Yours, Boris.</p>
<p>Dear Gil:<br />
&gt; I dont understand yet the concept of “noise” precisely</p>
<p>One of ways is this. A noise is a scaling limit for coin tossing.<br />
You choose a class of “macroscopic observables” and look, whether<br />
their joint distribution converges, when n\to\infty. If it does, you<br />
get a noise. (For percolation we do not know, does it or not.)<br />
Now, if all “macroscopic observables” are noise insensitive, it means<br />
that the noise is white. For a white noise, there is only one<br />
invariant, its dimension (or multiplicity).<br />
If all “macroscopic observables” are noise sensitive, the noise is<br />
black. Probably, there are a lot of black noises, but for now we have<br />
only two examples, without knowing, whether they are isomorphic, or<br />
not. Spectra may be used for classifying black noises. Say, it may<br />
happen that for each “macroscopic observable”, its spectrum is<br />
concentrated on sets having Hausdorf dimension less than something.<br />
If some “macroscopic observables” are noise sensitive but some others<br />
are not (except for constants, of course), then the noise is neither<br />
white nor black. It may happen that it is a direct sum of a white<br />
noise and a black noise. However, it may happen that it is not. We<br />
have for now two such examples: “noise if splitting” and “noise of<br />
stickiness” (they are probably non-isomorphic); both are found by Jonathan<br />
Warren. I am trying to understand, whether your matter can give more<br />
examples.</p>

<h3>August 1998: Bible code story</h3>
<p>Dear Gil,</p>
<p>Thanks for the text.<br />
As for me, it is already an `overkill’, since for me the WRR94<br />
is basically dead. But maybe for others…</p>
<p>Yours, Boris.</p>
