of vertices of a tree. This model is based on a simple structure for
decomposing graphs, previously known under several names including elimination
trees, vertex rankings, and tubings. The model is equivalent to the classical
binary search tree model exactly when the underlying tree is a path. We
describe an online $O(\log \log n)$-competitive search tree data structure in
this model, matching the best known competitive ratio of binary search trees.
Our method is inspired by Tango trees, an online binary search tree algorithm,
but critically needs several new notions including one which we call
Steiner-closed search trees, which may be of independent interest. Moreover our
technique is based on a novel use of two levels of decomposition, first from
search space to a set of Steiner-closed trees, and secondly from these trees
into paths.

disciplines such as information retrieval, data-mining, pattern recognition and
machine learning, etc. In the literature, considerable research has been
focusing on how to efficiently build an approximate k-nearest neighbor graph
(k-NN graph) for a fixed dataset. Unfortunately, a closely related issue to the
approximate k-NN graph construction has been long overlooked. Namely, few
literature covers about how to merge existing k-NN graphs. In this paper, we
address the k-NN graph merge issue of two different scenarios. One one hand, we
address the problem of merging two existing graphs into one by the proposed
peer merge. This makes parallel approximate k-NN graph computation in
large-scale become possible. On the other hand, the problem of merging a raw
set into a built k-NN graph is also addressed by the proposed joint merge. It
enables the approximate k-NN graph to be built incrementally. Thus it supports
approximate k-NN graph construction for an open set. Moreover, deriving from
joint merge, an hierarchical graph construction approach is presented. With the
support of produced graph hierarchy, superior performance is observed on the
large-scale NN search task across various data types and various data
dimensions, under different distance measures.

linear system $\boldsymbol{Ax}=\boldsymbol{b}$ with iterative methods is
difficult. For instance, even if one has access to a collection
$\boldsymbol{M}_1,\boldsymbol{M}_2,\ldots,\boldsymbol{M}_n$ of candidate
preconditioners, it is currently unclear how to practically choose the
$\boldsymbol{M}_i$ which minimizes the number of iterations of an iterative
algorithm to achieve a suitable approximation to $\boldsymbol{x}$. This paper
makes progress on this sub-problem by showing that the preconditioner stability
$\|\boldsymbol{I}-\boldsymbol{M}^{-1}\boldsymbol{A}\|_\mathsf{F}$, known to
forecast preconditioner quality, can be computed in the time it takes to run a
constant number of iterations of conjugate gradients through use of sketching
methods. This is in spite of folklore which suggests the quantity is
impractical to compute, and a proof we give that ensures the quantity could not
possibly be approximated in a useful amount of time by a deterministic
algorithm. Using our estimator, we provide a method which can provably select
the minimal stability preconditioner among $n$ candidates using floating point
operations commensurate with running on the order of $n\log n$ steps of the
conjugate gradients algorithm. Our method can also advise the practitioner to
use no preconditioner at all if none of the candidates appears useful. The
algorithm is extremely easy to implement and trivially parallelizable. In one
of our experiments, we use our preconditioner selection algorithm to create to
the best of our knowledge the first preconditioned method for kernel regression
reported to never use more iterations than the non-preconditioned analog in
standard tests.

associated part semantics and structure is central to many applications
requiring high-quality 3D assets or large volumes of realistic training data. A
key challenge towards this goal is how to accommodate diverse shape variations,
including both continuous deformations of parts as well as structural or
discrete alterations which add to, remove from, or modify the shape
constituents and compositional structure. Such object structure can typically
be organized into a hierarchy of constituent object parts and relationships,
represented as a hierarchy of n-ary graphs. We introduce StructureNet, a
hierarchical graph network which (i) can directly encode shapes represented as
such n-ary graphs; (ii) can be robustly trained on large and complex shape
families; and (iii) can be used to generate a great diversity of realistic
structured shape geometries. Technically, we accomplish this by drawing
inspiration from recent advances in graph neural networks to propose an
order-invariant encoding of n-ary graphs, considering jointly both part
geometry and inter-part relations during network training. We extensively
evaluate the quality of the learned latent spaces for various shape families
and show significant advantages over baseline and competing methods. The
learned latent spaces enable several structure-aware geometry processing
applications, including shape generation and interpolation, shape editing, or
shape structure discovery directly from un-annotated images, point clouds, or
partial scans.

tournament heaps undergoing key modifications. These heaps are implemented by
binary trees with keys stored on leaves, and intermediate nodes tracking the
min of their respective subtrees. They represent a natural starting point for
studying self-adjusting heaps due to the need to access the root-to-leaf path
upon modifications. We combine previous studies on the competitive ratios of
unordered binary search trees by [Fredman WADS2011] and on order-by-next
request by [Mart\'inez-Roura TCS2000] and [Munro ESA2000] to show that for any
number of fingers, tournament heaps cannot handle a sequence of modify-key
operations with competitive ratio in $o(\sqrt{\log{n}})$. Critical to this
analysis is the characterization of the modifications that a heap can undergo
upon an access. There are $\exp(\Theta(n \log{n}))$ valid heaps on $n$ keys,
but only $\exp(\Theta(n))$ binary search trees. We parameterize the
modification power through the well-studied concept of fingers: additional
pointers the data structure can manipulate arbitrarily. Here we demonstrate
that fingers can be significantly more powerful than servers moving on a static
tree by showing that access to $k$ fingers allow an offline algorithm to handle
any access sequence with amortized cost $O(\log_{k}(n) + 2^{\lg^{*}n})$.

$\mathbb{R}^d$, and an integer $2 \leq k \leq d$, find an affine combination of
at most $k$ columns of $A$ that is closest to $y$. We describe a $O(n^{k-1}
\log^{d-k+2} n)$-time randomized $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
this problem with $d$ and $\varepsilon$ constant. This is the first algorithm
for this problem running in time $o(n^k)$. Its running time is similar to the
query time of a data structure recently proposed by Har-Peled, Indyk, and
Mahabadi (ICALP'18), while not requiring any preprocessing. Up to
polylogarithmic factors, it matches a conditional lower bound relying on a
conjecture about affine degeneracy testing. In the special case where $k = d =
O(1)$, we also provide a simple $O(n^{d-1+\epsilon})$-time deterministic exact
algorithm. Finally, we show how to adapt the approximation algorithm for the
sparse linear regression and sparse convex regression problems with the same
running time, up to polylogarithmic factors.

summarization. Given a communication graph $G$ of $n$ nodes each of which may
hold a value initially, we focus on computing $\sum_{i=1}^N g(f_i)$, where
$f_i$ is the number of occurrences of value $i$ and $g$ is some fixed function.
This includes important statistics such as the number of distinct elements,
frequency moments, and the empirical entropy of the data.

<p>In the CONGEST model, a simple adaptation from streaming lower bounds shows
that it requires $\tilde{\Omega}(D+ n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of
the graph, to compute some of these statistics exactly. However, these lower
bounds do not hold for graphs that are well-connected. We give an algorithm
that computes $\sum_{i=1}^{N} g(f_i)$ exactly in $\tau_G \cdot 2^{O(\sqrt{\log

applications in computing the top $k$ most frequent elements.

the CONGEST model in well-connected graphs. In particular, we show that each
round of the GOSSIP model can be simulated almost-perfectly in
$\tilde{O}(\tau_G $ rounds of the CONGEST model. To this end, we develop a new
algorithm for the GOSSIP model that $1\pm \epsilon$ approximates the $p$-th
frequency moment $F_p = \sum_{i=1}^N f_i^p$ in $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2}
n^{1-k/p})$ rounds, for $p &gt;2$, when the number of distinct elements $F_0$ is
at most $O\left(n^{1/(k-1)}\right)$. This result can be translated back to the
CONGEST model with a factor $\tilde{O}(\tau_G)$ blow-up in the number of
rounds.

subtour linear programming relaxation is half-integral. These instances
received significant attention over the last decade due to a conjecture of
Schalekamp, Williamson and van Zuylen stating that half-integral LP solutions
have the largest integrality gap over all fractional solutions. So, if the
conjecture of Schalekamp et al. holds true, our result shows that the
integrality gap of the subtour polytope is bounded away from $3/2$.

3d objects has been discussed. The objects represented as cloud of 3D points
are split into parts and organized in a tree structure, where parts are
approximated by simple box primitives. Applying grasping only on the individual
object parts may miss a good grasp which involves a combination of parts. The
problem has been addressed by traversing the decomposition tree and checking
each node of the tree for possible pre-grasps against a set of conditions.
Further, a face mask has been introduced to encode the free and blocked faces
of the box primitives. Pre-grasps are generated only for the free faces.
Finally, the proposed method implemented on a set twenty-four household objects
and toys, where a grasp planner based on object slicing method has been used to
compute the contact-level grasp plan.

scalar fields. In scalar field topology, graph-based topological descriptors
such as merge trees, contour trees, and Reeb graphs are commonly used to
characterize topological changes in the (sub)level sets of scalar fields. One
of the biggest challenges and opportunities to advance topology-based
visualization is to understand and incorporate uncertainty into such
topological descriptors to effectively reason about their underlying data. In
this paper, we study a structural average of a set of labeled merge trees and
use it to encode uncertainty in data. Specifically, we compute a 1-center tree
that minimizes its maximum distance to any other tree in the set under a
well-defined metric called the interleaving distance. We provide heuristic
strategies that compute structural averages of merge trees whose labels do not
fully agree. We further provide an interactive visualization system that
resembles a numerical calculator that takes as input a set of merge trees and
outputs a tree as their structural average. We also highlight structural
similarities between the input and the average and incorporate uncertainty
information for visual exploration. We develop a novel measure of uncertainty,
referred to as consistency, via a metric-space view of the input trees.
Finally, we demonstrate an application of our framework through merge trees
that arise from ensembles of scalar fields. Our work is the first to employ
interleaving distances and consistency to study a global, mathematically
rigorous, structural average of merge trees in the context of uncertainty
visualization.

are composed from clauses chosen uniformly randomly and independently of each
other. This model may be unsatisfactory in that it fails to describe various
features of SAT instances, arising in real-world applications. Various
modifications have been suggested to define models of industrial SAT. Here, we
focus on community-structured SAT. Namely, the set of variables consists of a
number of disjoint communities, and clauses tend to consist of variables from
the same community. Thus, we suggest a model of random community-structured
SAT. There has been a lot of work on the satisfiability threshold of random
$k$-SAT, starting with the calculation of the threshold of $2$-SAT, up to the
recent result that the threshold exists for sufficiently large $k$. In this
paper, we endeavor to study the satisfiability threshold for random industrial
SAT. Our main result is that the threshold of random community-structured SAT
tends to be smaller than its counterpart for random SAT. Moreover, under some
conditions, this threshold even vanishes.

evolution of connected components in the sublevel sets of scalar functions.
They enjoy widespread applications in data analysis and scientific
visualization. In this paper, we consider the problem of comparing two merge
trees via the notion of interleaving distance in the metric space setting. We
investigate various theoretical properties of such a metric. In particular, we
show that the interleaving distance is intrinsic on the space of labeled merge
trees and provide an algorithm to construct metric 1-centers for collections of
labeled merge trees. We further prove that the intrinsic property of the
interleaving distance also holds for the space of unlabeled merge trees. Our
results are a first step toward performing statistics on graph-based
topological summaries.

<p>Perhaps conferences made sense fifty years ago. We did not have internet, and the pollution was not as bad. Today, we can have effective virtual meetings, while the pollution has reached a level of crisis, see this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_school_strike_for_climate_save_the_world_by_changing_the_rules/transcript?language=en">moving talk by Greta_Thunberg</a>. Moving to a system of virtual conferences is I believe a duty of every scientist. Doing so will cut the significant air travel emissions that come from shipping scientists across the world. To attend a climate summit in the USofA, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/07/29/gretha-thunberg-will-sail-across-the-atlantic-to-attend-un-climate-conferences/#27e93f87c3b2">Greta will sail across the Atlantic ocean on a zero emission boat</a><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_school_strike_for_climate_save_the_world_by_changing_the_rules/transcript?language=en">.</a></p>
<p>We can keep everything the way it is, but simply give the talks online. This change doesn’t involve anybody higher up in the political ladder. It only involves us, the program chairs, the steering committees.</p>
<p>While we wait for that, we can begin by virtualizing the physical STOC/FOCS PC meetings,<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/stocfocs-pc-meetings-does-nature-of-decisions-justify-cost/"> whose added value over a virtual meeting, if any, does not justify the cost</a>; and by holding conferences where the center of mass is, instead of exotic places where one can combine the trip with a vacation at the expense of tax payers’ money and everybody’s health. And that is also why I put a bid to hold the 2021 Conference on Computational Complexity in Boston.</p>
<p>NSF panels, making decisions worth millions, routinely have virtual panelists (I was the last few times). So why do we insist on shipping scientists across the globe multiple times a year to give 15-minute talks which to most people are less useful than spending 20 minutes reading the paper on the arxiv?</p></div>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The cover of Avi Wigderson’s book “Mathematics and computation” as was first exposed to the public in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zxctNw-mA3hOT1tktE_dYjnmvOzZmC_A/view">Avi’s Knuth Prize videotaped lecture</a>. (I had trouble with 3 of the words: What is EGDE L WONK 0?  what is GCAAG?GTAACTC ?  TACGTTC ?  I only figured out the first.)</span></p>
<p>Avi Wigderson’s book  “<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book">Mathematics and computation, a theory revolutionizing technology and science</a>” is about to be published by Princeton University Press. The link is to a free copy of the book which will always be available on Avi’s homepage. (See also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/must-read-book-by-avi-wigderson/">this re-blogged post here</a> of Boaz Barak.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One main theme of the book is the rich connection between the theory of computing and other areas (in fact, most areas) of mathematics. See also this self contained survey (based on Chapter 13 of the book) by Avi <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09780">Interactions of Computational Complexity Theory and Mathematics,</a> which in 27 pages overviews relations to number theory, Geometry, Operator Theory, Metric Geometry, Group Theory, Statistical Physics, Analysis and Probability, Lattice Theory and Invariant Theory. Of course, Avi himself is among the main heroes in finding many paths between mathematics and the theory of computing over the last four decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Another theme of the book and of several talks by Avi is that the theory of computing has revolutionary connections with many fields of science and technology. Again, this theme is present in the entire book and is emphasized in Chapter 20, which also appeared as a self contained paper  “<a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/Wigderson2018.pdf">On the nature of the Theory of Computation (ToC).</a>”  Let me quote one sentence from Avi’s book that I propose for discussion. (For the complete quote see the end of the post.)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The intrinsic study of computation transcends human-made artifacts, and its expanding connections and interactions with all sciences, integrating computational modeling, algorithms,  and complexity into theories of nature and society, marks a new scientific revolution!</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, <span style="color: #000000;">similar ideas were also expressed by several other prominent scientists, and let me mention Bernard Chazelle’s essay: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/algorithm.html">The Algorithm: Idiom of Modern Science</a>. (Feel free to give further examples and links in the comment section.)</span></p>
<h3>Let’s discuss:  Integrating computational modeling, algorithms,  and complexity into theories of nature, marks a new scientific revolution!</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I propose to discuss in the comment section the idea that the theory of computing offers a scientific revolution. Very nice cases to examine are the computational study of randomness and connections to statistics, connections with economy and connections with biology. Comments on the relations between the theory of computation and other areas of mathematics are also very welcome.</span></p>

<h3>The full quote of Avi:</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>The Theory of Computation is as revolutionary, fundamental and beautiful as major theories of mathematics, physics, biology, economics… that are regularly hailed as such. Its impact has been similarly staggering. The mysteries still baffling ToC are as challenging as those left open in other fields. And quite uniquely, the theory of computation is central to most other sciences. In creating the theoretical foundations of computing systems ToC has already played, and continues to play a major part in one of the greatest scientific and technological revolutions in human history. But the intrinsic study of computation transcends man-made artifacts. ToC has already established itself as an important mathematical discipline, with growing connections to nearly all mathematical areas. And its expanding connections and interactions with all sciences, naturally integrating computational modeling, algorithms and complexity into theories of nature and society, marks the beginning of another scientific revolution!</em></p></blockquote>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>We saw quite an activity last month, with a total of 9 papers on property testing or related areas.</p>



<p>Let’s start with a paper on PCPs:<br /><strong>Revisiting Alphabet Reduction in Dinur’s PCP</strong>, by Venkatesan Guruswami, Jakub Opršal, and Sai Sandeep  (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/092/">ECCC</a>). As mentioned in the title, this work provides an alternate proof of one of the two parts of the Dinur’s PCP theorem proof. In that proof, the argument goes by alternating two main steps: (i) amplifying the soundness gap, at the price of increasing the alphabet size (and the instance size); (ii) reducing the alphabet size, at the price of increasing the  instance size. From the observation that step (i) creates some structure in the instances that can be leveraged, the authors provide an alternative construction for (ii), leading to an arguably simpler analysis of the soundness of the underlying test. A nice throwback to some of the roots of property testing.</p>



<p>Then, four papers on distribution testing:<br /><strong>Testing Mixtures of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Ravi Kumar, Ronitt Rubinfeld (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03190">arXiv</a>). One of the most studied problems in distribution testing is <em>identity testing</em> (a.k.a., goodness-of-fit): given a reference distribution \(q\) over a domain of size \(n\) and i.i.d. samples from an unknown \(p\), decide between \(p=q\) and \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &gt; \varepsilon\). While this is now well-understood and can be done with a strongly sublinear number of samples (namely, \(\sqrt{n})\)), the case of <em>tolerant</em> testing is much sadder: Valiant and Valiant proved that \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) samples were required for distinguishing \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &lt; \varepsilon/2\) from \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &gt; \varepsilon\). So, noise-tolerance is almost as hard as it gets… <em>except</em>, as this works suggests and studies, if one has some guarantees on the noise! What if the noise in the completeness case was just that \(q\) is perturbed by some (known, or available via samples as well) noise coming from a second distribution \(\eta\)? I.e., the question is now to test whether \(p\) if of the form \(\alpha q + (1-\alpha) \eta\) for some \(\alpha\in [0,1]\), or if it is \(\varepsilon\)-far from all mixtures of \(q\) and \(\eta\). The authors have various results on this question and some extensions, but the upshot is: “with structured noise, strongly sublinear sample complexity is once again possible.”<br /><strong><br />Can Distributed Uniformity Testing Be Local?</strong>, by Uri Meir, Dor Mintzer, and Rotem Oshman (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3331613">ACM PODC Proceedings</a>). More on identity testing, specifically uniformity testing. No noise here, but another constraint: the samples are distributed. There are \(k\) players, each holding \(q\) i.i.d. samples from a distribution \(p\) over \([n]\); each can send \(\ell=1\) bit to a central referee, in a non-interactive fashion. Is \(p\) the uniform distribution, or is it \(\varepsilon\)-far from it? The authors here consider the case where \(k,n,\varepsilon\) are fixed, and prove lower bounds on the number \(q=q(k,n,\varepsilon)\) of samples each player must hold in order to perform this uniformity testing task. (Note: their lower bounds hold even in the public-randomness setting.) Motivated by the LOCAL model, they focus on 3 cases of interest, for which they obtain tight or near-tight bounds on \(q\) (in view of upper bounds from previous work of a subset of the authors): (1)  when the referee’s decision has to be the \(\textsf{AND}\) of all \(n\) bits she receives; (2) when the referee can do something more involved, and use a threshold function; and (3) when the referee can use an arbitrary function of those \(n\) messages. Underlying those lower bounds is a neat application of Boolean Fourier analysis, recasting the analysis of the standard “Paninski” lower bound instance and the player’s decision functions as a question on Boolean functions.<br /><br /><strong>Domain Compression and its Application to Randomness-Optimal  Distributed Goodness-of-Fit</strong>, by Jayadev Acharya, Clément Canonne, Yanjun Han, Ziteng Sun, and Himanshu Tyagi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08743">arXiv</a>,<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/098/">ECCC</a>). Remember the paper just above? Now, focus on the case (3), where the referee can use any function of the message, allow each player to send \(\ell\) bits instead of one, but give only one sample (instead of \(q\)) to each player. This becomes a setting we have talked about before on this blog (specifically, with three papers on <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=990">these</a> <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1030">three</a> <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1075">months</a>). Those three papers established the optimal number of player \(k\), in terms of  the domain size \(n\), the distance parameter \(\varepsilon\), and the number of bits per player \(\ell\), in both the private-coin and public-coin settings. This new work interpolates between those two extremes, and gives the tight answer to the general question: if there are \( 0\leq s \leq \log n\) bits of public randomness available, what is the optimal number of players to perform identity testing? Behind the upper bounds is a new notion of (randomness-efficient) <em>domain compression</em> they introduce: how to reduce the domain size of the probability distributions while preserving the \(\ell_1\) distances between them as much as possible?<br /><br /><strong>Towards Testing Monotonicity of Distributions Over General Posets</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Themis Gouleakis, John Peebles, Ronitt Rubinfeld, and Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03182">arXiv</a>). Away from identity testing, let’s now consider another central question, testing <em>monotonicity</em> of distributions. Specifically, a distribution \(p\) over a given poset \((\mathcal{X}, \prec)\) is said to be monotone if \(p(x) \leq p(y)\) whenever \(x\prec y\). While the question is fully understood for the familiar case of the line \(\mathcal{X} = \{1,2,\dots,n\}\), the case of general posets is much murkier, and more or less uncharted. This paper initiates a general study of the question, improving on previously known bounds for the matching poset and Boolean hypercube, and providing several new results and techniques for the general case, to establish both upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity.</p>



<p>And now… graphs!<br /><strong>Expansion Testing using Quantum Fast-Forwarding and Seed Sets</strong>, by Simon Apers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02369">arXiv</a>). This paper is concerned with (bicriteria) testing of vertex expansion of a given graph \(G=(V,E)\) in the bounded-degree graph model. Loosely speaking, given a value \(\Phi\) and query access <em>(i.e., sampling a node u.a.r., querying the degree of a node, and querying the \(i\)-th neighbor of a node) </em>to a graph \(G\) with maximum degree \(d=\Theta(1)\), the goal is to distinguish between (i) \(G\) has vertex expansion at most \(\Phi\) and (ii) \(G\) is \(\varepsilon\)-far from any \(G’\) with vertex expansion at most \(\Phi^2\) <em>(simplifying and dropping some technicalities)</em>. The previous state-of-the-art was a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/2}/\Phi^2)\) query complexity for classical algorithms, and a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(\min(n^{1/3}/\Phi^2),n^{1/2}/\Phi^2))\) query complexity upper bound for quantum testers. The current work improves on this by providing a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/3}/\Phi)\) quantum tester. Graphs expand—and so does the gap between classical and quantum testing.<br /><br /><strong>Walking Randomly, Massively, and Efficiently</strong>, by Jakub Łącki, Slobodan Mitrović, Krzysztof Onak, and Piotr Sankowski  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05391">arXiv</a>). One very useful primitive, in many graph property testing results and of course well beyond property testing, is the ability to perform random walks on graphs. In the case of large, distributed (or merely impractically massive) graphs, however, it is not clear how to implement this primitive efficiently. This work addresses this question in the MPC (Massive Parallel Computation) model, and shows how to perform independently, from all of the \(n\) nodes of a graph (i.e., machine), an \(\ell\)-length random walk with only \(O(\log \ell)\) rounds of communication and \(O(n^\alpha)\) space per machine, for any constant \(\alpha \in(0,1)\). This round complexity matches a known (conditional) lower bound, and thus the result is as good as it gets — further, the authors obtain such MPC algorithms for both undirected and directed graph, somehow leveraging the latter case to handle the (significantly more complicated) directed case. As an application of this efficient random walk primitive, they provide MPC property testing algorithms for both bipartiteness and vertex expansion<em> (same definition as in the paper above: vertex expansion \(\Phi\) vs. \(\varepsilon\)-far from any \(G’\) with vertex expansion \(\Phi^2\))</em> in the general graph model. (Beyond property testing, another application—the main one in the paper— is computing PageRank in both graphs and directed graphs.)<br /><strong><br />A Lower Bound on Cycle-Finding in Sparse Digraphs</strong>, by Xi Chen, Tim Randolph, Rocco Servedio, and Timothy Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12106">arXiv</a>). In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of one-sided testing of acyclicity of directed graphs, in the bounded-degree graph model (equivalently, on the task of finding a cycle in a digraph promised to be far from acyclic). Previously, an \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) lower bound for this task had been shown by Bender and Ron, based on a birthday-paradox-type argument; this work improves on this hardness result, showing that \(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{5/9})\) queries are necessary. Interestingly, whether achieving any \(o(n)\) query complexity is possible remains open.<br /><br /><strong>Constant-Time Dynamic \((\Delta+1)\)-Coloring and Weight Approximation for  Minimum Spanning Forest: Dynamic Algorithms Meet Property Testing</strong>, by Monika Henzinger and Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04745">arXiv</a>). Finally, the last paper covered this month is concerned with <em>dynamic graph algorithms</em>: where updates to a graph (which can be both edge additions <em>and</em> deletions) come sequentially, and the objective is to maintain, e.g., a coloring, or an approximation of some function of the graph, at any time using as little time per update. This paper advocates the use of techniques from property testing <em>(loosely speaking, as their locality and query-efficiency translates to fast update times)</em> to design better dynamic graph algorithms. It illustrates this idea by obtaining several new results, in particular an (amortized) \(O(1)\)-update-time randomized algorithm to maintain a \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring in a graph with degree bound \(\Delta\). The algorithm relies on a random ranking of the nodes which, combined with a suitable randomized update rule for recoloring a vertex when needed, ensure that the recolorings will not (with high probability) “propagate” to much. This is the first time that this idea, previously used in several testing and sublinear-time papers, is used in the context of dynamic graph algorithms—adding an edge between the two areas, hopefully only the first of many.<br /></p>

Blumenthal</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00265">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Due to their capacity to encode rich structural information, labeled graphs
are often used for modeling various kinds of objects such as images, molecules,
and chemical compounds. If pattern recognition problems such as clustering and
classification are to be solved on these domains, a (dis-)similarity measure
for labeled graphs has to be defined. A widely used measure is the graph edit
distance (GED), which, intuitively, is defined as the minimum amount of
distortion that has to be applied to a source graph in order to transform it
into a target graph. The main advantage of GED is its flexibility and
sensitivity to small differences between the input graphs. Its main drawback is
that it is hard to compute.
</p>
<p>In this thesis, new results and techniques for several aspects of computing
GED are presented. Firstly, theoretical aspects are discussed: competing
definitions of GED are harmonized, the problem of computing GED is
characterized in terms of complexity, and several reductions from GED to the
quadratic assignment problem (QAP) are presented. Secondly, solvers for the
linear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE) are discussed.
LSAPE is a generalization of the well-known linear sum assignment problem
(LSAP), and has to be solved as a subproblem by many GED algorithms. In
particular, a new solver is presented that efficiently reduces LSAPE to LSAP.
Thirdly, exact algorithms for computing GED are presented in a systematic way,
and improvements of existing algorithms as well as a new mixed integer
programming (MIP) based approach are introduced. Fourthly, a detailed overview
of heuristic algorithms that approximate GED via upper and lower bounds is
provided, and eight new heuristics are described. Finally, a new easily
extensible C++ library for exactly or approximately computing GED is presented.

assignment of papers to reviewers. A recurring issue in allocation problems is
the compatibility of welfare/efficiency and fairness. Given an oracle to find a
welfare-achieving allocation, we embed such an oracle into a flexible algorithm
called the Constrained Round Robin (CRR) algorithm, that achieves the required
welfare level. Our algorithm also allows the system designer to lower the
welfare requirements in order to achieve a higher degree of fairness. If the
welfare requirement is lowered enough, a strengthening of envy-freeness up to
one item is guaranteed. Hence, our algorithm can be viewed as a computationally
efficient way to interpolate between welfare and approximate envy-freeness in
allocation problems.

data into its constituent loads. This paper decomposes daily use data of a
household unit into fixed loads and one or more classes of shiftable loads. The
latter is characterized by ON OFF duty cycles. A novel algorithm based on
nonnegative matrix factorization NMF for energy disaggregation is proposed,
where fixed loads are represented in terms of real-valued basis vectors,
whereas shiftable loads are divided into binary signals. This binary
decomposition approach directly applies L0 norm constraints on individual
shiftable loads. The new approach obviates the need for more computationally
intensive methods e.g. spectral decomposition or mean field annealing that have
been used in earlier research for these constraints. A probabilistic framework
for the proposed approach has been addressed. The proposed approach s
effectiveness has been demonstrated with real consumer energy data.

accuracy also scales with both the size and the spatial coherence
(nearby-element similarity) of the matrix. It is thus well-suited for real-time
applications and against many matrices in general.

Fourier coefficients of vector spherical harmonics. In this paper, we develop
fast algorithms (FaVeST) for vector spherical harmonic transforms for these
evaluations. The forward FaVeST which evaluates the Fourier coefficients has
computational steps proportional to $N\log \sqrt{N}$ for $N$ number of
evaluation points. The adjoint FaVeST which evaluates a linear combination of
vector spherical harmonics with degree up to $\sqrt{M}$ for $M$ evaluation
points is proportional to $M\log\sqrt{M}$. Numerical examples illustrate the
accuracy and efficiency of FaVeST.

<p>
Alexander Hamilton was a framer of the U.S. Constitution. He wrote the bulk of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">Federalist Papers</a> (FP) defending the Constitution. Today he is best known for the playbill—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)">musical</a> on his life—and the bill, the US ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we would discuss the U.S. electoral college (EC).</p>
<p>
We are in the midst of the run-up to next year’s President election. An on-going discussion is the issue of the EC. Should it be modified? Should it be replaced? Is it a good idea? </p>
<p>
So let’s recall how the EC works. Then we will look at it from a theory viewpoint. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The College </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The electoral college is how every four years we elect the President of the United States. It is not a direct popular vote. The Constitution created it as a compromise between a direct popular vote and a vote by the members of Congress. Back then, the framers of the Constitution, including Hamilton, did not trust the electorate. Hence, the rationale for the EC.</p>
<p>
Today the EC consists of 538 electors. Voters in each state pick electors, who then vote in EC for the President. Thus by high math, 270 electors are required to win. A state gets one electoral vote for each member in the House of Representatives plus two. The latter rule ensures that no state gets too few votes. It is some times called the “two-plus rule”.</p>
<p>
The arguments for the EC are distilled in FP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68">No. 68</a>. Although the collaboration/authorship status of numerous FP remains unclear, Hamilton’s claim in his last testament to sole authorship of FP 68 is not seriously disputed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68">Quoting</a> Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Entitled “The Mode of Electing the President”, No. 68 describes a perspective on the process of selecting the Chief Executive of the United States. In writing this essay, the author sought to convince the people of New York of the merits of the proposed Constitution. Number 68 is the second in a series of 11 essays discussing the powers and limitations of the Executive branch and the only one to describe the method of selecting the president. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Opponents today argue against the EC. They point out that it allows one to win without getting the most votes. This has happened in two of the last five elections, in 2000 and 2016. The EC rewards uneven allocations of campaigning to the few “swing-states”. It also gives voters in less populated states more voting power. A vote from Wyoming has over three times the influence on the EC tally as a vote from California. The battle over FP 68 has even been <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/hamilton-68">internationalized</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My College </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Years ago. Decades ago. Eons ago. When I was in college, I almost flunked a required one-credit course in my senior year. The course was on issues of the election that year of the President. No it did not involve Hamilton. </p>
<p>
The grade of the course was based on a term paper. Mine, which got a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal D}" class="latex" title="{\cal D}" />, was based on an argument for the EC. Thankfully, the grade was just enough to get me a pass in the course, and allow me to graduate. I did not take the course seriously—my attendance was spotty, at best.</p>
<p>
My idea was that there was an argument for the EC based on a connection with the ability to manage elections. My central thesis was: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The ability to accurately predict the outcome of a Presidential election is inherently undesirable</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Let’s agree that we will call this the <i>Prediction Assumption</i> (PA). Predicting the outcome of elections may not be a good idea. If predictions could be accurate, then one could argue that this would allow candidates to manipulate the election. I think you could make the case that this could be a problem. Candidates would be able to manage their opinions to optimize their chances of winning the election. </p>
<p>
In any event I then proved a result that showed that given PA, one could argue that the EC was better than a popular election. Note, the usual math arguments against the EC are based on the power of individual voters. See <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01616.pdf?ver=2019-02-12-215230-620">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-funky-math-of-the-electoral-college/">here</a> for some of their insights.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My College Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The central point of my paper was informally this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem:</b> <em> Prediction of an election using EC is more difficult than one using the popular vote. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A simple example should help. Imagine an election with three states: Northeast, West, and South. Let them each have one electoral vote. Clearly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> are needed to win. Suppose the states are arranged like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Northeast: Almost all for A; <p></p>
</li><li>
West: Almost all for B; <p></p>
</li><li>
South: Close between A and B.
</li></ul>
<p>
Then prediction requires the polling to be able to tell the outcome of the South vote. The point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The smaller the number of voters in the ensemble being predicted, the more uncertain the prediction. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Ken argues that simply having a multiplicity of component elections—one in each state plus DC—also increases the uncertainty. This may happen technically just because the result is a kind of average over unequal-sized averages. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Their Papers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Modern results in Boolean function theory actually have studied the noise sensitivity of the EC. They have studied how errors in voting can flip an election. Look at Gil Kalai’s 2010 <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/CHAOS.pdf">paper</a>, “Noise Sensitivity And Chaos In Social Choice Theory.” He shows that majority is more stable in the presence of noise than the EC. Look at Ryan O’Donnell’s <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/analysis-survey.pdf">paper</a>, “Some Topics in Analysis of Boolean Functions.” He shows a related point that errors in EC—in a simple model—can increase the chance that errors flip the election factor of about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5.7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5.7}" class="latex" title="{5.7}" />.</p>
<p>
Neither paper strikes me as studying whether predictions are easier with the simple majority rule than with the EC.<br />
I believe that their new results can be used to prove the same type of theorems on prediction. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Did I deserve a better grade than a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal D}" class="latex" title="{\cal D}" />? Or should I have flunked? Should I have published something?</p>
<p>
For comparison, the college term paper which eventually became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">27th Amendment</a> to the Constitution received a better grade: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal C}" class="latex" title="{\cal C}" />. Oh well.</p>

The affine perimeter of a convex curve is an affine-equivariant number in units of length, zero for polygons and larger for smooth curves. And the limit shape of a convex set is what you get by taking a uniformly random convex subset of a grid within the set, in the limit as the grid becomes very fine; it turns out to be the max-affine-perimeter curve contained in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: and here is a <a href="http://www.careeryoga.life/440ebcdf?fbclid=IwAR2BWeyMdhTg2fbdHp5U-D9gCy2oqLZBk2ljRBMhjtyAEtSgqBCt7kMlSFk">great interview</a> of Noga in English and the interviewer is Narkis Alon, Noga’s youngest daughter and Amalya Duek.</p>
<p>I was very happy to interview my academic doctoral  twin and long-time friend Noga Alon.  <a href="https://youtu.be/9PhckP9eJhg">The interview</a> is an initiative of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. (This is my second interview of this kind. See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/15/an-interview-with-yisrael-robert-aumann/">here</a> for an interview with Yisrael Aumann.) The interview is in Hebrew. (Update: Automatically-produced  English subtitles are available.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For our English speaking readers here is a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/rwiEiGqgetU">Numberphile video</a> with Noga.</p>
<p>We agreed in advance that most of the interview would be about mathematics, and  most of the time  we courageously (and perhaps somewhat recklessly)  tried to explain to a large audience  (starting from scratch) some of Noga’s research directions and results. We hope that people will enjoy the beauty of it even with the missing details and background.</p>
<h3>Noga’s parents, family and childhood</h3>
<p>In the first part of the  interview  Noga talked about his family, his parents, Dror and Hemda, his great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Allon">Yigal Alon</a>, his early childhood, and his early interest in mathematics. Noga liked to solve mathematical riddles from a young age. One reason Noga was drawn to mathematics is that unlike other topics, in mathematics there are absolute truths, and a mathematical proof (when such exists)  is perhaps the only way you can settle a debate. Noga gave an amusing example from his youth regarding the Eurovision song context. Then he mentioned the <a href="https://www.reali.org.il/en/%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%94-%d7%a9%d7%a0%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%a8%d7%99%d7%90%d7%9c%d7%99/">Hebrew Reali school in Haifa</a>, a mathematics teacher there, Yaakov Kaplan,  newly immigrated from the former Soviet Union, who greatly influenced Noga. Noga also talked about his participation in the Israeli Mathematical Olympiad where the two of us first met 45 years ago.  Next, the two of us met during our military service, and in parallel to his service, Noga finished his M. Sc. and Ph. D with Micha A. Perles, who was also my supervisor.</p>
<h3>An hour of mathematics</h3>
<p>The mathematical part of the video starts with Noga’s  overview of combinatorics. Then we moved to specific topics.</p>
<p>(22:40- 33:30) Noga’s negative solution to Shannon’s conjecture about the capacity of two graphs (and a little about Claude Shannon and information theory)</p>
<p>(33:30- 40:25) The combinatorial nullstellensatz and the polynomial method and a little about the game SET</p>
<p>(40:25 – 46:50) The probabilistic method and a little on the history of probability and about Paul Erdos.</p>
<p>(46:50-  54:50)  Streaming algorithms, a topic introduced by Noga Alon, Yossi Matias, and Mario Szegedy, and more generally, about positive and negative results in computer science, and their practical applications.</p>
<p>(54:50 – 59:25)    Expander graphs and “spectroscopy of graphs”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png?w=640&amp;h=326" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17717" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>59:25  -1:05:40 Ramsey theory</p>
<p>1:05:40-1:12:20 Factoring integers with quantum computers and with classical methods</p>
<p>1:12:00-1:20:00 Combinatorics, economics and game theory:  Noga’s theorem that large committees require a large budget!</p>
<h3>Going back from mathematics to life itself</h3>
<p>After a full hour of mathematics, we returned to life itself. Memories from our years as postdocs at MIT, and our 1993 conference in Jerusalem. Noga talked a little about women in science and in society, about his three daughters, about  the possibility that science, like sport,  can bridge different groups and different peoples, and about politics and prospects for better relations with our Arab neighbors and Iran (Noga is somewhat optimistic and so am I),  prospects about getting old (we are hopeful about it), and advice to young researchers. Noga’s message at the end was that there are many paths to mathematical research and he encouraged young people that like mathematics to follow and enjoy them.</p>

Inspired by Nisan's characterization of noncommutative complexity (Nisan 1991), we study different notions of nonnegative rank, associated complexity measures and their link with monotone computations. In particular we answer negatively an open question of Nisan asking whether nonnegative rank characterizes monotone noncommutative complexity for algebraic branching programs. We also prove a rather tight lower bound for the computation of elementary symmetric polynomials by algebraic branching programs in the monotone setting or, equivalently, in the homogeneous syntactically multilinear setting.</div>

<p>For those who haven’t yet seen it, Erica Klarreich has a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/">wonderful article in </a><em><a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/">Quanta</a></em> on Hao Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture.  <em>This</em> is how good popular writing about math can be.</p>



<p>Klarreich quotes my line from this blog, “I find it hard to imagine that even God knows how to prove the Sensitivity Conjecture in any simpler way than this.”  However, even if God doesn’t know a simpler proof, that of course doesn’t rule out the possibility that <strong>Don Knuth</strong> does!  And indeed, a couple days ago Knuth posted <a href="https://www.cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/huang.pdf">his own variant of Huang’s proof</a> on his homepage—in Knuth’s words, fleshing out the <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1813084">argument</a> that Shalev Ben-David previously posted on this blog—and then left a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229#comment-1815290">comment</a> about it here, the first comment by Knuth that I know about on this blog or any other blog.  I’m honored—although as for whether the variants that avoid the Cauchy Interlacing Theorem are actually “simpler,” I guess I’ll leave that between Huang, Ben-David, Knuth, and God.</p>



<p>In <em>Communications of the ACM</em>, Samuel Greengard has a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/8/238339-the-algorithm-that-changed-quantum-machine-learning/fulltext?mobile=false">good, detailed article</a> on Ewin Tang and her dequantization of the quantum recommendation systems algorithm.  One warning (with thanks to commenter Ted): the sentence “The only known provable separation theorem between quantum and classical is sqrt(<em>n</em>) vs. <em>n</em>” is mistaken, though it gestures in the direction of a truth.  In the <em>black-box</em> setting, we can rigorously prove all sorts of separations: sqrt(<em>n</em>) vs. <em>n</em> (for Grover search), exponential (for period-finding), and more.  In the non-black-box setting, we can’t prove any such separations at all.</p>



<p>Last week I returned to the US from the <a href="https://fqxi.org/conference/home/2019">FQXi meeting</a> in the Tuscan countryside.  This year’s theme was “Mind Matters: Intelligence and Agency in the Physical World.”  I gave a talk entitled “The Search for Physical Correlates of Consciousness: Lessons from the Failure of Integrated Information Theory” (<a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/iitfail.ppt">PowerPoint slides here</a>), which reprised my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1799">blog</a> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1823">posts</a> critical of IIT from five years ago.  There were thought-provoking talks by many others who might be known to readers of this blog, including Sean Carroll, David Chalmers, Max Tegmark, Seth Lloyd, Carlo Rovelli, Karl Friston … you can see the full schedule <a href="https://fqxi.org/conference/schedule/2019">here</a>.  Apparently video of the talks is not available yet but will be soon.</p>



<p>Let me close this post by sharing two important new insights about quantum mechanics that emerged from my conversations at the FQXi meeting:</p>



<p>(1) In Hilbert space, no one can hear you scream. Unless, that is, you scream the exact same way everywhere, or unless you split into separate copies, one for each different way of screaming.</p>



<p>(2) It’s true that, as a matter of logic, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation">Schrödinger equation</a> does not imply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule">Born Rule</a>.  Having said that, if the Schrödinger equation were leading a rally, and the crowd started a chant of “BORN RULE! BORN RULE! BORN RULE!”—the Schrödinger equation would just smile and wait 13 seconds for the chant to die down before continuing.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>My latest arXiv preprint is “Some polycubes have no edge-unzipping” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08433">arXiv:1907.08433</a>, with Erik and Marty Demaine and Joe O’Rourke). It’s about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)">polyhedral unfolding</a>, the problem of cutting a polyhedron along some of its edges into a surface that unfolds into a flat polygon in the plane (a “net”). Although it dates back to the work of Albrecht Dürer, we still don’t know a lot about this problem, in general. We don’t know whether every convex polyhedron has an unfolding, and we don’t know whether every polycube has a folding (allowing cuts in the middle of flat faces as long as they are on boundary edges of the cubes making up the polycube).</p>

<p>The preprint is about a variation of unfolding in which the cut has to form a path through the graph of vertices and edges. If the polyhedron has the topology of a sphere and there are no flat vertices (with a full  total angle of surrounding faces) then all vertices must be touched by a cut, and it’s the same thing to ask for an unfolding that forms a Hamiltonian path. These zipper-unfoldings have previously been studied, notably in joint work by two parent-child groups, <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2010/08/12/more-from-cccg.html">Marty and his son Erik, and Anna Lubiw and her two sons Arlo and Jonah from CCCG 2010</a>. The new preprint shows that they don’t always exist for (topologically spherical) polycubes. In particular, the following shape has no flat vertices, but its graph is bipartite and unbalanced enough that it also has no Hamiltonian path.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/zipless.png" alt="A zipless polycube" /></p>

<p>It does have an unfolding, though (figure made by Erik using <a href="https://github.com/amandaghassaei/OrigamiSimulator">OrigamiSimulator</a>):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/zipless.gif" alt="Unfolding a zipless polycube" /></p>

<p>The paper also has a smaller example that’s a little tricker to prove zipless. It’s a small enough advance that we probably won’t bother trying to turn it into a conference or journal paper. (If it were just me, I’d probably have just made a blog post about it. And here we are!)</p>

Existing proofs that deduce $\mathbf{BPP}=\mathbf{P}$ from circuit lower bounds convert randomized algorithms into deterministic algorithms with a large polynomial slowdown. We convert randomized algorithms into deterministic ones with little slowdown. Specifically, assuming exponential lower bounds against nondeterministic circuits, we convert any randomized algorithm over inputs of length $n$ running in time $t \ge n$ to a deterministic one running in time $t^{2+\alpha}$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\alpha &gt; 0$. Such a slowdown is nearly optimal, as, under complexity-theoretic assumptions, there are problems with an inherent quadratic derandomization slowdown. We also convert any randomized algorithm that errs rarely into a deterministic algorithm having a similar running time (with pre-processing).

Our results follow from a new, nearly optimal, explicit pseudorandom generator fooling circuits of size $s$ with seed length $(1+\alpha)\log s$, under the assumption that there exists a function $f \in \mathbf{E}$ that requires nondeterministic circuits of size at least $2^{(1-\alpha')n}$, where $\alpha = O(\alpha')$. The construction uses, among other ideas, a new connection between pseudoentropy generators and locally list recoverable codes.</div>

BILL: How did you deduce that? (She is right, see  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48962557">here</a>.)<br />
<br />
DARLING: Since you asked it, it couldn't be a member of the Royal Family (you don't care about that) or some British Politician (you don't care about that either). It had to be a mathematician or computer scientist.<br />
<br />
BILL: It could have been Hardy. I wonder if Ramanujan could qualify---do they need to be British? At <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/banknote-characters">this website</a> it says<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Of course, banknotes need to be universally accepted. We therefore look for UK characters who have made an important contribution to our society and culture through their innovation, leadership or values. We do not include fictional characters, or people who are still living (except the monarch on the front of the note). Finally, we need to have a suitable portrait of the person which will be easy to recognise.</i><br />
<br />
(They spell <i>recognise</i> with an s instead of a z, so spellcheck flagged it, but I won't change it.) <br />
<br />
Note that people on the banknotes have to be <i>UK characters</i>. I honestly don't know if that means they must be citizens.<br />
<br />
OKAY, so here are a few thoughts on Turing.<br />
<br />
1) When I visited Bletchley Park there was a booklet that bragged about the fact that Bletchley Park was much better at cracking codes than Germany because  they allowed people to work there based only on ability (unlike Germany) - women worked there, Turing who was Gay worked there. I think this is simplistic. Did any Jews work there (anti-semitism was widespread in England, and the world, at the time)? I doubt any blacks worked there since if they did that would be well known by now (if I am wrong let me know). Women DID work there but was their work respected and used? (I honestly don't know). Did Germany also use women at their codebreaking centers? Was Turing known to be gay (if not then Bletchley gets no points for tolerating him). Was JUST having Turing the reason they could crack codes. Plus I am sure there were other factors aside from merit-only.<br />
<br />
2) Turing was given a Pardon for his ``crimes'' in August 2014. When I see things like this I wonder who was against it and why and if they were an obstacle.<br />
<br />
a) Human Rights Advocate Peter Tatchell noted that its wrong to just single out Turing. Other people prosecuted under that law who did not help beat the German's in WW II should also be pardoned. The government later DID such a pardon in 2017.<br />
<br />
b) Judge Minister Lord McNally objected to the pardon:<br />
<br />
<i>A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never again return to those times.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
While I disagree with him, I do note that, based on what he wrote and his general record, I think he is not saying this from being anti-gay.  There is  a hard general question here: how does a society right past wrongs? I think pardoning and apologizing is certainly fine, but frankly it seems to weak. What else could a society due? Financial renumeration to living relatives? I don't think giving Inagh Payne (Turing's niece, who I think is still alive) would really help here.<br />
<br />
c) <i>At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage<br />
</i><br />
<br />
I couldn't find Chope's reasons. On the one hand, they may be similar to McNally's. On the other hand he is against same sex marriage so its possible (though I do not know this) that he anti-gay and that is why he is against the pardon. If someone can find what his explanation for blocking the Turing bill is, or other evidence that he is anti-gay, please leave it in the comments.<br />
<br />
3) Did the delay matter? I was surprised to find out---Yes. Here is the full passage from Wikipedia:<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014,[175] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[176] the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect.[17] Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal conviction.[16][18] The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[177] The Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.[178] Pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.[179]</i><br />
<br />
This amazed me! I thought the Queen had NO power (too bad--- I wish she could just say NO BREXIT). Or that she formally has power but if she ever used it, it might be blocked somehow and  taken away. So I am surprised she has a power she can use at all.<br />
<br />
4) I wonder if the Pardon had to happen before they put him on the Banknote. I have been told that this is a very American Question--- England has no Constitution and operates more on Custom and Tradition than on written rules. <br />
<br />
5) I had always assumed that Turing committed suicide. Without going into detail, the Wikipedia site on Turing does give intelligent counterarguments to this. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">here</a><br /></div>
