<p><br /></p><p>1) Democrats think the best way to avoid school shootings (and other problems with guns) is to have regulations on Guns. They have proposed legislation. The Republicans think its a mental health issue. They have proposed legislation for this. NO THEY HAVEN"T. I would respect the <i>its a mental health</i> <i>issue</i> argument if the people saying this  respected it. They do not. See <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/report-texas-last-access-mental-health-care/269-1283fcee-0dc4-4948-9dda-886f55c49ca3">here</a>. Idea: Politico should leak a (false) memo  by Gov Abbott where he says </p><p><i>We have a serious mental health crisis in Texas which caused the recent event. I am not just saying this to deflect from the gun issue. I have drawn up a bill to fund mental health care, providing more money, for care and for studies. I call on Republicans and Democrats to pass it ASAP.</i></p><p>I wonder- if this false memo was leaked, would he deny it and say </p><p><i>I didn't write that. I am using mental health only as a way to deflect from the gun issue. How dare they say that I am reasonable and am proposing actual solutions. </i></p><p>Or would he be forced to follow through?</p><p>2) Democrats think Biden won the election. Some Republicans think Trump won the election. One issue was Arizona. So some republicans organized a recount of Arizona. And when they found out that Biden really did win it they said, as the good Popperian scientists they are, <i>we had a falsifiable hypothesis and it</i> <i>was shown to be false, so now we acknowledge the original hypothesis was wrong. </i>NO THEY DIDN"T. They seem to point to the Arizona audit as proof that they were right, even though it proves the opposite. (Same for all the court cases they lost.)</p><p>3) At one time I read some books that challenged evolution (Darwin on Trial by Phillip Johnson was one of them). Some of them DID raise some good points about how science is done (I am NOT being sarcastic). Some of them DID raise some questions like the gap in the fossil record and Michael Behe's notion of irreducible complexity.  (In hindsight these were window dressing and not what they cared about.) MY thought at the time was <i>its good to have people</i> v<i>iew a branch of science with a different viewpoint. Perhaps the scientists at the Discovery Institute will find something interesting. </i>(The Discovery institute is a think tank and one of their interests is Int. Design.) Alas, the ID people seem to spend their time either challenging the teaching of Evolution in school OR doing really bad science. Could intelligent people who think Evolution is not correct look at it in a different way than scientists do, and do good science, or at least raise good questions,  and come up with something interesting? I used to think so.

<p>I hereby precommit that this will be my last post, for a long time, around the twin themes of (1) the horribleness in the United States and the world, and (2) my desperate attempts to reason with various online commenters who hold me personally complicit in all this horribleness.  I should really focus my creativity more on <em>actually fixing</em> the world’s horribleness, than on seeking out every random social-media mudslinger who blames me for it, shouldn’t I?  Still, though, isn’t undue obsession with the latter a pretty ordinary human failing, a pretty understandable one?</p>



<p>So anyway, if you’re one of the thousands of readers who come here simply to learn more about quantum computing and computational complexity, rather than to try to provoke me into mounting a public defense of my own existence (which defense will then, ironically but inevitably, stimulate <em>even more</em> attacks that need to be defended against) … well, either scroll down to the very end of this post, or wait for the next post.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Thanks so much to all my readers who donated to <a href="https://fundtexaschoice.org/">Fund Texas Choice</a>.  As promised, I’ve personally given them a total of $4,106.28, to match the donations that came in by the deadline.  I’d encourage people to continue donating anyway, while for my part I’ll probably run some more charity matching campaigns soon.  These things are addictive, like pulling the lever of a slot machine, but where the rewards go to making the world an infinitesimal amount more consistent with your values.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Of course, now there’s a brand-new atrocity to shame my adopted state of Texas before the world.  While the Texas government will go to extraordinary lengths to protect unborn children, the world has now witnessed 19 of its<em>born</em> children consigned to gruesome deaths, as the “good guys with guns”—waited outside and prevented parents from entering the classrooms where their children were being shot.  I have nothing original to add to the global outpourings of rage and grief.  Forget about the statistical frequency of these events: I know perfectly well that the risk from car crashes and home accidents is orders-of-magnitude greater.  Think about it this way: the United States is now known to the world as “the country that can’t or won’t do anything to stop its children from semi-regularly being gunned down in classrooms,” not even measures that virtually every other comparable country on earth has successfully taken.  It’s become <em>the</em> symbol of national decline, dysfunction, and failure.  If so, then the stakes here could fairly be called existential ones—not because of its <em>direct</em> effects on child life expectancy or GDP or any other index of collective well-being that you can define and measure, but rather, because a country that lacks the will to solve this will be judged by the world, and probably accurately, as lacking the will to solve anything else.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>In return for the untold thousands of hours I’ve poured into this blog, which has never once had advertising or asked for subscriptions, my reward has been years of vilification by sneerers and trolls.  Some of the haters even compare me to Elliot Rodger and other aggrieved mass shooters.  And I mean: yes, it’s <em>true</em> that I was bullied and miserable for years.  It’s true that Elliot Rodger, Salvador Ramos (the Uvalde shooter), and most other mass shooters were also bullied and miserable for years.  But, Scott-haters, if we’re being intellectually honest about this, we might say that the similarities between the mass shooter story and the Scott Aaronson story end at a certain point not very long after that.  We might say: it’s not just that Aaronson didn’t respond by hurting anybody—rather, it’s that his response loudly <em>affirmed</em> the values of the Enlightenment, meaning like, the whole package, from individual autonomy to science and reason to the rejection of sexism and racism to everything in between.  Affirmed it in a manner that’s not secretly about popularity (demonstrably so, because it doesn’t <em>get</em> popularity), affirmed it via self-questioning methods intellectually honest enough that they’d probably <em>still</em> have converged on the right answer even in situations where it’s now obvious that almost everyone you around would’ve been converging on the <em>wrong</em> answer, like (say) Nazi Germany or the antebellum South.</p>



<p>I’ve been to the valley of darkness.  While there, I decided that the only “revenge” against the bullies that was possible or desirable was to <em>do</em> something with my life, to achieve something in science that at least some bullies might envy, while also starting a loving family and giving more than most to help strangers on the Internet and whatever good cause comes to his attention and so on.  And after 25 years of effort, some people might say I’ve sort of <em>achieved</em> the “revenge” as I’d then defined it.  And they might further say: if you could get every school shooter to redefine “revenge” as “becoming another Scott Aaronson,” that would be, you know, like, a step upwards.  An improvement.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>And let this be the final word on the matter that I ever utter in all my days, to the thousands of SneerClubbers and Twitter randos who pursue this particular line of attack against Scott Aaronson (yes, we do mean the <em>thousands</em>—which means, it both <em>feels to its recipient like</em> the entire earth yet <em>actually is</em> less than 0.01% of the earth). </p>



<p><strong>We see what <em>Scott</em> did with <em>his</em> life, when subjected for a decade to forms of psychological pressure that are infamous for causing young males to lash out violently.  What would <em>you</em> have done with <em>your</em> life?</strong></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>A couple weeks ago, when the trolling attacks were arriving minute by minute, I toyed with the idea of permanently shutting down this blog.  <em>What’s the point?</em> I asked myself.  <em>Back in 2005, the open Internet was fun; now it’s a charred battle zone.  Why not restrict conversation to my academic colleagues and friends?  Haven’t I done enough for a public that gives me so much grief?</em>  I was dissuaded by many messages of support from loyal readers.  Thank you so much.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>If anyone needs something to cheer them up, you should really watch <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/prehistoric-planet/umc.cmc.4lh4bmztauvkooqz400akxav?ign-itscg=MC_20000&amp;ign-itsct=atvp_brand_omd&amp;mttn3pid=Google%20AdWords&amp;mttnagencyid=a5e&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnsiteid=143238&amp;mttnsubad=OUS2019950_1-600303192626-c&amp;mttnsubkw=144248666108__J1lRfctc_&amp;mttnsubplmnt=">Prehistoric Planet</a>, narrated by an excellent, 96-year-old David Attenborough.  Maybe 35 years from now, people will believe dinosaurs looked or acted somewhat differently from these portrayals, just like they believe somewhat differently now from when I was a kid.  On the other hand, if you literally took a time machine to the Late Cretaceous and starting filming, you couldn’t get a result that <em>seemed</em> more realistic, let’s say to a documentary-watching child, than these CGI dinosaurs on their CGI planet seem.  So, in the sense of passing that child’s Turing Test, you might argue, the problem of bringing back the dinosaurs has now been solved.</p>



<p>If you … err … <em>really</em> want to be cheered up, you can follow up with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/series/dinosaur-apocalypse/">Dinosaur Apocalypse</a>, <em>also</em> narrated by Attenborough, where you can (again, as if you were there) watch the dinosaurs being drowned and burned alive in their billions when the asteroid hits.  We’d still be scurrying under rocks, were it not for that lucky event that only a monster could’ve called lucky at the time.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Several people asked me to comment on the recent <a href="https://scorpioncapital.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reports/IONQ.pdf">savage investor review</a> against the quantum computing startup IonQ.  The review amusingly mixed together every imaginable line of criticism, with every imaginable degree of reasonableness from 0% to 100%.  Like, quantum computing is impossible even in theory, <em>and</em> (in the very next sentence) other companies are much closer to realizing quantum computing than IonQ is.  And <a href="https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond">IonQ’s response</a> to the criticism, and see also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/05/26/waging-war-on-quantum/">this</a> by the indefatigable Gil Kalai.</p>



<p>Is it, err, OK if I sit this one out for now?  There’s probably, like, actually an <em>already-existing</em> machine learning model where, if you trained it on all of my previous quantum computing posts, it would know exactly what to say about this.</p></div>

et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The
original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations
encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the
syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end
up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res
over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a
comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle
this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only
LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently
known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from
Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res
and LQU$^+$-Res.
</p>
<p>Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i)
MRes is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system,
and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an
exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the
context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal
variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without
weakening. These results suggest that MRes is better used with weakening,
though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open.
We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+$
$\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and
Slivovsky).

communication efficient federated learning. In DME, clients communicate their
lossily compressed gradients to the parameter server, which estimates the
average and updates the model. State of the art DME techniques apply either
unbiased quantization methods, resulting in large estimation errors, or biased
quantization methods, where unbiasing the result requires that the server
decodes each gradient individually, which markedly slows the aggregation time.
In this paper, we propose QUIC-FL, a DME algorithm that achieves the best of
all worlds. QUIC-FL is unbiased, offers fast aggregation time, and is
competitive with the most accurate (slow aggregation) DME techniques. To
achieve this, we formalize the problem in a novel way that allows us to use
standard solvers to design near-optimal unbiased quantization schemes.

from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. In the $H$-Coloring problem the graph $H$ is fixed and
we ask whether an instance graph $G$ admits an $H$-coloring. A generalization
of this problem is $H$-ColoringExt, where some vertices of $G$ are already
mapped to vertices of $H$ and we ask if this partial mapping can be extended to
an $H$-coloring.
</p>
<p>We study the complexity of variants of $H$-Coloring in $F$-free graphs, i.e.,
graphs excluding a fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. For integers $a,b,c
\geq 1$, by $S_{a,b,c}$ we denote the graph obtained by identifying one
endvertex of three paths on $a+1$, $b+1$, and $c+1$ vertices, respectively. For
odd $k \geq 5$, by $W_k$ we denote the graph obtained from the $k$-cycle by
adding a universal vertex.
</p>
<p>As our main algorithmic result we show that $W_5$-ColoringExt is
polynomial-time solvable in $S_{2,1,1}$-free graphs. This result exhibits an
interesting non-monotonicity of $H$-ColoringExt with respect to taking induced
subgraphs of $H$. Indeed, $W_5$ contains a triangle, and $K_3$-Coloring, i.e.,
classical 3-coloring, is NP-hard already in claw-free (i.e., $S_{1,1,1}$-free)
graphs.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm is based on two main observations:
</p>
<p>1. $W_5$-ColoringExt in $S_{2,1,1}$-free graphs can be in polynomial time
reduced to a variant of the problem of finding an independent set intersecting
all triangles, and
</p>
<p>2. the latter problem can be solved in polynomial time in $S_{2,1,1}$-free
graphs.
</p>
<p>We complement this algorithmic result with several negative ones. In
particular, we show that $W_5$-ColoringExt is NP-hard in $S_{3,3,3}$-free
graphs. This is again uncommon, as usually problems that are NP-hard in
$S_{a,b,c}$-free graphs for some constant $a,b,c$ are already hard in claw-free
graphs.

($S$) with tensor network structure. These embeddings have been used to perform
dimensionality reduction of tensor network structured inputs $x$ and accelerate
applications such as tensor decomposition and kernel regression. Existing works
have designed embeddings for inputs $x$ with specific structures, such that the
computational cost for calculating $Sx$ is efficient. We provide a systematic
way to design tensor network embeddings consisting of Gaussian random tensors,
such that for inputs with more general tensor network structures, both the
sketch size (row size of $S$) and the sketching computational cost are low.
</p>
<p>We analyze general tensor network embeddings that can be reduced to a
sequence of sketching matrices. We provide a sufficient condition to quantify
the accuracy of such embeddings and derive sketching asymptotic cost lower
bounds using embeddings that satisfy this condition and have a sketch size
lower than any input dimension. We then provide an algorithm to efficiently
sketch input data using such embeddings. The sketch size of the embedding used
in the algorithm has a linear dependence on the number of sketching dimensions
of the input. Assuming tensor contractions are performed with classical dense
matrix multiplication algorithms, this algorithm achieves asymptotic cost
within a factor of $O(\sqrt{m})$ of our cost lower bound, where $m$ is the
sketch size. Further, when each tensor in the input has a dimension that needs
to be sketched, this algorithm yields the optimal sketching asymptotic cost. We
apply our sketching analysis to inexact tensor decomposition optimization
algorithms. We provide a sketching algorithm for CP decomposition that is
asymptotically faster than existing work in multiple regimes, and show
optimality of an existing algorithm for tensor train rounding.

sequential iterative algorithms can be directly parallelized but there are
still challenges in achieving work-efficiency and high-parallelism.
Work-efficiency can be hard for certain problems where the number of
dependences is asymptotically more than optimal sequential work bound. To
achieve high-parallelism, we want to process as many objects as possible in
parallel. The goal is to achieve $\tilde{O}(D)$ span for a problem with the
deepest dependence length $D$. We refer to this property as round-efficiency.
In this paper, we show work-efficient and round-efficient algorithms for a
variety of classic problems and propose general approaches to do so.
</p>
<p>To efficiently parallelize many sequential iterative algorithms, we propose
the phase-parallel framework. The framework assigns a rank to each object and
processes them accordingly. All objects with the same rank can be processed in
parallel. To enable work-efficiency and high parallelism, we use two types of
general techniques. Type 1 algorithms aim to use range queries to extract all
objects with the same rank, such that we avoid evaluating all the dependences.
We discuss activity selection, unlimited knapsack, and more using Type 1
framework. Type 2 algorithms aim to wake up an object when the last object it
depends on is finished. We discuss activity selection, longest increasing
subsequence (LIS), and many other algorithms using Type 2 framework.
</p>
<p>All of our algorithms are (nearly) work-efficient and round-efficient. Many
of them improve previous best bounds, and some of them are the first to achieve
work-efficiency with round-efficiency. We also implement many of them. On
inputs with reasonable dependence depth, our algorithms are highly parallelized
and significantly outperform their sequential counterparts.

finding stationary points of nonconvex composite optimization problems. The
objective function is of the form $f+h$ where $h$ is a proper closed convex
function, $f$ is a differentiable function on the domain of $h$, and $\nabla f$
is Lipschitz continuous on the domain of $h$. The main advantage of this method
is that it is "curvature-free" in the sense that it does not require knowledge
of the Lipschitz constant of $\nabla f$ or of any global topological properties
of $f$. It is shown that the proposed method can obtain a $\rho$-approximate
stationary point with iteration complexity bounds that are optimal, up to
logarithmic terms over $\rho$, in both the convex and nonconvex settings. Some
discussion is also given about how the proposed method can be leveraged in
other existing optimization frameworks, such as min-max smoothing and penalty
frameworks for constrained programming, to create more specialized
curvature-free methods. Finally, numerical experiments on a set of nonconvex
quadratic semidefinite programming problems are given to support the practical
viability of the method.

edge-weighted graph $G$, sets of clients $\mathcal{C}$ and hub locations
$\mathcal{H}$, where ${V(G) = \mathcal{C} \cup \mathcal{H}}$, a set of demands
$\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{C}^2$ and a positive integer $k$. A solution is
a set of hubs $H \subseteq \mathcal{H}$ of size $k$ such that every demand
$(a,b)$ is satisfied by a path starting in $a$, going through some vertex of
$H$, and ending in $b$. The objective is to minimize the largest length of a
path. We show that finding a $(3-\epsilon)$-approximation is NP-hard already
for planar graphs. For arbitrary graphs, the approximation lower bound holds
even if we parameterize by $k$ and the value $r$ of an optimal solution. An
exact FPT algorithm is also unlikely when the parameter combines $k$ and
various graph widths, including pathwidth. To confront these hardness barriers,
we give a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm parameterized by treewidth,
and, as a byproduct, for unweighted planar graphs, we give a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm parameterized by $k$ and $r$. Compared
to classical location problems, computing the length of a path depends on
non-local decisions. This turns standard dynamic programming algorithms
impractical, thus our algorithm approximates this length using only local
information. We hope these ideas find application in other problems with
similar cost structure.

We continue a line of work on extracting random bits from weak sources that are generated by simple processes. We focus on the model of locally samplable sources, where each bit in the source depends on a small number of (hidden) uniformly random input bits. Also known as local sources, this model was introduced by De and Watson (TOCT 2012) and Viola (SICOMP 2014), and is closely related to sources generated by AC$^0$ circuits and bounded-width branching programs. In particular, extractors for local sources also work for sources generated by these classical computational models.

Despite being introduced a decade ago, little progress has been made on improving the entropy requirement for extracting from local sources. The current best explicit extractors require entropy $n^{1/2}$, and follow via a reduction to affine extractors. To start, we prove a barrier showing that one cannot hope to improve this entropy requirement via a black-box reduction of this form. In particular, new techniques are needed.

In our main result, we seek to answer whether low-degree polynomials (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) hold potential for breaking this barrier. We answer this question in the positive, and fully characterize the power of low-degree polynomials as extractors for local sources.
More precisely, we show that a random degree $r$ polynomial is a low-error extractor for $n$-bit local sources with min-entropy $\Omega(r(n\log n)^{1/r})$, and we show that this is tight.

Our result leverages several new ingredients, which may be of independent interest. Our existential result relies on a new reduction from local sources to a more structured family, known as local non-oblivious bit-fixing sources. To show its tightness, we prove a ``local version'' of a structural result by Cohen and Tal (RANDOM 2015), which relies on a new ``low-weight'' Chevalley-Warning theorem.</div>

<div class="content">
Diverse applications of Kolmogorov complexity to learning [CIKK16], circuit complexity [OPS19], cryptography [LP20], average-case complexity [Hir21], and proof search [Kra22] have been discovered in recent years. Since the running time of algorithms is a key resource in these fields, it is crucial in the corresponding arguments to consider time-bounded variants of Kolmogorov complexity. While fruitful interactions between time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and different areas of theoretical computer science have been known for quite a while (e.g., [Sip83, Ko91, ABK+06, AF09], to name a few), the aforementioned results have led to a renewed interest in this topic. 

The theory of Kolmogorov complexity is well understood, but many useful results and properties of Kolmogorov complexity are not known to hold in time-bounded settings. Unfortunately, this creates technical difficulties or leads to conditional results when applying methods from time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity to algorithms and complexity theory. Perhaps even more importantly, in many cases it is desirable or even necessary to consider randomised algorithms. Since random strings have high complexity, the classical theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity might be inappropriate or simply cannot be applied in such contexts.

To mitigate these issues and develop a more robust theory of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity that survives in the important setting of randomised computations, some recent papers [Oli19, LO21, LOS21, GKLO22, LOZ22] have explored probabilistic notions of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity, such as $\mathrm{rKt}$ complexity [Oli19], $\mathrm{rK}^t$ complexity [LOS21], and $\mathrm{pK}^t$ complexity [GKLO22]. These measures consider different ways of encoding an object via a probabilistic representation. In this survey, we provide an introduction to probabilistic time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and its applications, highlighting many open problems and  research directions.</div>

Harvey was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the world’s youngest professor when he taught at Stanford University at age 18 as an assistant professor of philosophy. He got his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1967—hence the young age. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Difference </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Harvey has taken a viewpoint for most of his career that is different from other logicians. Godel’s incompleteness theorems apply to most logic systems—certainly those that are strong enough for central areas of mathematics. But the majority of mathematicians believe that incompleteness does not apply to their everyday work. In short most do not think:</p>
<p>
	<i>I cannot prove P not equal to NP, so it must be incomplete.</i> 	 </p>
<p>Rather they feel that this means I am not smart enough to resolve P vs NP. Which of these is true? </p>
<p>
For example, Harvey has created numerous algebraic and geometric systems that make no explicit reference to logic but which, under a suitable coding, contain a logical system to which Godel’s incompleteness theorems apply. Furthermore, these <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/modern-logic-godel-friedman-and-reverse-mathematics">systems</a> look similar to many systems used by mathematicians in their everyday work. Harvey uses these examples to argue that incompleteness cannot be dismissed as a phenomenon that occurs only in overly general foundational frameworks contrived by logicians. He argues that it applies often to their everyday world.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> An Example </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Harvey is also able to find numerous combinatorial statements with clear geometric meaning that are proved using large cardinals axioms and shown to require them. These <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9811187.pdf">results</a> are famous to Harvey. Such axioms previously seemed to require statements that are not geometric. </p>
<p>
Gill Williamson can show that this can be used to connect these problems to the assumption that subset sum is solvable in polynomial time. See the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.11707.pdf">On The Difficulty Of Proving P Equals NP In ZFC</a>. This curious connection between the P vs. NP problem and the theory of large cardinals seems to suggest that either P=NP is false or otherwise not provable in ZFC. This connection is <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/beatcs/column81.pdf">surprising</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Incompleteness </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Harvey does have a conjecture that shows that certain statements are not incomplete. He is interested in both sides of this coin: sometimes statements are provable and sometimes not. Concretely many mathematical theorems, such as Fermat’s Last Theorem, can be proved in very weak systems such as EFA. The <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00670733/document">Grand Conjecture</a> says:  Every theorem published in the Annals of Mathematics whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e. what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in EFA. </p>
<p>
EFA is the weak fragment of Peano Arithmetic based on the usual quantifier-free axioms for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%2C+1%2C+%2B%2C+%5Ctimes%2C+x%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0, 1, +, \times, x^y}" class="latex" />, together with the scheme of induction for all formulas whose quantifiers are bounded. While it is easy to construct artificial arithmetical statements that are true but not provable in EFA the point of the grand conjecture is that natural examples of such statements seem to be rare. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
 When Harvey was just starting to <a href="https://nautil.us/this-man-is-about-to-blow-up-mathematics-5857/">read</a>, at age 4 or 5, he remembers pointing to a dictionary and asking his mother what it was. It’s used to find out what words mean, she explained. A few days later, he returned to her with his verdict: The volume was completely worthless. For every word he’d looked up, the dictionary had taken him in circles: from “large” to “big” to “great” and so on, until he eventually arrived back at “large” again. She just looked at me as if I were a really strange, peculiar child, Friedman laughs. </p>
<p>
This is an <a href="https://nautil.us/this-man-is-about-to-blow-up-mathematics-5857/">insight</a> reported in an article by Jordana Cepelewicz. I cannot imagine Harvey was four or five when he told his mom this.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_L._Herman">Arthur Herman</a> is a popular Historian and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. On Forbes Magazine he “comments on quantum computing and AI and American national security”, and his recent Forbes article <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/arthurherman/2022/05/19/waging-war-on-quantum/?sh=2044c5318896">Waging War on Quantum</a> (thanks, Alexander Vlasov) starts as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Quantum computing will never work. Keeping enough qubits stable long enough to do any significant calculating or processing, is a mathematical impossibility. The whole idea that one day quantum computers will discover new miracle drugs, or crack public encryption systems, is a mirage. Even worse, it’s a hoax.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>That’s been the message from so-called quantum skeptics for a decade or more, including physicists like Gil Kalai of Hebrew University and Mikhail Dyakonov of the University of Montepellier—all in spite of the fact that quantum computers have continued to grow in sophistication and qubit power. Most experts now agree it’s not a question if a large-scale quantum will emerge that can break into public encryption systems using Shor’s algorithm, but </strong></em><strong>when</strong><em><strong>.”</strong></em></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The first paragraph gives a reasonable description of my views, however I <strong>never</strong> referred to the whole idea of quantum computing as a hoax. </span><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="color: #000000;">Regarding the second paragraph, it is indeed correct that quantum computers have continued to grow in sophistication and qubit power, however <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">my theory</a> (based on a computational complexity argument) is that progress for reducing the error rate will reach a wall and that recent progress merely approaches this limit. Let me elaborate a little on the development of the past decade as I see it</span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>Before moving to my assessment I would like to note that Arthur Herman’s offers an outrageous conclusion to his article. He suggests that skepticism of quantum computers (and of the company <a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a>) puts the skeptics’ countries at risk. In my opinion, the militant rhetoric of the title and of the conclusion is very inappropriate.</p>
<h2>Assessment of progress in the past decade</h2>
<p>The past quantum computing decade is characterized both by notable progress, adjustment of expectations, larger investments, much enthusiasm, and some hype. The overall picture is unclear and might be clearer 5-10 years from now.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The following picture (click to enlarge) describes the shift in the community view over the last decade (as I see it).</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2010-2020d.png"><img width="724" alt="2010-2020d" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/05/2010-2020d.png?w=724&amp;h=308" class="alignnone  wp-image-22721" height="308" /></a></p>
<p>On the left you can see David DiVincenzo’s famous 7-steps road map to quantum computers. DiVincenzo put forward these steps in his 2000 paper  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002077">The physical implementation of quantum computation</a>,  and the above picture on the left is a graphic description of these steps in a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1231930">2013 review paper</a> by Michel Devoret and Rob Schoelkopf.  The caption under the Figure asserts that <span style="color: #0000ff;">“Superconducting qubits are the only solid-state implementation at the third stage, and they now aim at reaching the fourth stage (green arrow). In the domain of atomic physics and quantum optics, the third stage had been previously attained by trapped ions and by Rydberg atoms. No implementation has yet reached the fourth stage, where a logical qubit can be stored, via error correction, for a time substantially longer than the decoherence time of its physical qubit components.”</span> The fourth step “logical memory with (substantial) longer lifetime than physical qubits” looked to many like a near term goal ten years ago.</p>
<p>One important development of the last ten years was to introduce building NISQ computers and achieving “quantum supremacy” (and related tasks like high “quantum volume”) as an intermediate goal towards DiVincenzo’s step four. (See the picture on the right.) Of course, there is nothing wrong with setting intermediate goals, we do it all the time and this can be very fruitful.</p>
<p>For me, from the skeptical point of view, these intermediate goals were an opportunity, allowing me to present a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2020/12/29/the-argument-against-quantum-computers-a-very-short-introduction/">clear computational theoretic argument</a> for why “quantum supremacy” is out of reach and to connect the problem with the theory of noise-sensitivity and noise-stability and with Fourier methods that I and my colleagues developed in the 90s.</p>
<p>Adding the intermediate goal of quantum supremacy also represented a much slower time-table than what people previously anticipated. For example, nine years ago in 2013  John Martinis <a href="https://youtu.be/7Pok08VvkeU">gave a lecture</a> at <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/04/12/qstart/">QSTART</a>,  the opening conference of our HUJI quantum science center. At that time, John expected to have the ability of building distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes within a few years and the tasks of demonstrating logical gates and of logical qubits with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B-15%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="10^{-15}" class="latex" /> error rates some years later. John also mentioned the ability to control 20 qubits within one month (to this Ray Laflamme commented that it is going to be a long month). All these targets are today still out of reach. It is undisputed that considerably lower noise rates are required even for achieving distance-3 surface codes and it is still not possible to have good control of 20-qubit (and perhaps even 10-qubit) quantum computation.</p>
<p>Of course, John Martinis himself was the leader of the Google efforts towards “quantum supremacy” which are now being carefully evaluated, and his vision and technology from 2013 was important for the Sycamore NISQ experiments. Let me mention that Google’s fantastic “quantum supremacy” claims were <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">largely (but not fully) refuted</a>.</p>
<p>There was a similar level of optimism from various other researchers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Schoelkopf#Schoelkopf.27s_law">It was expected</a> that coherence time would increase by a factor of ten every three years and there was a proposed “<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/does-nevens-law-describe-quantum-computings-rise-20190618/">double exponential law</a>” prediction for the classical computational power required to simulate quantum devices as time proceeds.  I personally don’t regard these specific claims as hype but rather as (at times, over-the-top) reasoned optimism, but both the reasoning and the predictions themselves should carefully be examined.</p>
<p>NISQ computers are interesting, and they allow interesting quantum physics experiments. Herman asserts that <strong><em>“quantum hybrid systems are making the qubit revolution something that’s happening now, not just a distant dream” </em></strong>and this echoes hopes of several researchers in academia and industry. My analysis asserts that NISQ computers are, from the computational complexity perspective, primitive classical computational devices with inherent chaotic behavior, and therefore, I don’t see how hybrid systems and the interface with conventional computers would turn them into useful computational devices. (They can still be useful for quantum physics experimentation.)</p>
<p>Let me repeat: slower progress than anticipated is very common, setting new intermediate goals is both common and welcome. By themselves they do not imply that the target of “<em><strong>large-scale quantum computers that can break into public encryption systems using Shor’s algorithm” </strong></em>is unrealistic, and indeed many experts in the field believe that it is a matter of time for this ultimate goal to be reached. My view is different, I try to explain my argument to other experts, and to offer experimental predictions and theoretical implications. There are good reasons to hope that the matter will be tested experimentally in the years to come, but my assessment is that the experimental picture from the past decade <strong>is not clear</strong>.</p>
<h3>IonQ, trapped ion quantum computation, and Elon Musk</h3>
<p>Herman’s article was triggered by a 183-page document written by a group called “Scorpion Capital.” The document attacks Maryland-based quantum computer company IonQ and among various concerns it also briefly mentions my and Michel Dyakonov’s positions about quantum computers.  I myself share the common view that ion-trap methods for quantum computers form a major avenue and that Chris Monroe (a co-founder of IonQ) is a major player in this direction. I don’t know much about IonQ’s specific efforts, but I would expect that large scale investment is required to put ion-trap methods to test and I personally would like to see it being tested. So I would be quite pleased to see <strong>Elon Musk</strong> deciding to buy IonQ or the Israeli trapped ion QC company of <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/ozeri/welcome-weizmann-trapped-ions-lab">Roee Ozeri</a> (or both) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> and to make  trapped ion technology his quantum computing signature. Incidentally, the comment section of my 2018 <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/">Quanta Magazine interview</a> presented an interesting exchange between Monroe and me (starting <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gil-kalais-argument-against-quantum-computers-20180207/#comment-4559220424">here</a>).</p>
<h3>A few more remarks:</h3>
<p>1) Herman’s article raises several other interesting issues like when (and if) is the appropriate time to transfer to “post quantum cryptography” protocols.</p>
<p>2) There are a few researchers skeptical of quantum computers that actually conduct research and write papers (and books) about it. (There are others that regard the idea as absurd nonsense of absolutely no interest.) A notable researcher who wrote several important papers in the skeptical direction since the late 90s is Robert Alicki from the University of Gdansk.</p>
<p>3) Here is Herman’s crazy conclusion: “No one is saying the Scorpion Capital short-sellers are in Chinese pay, or that skeptics like Dyakonov and Kalai are knowingly putting their countries at risk. But waging war on the U.S. quantum industry can have serious consequences, unless quantum companies and labs show that they are not intimidated, and reassure the public that the quantum future doesn’t rest on hype but significant achievements—achievements that will make our country and our world safer, stronger, and more confident about our future as a whole.”</p>
<p>4) I changed the title to reflect the main topic of the post.</p></div>

The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res.

Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) MRes is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that MRes is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+ $ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</div>

<p>Abstract: Algorithms increasingly interact with strategic, self-interested players; their design must take player incentives into account or risk being “gamed” and failing miserably. The algorithmic game theory literature traditionally focused on “mechanisms” – algorithms that incentivize players to truthfully report the <strong>input</strong>. In this talk we shift focus from mechanisms to “contracts”, which are concerned with the algorithm’s <strong>output</strong> and players’ incentives to carry it out. The goal of this talk is to describe where we’re at in forming a new algorithmic theory of contract design.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate how algorithmic approaches – in particular the approach of <strong>beyond worst-case analysis</strong> – can shed light on a classic economic puzzle regarding simple contracts. Within the realm of <strong>incentives and learning</strong>, I will discuss how classifiers induce incentives and show a formal relation to contracts.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Tal Alon, Magdalen Dobson, Paul Duetting, Ron Lavi, Ariel Procaccia, Tim Roughgarden, Elisheva Shamash and Jamie Tucker-Foltz.</p>

<div class="content">
The sign-rank of a matrix $A$ with $\pm 1$ entries is the smallest rank of a real matrix with the same sign pattern as $A$. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three known methods for proving lower bounds on the sign-rank of explicit matrices:  (i) Sign-rank is at least the VC-dimension; (ii) Forster's method, which states that sign-rank is at least the inverse of the largest possible average margin among the representations of the matrix by points and half-spaces; (iii) Sign-rank is at least a logarithmic function of the density of the largest monochromatic rectangle. 
 

We prove several results regarding the limitations of these methods. 


$\bullet$ We prove that, qualitatively,  the monochromatic rectangle density is the strongest of these three lower bounds. If it fails to provide a super-constant lower bound for the sign-rank of a  matrix, then the other two methods will fail as well.   
$\bullet$ We show that there exist $n \times n$ matrices with sign-rank $n^{\Omega(1)}$ for which none of these methods can provide a super-constant lower bound.   
$\bullet$ We show that sign-rank is at most an exponential function of the deterministic communication complexity with access to an equality oracle. We combine this result with Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem to show that for a large class of sign matrices (e.g., XOR-lifts), sign-rank is at most an exponential function of the $\gamma_2$ norm of the matrix. We conjecture that this holds for all sign matrices. 
$\bullet$ Towards answering a question of Linial,  Mendelson,   Schechtman, and  Shraibman regarding the relation between sign-rank and discrepancy, we conjecture that sign-ranks of the $\pm1$ adjacency matrices of hypercube graphs can be arbitrarily large. We prove that none of the three lower bound techniques can resolve this conjecture in the affirmative.</div>

Multiplicity codes are a generalization of Reed-Muller codes which include derivatives as well as the values of low degree polynomials, evaluated in every point in $\mathbb{F}_p^m$. 
Similarly to Reed-Muller codes, multiplicity codes have a local nature that allows for local correction and local testing. 
Recently, the authors and Salama showed that the plane test, which tests the degree of the codeword on a random plane, is a good local tester for small enough degrees.
In this work we simplify and extend the analysis of local testing for multiplicity codes, giving a more general and tighter analysis. In particular, we show that multiplicity codes $\mathrm{MRM}_{p}(m, d, s)$ over prime fields with arbitrary $d$ are locally testable by an appropriate $k$-flat test, which tests the degree of the codeword on a random $k$-dimensional affine subspace. The relationship between the degree parameter $d$ and the required dimension $k$ is shown to be nearly optimal, and improves on the degree previously known in the case of planes.

Our analysis relies on a generalization of the technique of canonincal monomials introduced by Haramaty, Shpilka and Sudan (FOCS 2011). Generalizing canonical monomials to the multiplicity case requires substantially different proofs which exploit the algebraic structure of multiplicity codes.</div>

We construct an explicit family of 3-XOR instances hard for $\Omega(n)$-levels of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) semi-definite programming hierarchy. Not only is this the first explicit construction to beat brute force search (beyond low-order improvements (Tulsiani 2021, Pratt 2021)), combined with standard gap amplification techniques it also matches the (optimal) hardness of random instances up to imperfect completeness (Grigoriev TCS 2001, Schoenebeck FOCS 2008). 

Our result is based on a new form of small-set high dimensional expansion (SS-HDX) inspired by recent breakthroughs in locally testable and quantum LDPC codes. Adapting the recent framework of Dinur, Filmus, Harsha, and Tulsiani (ITCS 2021) for SoS lower bounds from the Ramanujan complex to this setting, we show any (bounded-degree) SS-HDX can be transformed into a highly unsatisfiable 3-XOR instance that cannot be refuted by $\Omega(n)$-levels of SoS. We then show Leverrier and Z\'emor's (Arxiv 2022) recent qLDPC construction gives the desired explicit family of bounded-degree SS-HDX. Incidentally, this gives the strongest known form of bi-directional high dimensional expansion to date.</div>

Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a>, which provides an improved and simple analysis of the so-called “amplification by shuffling” formally connecting local privacy (LDP) and shuffle privacy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Now, I’ll assume the reader is familiar with both LDP and Shuffle DP: if not, a quick-and-dirty refresher (with less quick, and less dirty references) can be found <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/\trustmodels">here</a>, and of course there is also Albert Cheu’s excellent survey on Shuffle DP <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11839" title="Albert Cheu. Differential Privacy in the Shuffle Model: A Survey of Separations. arXiv 2021"><strong>[Cheu21]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>I will also ignore most of the historical details, but it is worth mentioning that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> is not the first paper on this “amplification by shuffling,” (which, for local reasons, I’ll just call a <em>privacy <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doona">doona</a></em>) but rather is the culmination of a rather long line of work involving many cool ideas and papers, starting with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01394" title="Albert Cheu, Adam D. Smith, Jonathan Ullman, David Zeber, Maxim Zhilyaev. Distributed Differential Privacy via Shuffling. EUROCRYPT 2019"><strong>[CSUZZ19</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12469" title="Úlfar Erlingsson, Vitaly Feldman, Ilya Mironov, Ananth Raghunathan, Kunal Talwar, Abhradeep Thakurta. Amplification by Shuffling: From Local to Central Differential Privacy via Anonymity. SODA 2019"><strong>EFMRTT19]</strong></a>: I’d refer the reader to <strong>Table 1</strong> in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> for an overview.</p>

<p>Alright, now that the caveats are behind us, what <em>is</em> “amplification by shuffling”? In a nutshell, it is capturing the (false!) intuition that “anonymization provides privacy” (which, again, is false! Don’t do this!) and making it… less false. The idea is that while <em>anonymization does not provide in itself any meaningful privacy guarantee</em>, it can <em>amplify existing, rigorous privacy guarantee</em>. So if I start with a somewhat lousy LDP guarantee, but then all the messages sent by all users are completely anonymized, then my lousy LDP guarantee suddenly gets <em>much</em> stronger (roughly speaking, the \(\varepsilon\) parameter goes down with the square root of of the number of users involved). Which is wonderful! Let’s see what this means, quantitatively.</p>

<h3 id="the-result-of-feldman-mcmillan-and-talwar">The result of Feldman, McMillan, and Talwar.</h3>
<p>Here, we will focus on the simpler case of <em>noninteractive</em> protocols (one-shot messages from the users to the central server, no funny business with messages going back and forth); which is conceptually simpler to state and parse, still very rich and interesting, and, well, very relevant in practice (being the easiest and cheapest to deploy). If you want the results in their full glorious generality, though, they are in the paper.</p>

<p>What the main theorem of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> is saying for this noninteractive setting can then be stated as follows: if I have an <em>\(\varepsilon_L\)-locally private</em> (LDP) protocol for a task, where all \(n\) users pass their data through the same randomizer (algorithm) \(R\) and send the resulting message \(y_i \gets R(x_i)\), then just permuting the messages \(y_1\dots,y_n\) immediately gives an \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-<em>shuffle</em> private protocol for the same task, for any pair \((\varepsilon,\delta)\) which satisfies
<a name="eq:eps:epsL"></a>
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \leq \log\left( 1+ 16\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}-1}{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}+1}\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation}
as long as \(n \gg e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log(1/\delta)\). That is quite a lot to parse, though: what does this actually <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, the assumption that all users have the same randomizer (or at least cannot be distinguished by their randomizer) is quite natural: if they didn’t, then we wouldn’t be able to say anything in general, since the randomizer they use could just give away their identity completely. For instance, as an extreme case, the randomizer of user \(i\) could just append \(i\) to the message (it’s OK, still LDP!), and then shuffling achieves exactly nothing: we know who sent what. So OK, asking for all randomizers to be the same is not really a restriction.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, each user only sends one message, and this preserves its length (we just shuffled the messages, didn’t modify them!). So if you start with an LDP protocol with amazing features XYZ (e.g., the messages are \(1\)-bit long, or users don’t share a random seed, or the randomizers run in time \(O(1)\)), then the shuffle protocol enjoys exactly the same properties. (It only enjoys naturally some <em>robustness</em>, in the sense that if \(10\%\) if the \(n\) users maliciously deviate from the protocol, they can’t really jeopardize the privacy of the remaining \(90\%\) of users.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Which is… good.)</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, this is inherently approximate DP. Here we started with pure LDP (you can also extend that to approximate LDP) and ended up with approximate Shuffle DP: this is not a mistake, that’s how it is. I am not a purist (erm) myself, and that looks more than good enough to me; but if you seek pure Shuffle DP, then this result is not the droid you’re looking for.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" alt="This is not the pure DP guarantee you are looking for." src="https://differentialprivacy.org/../images/droids-looking.png" />
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Alright, <em>what</em> is this guarantee stated in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:eps:epsL">(1)</a> giving us? Let’s interpret the expression in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:eps:epsL">(1)</a> in two parameter regimes, focusing on \(\varepsilon\) (fixing some small \(\delta&gt;0\)). If we start with \(\varepsilon_{L} \ll 1\) for our LDP randomizers \(R\), then a first-order Taylor expansion shows that we get
\[
		\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_{L}\cdot 8\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}
\]
so that <em>shuffling improved our privacy parameter by a factor \(\sqrt{n}\)</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> 😲 This is great! With more users, comes more privacy!</p>

<p>But that was starting with small \(\varepsilon_{L}\), that is, already pretty good privacy guarantees for our LDP “building block” \(R\). What happens if we start with “somewhat lousy” privacy guarantees, that is, \(\varepsilon_{L} \gg 1\)? Do we get anything interesting then?
Another Taylor expansion (everything is a Taylor expansion) shows us that, then,
<a name="eq:epsL:ll:one"></a>
\[
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \approx \log\left( 1+ 8\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation}
\]
or, put differently,
<a name="eq:epsL:gg:one"></a>
\[
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \approx 8e^{\varepsilon_{L}/2}\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}} \tag{3}
\end{equation}
\]
That’s a bit harder to interpret, but that seems… useful? It is: let us see how much, with a couple examples.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning.</h4>
<p>The first one is distribution learning, a.k.a. density estimation: you have \(n\) i.i.d. samples (one per user) from an unknown probability distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) over a discrete domain of size \(k\), and your goal is to output an estimate \(\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\) such that, with high (say, constant) probability, \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\) are close in <em>total variation distance</em>:
\[
		\operatorname{TV}(\mathbf{p},\widehat{\mathbf{p}}) = \sup_{S\subseteq [k]} (\mathbf{p}(S) - \widehat{\mathbf{p}}(S) ) \leq \alpha
\]
(if total variation distance seems a bit mysterious, it’s exactly half the \(\ell_1\) distance between the probability mass functions). We know how to solve this problem in the non-private setting: \(n=\Theta\left( \frac{k}{\alpha^2} \right)\) samples are necessary and sufficient. We know how to solve this problem in the (central) DP setting: \(n=\Theta\left( \frac{k}{\alpha^2} + \frac{k}{\alpha\varepsilon} \right)\) samples are necessary and sufficient <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/hash/2b3bf3eee2475e03885a110e9acaab61-Abstract.html" title="Ilias Diakonikolas, Moritz Hardt, Ludwig Schmidt. Differentially Private Learning of Structured Discrete Distributions. NeurIPS 2015"><strong>[DHS15]</strong></a>. We know how to solve this problem in the LDP setting: 
<a name="eq:learning:ldp"></a>
\begin{equation}
n=\Theta\left(\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2(e^\varepsilon-1)^2}+\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2e^\varepsilon}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation}
samples are necessary and sufficient <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/acharya19a.html" title="Jayadev Acharya, Ziteng Sun, Huanyu Zhang. Hadamard Response: Estimating Distributions Privately, Efficiently, and with Little Communication. AISTATS 2019"><strong>[ASZ19]</strong></a> (note that the first term is just \(k/(\alpha^2\varepsilon^2)\) for small \(\varepsilon\)). Now, as they say in Mulan: <em>let’s make a shuffle DP algo out of you.</em></p>

<p>If we want to achieve \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-shuffle DP, we need to select \(\varepsilon_L\). Based on <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:ll:one">(2)</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:gg:one">(3)</a>, and ignoring pesky constants we will choose it so that
<a name="eq:choice:epsL"></a>
\begin{equation}
	 \varepsilon_{L} \approx \varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}}  \quad\text{ or }\quad e^{\varepsilon_{L}} \approx \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}\,. \tag{5}
\end{equation}
depending on whether \(\frac{\varepsilon^2 n}{\log(1/\delta)}\geq 1\). Plugging that back in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:learning:ldp">(4)</a>, we see that the first case corresponds to the first term (small \(\varepsilon_{L}\)) and the second to the second term (\(\varepsilon_{L} \geq 1\)), and overall the condition on \(n\) for the original LDP algorithm to 
successful learn the distribution becomes
\[
	n \gtrsim 
	\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2(e^{\varepsilon_{L}}-1)^2}+\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2e^{\varepsilon_{L}}}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
	\approx \frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2} 
	 \approx \frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
\]
(where \(\gtrsim\) means “let’s ignore constants”). There is an \(n\) in the RHS as well, so reorganizing and handling the two terms separately the condition on \(n\) becomes
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
\]
which… is great? We immediately get a sample complexity \(O\left(\frac{k}{\alpha^2}+\frac{k \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}\right)\) in the shuffle DP model, which (ignoring the \(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}\)) matches the one in the <em>central</em> DP setting!</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Taking an optimal LDP algorithm and just shuffling the messages <em>immediately</em> gives an optimal shuffle DP algorithm, no extra work needed.</p>

<h4 id="uniformity-testing">(Uniformity) Testing.</h4>
<p>Alright, maybe it was a fluke? Let’s look at another “basic” problem close to my heart: we don’t want to learn the probability distribution \(\mathbf{p}\), just test whether it is actually <em>the</em> uniform distribution<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> \(\mathbf{u}\) on the domain \([k]={1,2,\dots,k}\). So if \(\mathbf{p} =\mathbf{u}\), you’ve got to say “yes” with probability at least \(2/3\), and if \(\operatorname{TV}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{u})&gt;\alpha\), then you need to say “no” with probability at least \(2/3\).</p>

<p>This is also well understood in the non-private setting (\(n=\Theta(\sqrt{k}/\alpha^2)\)) <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4626074" title="Liam Paninski. A Coincidence-Based Test for Uniformity Given Very Sparsely Sampled Discrete Data. IEEE Trans. Inf.

Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster. SOSA 2022"><strong>CL22]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Now, say you want an (\(\varepsilon,\delta)\)-shuffle DP algorithm for uniformity testing, but don’t want to design one from scratch (though it <em>is</em> possible to do so, and some did <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09481" title="Victor Balcer, Albert Cheu, Matthew Joseph, Jieming Mao. Connecting Robust Shuffle Privacy and Pan-Privacy. SODA 2021"><strong>[BCJM21</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987" title="Clément L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu. Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster. SOSA 2022"><strong>CL22</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10032" title="Albert Cheu, Chao Yan. Pure Differential Privacy from Secure Intermediaries. arXiv 2021"><strong>CY21]</strong></a>). Let’s say you want to look at the “no-common-random-seed-shared-by-users” model (a.k.a. <em>private-coin</em> setting): so you stare at the corresponding LDP communication complexity, <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:privatecoin">(7)</a>, and try to choose \(\varepsilon_L\) to start with before shuffling. This will be the same as in the learning example (i.e., <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:choice:epsL">(5)</a>): based on <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:ll:one">(2)</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:gg:one">(3)</a>, we will set
\begin{equation}
	 \varepsilon_{L} \approx \varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}}  \quad\text{ or }\quad e^{\varepsilon_{L}} \approx \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}\,.
\end{equation}
depending on whether \(\frac{\varepsilon^2 n}{\log(1/\delta)}\geq 1\). Plugging this back in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:privatecoin">(7)</a> and quickly checking which case corresponds to each term, we then easily get that for our algorithm to correctly solve the uniformity testing problem, it suffices that the sample complexity (number of users) \(n\) satisfies
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k^{3/2}}{\alpha^2(e^{\varepsilon_L}-1)^2} + \frac{k^{3/2}}{\alpha^2e^{\varepsilon_L}} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}
	 \approx \frac{k^{3/2}\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n } + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}
\]
which, reorganizing and solving for \(n\), means that it suffices to have 
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k^{3/4}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\,.
\]
And, <em>voilà</em>! Even better, we also have strong evidence to suspect that this sample complexity \(O\Big(\frac{k^{3/4}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+ \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\Big)\) is tight among all private-coin algorithms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Now, if you wanted to look at <em>public-coin</em> shuffle DP protocols (with a common random seed available), then you would start with an optimal public-coin LDP algorithm (and look at <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:publiccoin">(6)</a>), and setting \(\varepsilon_L\) the same way you’d get a shuffle DP algorithm with sample complexity
\[
n=O\Big(\frac{k^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(1/\delta)}{\alpha^{4/3}\varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{\sqrt{k\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+ \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\Big)
\]
which, well, is <em>also</em> strongly believed to be optimal!</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Here again, taking an optimal off-the-shelf LDP algorithm and just shuffling the messages <em>immediately</em> gives an optimal shuffle DP algorithm, no extra work needed.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h3>
<p>I hope the above convinced you of how useful this privacy amplification can be: from an optimal LDP algorithm, featuring any extra appealing characteristics you like, <em>just adding an extra shuffling step as postprocessing</em> yields an (often optimal? At least good) shuffle DP algorithm, <em>with the same characteristics</em> and built-in robustness against malicious users.</p>

<p>All you need is to make sure that your starting point, the LDP algorithm satisfies a couple things: (1) all users have the same randomizer,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and (2) it works in all regimes of \(\varepsilon\) (both high-privacy, \(\varepsilon \leq 1\), <em>and</em> low-privacy, \(\varepsilon \gg 1\)). Once you’ve got this, Bob’s your uncle! You get shuffle DP algorithms for free.</p>

<p>It is not only appealing from a theoretical point of view, by the way! The authors of the paper worked hard to make their empirical analysis compelling as well, and their code is available <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-shuffling-amplification">on GitHub</a> 📝. But more importantly, from a practitioner’s point of view, this means it is enough to design, implement, and test <em>one</em> algorithm (the LDP one we start with) to automatically get a trusted one in the shuffle DP model as well: this reduces the risks of bugs, security failures, the amount of work spending tuning, testing…</p>

<p>So yes, whenever possible, we <em>should</em> hide among the clones!</p>

Intuitively, the “amplification by shuffling” paradigm can be seen as anonymizing the messages from local randomizers, whose message distribution can be mathematically decomposed as a mixture of “noise distribution not depending on the user’s input” and “distribution actually depending on their input.” As a result, each user randomly sends a message from the first or second distribution of the mixture.  But the shuffling then hides the informative messages (drawn from the second part of the mixture) among the non-informative (noise) ones: so the noise messages end up providing a “privacy blanket” in which sensitive information is safely and soundly wrapped. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

<p><em>[Apologies for yet another <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/category/philosophizing/">“philosophizing” </a>blog post, hope to get back to posts with more equations soon… Should also mention that one response to this piece was that “anyone who writes a piece called “Why I am not a longtermist” is probably more of a longtermist than 90% of the population</em>” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> <em>–Boaz]</em></p>



<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism">Longtermism</a>” is a moral philosophy that places much more weight on the well-being of all future generations than on the current one. It <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism">holds</a> that “positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time,” where “long term” can be <em>really</em> long term, e.g., “many thousands of years in the future, or much further still.”   At its core is the belief that each one of the potential quadrillion or more people that may exist in the future is as important as any single person today.</p>

<p>Longtermism has recently attracted attention, some of it in <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk">alarming tones</a>. The reasoning behind longtermism is natural: if we assume that human society will continue to exist for at least a few millennia, many more people will be born in the future than are alive today. However, since predictions are famously hard to make, especially about the future, longtermism invariably gets wrapped up with probabilities. Once you do these calculations, preventing an infinitely bad outcome, even if it would only happen with tiny probability, will have infinite utility. Hence longtermism tends to focus on so-called “existential risk”:  The risk that humanity will go through in an extinction event, like the one suffered by the Neanderthals or Dinosaurs, or another type of irreversible humanity-wise calamity.<br /></p>



<p>This post explains why I do not subscribe to this philosophy. Let me clarify that I am not saying that all longtermists are bad people. Many “longtermists” have given generously to improve people’s lives worldwide, particularly in developing countries. For example, none of the top charities of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">Givewell</a> (an organization associated with the effective altruism movement, in which many prominent longtermists are members) focus on hypothetical future risks. Instead, they all deal with current pressing issues, including Malaria, childhood vaccinations, and extreme poverty. Overall the effective altruism movement has done much to benefit currently living people. Some of its members <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17962134/future-perfect-podcast-kidney-donation">donated their kidneys to strangers</a>: These are good people- morally better than me. It is hardly fair to fault people that are already contributing more than most others for caring about issues that I think are less significant.</p>

<p>This post critiques the philosophy of longtermism rather than the particular actions or beliefs of “longtermists.” In particular, the following are often highly correlated with one another:</p>



<ol><li>Belief in the philosophy of longtermism.</li><li>A belief that existential risk is not just a concern for the far-off future and a low-probability event, but there is a very significant chance of it happening in the near future (next few decades or at most a century).</li><li>A belief that the most significant existential risk could arise from artificial intelligence and that this is a real risk in the near future.</li></ol>



<p>Here I focus on (1) and explain why I disagree with this philosophy. While I might disagree on specific calculations of (2) and (3), I fully agree with the need to think and act regarding near-term risks.  Society tends to err on the side of being too myopic. We prepare too little even for risks that are not just predictable but are also predicted, including climate change, pandemics, nuclear conflict, and even software hacks. It is hard to motivate people to spend resources for safety when the outcome (bad event not happening) is invisible. It is also true that over the last decades, humanity’s technological capacities have grown so much that for the first time in history, we are capable of doing irreversible damage to our planet. </p>



<p>In addition to the above, I agree that we need to think carefully about the risks of any new technology, particularly one that, like artificial intelligence, can be very powerful but not fully understood.  Some AI risks are relevant to the shorter term: they are likely over the next decade or are already happening. There <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815">are</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">several</a> <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/">books</a> on these challenges. None of my critiques apply to such issues. At some point, I might write a separate blog post about artificial intelligence and its short and long-term risks. </p>



<p>My reasons for not personally being a “longtermist” are the following:</p>



<p><strong>The probabilities are too small to reason about.</strong></p>



<p>Physicists know that there is no point in writing a measurement up to 3 significant digits if your measurement device has only one-digit accuracy. Our ability to reason about events that are decades or more into the future is severely limited. At best, we could estimate probabilities up to an order of magnitude, and even that may be optimistic. Thus, claims such as <a href="https://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html">Nick Bostrom’s</a>, that <em>“the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives”</em> make no sense to me.  This is especially the case since these “probabilities” are Bayesian, i.e., correspond to degrees of belief. If, for example, you evaluate the existential-risk probability by aggregating the responses of 1000 experts, then what one of these experts had for breakfast is likely to have an impact larger than 0.001 percent (which, according to Bostrom, would correspond to much more than 10²⁰ human lives). To the extent we can quantify existential risks in the far future, we can only say something like “extremely likely,” “possible,” or “can’t be ruled out.” Assigning numbers to such qualitative assessments is an exercise in futility. </p>



<p><strong>I cannot justify sacrificing current living humans for abstract probabilities.</strong></p>



<p>Related to the above, rather than focusing on specific, measurable risks (e.g., earthquakes, climate change), longtermism is often concerned with extremely hard to quantify risks. In truth, we cannot know what will happen 100 years into the future and what would be the impact of any particular technology. Even if our actions will have drastic consequences for future generations, the dependence of the impact on our choices is likely to be chaotic and unpredictable. To put things in perspective, many of the risks we are worried about today, including nuclear war, climate change, and AI safety, only emerged in the last century or decades. It is hard to underestimate our ability to predict even a decade into the future, let alone a century or more.</p>



<p>Given that there is so much suffering and need in the world right now, I cannot accept a philosophy that prioritizes abstract armchair calculations over actual living humans. (This concern is not entirely hypothetical: <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/">Greaves and MacAskill</a> estimate that $100 spent on AI safety would, in expectation, correspond to saving a <em>trillion lives</em> and hence would be “far more than the near-future benefits of bednet distribution [for preventing Malaria],” and recommend that it is better that individuals “fund AI safety rather than developing world poverty reduction.”)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism">Moorhouse</a> compares future humans to ones living far away from us. He says that just like “something happening far away from us in space isn’t less intrinsically bad just because it’s far away,” we should care about humans in the far-off future as much as we care about present ones. But I think that we <em>should</em> care less about very far away events, especially if it’s so far away that we cannot observe them. E.g., as far as we know, there may well be trillions of sentient beings in the universe right now whose welfare can somehow be impacted by our actions. </p>



<p><strong>We cannot improve what we cannot measure.</strong></p>



<p>An inherent disadvantage of probabilities is that they are invisible until they occur. We have no direct way to measure whether a probability of an event X has increased or decreased. So, we cannot tell whether our efforts are working or not. The <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">scientific revolution</a> involved moving from armchair philosophizing to making measurable predictions. I do not believe we can make meaningful progress without concrete goals. For some risks, we do have quantifiable goals (Carbon emissions, number of nuclear warheads). Still, there are significant challenges to finding a measurable proxy for very low-probability and far-off events. Hence, even if we accept that the risks are real and vital, I do not think we can directly do anything about them before finding such proxies. </p>



<p>Proxies do not have to be perfect: Theoretical computer science made much progress using the imperfect measure of worst-case asymptotic complexity. The same holds for machine learning and artificial benchmarks. It is enough that proxies encourage the generation of new ideas or technologies and achieve gradual improvement. One lesson from modern machine learning is that the objective (aka loss function) doesn’t have to perfectly match the task for it to be useful.</p>



<p><strong>Long-term risk mitigation can only succeed through short-term progress.</strong></p>



<p>Related to the above, I believe that addressing long-term risks can only be successful if it’s tied to shorter-term advances that have clear utility. For example, consider the following two extinction scenarios:</p>



<p>1. The actual Neanderthal extinction.<br />2. A potential human extinction 50 years from now due to total nuclear war.</p>



<p>I argue that the only realistic scenario to avoid extinction in both cases is a sequence of actions that improve some measurable outcome. While sometimes extinction could theoretically be avoided by a society making a huge sacrifice to eliminate a hypothetical scenario, this could never actually happen.</p>



<p>While the reasons for the Neanderthal extinction are not fully known, most researchers believe that Neanderthals were out-competed by our ancestors – modern humans – who had better tools and ways to organize society. The crucial point is that the approaches to prevent extinction for Neanderthal were the same ones to improve their lives in their current environment. They may not have been capable of doing so, but it wasn’t because they were working on the wrong problems.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the scenario of human extinction through total nuclear war. In such a case, our conventional approaches for keeping nuclear arms in check, such as international treaties and sanctions, have failed. Perhaps in hindsight, humanity’s optimum course of action would have been a permanent extension of the middle ages, stopping the scientific revolution from happening through restricting education, religious oppression, and vigorous burning-at-stake of scientists.  Or perhaps humanity could even now make a collective decision to go back and delete all traces of post 17th-century science and technology.</p>



<p>I cannot rule out the possibility that, in hindsight, one of those outcomes would have had more aggregate utility than our current trajectory. But even if this is the case, such an outcome is simply not possible. Humanity can not and will not halt its progress, and solutions to significant long-term problems have to arise as a sequence of solutions to shorter-range measurable ones, each of which shows positive progress. Our only hope to avoid a total nuclear war is through piecemeal quantifiable progress.  We need to use diplomacy, international cooperation, and monitoring technologies to reduce the world’s nuclear arsenal one warhead at a time. This piecemeal, incremental approach may or may not work, but it’s the only one we have. </p>



<p><strong>Summary: think of the long term, but act and measure in the short term.</strong></p>



<p>It is appropriate for philosophers to speculate on hypothetical scenarios centuries into the future and wonder whether actions we take today could influence them. However, I do not believe such an approach will, in practice, lead to a positive impact on humanity and, if taken to the extreme, may even have negative repercussions. We should maintain epistemic humility. Statements about probabilities involving fractions of percentage points, or human lives in the trillions, should raise alarm bells. Such calculations can be particularly problematic since they can lead to a “the end justifies the means” attitude, which can accept any harm to currently living people in the name of the practically infinite multitudes of future hypothetical beings. </p>



<p>We need to maintain the invariant that, even if motivated by the far-off future, our actions “first do no harm” to living, breathing humans. Indeed, as I mentioned, even longtermists don’t wake up every morning thinking about how to reduce the chance that something terrible happens in the year 1,000,000 AD by 0.001%. Instead, many longtermists care about particular risks because they believe these risks are likely in the near-term future. If you manage to make a convincing case that humanity faces a real chance of near-term total destruction, then most people would agree that this is very very bad, and we should act to prevent it. It doesn’t matter whether humanity’s extinction is two times or a zillion times worse than the death of half the world’s population. Talking about trillions of hypothetical beings thousands of years into the future only turns people off. There is a reason that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">Pascal’s Wager</a> is not such a winning argument, and I have yet to meet someone who converted to a particular religion because it had the grisliest version of hell.</p>



<p>This does not mean that thinking and preparing for longer-term risks is pointless. Maintaining seed banks, monitoring asteroids, researching pathogens, designing vaccine platforms, and working toward nuclear disarmament, are all essential activities that society should take. Whenever a new technology emerges, artificial intelligence included, it is crucial to consider how it can be misused or lead to unintended consequences. By no means do I argue that humanity should spend all of its resources only on actions that have a direct economic benefit. Indeed, the whole enterprise of basic science is built on pursuing directions that, in the short term, increase our knowledge but do not have practical utility. Progress is not measured only in dollars, but it should be measured somehow. Epistemic humility also means that we should be content with working on direct, measurable proxies, even if they are not perfect matches for the risk at hand. For example, the probability of extinction via total nuclear war might not be a direct function of the number of deployed nuclear warheads. However, the latter is still a pretty good proxy for it.</p>



<p>Similarly, even if you are genuinely worried about long-term risk, I suggest you spend most of your time in the present. Try to think of short-term problems whose solutions can be verified, which might advance the long-term goal. A “problem” does not have to be practical: it can be a mathematical question, a computational challenge, or an empirically verifiable prediction. The advantage is that even if the long-term risk stays hypothetical or the short-term problem turns out to be irrelevant to it, you have still made measurable progress. As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">has happened before</a>, to make actual progress on solving existential risk, the topic needs to move from philosophy books and blog discussions into empirical experiments and concrete measures.</p>

<p>
David Hilbert famously presented 23 important open mathematical problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He intended to include a 24th on the simplicity of proofs.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss this problem, which was “lost” until the historian Rüdiger Thiele discovered it in Hilbert’s papers in 2000 and brought it to light in a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=C970003BC10AB452B346D45B8AAE14B6?doi=10.1.1.97.7633&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> for the American Mathematical Monthly.</p>
<p>
I (Ken) have long wondered why Hilbert targeted the number 23 for his list. That some of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">problems</a> have broad, vague statements tells me he could have altered their number. To be sure, he discussed only 10 in his actual 1900 lecture; the rest appeared in his long <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf">article</a> that year. Until Dick drafted this post and I found Thiele’s article, I had not known about a No. 24—a nice factorial number. </p>
<p>
As <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsta.2018.0040">discussed</a> by Inês Hipolito and Reinhard Kahle, in a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rsta/2019/377/2140">special issue</a> of the UK Royal Society <em>Philosophical Transactions A</em> devoted to Hilbert’s 24th, there were only faint traces of it until Thiele’s discovery. They decline to guess Hilbert’s motives for leaving it out, but I venture this: Hilbert could not agree with himself on the terms by which to state it, even broadly. How to quantify simplicity was already the subject of Dick’s draft, into which we blend.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Pólya on Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One simple question is whether a human notion of simpler proof would accord with, say, that of a Martian. George Pólya was one of a vanguard of Hungarian emigré scientists who came to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists)">The Martians</a> after another of them, the physicist Leo Szilard, gave this answer to Enrico Fermi’s question of why aliens had not been detected when life in the universe should be plentiful:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“They are among us, but they call themselves Hungarians.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Kidding aside, this could set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf</a> type hypothesis that humans from disparate linguistic groups and mathematical cultures could have different values for proofs. Even if so, the joke would be on non-Hungarians, because Paul Erdős, whose idea of “Proofs from The Book” set the internationally recognized standard of proof elegance, was also a “Martian.”</p>
<p>
Pólya’s quote above hits the nail on the head. For an example, consider the <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/math/q1.html">theorem</a> that: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The square root of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> is irrational. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>
The well-known proof begins by supposing not: </p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/proof-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-20055"><img width="450" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/proof.png?resize=450%2C460&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-20055" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>
One might claim that this famous proof is not obvious—do you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Measure </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Now consider the general task of proving statements of this form:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em><a name="pos"></a> For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28n%29+%3E+0.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  f(n) &gt; 0. " class="latex" /></p>
</em><p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Think this as an encoding of an interesting property: For example, for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> there is a prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p&gt;n}" class="latex" />. Or for each planar graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> there is some four coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />. Or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
To make this more concrete, let us base proofs on the Peano axioms for arithmetic, and suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" /> is well-defined in this system. Note that proving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" /> to be total computable is not the same as proving that all its values are <em>positive</em> as Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a> asserts. In case Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a> is provable, we have two key parameters:</p>
<li>D: The length of the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" />.
</li><li>P: The length of the full proof of Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a>.
<p></p><p><br />
Our proof simplicity measure is then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++M%3D%5Cfrac%7BP%7D%7BD%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  M=\frac{P}{D} " class="latex" /></p>
<p></p><h2> Some Instances </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are some keys to understanding the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> intuitively:</p>
<ol>
<li> For known provable problems we might have that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> is not too large
</li><li> For classic problems like the Four-Color problem we might have that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> is huge. Think of the proof that arises in this case.
</li><li> For many chess positions where one side can win, say checkmate in 30 moves, the proof of that is likewise huge. Crafting chess problems where the proof is both crisp and hard to find is a centuries-old art.
</li><li> For open problems, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> is currently infinite.
</li><li> But for practical software we get something bounded. The trouble here is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> is potentially huge and could be the size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
Consider for the last case a program that calculates your tax payment based on the US tax code, for example. The code has wording like:  </p>
<blockquote><p>
An apparently insignificant discrepancy between the wording in the Statutes at Large and the wording in some editions of the U.S. Code with respect to a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (specifically, the words “any papers” in the first sentence of 6104(a)(1)(A) is described by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of Tax Analysts v. Internal Revenue Serv., 214 F.3d 179 (D.C. Cir. 2000), in footnote 1. According to the Court, some versions of the U.S. Code show the text as “any paper” while the Statutes at Large version shows the text as “any papers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus the proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> could be the same size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" />. Thus,</p>
<p>
Case: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%3E%3E+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P &gt;&gt; D}" class="latex" />. This is the usual proof of a classic problem like the four-color problem. Huge proof. </p>
<p>
Case: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%5Capprox+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P \approx D}" class="latex" />. This is like a simple problem or like a proof of a complex program with tons of bits in its description. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proofs and Software </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My famous—infamous?—<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> with Alan Perlis and Rich de Millo raised the related issue in the first sentence of our abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is argued that formal verifications of programs, no matter how obtained, will not play the same key role in the development of computer science and software engineering as proofs do in mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This argument made over four decades ago has been argued by critics as being wrong. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">this</a> for comments about the recent <a href="https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/2021/05/26/debate-that-changed-programming-living-history/">debate</a> on the paper moderated by Harry Lewis.</p>
<p>
We claim that we were correct but for a different reason that we made in the original paper. We got it <b>right</b> but for the wrong reason. The real reason is alluded to in this <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication8316-abstract.html">statement</a> by Tony Hoare, whose programme of proofs for programs partly spurred our paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ten years ago, researchers into formal methods (and I was the most mistaken among them) predicted that the programming world would embrace with gratitude every assistance promised by formalisation to solve the problems of reliability that arise when programs get large and more safety-critical. Programs have now got very large and very critical—well beyond the scale which can be comfortably tackled by formal methods. … It has turned out that the world just does not suffer significantly from the kind of problem that our research was originally intended to solve.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
See also his 1996 <a href="http://176.9.41.242/docs/math/1996-hoare.pdf">position paper</a>, “How Did Software Get So Reliable Without Proof?”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Does this measure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> shed some light on the problems of program verification? Is it useful? Would it have satisfied Hilbert? Hilbert’s handwritten note discovered by Thiele showed him thinking in terms of proofs via polynomial invariants and equations—hence maybe not at a brute level of counting symbols.</p>

<div class="content">
<p> I was at SUNY Stonybrook for college 1976-1980. </p><p>I remember one student protest about a change to the calendar that (I think) would have us go home for winter break and then come back for finals.  I don't recall how that turned out. </p><p>However I had heard about the protests in the 1960's over the Vietnam war. Recall that there was a draft back then so college students were directly affected. </p><p>I was reading a book `<i>Everything you know is wrong'</i> which noted that some people thought the first time there were student protests was in the 1960's but this is not true. (Not quite as startling as finding out that a ships captain cannot perform weddings.) </p><p>It pointed to <i>The 1830 Conic Section Rebellion. </i>I quote Wikipedia (full entry is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_Sections_Rebellion">here</a>)</p><p><i>Prior to the introduction of blackboards, Yale students had been allowed to consult diagrams in their textbooks when solving geometry problems pertaining to conic sections – even on exams. When the students were no longer allowed to consult the text, but were instead required to draw their own diagrams on the blackboard, they refused to take the final exam. As a result forty-three of the ninety-six students – among them, Alfred Stille, and Andrew Calhoun, the son of John C. Calhoun (Vice Pres a the time) – were summarily expelled, and Yale authorities warned neighboring universities against admitting them.</i></p><p>Random Thoughts</p><p>1) From my 21st century prospective I am on the students side. It seems analogous to allowing students to use calculators-- which I do allow. </p><p>2) From my 21st century prospective the punishment seems unfair. </p><p>3) The notion of a school telling other schools to not admit student- I do not think this would happen now, and might even be illegal (anti-trust).</p><p>4) I am assuming  the students wanted to be able to consult their text out of some principle: we want to learn concepts not busy work.  And again, from my prospective I agree that it was busy work. </p><p>5) Since all of my thoughts are from a 21st century prospective, they may be incorrect, or at least not as transferable to the 1830 as I think. (Paradox: My ideas may not be as true as I think. But if I think that...) </p><p>6) I try to avoid giving busy work. When I teach Decidability and Undecidability I NEVER have the students actually write a Turing Machine that does something. In other cases I also try to make sure they never have to do drudge work.  And I might not even be right in the 21st century- some of my colleagues tell me its good for the students to get their hands dirty (perhaps just a little) with real TM to get a feel for the fact that they can do anything. </p><p>7) The only student protests I hear about nowadays are on political issues. Do you know of any student protests on issues of how they are tested or what the course requirements are, or something of that ilk? I can imagine my discrete math students marching with signs that say: </p><p>DOWN WITH INDUCTION!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="content">
We consolidate two widely believed conjectures about tautologies---no optimal proof system exists, and most require superpolynomial size proofs in any system---into a $p$-isomorphism-invariant condition satisfied by all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages or none. The condition is: for any Turing machine (TM) $M$ accepting the language, $\textbf{P}$-uniform input families requiring superpolynomial time by $M$ exist (equivalent to the first conjecture) and appear with positive upper density in an enumeration of input families (implies the second). In that case, no such language is easy on average (in $\textbf{AvgP}$) for a distribution applying non-negligible weight to the hard families.

The hardness of proving tautologies and theorems is likely related. Motivated by the fact that arithmetic sentences encoding "string $x$ is Kolmogorov random" are true but unprovable with positive density in a finitely axiomatized theory $\mathcal{T}$ (Calude and Jürgensen), we conjecture that any propositional proof system requires superpolynomial size proofs for a dense set of $\textbf{P}$-uniform families of tautologies encoding "there is no $\mathcal{T}$ proof of size $\leq t$ showing that string $x$ is Kolmogorov random". This implies the above condition.

The conjecture suggests that there is no optimal proof system because undecidable theories help prove tautologies and do so more efficiently as axioms are added, and that constructing hard tautologies seems difficult because it is impossible to construct Kolmogorov random strings. Similar conjectures that computational blind spots are manifestations of noncomputability would resolve other open problems.</div>

We study the following natural question on random sets of points in $\mathbb{F}_2^m$:
    

Given a random set of $k$ points $Z=\{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_k\} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^m$, what is the dimension of the space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials that vanish on all points in $Z$?


We show that, for $r \leq \gamma m$ (where $\gamma &gt; 0$ is a small, absolute constant) and $k = (1-\epsilon) \cdot {m \choose {\leq r}}$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials vanishing on a random set $Z = \{z_1,\ldots, z_k\}$ has dimension exactly ${m \choose {\leq r}} - k$ with probability $1 - o(1)$. This bound shows that random sets have a much smaller space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials vanishing on them, compared to the worst-case bound (due to Wei (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 1991)) of ${m \choose{\leq r}} - {{\log_2 k}\choose {\leq r}} \gg {m\choose{\leq r}} - k$. 

    Using this bound, we show that high-degree Reed-Muller codes ($\text{RM}(m,d)$ with $d &gt; (1-\gamma) m$) ``achieve capacity'' under the Binary Erasure Channel in the sense that, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we can recover from $(1 - \epsilon) \cdot {m\choose {\leq m-d-1}}$ random erasures with probability $1 - o(1)$. This also implies that $\text{RM}(m,d)$ is also efficiently decodable from $\approx {m\choose {\leq m-(d/2)}}$ random errors for the same range of parameters.</div>

<p>Martha Osegueda, one of Mike Goodrich’s students at UC Irvine, successfully defended her doctoral dissertation yesterday. Martha is originally Salvadorean, and came to UCI from an undergraduate degree at the University of Texas El Paso. Her research at UCI has spanned a wide variety of topics in graph drawing, phylogeny, computational geometry, and parallel query complexity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Minimum-width drawings of phylogenetic trees” from <em>COCOA</em> 2019 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36412-0_4">doi:10.1007/978-3-030-36412-0_4</a>) is about drawing evolutionary trees compactly. For the version of tree drawing they study, it turns out to be NP-hard when the order of the leaves is unconstrained but linear-time solvable for fixed leaf orderings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Reconstructing binary trees in parallel” from <em>SPAA</em> 2020 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15259">arXiv:2006.15259</a>) involved the reconstruction of evolutionary trees from queries asking which pair of a triple of species is closest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Concatenation arguments and their applications to polyominoes and polycubes”, in <em>CGTA</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2021.101790">doi:10.1016/j.comgeo.2021.101790</a>) and “On the number of compositions of two polycubes” from <em>EuroComb</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83823-2_12">doi:10.1007/978-3-030-83823-2_12</a>) strengthen the known lower bounds on the growth rates of polyominoes and polycubes, using arguments based on counting ways of gluing pairs of smaller polyforms into larger ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Angles of arc-polygons and Lombardi drawings of cacti”, from <em>CCCG</em> 2021 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03615">arXiv:2107.03615</a>) is my only collaboration with Martha and one <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/07/10/angles-arc-triangles.html">I have posted about here</a>. It characterizes the vertex angles that are possible in triangles with circular-arc sides, and uses that characterization to prove the existence of a Lombardi drawing for any cactus graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Parallel network mapping algorithms” from <em>SPAA</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3409964.3461822">doi:10.1145/3409964.3461822</a>) and “Mapping Networks via parallel \(k\)th-hop traceroute queries” from <em>STACS</em> 2022 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.4">doi:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.4</a>) are on traceroute-like problems: mapping the structure of a computer communication network using a small number of parallel rounds of pings to determine distances from nodes on the network.</p>

The new bound </span><span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2204.12455v1-abstract-full">substantially improves an 1985 result of Pyber, who showed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Clog+n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n \log n " class="latex" /> <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-13-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-55"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-56"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-62"> edges</span></span></span></span> suffice.</span></p>
<h3>The history of the <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2204.12455v1-abstract-full">Erdős -Sauer</span> problem 1975-2022</h3>
<p>Erdos and Sauer asked in 1975 how many edges (let’s denote the minimum number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_k%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_k(n)" class="latex" />) for an <em>n</em>-vertex graph guarantee a <em>k</em>-regular subgraph. In 1985 Laszlo Pyber proved that for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C_k" class="latex" /> every graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> edges and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_kn+%5Clog+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C_kn \log n" class="latex" /> edges contains a <em>k</em>-regular graph. A few years later Pyber, Rodl and Szemeredi found a construction of a graph with<em> n</em> vertices and  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+n+%5Clog+%5Clog+n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c n \log \log n " class="latex" /> edges that contains no k-regular subgraph for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cge+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k \ge 3" class="latex" />. (The paper appeared in 1995 but the result is from the late 80s.)</p>
<p>Paul <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2204.12455v1-abstract-full">Erdős  mentioned the problem among his favorites in a famous paper in 1980 (Vol 1. Issue 1. of Combinatorica) and mentioned the results of Pyber and of Pyber, Rodl and Szemeredi in his 1989 paper.</span></p>
<p>Oliver and Benny proved an upper bound on the number of edges of k-regular free graphs that matches the Pyber, Rodl and Szemeredi lower bound. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Congratulations!</strong></span></p>
<h3>AFK84 and the Berge-Sauer problem</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong>Every graph (or hypergraph) <em>G</em> with <em>n</em> vertices and <em>2n+1</em> edges contains a nontrivial subgraph <em>H</em> with all vertex-degrees divisible by 3.</p>
<p>This is a theorem of Noga Alon,  Shmuel Friedland, and me (AFK) from 1984.)</p>
<p><strong>Before the proof</strong>: If we want to get a subgraph with all vertex degrees even then we need<em> n</em> edges (or <em>n+1</em> edges for hypergraphs). This has a simple linear algebra proof which also gives an efficient algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>From-scratch proof scatch: </strong>Associate to every edge <em>e</em> of the graph a variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_e&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_e" class="latex" />. Consider the two polynomial</p>
<p><em>P=</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cprod_%7Bv+%5Cin+V%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\prod_{v \in V(G)}" class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28%5Csum_%7Be%3A+v+%5Cin+e%7Dx%5E2_e%29%5E2-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="((\sum_{e: v \in e}x^2_e)^2-1)" class="latex" />, and</p>
<p>Q=<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cprod_%7Be%5Cin+E%28G%29%7D%28x_e%5E2-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\prod_{e\in E(G)}(x_e^2-1)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>If the theorem is false then <em>P-Q=0, </em>as polynomials over the field with three elements. This is impossible since P is a polynomial of degree <em>4n</em> while Q is a polynomial which has a monomial of degree <em>4n+2</em> with nonzero coefficient.</p>
<p>The theorem follows more directly from a theorem of Chevallay and even more directly from a theorem of Olson.</p>
<p>AFK84 was a necessary ingredients of Pyber 1985 upper bound as well as the Janzer-Sudakov new upper bound. It will be very nice to get rid of this ingredient. AFK84 came a little short of proving the Berge-Sauer conjecture that every 4-regular graph contains a 3-regular subgraph.  This conjecture was proved in a 1982 paper by Taskinov.</p>
<h3>Three problems</h3>
<p>A) Is it true that every graph with n vertices and 2n+1 edges with maximum degree 5 contains a 3-regular graph of type I? (Namely a 3-regular 3-edge colorable subgraph.)</p>
<p>B) How many edges for a 3-uniform hypergraph on n vertices guarantees a k-regular sub-hypergraph? (Here we refer to “3-regular hypergraph as a hypergraph so that every vertex belongs to three (or zero) edges. You can also demand that every pair of vertices belongs to three or zero edges.)</p>
<p>C) Is there a polynomial-time algorithm to find a<em> r</em>-regular subgraph for a graph with n vertices and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{1.01}" class="latex" /> edges.</p>
<h3>Climbing the Turan ladder</h3>
<p>Climbing the Turan ladder refers to unavoidable subgraphs of a graph of n vertices and m edges as m grows. (The Erdos-Renyi ladder is a similar notion for random graphs.)</p>
<p>Problem A) is related to the following:</p>
<p>When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> is roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2n" class="latex" /></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> (for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2n-2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m=2n-2" class="latex" />) you must have a subgraph with all degrees larger than 2</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> (for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D+2n%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m= 2n+1" class="latex" />) you must have a subgraph with all degrees divisible by 3 (AFK84), and</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> (for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2n%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m=2n+1" class="latex" />) you also must have a subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> such that you can color its edges with three colors so that every (non-isolated) vertex have neighbors of the all color.</p>
<p>We don’t know what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> guarantees</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> such an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> so that for every vertex the number of edges of each color is the same modulo three.</p>
<p>Condition<strong> d)</strong> is stronger than both <strong>b)</strong> and <strong>c)</strong> and each of them is stronger than<strong> a)</strong>. Both<strong> a), b)</strong> and <strong>c)</strong> extend to hypergraphs.</p>
<h3>The relevance of Christos’s classes and the PME-conjecture.</h3>
<p>The <strong>Probabilistic Method is Efficient (PME)</strong> <strong>Conjecture</strong> asserts: Every mathematical proof based on the probabilistic method can be transformed into an efficient (randomized) algorithm.</p>
<p>This is a vague and controversial conjecture that I mentioned in the post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/poznan-random-structures-and-algorithms-2013/" rel="bookmark">Poznań: Random Structures and Algorithms 2013</a>. (There I  referred to it as the Kalai-Spencer conjecture.) Now, if we can get rid of AFK84 and find a purely combinatorial/probabilistic  proof even just for the fact that every graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> vertices and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{1.01}" class="latex" /> edges contains a 3-regular subgraph, this would be nice on its own and may lead (especially for PME-believers) to an efficient algorithm. AFK84 is not supported by an efficient algorithm and, in fact it is related to one of Christos Papadimitriou’s classes describing the algorithmic difficulty for finding objects guarantees by mathematical proofs. See Papadimitriou’s  1994 paper: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000005800637" id="OT-8y8wGxeEJ"><span dir="ltr">On the complexity of the parity argument and other inefficient proofs of existence</span>‏.</a></p></div>

We study the power of randomized polynomial-time non-adaptive reductions to the problem of approximating Kolmogorov complexity and its polynomial-time bounded variants.

As our first main result, we give a sharp dichotomy for randomized non-adaptive reducibility to approximating Kolmogorov complexity. We show that any computable language $L$ that has a randomized polynomial-time non-adaptive reduction (satisfying a natural honesty condition) to $\omega(\log(n))$-approximating the Kolmogorov complexity is in AM $\cap$ coAM. On the other hand, using results of Hirahara [H20], it follows that every language in NEXP has a randomized polynomial-time non-adaptive reduction (satisfying the same honesty condition as before) to $O(\log(n))$-approximating the Kolmogorov complexity.

As our second main result, we give the first negative evidence against the NP-hardness of polynomial-time bounded Kolmogorov complexity with respect to randomized reductions. We show that for every polynomial t', there is a polynomial t such that if there is a randomized time t' non-adaptive reduction (satisfying a natural honesty condition) from SAT to $\omega(\log(n))$-approximating $K^t$ complexity, then either NE = coNE or E has sub-exponential size non-deterministic circuits infinitely often.</div>

In 2007 Guruswami, Umans and Vadhan gave an explicit construction of a lossless condenser based on Parvaresh-Vardy codes. This lossless condenser is a basic building block in many constructions, and, in particular, is behind the state of the art extractor constructions.

We give an alternative construction that is based on Multiplicity codes. While the bottom-line result is similar to the GUV result, the analysis is very different. In GUV (and Parvaresh-Vardy codes) the polynomial ring is closed to a finite field, and every polynomial is associated with related elements in the finite field. In our construction a polynomial from the polynomial ring is associated with its iterated derivatives. Our analysis boils down to solving a differential equation over a finite field, and uses previous techniques, introduced by Kopparty for the list-decoding setting.
We also observe that these (and more general) questions were studied in differential algebra, and we use the terminology and result developed there.

We believe these techniques have the potential of getting better constructions and solving the current bottlenecks in the area.</div>

<ol><li>What led you to academia?</li></ol>



<p>Much to the shock of my fellow students, I have wanted to be a professor since my freshman year in Italy. The pursuit of knowledge and the lifestyle freedom really appealed to me. Naturally, I did not have a clue; but I would do it all over again, changing nothing… alright, almost nothing.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>How did you become interested in theoretical computer science?</li></ol>



<p>I was totally hooked to computers since I was eight, and also worked on videogames in my early teens. In high school I didn’t mind math, but it was not my passion: It was mostly calculus which I thought was “only good for physics.” In college I had a first glimpse of theoretical computer science, and I was struck. The field was asking the right questions: What is a proof, what is knowledge, what is randomness, <em>when you are short on time?</em></p>



<ol start="3"><li>What are you currently working on?</li></ol>



<p>The most famous open problem in the field is the P vs. NP problem which can be phrased as asking to prove that <em>Super Mario</em> levels, properly constructed, are hard to beat. The general challenge is to exhibit problems that require a lot of time on computers. Much of my research concerns proving such limitations for restricted models of computers, for example computers with no memory. Even understanding such restricted models has proved enormously difficult, and a good reason for that is that they are extremely powerful, much more so than anyone anticipated.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-left"><p>This book introduces important results and techniques in property testing, where the goal is to design algorithms that decide whether their input satisfies a predetermined property in sublinear time, or even in constant time – that is, time is independent of the input size.</p><p>This book consists of three parts. The first part provides an introduction to the foundations of property testing. The second part studies the testing of specific properties on strings, graphs, functions, and constraint satisfaction problems. Vectors and matrices over real numbers are also covered. The third part is more advanced and explains general conditions, including full characterizations, under which properties are constant-query testable.</p><p>The first and second parts of the book are intended for first-year graduate students in computer science.

<p>Mohit Singh and I are organizing a two-day virtual DIMACS Workshop on <strong>Entropy and Optimization</strong> that starts tomorrow — May 18, 19, 2022. </p>



<p>We have a stellar lineup of speakers:  </p>



<p><em>Nima Anari (Stanford University), Alexander Barvinok (Michigan), Mark Braverman (Princeton), Sebastien Bubeck (Microsoft Research), Péter Csikvári (Alfred Renyi Institute of Mathematics), Zongchen Chen (MIT), Ronen Eldan (Weizmann), Tali Kaufman (Bar-Ilan University), Jon Lee (Michigan), Shayan Oveis-Gharan (U Washington)</em></p>



<p>The goal of this workshop is to explore various connections between entropy, optimization, and sampling. Entropy-maximizing probability distributions have been recently used in interesting ways in applications such as algorithms for counting problems, algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems, and interior-point methods for convex programming</p>



<p>Attendance to the workshop is free but <strong>registration is required</strong>. To see the program of the workshop and register, visit <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/events/details?eID=318">here</a>.</p>



<p>Looking forward to seeing many of you there!</p>

Jeannette Wing is a Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University. She was recently <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/jeannette-wing-appointed-executive-vice-president-research">appointed</a> Executive VP for Research across all of Columbia’s campuses. She is also an adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. She stays busy. See <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~wing/">this</a> for her CV. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/16/take-wing/jw/" rel="attachment wp-att-20028"><img width="225" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/jw.png?resize=225%2C225&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20028" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>
Sixteen years ago she wrote a short <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf">position</a> paper for <em>Communications of the ACM</em> titled “Computational Thinking.” It begins:</p>
<p>
<em><br />
 Computational thinking builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine.<br />
</em></p>
<p>
This is the first of sixteen sentences of the form “Computational thinking [verb]…,” plus one that follows a semicolon. The thirteenth prefaces six bulleted paragraphs giving characteristics of computational thinking. They fill page 3 of 3—the paper is shorter to read than this post. </p>
<p>
Her 2007 <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/Computational_Thinking.pdf">talk</a> on “Computational Thinking” has oodles of things that aren’t in the paper: <em>pictures</em>. It also concludes by posing five questions that she put into another famous CACM paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Five Questions </b></p>
<p></p><p>
This second <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2008/1/5481-five-deep-questions-in-computing/fulltext">paper</a> appeared in 2008 with the title “Five Deep Questions in Computing.” They are: </p>
<ol>
<li> P = NP?
</li><li> What is computable?
</li><li> What is intelligence?
</li><li> What is information?
</li><li> (How) can we build complex systems simply?
</li></ol>
<p>
The first is one of the basic questions of theory, of course. </p>
<p>
The next is about what are computations? This question complicates when one includes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing">DNA</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">quantum</a> computers? Also what about man-machine joint computations? Given that humans and machines have different computing capability, now ask: What is computable? Pretty complex.</p>
<p>
Let’s skip what is intelligence for now.</p>
<p>
What is information? This is a perfect question: Information is not just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />‘s and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />‘s. DNA encodes information in a different way and with quantum computing, it’s not bits but qubits. Amazing. </p>
<p>
Finally we will also skip the last question. </p>
<p>
She ends with:<br />
<em><br />
I pose these questions to stimulate deep thinking and further discussion. What deep questions about computing would you want answered? In 50 years, how different will they and their answers be from what we ask and are able to answer today?<br />
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Data Science </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Wing is a leading expert of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a>. This field is traceable back to 1962 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John Tukey</a> described an area he called “data analysis”. That is Tukey of Fast Fourier transform fame, who I knew when I was at Princeton. </p>
<p>
Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.</p>
<p>
Her current research interests are in trustworthy AI. Her areas of research expertise include security and privacy, formal methods, programming languages, and distributed and concurrent systems. She is widely recognized for her intellectual leadership in computer science, and more recently in data science. Wing’s seminal essay, titled “Computational Thinking,” was published more than a fifteen years ago and is credited with helping to establish the centrality of computer science to problem-solving in all other disciplines.</p>
<p>
Data can be precious for one of three reasons: the data set is expensive to collect; the data set contains a rare event (low signal-to-noise ratio); or the data set is artisanal—small, task-specific, and/or targets a limited audience. </p>
<ul>
<li> A good example of expensive data comes from large, one-off, expensive scientific instruments, for example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Large Hadron Collider, and the IceCube Neutrino Detector at the South Pole.
</li><li> A good example of rare event data is data from sensors on physical infrastructure, such as bridges and tunnels; sensors produce a lot of raw data, but the disastrous event they are used to predict is (thankfully) rare. Rare data can also be expensive to collect.
</li><li> A good example of artisanal data is the tens of millions of court judgments that China has released online to the public since 2014.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s take a cue from Wing: What other major aspects and objectives of computer science shall we put into crisp bullet points?</p>

<p>On Nov 19, 2021 Joe Biden got a colonoscopy and hence the 25th amendment was used to make Kamala Harris the president temporarily (this source: <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/19/biden-returns-to-white-house-after-physical-colonoscopy/">here</a> says 85 minutes, though I thought I heard a few hours from other sources). </p><p>Does this make Kamala Harris our first female president?</p><p>I would say NO and I suspect you agree. A friend of mine suggested the phrasing <i>Kamala Harris is the</i> <i>first women to assume the powers of the president under the 25th amendment.  </i>True.  I don't think it means much. She tacked on the <i>under the 25th amendment </i>since Edith Wilson was essentially president when Woodrow Wilson had a stroke (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Wilson#Increased_role_after_husband's_stroke">here</a>).</p><p><br /></p><p>A student asked me <i>Is there a theorem that is referred to as Gasarch's Theorem or something like that?</i></p><p>I will answer YES and NO, but really the answer is NO.</p><p>YES: In 1999 Gasarch and Kruskal had a paper in Mathematics Magazine: </p><p><a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/dice.pdf">When can one load of Dice so that the sum is uniformly distributed</a>?<br /></p><p>In that paper we have a theorem that gives an exact condition on</p><p>(n_1,...,n_k) for when there is a loaded n_1-sided dice, n_2-sided dice,...,n_k-sided dice so that </p><p>the sums are all equally likely.</p><p>In 2018 Ian Morrison published a paper in the American Math Monthly:</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2272">Sacks of dice with fair totals</a><br /></p><p>which used our work and referred to our main theorem as <b>The Gasarch-Kruskal Theorem.</b></p><p>Hence there is a theorem with my name on it!</p><p>NO: The Gasarch-Kruskal paper has only 8 citations (according to Google Scholar). This is more than I would have thought, but its not a lot. The fact that ONE person calls the main theorem THE GASARCH-KRUSKAL THEOREM hardly makes it a named theorem. </p><p>QUESTION: So what criteria can one use?</p><p>We could say that X has a theorem with their name on it if there is a Wikipedia entry about the theorem, using that name. That works to a point, but might fun afoul of Goodhart's law (if a measure becomes a target it stops being a measure) in that, for example, I could write a Wikipedia entry on The Gasarch-Kruskal Theorem. </p><p>We could say that 10 people need to refer to the theorem by the name of its authors. Why 10? Any number seems arbitrary. </p><p>CAVEAT: If someone asked Clyde Kruskal <i>is there a theorem that bears your name</i> that is trickier, since <i>The Kruskal Tree Theorem</i> bears his name.... but its not his theorem. Reminds me of the (fictional) scenario where a Alice steals  a Field's medal and tells Bob<i> I have a Field's Medal! </i>and Bob  thinks Alice is a world-class mathematician since she has a fields medal, rather than thinking Alice is a world class thief. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/08/how-valuable-is-fields-medal.html">here</a> for my post on that. </p><p>(I originally had Kruskal Three Theorem instead of Tree Theorem. I have corrected this but I hope it inspires Clyde to prove a theorem about the number Three so he can have a named theorem. And if he is lucky, over time, people will confuse it with the Kruskal Tree Theorem!) </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><i><br /></i></p></div>
