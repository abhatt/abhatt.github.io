<p> </p><p>1) Contrast the following two points and, if you have an intelligent way to fill-in-the-blank for the second one, please comment.</p><p>a) When Trump says `open the schools or I will cut of funding' I disagree, or at least he should talk more about how to do it carefully BUT there is an underlying important and serious issue: how to balance health and education. Similar for when he talks about opening up business's - how to balance heath and the economy.</p><p>b) When Trump says `hydroxychloroquine is a potential cure for covid' I (and most of the medical community) disagree, BUT FILL IN THE BLANK. Is there SOME serious issue involved here that I am just missing?</p><p>2) I have seen several approaches to large gathering, say Churchs, beach parties, motorcycle meeting etc. </p><p>a) DO IT ONLINE.  UMCP classes will be on-line in the fall. My church has been online since mid March and seems like it will do the same in the fall. (Note- Choir is much worse than normal talking for spreading it, so Choir might not resume for a much longer time than Church).</p><p>b) HAVE THEM but SOCIAL DISTANCE and MASKS and other precautions. And it works. I hope it works.</p><p>c) HAVE THEM, realize that there IS an issue, TRY to do some of the precautions, but fail. This may be what has happened at some high schools, see <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/9-people-test-positive-at-georgia-school-with-photo-of-crowded-hallway?ref=home">Here</a>.</p><p>d) HAVE THEM and ignore ALL precautions either because </p><p>i) God will protect you</p><p>ii) The Government is not my boss. Such people are usually pro-business so they should NOT mind if a business on its own requires masks and SHOULD mind if its the government. I have not seen them making that distinction. Such people are usually against Federalism and for localism. So they should be upset when a Prez or a Gov overides a Mayor's Mask Mandate. I have not seen this.</p><p>iii) The whole think is a Hoax. How can people still believe this?</p><p>These three may overlap.</p><p>3) The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota seems to believe ii and iii. Can someone give any rational reason why they want to have this rally and why its allowed to happen. Given how many people come (usually 250,000- less now?) from all across the country, this could make thinks far far worse. But see next point.</p><p>4) Libertarians think that there is too much Government in our lives. This is a fair point of view but it needs to be tested on a case by case basis. There are some things that REQUIRE a more national response. When this happens Libertarians have two choices:</p><p>a) Apply their thinking to figure out how Gov can help with the least damage. For example, Carbon tax for global warning. In the current pandemic they might have LOCAL govs pass mandatory mask laws.. Or they would at least set a good example by wearing masks themselves. Perhaps relax regulations on medical stuff so that companies can work together without worrying about anti-trust, and perhaps look more carefully at regulations that get in the way (might be a good idea anyway).</p><p>b) Deny its a problem. Man made Global Warming is a myth. Covid is a hoax. Hence its okay to have the Motorcycle Rally. But the problem is, this doesn't just harm the people showing up, it harms others as well.</p><p>5) Early on I was puzzled that Trump didn't care more since older people (his base!) are at more risk. Did he think it would only affect democrats (early on NY was hit badly). Why didn't his advisors tell him that it would kill his own base?I ASK NON-RHETORICALLY  Or did they and he didn't list. My point is, for purely selfish reasons Trump should have taken more action earlier, so I am surprised he did not. See next point.</p><p>6) Trump could have even taken action in a Trumpian way:</p><p>The Chinese and the Democrats are waging a bio-war on real Americans (white rural older) !!! We will STOP them in their tracks and show them they can't mess with us!!  I will LOCKDOWN some cities AND provide online stuff to schools, business's (my cronies)  and churchs (SCREW that stupid sep of church and state- that was only one passage in a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote).  </p><p>He might have even got Democrats to complain that it will choke the economy and hurt the poor, and that giving stuff to churchs is against the constitution (it prob is). </p><p>7) If a vax for covid is found, will Trump urge his base (some of whom are anti-vax) to take it? Having said that, if it comes out in October it may be untested so I doubt I will take it. I'll wait until Dr Fauci says its okay to take it. (See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUiDLcp_hIw">here</a> for a nice song about Dr. Fauci.)</p><p>8) Some people who thought it was a Hoax and then got a bad case of it are saying loudly `I WAS WRONG! Its Real!'  I wonder if Herman Cain realized it was real before he died of it? I wish he had said `I WAS WRONG! ITS REAL! Wear a MASK' (The Whitehouse denies that he got Covid from the Tulsa Rally, here is headline only since something is behind paywalls: <a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/white-house-denies-herman-cain-contracted-covid-19-at-tulsa-trump-rally-prior-to-his/article_b0c83d3c-c3de-547e-9a5f-434b6a82ac61.html">here</a>)</p><p>9) At Tulsa the presidents people took DOWN signs about safe distancing. So again, why does the Prez want to kill his own base? I ask non rhetorically. I am serious- I want someone to defend his actions intelligently both this one and the hydro-whatever in the first point.</p><p>10) Authoritarian governments often claim that they bring order and can act fast to get things done. So they SHOULD have an advantage during the pandemic since they can more easily ORDER a lockdown. Yet they don't seem to be doing better.  </p><p>Russia: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/russia/">See Here</a>, number of cases going up fast.</p><p>Iran: <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/iran/">See here</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-53598965">Here</a>, number of cases going up fast.</p><p>These countries and others, and America, had their leaders LIE about the extend of the virus early on. What is the upside of doing this?  I ask non-rhetorically. </p><p><br /></p></div>

constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be approximated by some sentence of
fixed point logic with counting (FPC). It is known that, assuming $\mathsf{P}
\neq \mathsf{NP}$ and the Unique Games Conjecture, the best polynomial time
approximation algorithm for any CSP is given by solving and rounding a specific
semidefinite programming relaxation. We prove an analogue of this result for
algorithms that are definable as FPC-interpretations, which holds without the
assumption that $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$. While we are not able to drop
(an FPC-version of) the Unique Games Conjecture as an assumption, we do present
some partial results toward proving it. Specifically, we give a novel
construction which shows that, for all $\alpha &gt; 0$, there exists a positive
integer $q = \text{poly}(\frac{1}{\alpha})$ such that no there is no
FPC-interpretation giving an $\alpha$-approximation of Unique Games on a label
set of size $q$.

function. We introduce a proof technique, called the normalization procedure,
that takes any such clustering of a graph $G$ and iteratively improves it until
a desired target clustering of G is reached. We use this technique to show both
a negative and a positive complexity result. Firstly, we show that in general
the problem is NP-complete. Secondly, we consider min-well-behaved graphs,
which are graphs $H$ having the property that for any $k$ the graph $H(k)$
being the join of $k$ copies of $H$ has an optimal hierarchical clustering that
splits each copy of $H$ in the same optimal way. To optimally cluster such a
graph $H(k)$ we thus only need to optimally cluster the smaller graph $H$.
Co-bipartite graphs are min-well-behaved, but otherwise they seem to be scarce.
We use the normalization procedure to show that also the cycle on 6 vertices is
min-well-behaved.

interest due to its many applications. However, in most applications, the

that make MOT tractable. We identify two such properties: decomposability of
the cost into either (i) local interactions and simple global interactions; or
(ii) low-rank interactions and sparse interactions. We also provide strong
evidence that (iii) repulsive costs make MOT intractable by showing that
several such problems of interest are NP-hard to solve--even approximately.
These three structures are quite general, and collectively they encompass many
(if not most) current MOT applications. We demonstrate our results on a variety
of applications in machine learning, statistics, physics, and computational
geometry.

near-term quantum computers; however, recent studies have demonstrated that
unless the variational quantum circuits are configured in a problem-specific
manner, optimization of such circuits will most likely fail. In this paper, we
focus on a special family of quantum circuits called the Hamiltonian
Variational Ansatz (HVA), which takes inspiration from the quantum
approximation optimization algorithm and adiabatic quantum computation. Through
the study of its entanglement spectrum and energy gradient statistics, we find
that HVA exhibits favorable structural properties such as mild or entirely
absent barren plateaus and a restricted state space that eases their
optimization in comparison to the well-studied "hardware-efficient ansatz." We
also numerically observe that the optimization landscape of HVA becomes almost
trap free when the ansatz is over-parameterized. We observe a size-dependent
"computational phase transition" as the number of layers in the HVA circuit is
increased where the optimization crosses over from a hard to an easy region in
terms of the quality of the approximations and speed of convergence to a good
solution. In contrast with the analogous transitions observed in the learning
of random unitaries which occur at a number of layers that grows exponentially
with the number of qubits, our Variational Quantum Eigensolver experiments
suggest that the threshold to achieve the over-parameterization phenomenon
scales at most polynomially in the number of qubits for the transverse field
Ising and XXZ models. Lastly, as a demonstration of its entangling power and
effectiveness, we show that HVA can find accurate approximations to the ground
states of a modified Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian on a ring, which has
long-range interactions and has a power-law entanglement scaling.

We study parity decision trees for Boolean functions. The motivation of our study is the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions and its connection to Fourier analysis and parity decision tree complexity. Our contributions are as follows. Let $f : \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ be a Boolean function with Fourier support $\mathcal{S}$ and Fourier sparsity $k$.

1) We prove via the probabilistic method that there exists a parity decision tree of depth $O(\sqrt{k})$ that computes $f$. This matches the best known upper bound on the parity decision tree complexity of Boolean functions (Tsang, Wong, Xie, and Zhang, FOCS 2013). Moreover, while previous constructions (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013, Shpilka, Tal, and Volk, Comput. Complex. 2017) build the trees by carefully choosing the parities to be queried in each step, our proof shows that a naive sampling of the parities suffices.

2) We generalize the above result by showing that if the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions satisfy a natural "folding property", then the above proof can be adapted to establish existence of a tree of complexity polynomially smaller than $O(\sqrt k)$. More concretely, the folding property we consider is that for most distinct $\gamma, \delta$ in $\mathcal{S}$, there are at least a polynomial (in $k$) number of pairs $(\alpha, \beta)$ of parities in $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\alpha+\beta=\gamma+\delta$. We make a conjecture in this regard which, if true, implies that the communication complexity of an XOR function is bounded above by the fourth root of the rank of its communication matrix, improving upon the previously known upper bound of square root of rank (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013, Lovett, J. ACM. 2016).

3) Motivated by the above, we present some structural results about the Fourier spectra of Boolean functions. It can be shown by elementary techniques that for any Boolean function $f$ and all $(\alpha, \beta)$ in ${\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$, there exists another pair $(\gamma, \delta)$ in ${\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ such that $\alpha + \beta = \gamma + \delta$. One can view this as a "trivial" folding property that all Boolean functions satisfy. Prior to our work, it was conceivable that for all $(\alpha, \beta) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$, there exists exactly one other pair $(\gamma, \delta) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ with $\alpha + \beta = \gamma + \delta$. We show, among other results, that there must exist several $\gamma \in \mathbb{F}_2^n$ such that there are at least three pairs of parities $(\alpha_1, \alpha_2) \in {\mathcal{S} \choose 2}$ with $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=\gamma$. This, in particular, rules out the possibility stated earlier.</div>

optimal, i.e., algorithms that are simultaneously time and message optimal, for
the fundamental leader election problem in networks. Our main result is a
randomized distributed leader election algorithm for asynchronous complete
networks that is essentially (up to a polylogarithmic factor) singularly
optimal. Our algorithm uses $O(n)$ messages with high probability and runs in
$O(\log^2 n)$ time (with high probability) to elect a unique leader. The $O(n)$
message complexity should be contrasted with the $\Omega(n \log n)$ lower
bounds for the deterministic message complexity of leader election algorithms
(regardless of time), proven by Korach, Moran, and Zaks (TCS, 1989) for
asynchronous algorithms and by Afek and Gafni (SIAM J. Comput., 1991) for
synchronous networks. Hence, our result also separates the message complexities
of randomized and deterministic leader election. More importantly, our
(randomized) time complexity of $O(\log^2 n)$ for obtaining the optimal $O(n)$
message complexity is significantly smaller than the long-standing
$\tilde{\Theta}(n)$ time complexity obtained by Afek and Gafni and by Singh
(SIAM J. Comput., 1997) for message optimal (deterministic) election in
asynchronous networks.
</p>
<p>In synchronous complete networks, Afek and Gafni showed an essentially
singularly optimal deterministic algorithm with $O(\log n)$ time and $O(n \log
n)$ messages. Ramanathan et al. (Distrib. Comput. 2007) used randomization to
improve the message complexity, and showed a randomized algorithm with $O(n)$
messages and $O(\log n)$ time (with failure probability $O(1 /
\log^{\Omega(1)}n)$). Our second result is a tightly singularly optimal
randomized algorithm, with $O(1)$ time and $O(n)$ messages, for this setting,
whose time bound holds with certainty and message bound holds with high
probability.

patterns of bounded depth in this work. For them a classification splitting the
types in easy (strongly sub-quadratic) and hard (essentially quadratic time
under SETH) is known. We take a very fine-grained look at the hard pattern
types from this classification and show a dichotomy: few types allow
super-poly-logarithmic improvements while the algorithms for the other pattern
types can only be improved by a constant number of log-factors, assuming the
Formula-SAT Hypothesis.

additively separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. A mixed manna
contains goods that everyone likes and bads that everyone dislikes, as well as
items that some like and others dislike. The seminal work of Bogomolnaia et al.
[Econometrica'17] argue why allocating a mixed manna is genuinely more
complicated than a good or a bad manna, and why competitive equilibrium is the
best mechanism. They also provide the existence of equilibrium and establish
its peculiar properties (e.g., non-convex and disconnected set of equilibria
even under linear utilities), but leave the problem of computing an equilibrium
open. This problem remained unresolved even for only bad manna under linear
utilities.
</p>
<p>Our main result is a simplex-like algorithm based on Lemke's scheme for
computing a competitive allocation of a mixed manna under SPLC utilities, a
strict generalization of linear. Experimental results on randomly generated
instances suggest that our algorithm will be fast in practice. The problem is
known to be PPAD-hard for the case of good manna, and we also show a similar
result for the case of bad manna. Given these PPAD-hardness results, designing
such an algorithm is the only non-brute-force (non-enumerative) option known,
e.g., the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm (1964) for computing a Nash
equilibrium in a 2-player game is still one of the most widely used algorithms
in practice.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm also yields several new structural properties as simple
corollaries. We obtain a (constructive) proof of existence for a far more
general setting, membership of the problem in PPAD, rational-valued solution,
and odd number of solutions property. The last property also settles the
conjecture of Bogomolnaia et al. in the affirmative.

on a single variable (atomic interventions) using observational samples in a
causal Bayesian network. Our goal is to give algorithms that are efficient in
both time and sample complexity in a non-parametric setting.
</p>
<p>Tian and Pearl (AAAI `02) have exactly characterized the class of causal
graphs for which causal effects of atomic interventions can be identified from
observational data. We make their result quantitative. Suppose P is a causal
model on a set $\vec{V}$ of n observable variables with respect to a given
causal graph G with observable distribution $P$. Let $P_x$ denote the
interventional distribution over the observables with respect to an
intervention of a designated variable X with x. Assuming that $G$ has bounded
in-degree, bounded c-components ($k$), and that the observational distribution
is identifiable and satisfies certain strong positivity condition, we give an
algorithm that takes $m=\tilde{O}(n\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $P$ and $O(mn)$
time, and outputs with high probability a description of a distribution
$\hat{P}$ such that $d_{\mathrm{TV}}(P_x, \hat{P}) \leq \epsilon$, and:
</p>
<p>1. [Evaluation] the description can return in $O(n)$ time the probability
$\hat{P}(\vec{v})$ for any assignment $\vec{v}$ to $\vec{V}$
</p>
<p>2. [Generation] the description can return an iid sample from $\hat{P}$ in
$O(n)$ time.
</p>
<p>We also show lower bounds for the sample complexity showing that our sample
complexity has an optimal dependence on the parameters $n$ and $\epsilon$, as
well as if $k=1$ on the strong positivity parameter.

I consider Fran a friend, although we never worked together—our areas of interest were different. One fond memory of mine is being on panel a while ago with Fran. What a delightful presence.</p>

<p></p><h2> Compliers were Key </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There was a time when compliers were the most important program available on any new computer. Perhaps on any computer. Here is proof: </p>
<ol>
<li>
Computers are there to solve problems. <p></p>
</li><li>
We must write programs to solve problems. <p></p>
</li><li>
Details of the computer and instructions, are complicated, which make writing programs hard. <p></p>
</li><li>
Thus, automating the writing of programs is important. <p></p>
</li><li>
QED: we must have compliers.
</li></ol>
<p>
Okay this is not really a “proof”, but there is some truth to the argument. Fran was at IBM and worked on some of the early compliers, including FORTRAN and related languages. IBM wanted to sell computers, well actually in the early days rent them. One potential roadblock, IBM realized, was that new computers could be hard to program. Thus to ensure that companies rented new machines as fast as IBM could manufacture them was important. This created the need for compliers and even more for <i>optimizing compilers</i>.</p>
<p>
In order to ship more machines, the code that a complier created had to be efficient. Hence, a stress on Allen was to figure out how compliers could generate high quality code. This led Fran and others like John Cocke to discover many complier techniques that are still used today. A short list of the ideas is: </p>
<ul>
<li>
Branch prediction <p></p>
</li><li>
Register allocation <p></p>
</li><li>
Control flow graphs <p></p>
</li><li>
Program dependence graphs <p></p>
</li><li>
And many more.
</li></ul>
<p>
What is so important is that Allen’s work was not just applicable to this machine or that language. Rather the work was able to be used for almost any machine and for almost any language. This universal nature of the work on compliers reminds me of what we try to do in theory. Allen’s research was so important because it could be used for future hardware as well as future languages. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Register Allocation </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Guy Steele interviewed Allen for the ACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103191-an-interview-with-frances-e-allen/fulltext">here</a>. During the interview Fran talked about register allocation:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I have a story about register allocation. FORTRAN back in the 1950’s had the beginnings of a theory of register allocation, even though there were only three registers on the target machine. Quite a bit later, John Backus became interested in applying graph coloring to allocating registers; he worked for about 10 years on that problem and just couldn’t solve it. I considered it the biggest outstanding problem in optimizing compilers for a long time. Optimizing transformations would produce code with symbolic registers; the issue was then to map symbolic registers to real machine registers, of which there was a limited set. For high-performance computing, register allocation often conflicts with instruction scheduling. There wasn’t a good algorithm until the Chaitin algorithm. Chaitin was working on the PL compiler for the 801 system. Ashok Chandra, another student of Knuth’s, joined the department and told about how he had worked on the graph coloring problem, which Knuth had given out in class, and had solved it not by solving the coloring problem directly, but in terms of what is the minimal number of colors needed to color the graph. Greg immediately recognized that he could apply this solution to the register allocator issue. It was a wonderful kind of serendipity. </em>

<p></p><p>
The early goal of creating compliers lead directly to some wonderful theory problems. One whole area that dominated early theory research was language theory. In particular understanding questions that arise in defining programming languages. Syntax came first—later semantics was formalized.</p>
<p>
Noam Chomsky created context-free grammars to help understand natural languages in the 1950s. His ideas were used by John Backus, also a Turing award winner from IBM, to describe the then new programming language IAL. This is known today as ALGOL 58, which became ALGOL 60. Peter Naur on the ALGOL 60 committee called Backus’s notation for ALGOL’s syntax: Backus normal form, but is now called BNF-Backus-Naur form. </p>

Theorists worked on, I confess I did, many questions about such languages. Existence problems, decidability problems, efficient algorithms, and closure properties were just some of the examples. Not clear how much of this theory effected compiler design, but I would like to think that some was useful. Theorist should thank the complier researchers. I do. </p>
<p>
For instance the 1970 STOC <a href="https://dblp.org/db/conf/stoc/stoc70">program</a> had many papers on language related topics—here are some:</p>
<ul>
<li>
A Result on the Relationship between Simple Precedence Languages and Reducing Transition Languages. 		Gary Lindstrom <p></p>
</li><li>
The Design of Parsers for Incremental Language Processors: 		Ronald Book, Sheila Greibach, Ben Wegbreit <p></p>
</li><li>
Tape- and Time-Bounded Turing Acceptors and AFLs. 		David Lewis <p></p>
</li><li>
Closure of Families of Languages under Substitution Operators. 		William Rounds <p></p>
</li><li>
Tree-Oriented Proofs of Some Theorems on Context-Free and Indexed Languages. 		Barry Rosen <p></p>
</li><li>
On Syntax-Directed Transduction and Tree Transducers. 		Alfred Aho, Jeffrey Ullman <p></p>
</li><li>
The Analysis of Two-Dimensional Patterns using Picture Processing Grammars. 		Jean-Francois Perrot <p></p>
</li><li>
On Some Families of Languages Related to the Dyck Language. 		Joseph Ullian <p></p>
</li><li>
Three Theorems on Abstract Families of Languages. 	Joseph Ullian
</li></ul>
<p>
By the way Abstract Families of Languages or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_family_of_languages">AFL</a>s was created by Seymour Ginsburg and Sheila Greibach in 1967 as a way to generalize context free languages. </p>

It’s just such an amazing field, and it’s changed the world, and we’re just at the beginning of the change. We have to find a way to get our excitement out to be more publicly visible. It is exciting, in the 50 years that I’ve been involved, the change has been astounding. </em>

Thanks Fran. Much of that change is due to pioneers like you. Thanks for everything.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>I spent the last few days participating in the <a href="http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/">Canadian Conference in Computational Geometry</a>, originally planned for Saskatoon but organized virtually instead.</p>

<p>The way the conference was organized was that (after the usual submission reviewing process) the accepted authors provided both a proceedings paper and a 10-15 minute talk video to the conference organizers. Participants were required to register, but with no registration fee, and were provided with links to the papers and talks (which are all still live on the conference program). Then, during the conference itself, live online Zoom sessions ran for only 2-3 hours daily, scheduled for 10AM-1PM Saskatoon time: very convenient for anywhere in North America or Europe, not so much for the participants in Iran, India, China, Japan, and Korea (all of which did have participants). The sessions included a daily 1-hour live invited talk, and question-and-answer sessions for the contributed works, in which we were shown a one-minute teaser for each video and then invited to ask questions of authors, at least one of whom was required to be present.</p>

<p>I think it all worked very well; so well, in fact, that during the business meeting there were calls for having at least some of the content similarly online so that people could participate remotely again. The ability to ask and answer questions either by live video on Zoom or through Zoom chat was useful, and used. Attendance was far above previous levels: 162 registrants, and over 120 unique participants at the most heavily attended of the two daily parallel sessions, compared to roughly 60 attendees each at the last two physical conferences. Despite the free registration, the conference organization was not without cost: they spent roughly $1500 (Canadian) in video production costs and video conferencing fees, but this was more than made up for by institutional support for the conference, so they ended up running a surplus which may (if it can be kept) end up providing some float for future conference organizers.</p>

<p>There are two changes I would suggest for future events of this type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The contributed sessions were for a short enough time that holding them in parallel seemed unnecessary, and made it impossible to participate in all discussions. So this format may work better with less parallelism.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The one-minute teaser videos were cut together by the conference organizers from the longer videos provided by the authors, but in some cases the pacing of the longer videos from which they were cut meant that these teaser videos could not clearly state the results of their papers. I think it would have been better to ask authors to provide these alongside the longer talk videos.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the highlights of the event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Wednesday’s invited talk by Erik Demaine was a moving tribute to Godfried Toussaint and a survey of some of both Toussaint’s research, and Erik’s research on problems started by Toussaint, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Nagy_theorem">convexifying polygons by flips</a>, sona curves (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15784">the subject of one of my own contributions</a>), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Geometry_of_Musical_Rhythm">geometry of musical rhythms</a>, and perhaps most importantly “supercollaboration”, the model of shared research and shared authorship developed by Toussaint at the Barbados research workshops and also used by Erik within many of his MIT classes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exzxGODi2YU">Erik’s talk was recorded and is now on YouTube</a>; I hope the same will be true of the other two invited talks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Wednesday’s contributed session on unfolding (in which I had two papers) I particularly liked Satyan Devadoss’s talk, “Nets of higher-dimensional cubes”. The main result is that if you unfold a hypercube, then no path of facets of the unfolded shape can contain a u-turn: if the path takes a step in one any coordinate direction, it cannot step in the opposite direction. This implies that all dual spanning trees unfold flat without self-intersection. The same property was known for all the Platonic solids, and Satyan can prove it for regular simplices in any dimension, but that still leaves several regular polytopes for which it is still open whether all unfoldings work: the cross-polytopes in all dimensions, and the three exceptional regular polytopes in four dimensions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thursday’s invited talk was by Jeff Erickson, “Chasing puppies”. It was an entertaining presentation of an elegant topological proof of the following result: if you and a puppy can both move around a simple closed curve in the plane, with the puppy always moving along the curve to a local minimum of distance to you, then you can always find a path to follow that will bring you and the puppy to the same point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There wasn’t an official prize for best contributed presentation, but in the data structures session on Thursday, several comments nominated <a href="https://medium.com/photos-we-love/the-trinity-of-incongruity-or-why-i-still-love-this-tuxedo-sewing-machine-ups-truck-photograph-39712dd32fcb">Don Sheehy</a> as the unofficial winner, for a video artfully mixing live action with computer animations. His paper, “One-hop greedy permutations” concerned heuristics for improving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farthest-first_traversal">farthest-first traversal</a> of a set of points by looking near each point as the sequence is constructed for a better point to use instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was an official best student paper award, and it went to <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/afloresv">Alejandro Flores Velazco</a> for his paper “Social distancing is good for points too!” It concerns the problem of reducing the size of a data set while preserving the quality of nearest-neighbor classification using the reduced set. It proves that FCNN, which it calls the most popular heuristic for this problem, can produce significantly less-reduced outputs than some other proven heuristics, and shows how to modify FCNN to get a heuristic with guaranteed output quality.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The third of the invited sessions was by Yusu Wang, newly moved from Ohio State to UC San Diego. She gave a nice introduction to combinatorial methods for reconstructing road networks (or other networks embedded into higher-dimensional geometry) from noisy samples of points on the network by combining discrete Morse theory to find the ridge lines of sample density with persistent homology to clean some of the noise from the data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The final technical component of the conference was an open problem session, also recorded and presumably to be uploaded at some point. Satyan posed his question on regular polytope unfolding there. Mike Paterson asked whether one can construct “Plato’s torus”, an embedded torus with six equilateral-triangle faces meeting at each vertex; <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/02/03/flat-equilateral-tori.html">in a blog post I made on this problem in 2009 I traced its history to Nick Halloway in 1997</a> but Mike says he discussed it already with Christopher Zeeman in the 1970s. Another problem that caught my attention asked for an algorithmic version of the polyhedral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_the_three_geodesics">theorem of the three geodesics</a>, the existence of a path across the surface of a convex polyhedron that stays straight across each edge or face of the polyhedron, and has at most \(\pi\) surface angle on each side of it when it passes through a vertex. Again there’s some history here: Joe O’Rourke says he once mentioned the problem to Gromov, who said it was easy but unfortunately didn’t elaborate.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>CCCG 2021 is planned for Halifax, colocated with WADS. One somewhat controversial issue is that the current plan is to have both conferences overlap for two days, with one overlap-free day for each conference at each end of the overlap period. But if both conferences are double-session, this means that participants can only choose one of four overlapping talks. At this point everyone is still hoping that events allow for a physical conference by then but that remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Years ago when I learned about Google PageRank algorithm, my first reaction was this is not the way it should be done! There should be some proof. This probably just shows that my CS education was too theoretical ;). Years later I have learned that indeed there are some nice tools to argue about the running time of PageRank algorithm. And very recently we were able to give some new parallel (in MPC model) algorithms for computing vanilla PageRank. We improved the number of rounds needed from O(log n) to O(log^2 log n) time.

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/open-problem-all-pairs/">Open Problem: Private All-Pairs Distances</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://differentialprivacy.org" title="Differential Privacy">DifferentialPrivacy.org</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Suppose we are interested in computing the distance between two vertices in a graph. Under edge or node differential privacy, this problem is not promising because the removal of a single edge can make distances change from 1 to \(n − 1\) or can even disconnect the graph. However, a different setting that makes sense to consider is that of a weighted graph \((G, w)\) whose topology \(G = (V, E)\) is publicly known but edge weight function \(w : E \to \mathbb{R}^+\) must be kept private. (For instance, consider transit times on a road network. The topology of the road network may be publicly available as a map, but the edge weights corresponding to transit times may be based on private GPS locations of individual cars.)</p>

<p>Suppose that two weight functions \(w\) and \(w’\) of the same graph \(G\) are considered to be neighbors if they differ by at most 1 in \(\ell^1\) norm. Then the length of any fixed path is sensitivity-one, so the distance between any pair of vertices is also sensitivity-one and can be released privately via the Laplace mechanism. But what if we want to release all \(\Theta(n^2)\) distances between all pairs of vertices in \(G\)? We can do this with accuracy roughly \(O(n \log n )/\varepsilon\) by adding noise to each edge, or roughly \(O(n \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}/\varepsilon)\) using composition theorems. Both of these are roughly \(n/\varepsilon\). But is this linear dependence on \(n\) inherent, or is it possible to release all-pairs distances with error sublinear in \(n\)?</p>

<p>This setting and question were considered in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04631">S16</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Let \(G\) be an arbitrary public graph, and \(w : E \to \mathbb{R}^+\) be an edge weight function. Can we release approximate all-pairs distances in \((G, w)\) with accuracy sublinear in \(n\) while preserving the privacy of the edge weight function, where two weight functions \(w, w’\) are neighbors if \(\|w − w’\|_1 \le 1\)? Or can we show that any private algorithm must have error \(\Omega(n)\)? A weaker (but nontrivial) lower bound would also be nice.</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> A bar of chocolate.</p>

<p><strong>Other related work:</strong> [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04631">S16</a>] provided algorithms with better error for two special cases, trees and graphs of a priori bounded weight. For trees, it is possible to release all-pairs distances with error roughly \(O(\log^{1.5} n)/\varepsilon\), while for arbitrary graphs with edge weights restricted to the interval \([0,M]\), it is possible to release all-pairs distances with error roughly \(O( \sqrt{nM\varepsilon^{-1}\log(1/\delta)})\)</p>

<p>Should Paper X cite Paper Y as previous or concurrent/independent work?  This is sometimes tricky: maybe Paper Y circulated privately before Paper X, maybe the authors of Paper X knew about Paper Y maybe not — nobody can know for sure.  One can say that the authors of Paper Y should have posted Paper Y online earlier to prevent this issue, but <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2014/07/02/only-papers-on-the-arxiv-can-be-submitted-for-publication/">that is not standard practice </a>and might lead to other problems, <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/paper-x-on-the-arxiv-keeps-getting-rejected/">including Paper Y never getting published!</a></p>



<p>I propose the following guiding principle:</p>



<p>“If a different accept/reject outcome would have forced paper X to cite paper Y as previous work, then paper X should cite paper Y as previous work.”<br /></p>



<p>The reasons behind my principle seem to me especially valid in the fast-moving theoretical computer science community, where papers are typically sent to conferences and thus seen by the entire program committee plus around 3 external referees, who are typically experts — only to be rejected.  Moreover, the progress is extremely fast, with the next conference cycle making obsolete a number of papers in just the previous cycle.</p></div>

We consider the problem of testing asymmetry in the bounded-degree graph model, where a graph is called asymmetric if the identity permutation is its only automorphism. Seeking to determine the query complexity of this testing problem, we provide partial results. Considering the special case of $n$-vertex graphs with connected components of size at most $s(n)=\Omega(\log n)$, we show that the query complexity of $\epsilon$-testing asymmetry (in this case) is at most $O({\sqrt n}\cdot s(n)/\epsilon)$, whereas the query complexity of $o(1/s(n))$-testing asymmetry (in this case) is at least $\Omega({\sqrt{n/s(n)}})$.

In addition, we show that testing asymmetry in the dense graph model is almost trivial.</div>

<p class="justify-text">Integration by parts is a highlight of any calculus class. It leads to multiple classical applications for integration of logarithms, exponentials, etc., and it is the source of an infinite number of exercises and applications to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions">special functions</a>. In this post, I will look at a classical discrete extension that is useful in machine learning and optimization, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts">Abel transformation</a>, with applications to convergence proofs for the (stochastic) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method">subgradient method</a>. Next month, extensions to higher dimensions will be considered, with applications to score functions [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/hyvarinen05a/hyvarinen05a.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1914309">3</a>] and randomized smoothing [4, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08676">5</a>].</p>



<h2>Abel transformation: from continuous to discrete</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical version of integration by parts goes as follows. Given two continuously differentiable functions from \(\mathbb{R}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\), we have: $$ \int_a^b \!\!\!\!f(x)g'(x) dx = \Big[ f(x) g(x) \Big]_a^b \!-\! \int_a^b\!\!\! \!f'(x) g(x) dx =  f(b) g(b)\, – f(a)g(a)-\! \int_a^b\! \!\!\! f'(x) g(x) dx.$$ This is valid for less regular functions, but this is not the main concern here. The proof follows naturally from the derivative of a product, but there is a nice “proof without words” (see, e.g., [1, p. 42] or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts#Visualization">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">There is a discrete analogue referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts">Abel transformation</a> or summation by parts, where derivatives are replaced by increments: given two real-valued sequences \((a_n)_{n \geq 0}\) and \((b_n)_{n \geq 0}\) (the second sequence could also be taken vector-valued), we can expand $$ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k ( b_k\, – b_{k-1}) =\sum_{k=1}^n a_k  b_k \ – \sum_{k=1}^n a_k  b_{k-1} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \ – \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_{k+1} b_{k},$$ using a simple index increment in the second sum.  Rearranging terms, this leads to $$ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k ( b_k\, – b_{k-1}) = a_n b_n \ – a_0 b_0\  – \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ( a_{k+1} – a_{k } ) b_k.$$ In other words, we can transfer the first-order difference from the sequence \((b_k)_{k \geq 0}\) to the sequence \((a_k)_{k \geq 0}\).  A few remarks:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Warning</strong>! It is very easy/common to make mistakes with indices and signs.</li><li>I gave the direct proof but a proof through explicit integration by part is also possible, by introducing the piecewise-constant function \(f\) equal to \(a_k\) on \([k,k+1)\), and \(g\) continuous  piecewise affine equal to \(b_{k} + (t-k) ( b_{k+1}-b_{k})\) for \(t \in [k,k+1]\), and integrating between \(0+\) and \(n+\). </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">There are classical applications for the convergence of series (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation_by_parts">here</a>), but in this post, I will show how it can lead to an elegant result for stochastic gradient descent for non-smooth functions and <em>decaying</em> step-sizes.</p>



<h2>Decaying step-sizes in stochastic gradient descent</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The Abel summation formula is quite useful when analyzing optimization algorithms, and we give a simple example below. We consider a sequence of random potentially <em>non-smooth</em> convex functions \((f_k)_{k \geq 0}\) which are independent and identically distributed functions from \(\mathbb{R}^d \) to \(\mathbb{R}\), with expectation \(F\). The goal is to find a minimizer \(x_\ast\) of \(F\) over a some convex bounded set \(\mathcal{C}\), only being given access to some stochastic gradients of \(f_k\) at well-chosen points. The most classical example is supervised machine learning, where \(f_k(\theta)\) is the loss of a random observation for the predictor parameterized by \(\theta\).  The difficulty here is the potential non-smoothness of the function \(f_k\) (e.g., for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge_loss">hinge loss</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vector machine</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text">We consider the projected stochastic subgradient descent method. The deterministic version of this method dates back to Naum Shor [6] in 1962 (see nice history <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/documenta/vol-ismp/43_goffin-jean-louis.pdf">here</a>). The method goes as follows: starting from some \(\theta_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d\), we perform the iteration $$ \theta_{k} = \Pi_{ \mathcal{C} } \big( \theta_{k-1} – \gamma_k  \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big),$$ where \(\Pi_{ \mathcal{C}}: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d\) is the orthogonal projection onto the set \(\mathcal{C}\), and \(\nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1})\) is any subgradient of \(f_k\) at \(\theta_{k-1}\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="528" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/gradient_contours_projection-1024x410.png" class="wp-image-4324" height="211" />One step of projected (sub)gradient descent: from a vector \(\theta\), we go down the direction of a negative subgradient \(\nabla f(\theta)\) of the function \(f\) (here typically a random function) and an orthogonal projection is performed to obtain the new vector \(\theta_+\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We make the following standard assumptions: (a) the set \(\mathcal{C}\) is convex and compact with diameter \(\Delta\) (with respect to the \(\ell_2\)-norm), (b) the functions \(f_k\) are almost surely convex and \(B\)-Lipschitz-continuous (or equivalently with gradients bounded in \(\ell_2\)-norm by \(B\)). We denote by \(\theta_\ast\) a minimizer of \(f\) on \(\mathcal{C}\) (there can be multiple ones). </p>



<p class="justify-text">For non-smooth problems, choosing a constant step-size does not lead to an algorithm converging to a global minimizer: decaying step-sizes are then needed.</p>



<h2>Convergence proof through Lyapunov functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Since the functions \(f_k\) are non-smooth, we cannot use Taylor expansions, and we rely on a now classical proof technique dating back from the 1960’s (see, e.g., a <a href="http://www.mathnet.ru/links/5d71a255cae8f1a313ac599b8f20a123/dan33049.pdf">paper</a> by Boris Polyak [7] in Russian), that has led to several extensions in particular for online learning [<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maz/publications/techconvex.pdf">8</a>]. The proof relies on the concept of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_function">Lyapunov functions</a>“, often also referred to as “potential functions”. This is a non-negative function \(V(\theta_k)\) of the iterates \(\theta_k\), that is supposed to go down along iterations (at least in expectation). In optimization, standard Lyapunov functions are \(V(\theta)  = F(\theta)\, – F(\theta_\ast)\) or \(V(\theta) = \| \theta \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">For the subgradient method, we will not be able to show that the Lyapunov function is decreasing, but this will lead through a manipulation which is standard in linear dynamical system analysis to a convergence proof for the averaged iterate: that is, if \(V(\theta_k) \leqslant V(\theta_{k-1})\ – W(\theta_{k-1}) + \varepsilon_k\),  for a certain function \(W\) and extra positive terms \(\varepsilon_k\), then, using telescoping sums, $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n W(\theta_{k-1}) \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \big( V(\theta_0)\ – V(\theta_n) \big) + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \varepsilon_k.$$ We can then either use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">Jensen’s inequality</a> to get a bound on \(W \big( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \theta_{k-1} \big)\), or directly get a bound on \(\min_{k \in \{1,\dots,n\}} W(\theta_{k-1})\). The first solution gives a performance guarantee for a well-defined iterate, while the second solution only shows that among the first \(n-1\) iterates, one of them has a performance guarantee; in the stochastic set-up where latex \(W\) is an expectation, it is not easily possible to know which one, so we will consider only averaging below.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Standard inequality. </strong>We have, by contractivity of orthogonal projections: $$ \|\theta_k \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 =  \big\|  \Pi_{ \mathcal{C} } \big( \theta_{k-1} – \gamma_k   \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big) – \Pi_{ \mathcal{C} } (\theta_\ast)  \big\|_2^2 \leqslant  \big\|   \theta_{k-1} – \gamma_k  \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1}) -\   \theta_\ast  \big\|_2^2.$$ We can then expand the squared Euclidean norm to get: $$ \|\theta_k – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \leqslant  \|\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \ – 2\gamma_k (\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast)^\top \nabla f_k (\theta_{k-1}) + \gamma_k^2 \|  \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1})\|_2^2.$$ The last term is upper-bounded by \(\gamma_k^2 B^2\) because of the regularity assumption on \(f_k\). For the middle term, we use the convexity of \(f_k\), that is,  the function \(f_k\) is greater than its tangent at \(\theta_{k-1}\). See figure below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="513" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tangent_convex-1-1024x440.png" class="wp-image-4331" height="220" />Convex function above its tangent at \(\theta_{k-1}\), leading to the desired inequality.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We then obtain $$ f_k(\theta_\ast) \geqslant f_k(\theta_{k-1}) + \nabla f_k(\theta_{k-1})^\top ( \theta_{\ast} – \theta_{k-1}).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Putting everything together, this leads to $$ \|\theta_k \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \leqslant  \|\theta_{k-1}\  – \theta_\ast\|_2^2 \ – 2\gamma_k  \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \ – f_k(\theta_\ast) \big] + \gamma_k^2 B^2.$$ At this point, except the last term, all terms are random. We can now take expectations, with a particular focus on the term \(\mathbb{E} \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big]\), for which we can use the fact that the random function \(f_k\) is independent from the past, so that $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big] =  \mathbb{E} \Big[  \mathbb{E} \big[ f_k(\theta_{k-1}) \big| f_{1},\dots,f_{k-1}  \big] \Big] =\mathbb{E} \big[   F(\theta_{k-1})   \big] . $$ We thus get $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_k – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] \leqslant  \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big]  – 2\gamma_k \big( \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \big) + \gamma_k^2 B^2.$$ As above, we can now isolate the excess in function values as: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast)  \leqslant \frac{1}{2 \gamma_k} \Big( \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k-1} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] – \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] \Big) + \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2.$$ At this point, the “optimization part” of the proof is done. Only algebraic manipulations are needed to obtain a convergence rate. This is where Abel transformation will come in.</p>



<h2>From fixed horizon to anytime algorithms</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>The lazy way.</strong> At this point, many authors (including me sometimes) will take a constant step-size \(\gamma_k = \gamma\) so as to obtain a telescopic sum, leading to $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2n\gamma}     \Big( \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{0} \ – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] – \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{n}\  – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big] \Big) + \frac{\gamma}{2} B^2,$$ which is less than \(\displaystyle \frac{\Delta^2}{2n \gamma} + \frac{\gamma}{2} B^2\), and minimized for \(\displaystyle \gamma = \frac{ \Delta}{B \sqrt{n}}\), leading to a convergence rate less than \(\displaystyle \frac{ B \Delta}{\sqrt{n}}\). Using Jensen’s inequality, we then get for \(\bar{\theta}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \theta_{k-1}\): $$\mathbb{E} \big[ F(\bar{\theta}_{n}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{ B \Delta}{\sqrt{n}} .$$ This result leads to the desired rate but can be improved in at least one way: the step-size currently has to depend on the “horizon” \(n\) (which has to be known in advance), and the algorithm is not “anytime”, which is not desirable in practice (where one often launches an algorithm and stops it when it the performance gains have plateaued or when the user gets bored waiting).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Non-uniform averaging.</strong> Another way [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/SIOPT_RSA_2009.pdf">9</a>] is to consider the non-uniform average $$ \eta_{k} =   \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_{k} \theta_{k-1}}{\sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_{k}}, $$ for which telescoping sums apply as before, to get $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\eta_k) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{2} \frac{\Delta^2 + B^2 \sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_k^2}{\sum_{k=1}^n \gamma_{k}}.$$  Then, by selecting a decaying step-size \(\displaystyle \gamma_k = \frac{ \Delta}{B \sqrt{k}}\), that depends on the iteration number, we get a rate proportional to \(\displaystyle \frac{ B \Delta}{\sqrt{n}} ( 1 + \log n)\). We now have an anytime algorithm, but we have lost a logarithmic term, which is not the end of the world, but still disappointing. In [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/SIOPT_RSA_2009.pdf">9</a>], “tail-averaging” (only averaging iterates between a constant times \(n\) and \(n\)) is proposed, that removes the logarithmic term but requires to store iterates (moreover, the non-uniform averaging puts too much weight on the first iterates, slowing down convergence).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Using Abel transformation.</strong> If we start to sum inequalities from \(k=1\) to \(k=n\), we get, with \(\delta_k = \mathbb{E} \big[ \|\theta_{k} – \theta_\ast\|_2^2\big]\) (which is always between \(0\) and \(\Delta^2\)): $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast)  \leqslant  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \bigg( \frac{1}{2 \gamma_k} \Big( \delta_{k-1} –  \delta_k \Big)\bigg) +  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2,$$ which can be transformed through Abel transformation into $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}  {\delta_k} \bigg(\frac{1}{ 2\gamma_{k+1}}- \frac{1}{ 2\gamma_{k}} \bigg) + \frac{\delta_0}{2 \gamma_1}- \frac{\delta_t}{2 \gamma_t}+ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2.$$ For decreasing step-size sequences, this leads to $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} {\Delta^2} \bigg(\frac{1}{ 2\gamma_{k+1}}- \frac{1}{ 2\gamma_{k}} \bigg) + \frac{\Delta^2}{2 \gamma_1}+ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2,$$ and thus $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E} \big[ F(\theta_{k-1}) \big] – F(\theta_\ast) \leqslant \frac{\Delta^2 }{2 n \gamma_n} + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\gamma_k}{2} B^2.$$ For \(\gamma_k = \frac{  \Delta}{B \sqrt{k}}\), this leads to an upper bound $$\frac{\Delta B }{2 \sqrt{n}} \big( 1+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\big) \leqslant \frac{3 \Delta B }{2 \sqrt{n}},$$ which is up to a factor \(\frac{3}{2}\) exactly the same bound as with a constant step-size, but now with an anytime algorithm.</p>



<h2>Experiments</h2>



<p class="justify-text">To illustrate the behaviors above, let’s consider minimizing \(\mathbb{E}_x \| x – \theta \|_1\), with respect to \(\theta\), with \(f_k(\theta) = \| x_k- \theta\|_1\), where \(x_k\) is sampled independently from a given distribution (here independent log-normal distributions for each coordinate). The global optimum \(\theta_\ast\) is the per-coordinate median of the distribution of \(x\)’s.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When applying SGD, the chosen subgradient of \(f_k\) has components in \(\{-1,1\}\). Hence in the plots below in two dimensions, the iterates are always on a grid. With a constant step-size: if the \(\gamma\) is too large (right), there are large oscillations, while if \(\gamma\) is too small (left), optimization is too slow. Note that while the SGD iterate with a constant step-size is always oscillating, the averaged iterate converges to some point (which is not the global optimum, and is typically at distance \(O(\gamma)\) away from it [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06386">11</a>]).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="545" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sgd-1.gif" class="wp-image-4339" height="230" />Stochastic gradient descent (averaged or not), with constant step-size. Left: small step-size. Right: large step-size (8 times larger).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">With a decaying step-size (figure below), the initial conditions are forgotten reasonably fast and the iterates converge to the global optimum (and of course, we get an anytime algorithm!).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="310" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sgd_decaying.gif" class="wp-image-4340" height="295" />Stochastic gradient descent (averaged or not), with decreasing step-size.</figure></div>



<p>We can now compare in terms of function values, showing that a constant step-size only works well for a specific range of iteration numbers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="371" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/convergence_proofs.png" class="wp-image-4335" height="276" />Comparison of expected performance for decaying and constant-step sizes. Several constant step-sizes are tested, with uniform spacings in log-scale (hence the the uniform spacings in performance for large \(n\)).</figure></div>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Being able to deal with decaying step-sizes and anytime algorithms is arguably not a major improvement, but quite a satisfactory one, at least to me! Discrete integration by parts is the key enabler here.</p>



<p class="justify-text">There is another rewarding aspect which is totally unrelated to integration by parts: when applied to supervised machine learning, we just obtained from elementary principles (convexity) and few calculations a generalization bound <em>on unseen data</em>, which is as good as regular bounds from statistics [<a href="https://www.esaim-ps.org/articles/ps/pdf/2005/01/ps0420.pdf">10</a>] that use much more complex tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_complexity">Rademacher complexities</a> (but typically no convexity assumptions): here, statistics considered independently from optimization is not only slower (considering the empirical risk and minimizing it using the plain non-stochastic subgradient method would lead to an \(n\) times slower algorithm) but also more difficult to analyze! </p>

In this work, we continue the research started in [HIMS18], where the authors suggested to study the half-duplex communication complexity. Unlike the classical model of communication complexity introduced by Yao, in the half-duplex model, Alice and Bob can speak or listen simultaneously, as if they were talking using a walkie-talkie. The motivation for such a communication model comes from the study of the KRW conjecture. Following the open questions formulated in [HIMS18], we prove lower bounds for the disjointness function in all variants of half-duplex models and an upper bound in the half-duplex model with zero, that separates disjointness from the inner product function in this setting. Next, we prove lower and upper bounds on the half-duplex complexity of the Karchmer-Wigderson games for the counting functions and for the recursive majority function, adapting the ideas used in the classical communication complexity. Finally, we define the non-deterministic half-duplex complexity and establish bounds connecting it with non-deterministic complexity in the classical model.</div>

<p>We hope you’re all staying safe and healthy! To bring you some news (and distraction?) during this… atypical summer,here are the recent papers on property testing and sublinear algorithms we saw appear this month. Graphs, probability distributions, functions… there is a something for everyone.</p>



<p><strong>On Testing Hamiltonicity in the Bounded Degree Graph Model,</strong> by Oded Goldreich (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/109/">ECCC</a>). The title sort of gives it away: this relatively short paper shows that testing whether an unknown bounded-degree graph has a Hamiltonian path (or Hamiltonian cycle) in the bounded-degree model requires a number of queries linear in \(n\), the number of nodes. The results also hold for directed graphs (with respect to directed Hamiltonian path or cycle), and are shown via a local reduction to a promise problem of satisfiability of 3CNF formulae. Also included: a complete proof of the linear lower bound for another problem, Independent Set Size; and an open problem: <em>what is the query complexity of testing graph isomorphism in the bounded-degree model?</em></p>



<p><strong>Local Access to Sparse Connected Subgraphs Via Edge Sampling</strong>, by Rogers Epstein (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.05523">arXiv</a>). Given access to a connected graph \(G=(V,E)\), can we efficiently provide access to some <em>sparse</em> connected subgraph \(G’=(V,E’)\subseteq G\) with \(|E’|\ll |E|\)? This question, well-studied in particular for the case where \(G\) had bounded degree and the goal is to achieve \(|E’|\leq (1-\varepsilon)|V|\), is the focus of this paper which provides a trade-off between the query complexity of the oracle and \(|E’|\). Specifically, for every parameter \(T\), one can give oracle access to \(G’\) with \(|E’|=O(|V|T)\), with a query complexity \(=\tilde{O}(|E|/T)\). </p>



<p>Switching gears, we move from graphs to probability distributions:</p>



<p><strong>Tolerant Distribution Testing in the Conditional Sampling Model</strong>, by Shyam Narayanan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09895">arXiv</a>). In the conditional sampling model for distribution testing, which we have covered a few times on this blog, the algorithm at each step gets to specify a subset \(S\) of the domain, and observe a sample from the distribution <em>conditioned on \(S\).</em> As it turns out, this can speed things up a <strong>lot</strong>: as Canonne, Ron, and Servedio (2015) showed, even tolerant uniformity testing, which with i.i.d. samples requires a near-linear (in the domain size \(n\)) number of samples, can be done in a <em>constant</em> number of conditional queries. Well, sort of constant: no dependence on \(n\), but the dependence on the distance parameter \(\varepsilon\) was, in CRS15, quite bad: \(\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^{20})\).  This work gets rid of this badness, and shows the (nearly) optimal \(\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^{2})\) query complexity! Among other results, it also generalizes it to tolerant identity testing  (\(\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^{4})\)), for which previously no constant-query upper bound was known. Things have become <em>truly</em> sublinear.</p>



<p>I<strong>nteractive Inference under Information Constraints</strong>, by Jayadev Acharya, Clément Canonne, Yuhan Liu, Ziteng Sun, and Himanshu Tyagi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10976">arXiv</a>). Say you want to do uniformity/identity testing (or learn, but let’s focus on testing) on a discrete distribution, but you can’t actually observe the i.i.d. samples: instead, you can only do some sort of limited, “local” measurement on each sample. How hard is the task, compared to what you’d do if you fully had the samples? This setting, which captures things like distributed testing with communication or local privacy constraints, erasure channels, etc., was well-understood from previous recent work in the <em>non-adaptive</em> setting. But what if the “measurements” could be made <em>adaptively</em>? This paper shows general lower bounds for identity testing and learning, as a function of the type of local measurement allowed: as a corollary, this gives tight bounds for communication constraints and local privacy, and shows the first separation between adaptive and non-adaptive uniformity testing, for a type of “leaky” membership query measurement.</p>



<p><strong>Efficient Parameter Estimation of</strong> <strong>Truncated Boolean Product Distributions</strong>, by Dimitris Fotakis, Alkis Kalavasis, and Christos Tzamos (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02392">arXiv</a>). Suppose there is a fixed and unknown subset \(S\) of the hypercube, a “truncation” set, which you can only accessible via membership query; and you receive i.i.d. samples from an unknown product distribution on the hypercube, <em>truncated</em> on that set \(S\) (for instance, because your polling strategy or experimental measurements have limitations). Can you still learn that distribution efficiently? Can you test it for various properties, as you typically really would like to? (or is it just me?) This paper identifies some natural sufficient condition on \(S\), which they call <em>fatness</em>, under which the answer is a resounding <em>yes</em>. Specifically, if \(S\) satisfies this condition, one can actually generate honest-to-goodness i.i.d. samples (non-truncated) from the true distribution, given truncated samples! </p>



<p>Leaving distribution testing, our last paper is on testing functions in the <em>distribution-free</em> model:</p>



<p><strong>Downsampling for Testing and Learning in Product Distributions,</strong> by Nathaniel Harms and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07449">arXiv</a>). Suppose you want to test (or learn) a class of Boolean functions \(\mathcal{C}\) over some domain \(\Omega^n\), with respect to some (unknown) product distribution (i.e., in the distribution-free testing model, or PAC-learning model). This paper develops a general technique, downsampling, which allows one to reduce such distribution-free testing of \(\mathcal{C}\) under a product distribution to testing \(\mathcal{C}\) over \([r]^d\) under the <em>uniform</em> distribution, for a suitable parameter \(r=r(d,\varepsilon,\mathcal{C})\). This allows the authors, among many other things and learning results, to easily re-establish (and, in the second case, improve upon) recent results on testing of monotonicity over \([n]^d\) (uniform distribution) and over \(\mathbb{R}^d\) (distribution-free). </p></div>

Zachary Chase is a graduate student of Ben Green at Oxford. Chase has already solved a number of interesting problems–check his <a href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~chase/">site</a> for more details. His advisor is famous for his brilliant work—especially in additive combinatorics. One example is his joint work with Terence Tao <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-Tao_theorem">proving</a> this amazing statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
Today we wish to report Chase’s new <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12097.pdf">paper</a> on a problem we have twice discussed before. </p>
<p>
But first Ken wants to say something about Oxford where he got his degree long before Green arrived. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Oxford Making Waves </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Green moved to Oxford in 2013. He holds a professorship associated to Magdalen College. I (Ken) did not know him when I started at Oxford in 1981. It would have been hard, as Green was only 4 years old at the time. But I did know the preteen Ruth Lawrence when she started there and even once played a departmental croquet match including her in which Bryan Birch made some epic long shots. Lawrence had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Lawrence">joined</a> St. Hugh’s College in 1983 at the age of twelve.</p>
<p>
Oxford has been Dick’s and my mind more in the past six years than before. Both of us were guests of Joël Ouaknine in 2012–2015 when he was there. Oxford has developed a front-line group in quantum computation, which fits as David Deutsch’s role as an originator began from there—note my story in the middle of this recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/01/15/halting-is-poly-time-quantum-provable/">post</a>.</p>
<p>
Recently Oxford has been in the <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/20/study-provides-first-glimpse-of-efficacy-of-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine/">news</a> for developing a promising Covid-19 vaccine. <a href="https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/vaccines/chadox1-mers-coronavirus-vaccine">ChAdOx1</a> heads Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine#Vaccine_candidates">list</a> of candidate vaccines and has gone to final <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/oxford-vaccine-enters-final-phase-of-covid-19-trials-in-brazil-cvd/">trials</a>, though there is still a long evaluation process before approval for general use.</p>
<p>
Before that, a modeling <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/03/oxford-study-coronavirus-may-have-infected-half-of-u-k.html">study</a> from Oxford in March raised the question of whether many more people have had Covid-19 without symptoms or any knowledge. This kind of possibility has since been <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/karl-friston-on-immunological-dark-matter.html">likened</a> to a “dark matter” hypothesis, not just now regarding Covid-19 but a decade <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21839767/">ago</a> and before. </p>
<p>
A main <a href="https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-techniques-from-physics-promise-better-covid-19-models-can-they-deliver-139925">supporting</a> <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Coronavirus-techniques-from-physics-promise-better-COVID-19-models-can-they-deliver">argument</a> is that a wide class of mathematical models can be fitted with higher relative likelihood if the hypothesis is true. I have wanted to take time to evaluate this argument amid the wider backdrop of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/05/19/lost-in-complexity/">controversy</a> over inference methods in physics, but online chess with unfortunately ramped-up frequency of cheating has filled up all disposable time and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Back to Chase’s new results on the following problem: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Given two distinct binary strings of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> there is always a finite state deterministic automaton (FSA) that accepts one and rejects the other. <i>How few states can such a machine have?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This is called the <em>separating words problem</em> (SWP). Here we consider it for binary strings only.</p>
<p>
John Robson proved <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B2%2F5%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^{2/5})}" class="latex" title="{O(n^{2/5})}" /> states are enough—we suppress any log factors. Some like to write this as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E%7B2%2F5%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde{O}(n^{2/5})}" class="latex" title="{\tilde{O}(n^{2/5})}" />. Chase <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12097.pdf">improves</a> this to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}" class="latex" title="{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}" />:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em><a name="Chasethm"></a> For any distinct <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y \in \{0,1\}^{n}}" class="latex" title="{x,y \in \{0,1\}^{n}}" />, there is a finite state deterministic automaton with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D+%5Clog%5E%7B7%7D+n%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^{1/3} \log^{7} n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^{1/3} \log^{7} n)}" /> states that accepts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> but not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We previously discussed this twice at GLL. We discussed the background and early results <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/08/separating-words-by-automata/">here</a>. The original problem is due to Pavel Goralcik and Vaclav Koubek. They proved an upper bound that was <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{o(n)}" class="latex" title="{o(n)}" />. Then we went over Robson’s bound <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/separating-words-decoding-a-paper/">here</a>. The best upper bound was Robson’s result until Chase came along.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Approach </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
All the approaches to SWP seem to have a common thread. They find some family of “hash” functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{h}" class="latex" title="{h}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> can be computed by a FSA with few states. <p></p>
</li><li>
For any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cneq+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x \neq y}" class="latex" title="{x \neq y}" /> binary strings of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />, there is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh+%5Cin+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{h \in H}" class="latex" title="{h \in H}" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%28x%29+%5Cneq+h%28y%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{h(x) \neq h(y)}" class="latex" title="{h(x) \neq h(y)}" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
The challenge is to find clever families that can do do both. Be easy to compute and also be able to tell strings apart. Actually this is only a coarse outline—Chase’s situation is a bit more complicated. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Proof </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We have taken the statement of Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#Chasethm">2</a> verbatim from the paper. It has a common pecadillo of beginning a sentence for a specific <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> but writing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Ccdots+n+%5Ccdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\cdots n \cdots)}" class="latex" title="{O(\cdots n \cdots)}" /> later. However, this is how we think intuitively: in terms of how the pieces of the formula behave. Chase declares right away his intent to ignore the power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log n}" class="latex" title="{\log n}" />. How he gets the power <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/3}" class="latex" title="{1/3}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is the real point. We can convey the intuition in brief.</p>
<p>
A length-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> binary string can be identified with its set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubseteq+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A \subseteq [n]}" class="latex" title="{A \subseteq [n]}" /> of positions where the string has a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. Chase begins by showing how a power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/2}" class="latex" title="{1/2}" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is obtainable by considering sets of the form </p>

<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> is prime and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi+%3C+p%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i &lt; p}" class="latex" title="{i &lt; p}" />.

<p>Then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> of magnitude about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log n}" class="latex" title="{\log n}" /> such that </p>

<p>Now we can make a finite automaton <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_%7BA%2CB%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M_{A,B}}" class="latex" title="{M_{A,B}}" /> with states <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28j%2C%5Cell%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(j,\ell)}" class="latex" title="{(j,\ell)}" /> that always increments <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" /> modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> and increments <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell}" class="latex" title="{\ell}" /> modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> each time it reads a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+%5Cequiv+i+%5Cpmod%7Bp%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j \equiv i \pmod{p}}" class="latex" title="{j \equiv i \pmod{p}}" />.

Again we ignore the pecadillo but we add some redundant words to the statement in the paper between dashes:</p>

<p></p><p>

The first is that we don’t have to limit attention to sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A,B}" class="latex" title="{A,B}" /> that come from places where the corresponding strings <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y}" class="latex" title="{x,y}" /> have a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />.

Then we can try to prove results of the following form given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m &lt; n}" class="latex" title="{m &lt; n}" />:</p>

A finite automaton using this extension needs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> states to store <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{w}" class="latex" title="{w}" /> in its finite control. The second lever is to try to prove results of this form, where now the words “of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" />” are not redundant:</p>

<p></p><p>
Now we need to balance the levers using the proposition and the lemma together.  Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{w}" class="latex" title="{w}" /> will add order-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> states to the automaton, we balance it against <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> from the previous argument.  So take <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m = n^{1/3}}" class="latex" title="{m = n^{1/3}}" />. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bn%7D%7Bm%7D+%5Capprox+n%5E%7B2%2F3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N = \frac{n}{m} \approx n^{2/3}}" class="latex" title="{N = \frac{n}{m} \approx n^{2/3}}" />. Lemma <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#conjlemma">5</a> then gives the bound </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++k+%3D+%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28N%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%29+%3D+%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  k = \tilde{O}(N^{1/2}) = \tilde{O}(n^{1/3}) " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  k = \tilde{O}(N^{1/2}) = \tilde{O}(n^{1/3}) " /></p>
<p>on the magnitude of the needed primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />. This yields the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E%7B1%2F3%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}" class="latex" title="{\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})}" /> breakthrough on SWP.</p>
<p></p><p>
Here a famous New Yorker <a href="https://www.allposters.com/-sp/Oh-if-only-it-were-so-simple-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Posters_i9168200_.htm?UPI=PGQEG50&amp;PODConfigID=8419447&amp;sOrigID=169338">cartoon</a> with the caption “If only it were so simple” comes to mind.  But there is a catch. Chase is not quite able to prove lemma <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#conjlemma">5</a>. However, the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{w}" class="latex" title="{w}" /> lever comes with extra flexibility that enables finding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{w}" class="latex" title="{w}" /> that make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA_w+%5Cneq+B_w%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A_w \neq B_w}" class="latex" title="{A_w \neq B_w}" /> and also give those sets an extra regularity property <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />. Using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, he is able to show the existence of good hash functions of a certain type. The modified lemma is enough to prove his new bound.  The proof still uses intricate analysis including integrals.</p>
<p>
This is classic high-power mathematics. When some idea is blocked, try to weaken the requirements. Sometimes it is possible to still proceed. It is a lesson that we sometimes forget, but a valuable one nevertheless.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We like the SWP and think Chase’s contribution is impressive. Note that it adds a third element <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bw%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{w}" class="latex" title="{w}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> in the automaton.  Can the argument be pushed further by finding more levers to add more elements?  Is Lemma 5 true as stated, and with what (other) tradeoffs of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> between it and Proposition 4?  [<b>Update</b>: not for extreme tradeoffs—see this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/08/03/cleverer-automata-exist/#comment-111915">comment</a>—but plausibly for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%2Cn%2CN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m,n,N}" class="latex" title="{m,n,N}" /> polynomially related.]</p>
<p>
We feel there could also be interesting applications for his theorem as it stands. Is the ability to tell two strings apart with a simple device—a FSA with not many states—useful? Could it solve some open problem? It does seem like a basic insight, yet we have no candidate application. Perhaps you have an idea. </p>

<br />
When teaching discrete math a while back I told the following story which some had already heard in High School: <br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>When Gauss was in 1st grade the class was being bad. So the teacher made them sit down and add up the numbers from 1 to 100. Gauss did it in 2 minutes by noting that if S was the answer then </i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>2S = (100+1) +(99+2) + ... + (1 + 100) = 100*101</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>So S = 50*101.  Then he went to Google and typed in 50*101 for the answer.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
The class laughed because of course the last part about Google was false. But I then told them that the entire story was false and showed them the following slides:  <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/gaussstory.pdf">here</a>  Take a look at them (there are only 4 of them) before reading on.<div><br /></div><div>(ADDED LATER: here is an article by Brian Hayes that documents the history of the story.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/AmSci-2006-05-Hayes-Gauss.pdf" target="_blank">http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/AmSci-2006-05-Hayes-Gauss.pdf</a></div><div><br /></div><div>)<br />
<br />
<br />
So I told them the Gauss Story was false (I am right about this) and then told them a lie- that the story's progression over time was orderly. I then told them that that was false (hmmm- actually I might not of, oh well).<br />
<br />
One of my students emailed me this semester<br />
<br />
<i>Dr Gasarch- one of my Math professors is telling the Gauss story as if its true! You should make a public service announcement and tell people its false!</i><div><i><br /></i></div><div>I do not think this is needed. I also don't know how one goes about making a public service announcement  I also  suspect the teacher knew it was false but told it anyway.<div>
<br />
OKAY- what do you do if you have a nice story that has some good MATH in it but  its not true?<br />
<br /><b>Options:</b></div><div><br /></div><div>Tell it and let the students think its true.</div><div><br /></div><div>Tell it and debunk it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Tell it and debunk it and tell another myth</div><div><br /></div><div>Tell it and debunk it and tell another myth and then debunk that</div><div><br /></div><div>Ask your readers what they would do. Which I do now: What do you do? <br /><br /></div></div></div></div>

<div class="content">
<p>The last of my CCCG 2020 papers is now on the arXiv: “New Results in Sona Drawing: Hardness and TSP Separation”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15784">arXiv:2007.15784</a>, with Chiu, Demaine, Diomidov, Hearn, Hesterberg, Korman, Parada, and Rudoy. (As you might infer from the long list of coauthors, it’s a Barbados workshop paper.) The paper studies a mathematical formalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusona">lusona</a> drawings of southwest Africa; in this formalization, a sona curve for a given set of points is a curve that can be drawn in a single motion, intersecting itself only at simple crossings, and surrounding each given point in a separate region of the plane, with no empty regions. The paper proves that it’s hard to find the shortest one, hard even to find whether one exists when restricted to grid edges, and gives tighter bounds for the widest possible ratio between sona curve length and TSP tour length; see the preprint or <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/22/three-cccg-videos.html">the video I already posted</a> for more information.</p>

<p>To save this post from being content-free, here’s a research question that we didn’t even state in the paper, let alone make any progress on solving: just how many of these curves can a given set of points have? A sona curve can be described as a 4-regular plane multigraph (satisfying certain extra conditions) together with an assignment of the given points to its bounded faces, so there are finitely many of these things up to some sort of topological equivalence. And because this is topological it shouldn’t matter where the points are placed in the plane: the number of curves should be a function only of the number of points. I tried hand-enumerating the curves for up to three points but it was already messy and I’m not certain I got them all. (In an earlier version of this post I definitely didn’t get them all — I had to update the figure below after finding more.) Here are the ones I found:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/sona-enum.svg" alt="Sona curves for up to three points" /></p>

<p>If this hand enumeration is correct, then the numbers of sona curves for \(n\) labeled points form an integer sequence beginning \(1, 3, 24,\dots\) and the numbers for unlabeled points form a sequence beginning \(1, 2, 5,\dots\) but I don’t really know anything more than that for this problem.</p>

<p>Another research direction I don’t know much about yet: given a topological equivalence class of sona drawings, how can we find a good layout for it as an explicit drawing? There’s lots of research on drawing plane graphs nicely but it’s not clear how much of it carries over to making nice sona curves.</p>

<div class="content">
In this paper, we propose a new conjecture, the XOR-KRW conjecture, which is a relaxation of the Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson conjecture [KRW95]. This relaxation is still strong enough to imply $\mathbf{P} \not\subseteq \mathbf{NC}^1$ if proven. We also present a weaker version of this conjecture that might be used for breaking $n^3$ lower bound for De~Morgan formulas. Our study of this conjecture allows us to partially answer an open question stated in [GMWW17] regarding the composition of the universal relation with a function. To be more precise, we prove that there exists a function $g$ such that the composition of the universal relation with $g$ is significantly harder than just a universal relation. The fact that we can only prove the existence of $g$ is an inherent feature of our approach.
    
The paper's main technical contribution is a method of converting lower bounds for multiplexer-type relations into lower bounds against functions. In order to do this, we develop techniques to lower bound communication complexity using reductions from non-deterministic communication complexity and non-classical models: half-duplex and partially half-duplex communication models.</div>

<p>Today we talk about the paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16834">Proof of Tomaszewski’s Conjecture on Randomly Signed Sums</a>, by Nathan Keller and Ohad Klein.</p>
<p>Consider a unit vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D%28a_1%2Ca_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+a_n%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a=(a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n)." class="latex" title="a=(a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n)." /> That is latex \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2=1$. Consider all (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2^n" class="latex" title="2^n" />) signed sums <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cepsilon_1a_1%2B%5Cepsilon_2a_2%2B%5Ccdots+%2B%5Cepsilon_n+a_n%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \epsilon_1a_1+\epsilon_2a_2+\cdots +\epsilon_n a_n, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle \epsilon_1a_1+\epsilon_2a_2+\cdots +\epsilon_n a_n, " /> where each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\epsilon_k" class="latex" title="\epsilon_k" /> is either 1 or -1.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (Keller and Klein (2020) asked by Boguslav Tomaszewski (1986)): </strong>For at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2^{n-1}" class="latex" title="2^{n-1}" /> signed sums <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%7C%5Cepsilon_1a_1%2B%5Cepsilon_2a_2%2B%5Ccdots+%2B%5Cepsilon_n+a_n%7C+%5Cle+1+.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle |\epsilon_1a_1+\epsilon_2a_2+\cdots +\epsilon_n a_n| \le 1 ." class="latex" title="\displaystyle |\epsilon_1a_1+\epsilon_2a_2+\cdots +\epsilon_n a_n| \le 1 ." /></p>
<p>Another way to state the theorem is that the probability of a signed sum to be in the interval [-1, 1] is at least 1/2.</p>
<p>To see that this is best possible consider the case that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n=2" class="latex" title="n=2" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ca_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,a_2" class="latex" title="a_1,a_2" /> be non zero. For the sum in question to exceed one we need both summands to have the same sign which happens half of the times. There is another example of importance, the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac {1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})" class="latex" title="(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac {1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})" />. Here 3/8 of the absolute values of signed sums (6 out of 16) are below 1 (in fact, equal to zero), 1/2 equal to 1 and 1/8 exceed 1. Holzman and Kleitman proved in 1992 that the fraction of absolute values of signed sums below 1 is always at least 3/8.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Nathan and Ohad. I will say a little more about the problem below but before that, a few more things.</p>
<h3>A few more things</h3>
<p>Luca Trevisan posted on his blog In Theory a post “Silver linings” about two cheerful pieces of news. The first one is “Karlin, Klein, and Oveis Gharan have just <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01409">posted a paper</a> in which, at long last, they improve over the 1.5 approximation ratio for metric TSP which was achieved, in 1974, by Christofides.”</p>
<p>The second  one is about breaking the logarithmic barrier for Roth’s theorem that we wrote about here. This was also discussed by Bill <a>Gasarch </a>on Computational Complexity. In the comment section of my post there is an interesting discussion regarding timetable for future achievements and how surprising they would be.</p>
<p>The third is about Ron Graham, a friend and a mathematical giant who passed away a few days ago. Here is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fan.chung.9/posts/10220086655131549">moving post</a> by Fan Chung, <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/ron/">a web page for Ron</a> set by Fan, and a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/07/10/ron-graham-1935-2020/">blog post by Dick and Ken on GLL</a>.</p>
<p>The fourth is that there is a nice collection of open problems on Boolean functions that is cited in the paper of Nathan and Ohad:  Y. Filmus, H. Hatami, S. Heilman, E. Mossel, R. O’Donnell, S. Sachdeva, A. Wan, and K. Wimmer, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/openprobsmerged.pdf">Real analysis in computer science: A collection of open problems</a>.</p>
<p>The fifth is that both our (HUJI) combinatorics seminar and basic notions seminar are running and are recorded. Here are the links. (Hmm, the links are not yet available, I will update.)</p>
<h2>Back to the result of Keller and Klein</h2>
<h3><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/dkrh2.png"><img width="640" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/dkrh2.png?w=640&amp;h=365" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20034" height="365" /></a></h3>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Daniel Kleitman and Ron Holzman</span></p>
<h3>A quick orientation</h3>
<p>If the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_i" class="latex" title="a_i" />s are all the same, or small, or random, then to compute the probability that the weighted sum is between -1 and 1, we can use some Gaussian approximation and then we will find ourselves in a clash of constants that goes our way. The probability will be close to a constant well above 1/2. So what we need to understand is the case where some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_i" class="latex" title="a_i" />s are large.</p>
<h3>Early papers on the problem</h3>
<p>The problem first appeared in the American Math Monthly.  Richard Guy <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~miller/res/fun-problem.pdf">collected several problems  and challenged the readers Any Answers Anent These Analytical Enigmas?</a> (I don’t know what the fate of the other questions is.)  Holzman and Kleitman <a href="https://holzman.technion.ac.il/files/2012/09/combsigns.pdf">proved in 1992</a> that the fraction of absolute values of signed sums below 1 is always at least 3/8, and this is tight. For many years, 3/8 was the record for the original problem, until  the 2017 paper by Ravi Boppana and Ron Holzman: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00350">Tomaszewski’s problem on randomly signed sums: Breaking the 3/8 barrier</a>, where a lower bound of 0.406, was proved. The current record 0f 0.46 was proved in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05031">Improved Bound for Tomaszewski’s Problem</a> by Vojtěch Dvořák, Peter van Hintum, and Marius Tiba. The new definite result by Nathan and Ohad used some ideas of these early papers.</p>
<h3>What is the crux of matters</h3>
<p>Let me quote what the authors kindly wrote me:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The crux of the matter is how to deal with the case of very large coefficients (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ba_2%3E1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1+a_2&gt;1" class="latex" title="a_1+a_2&gt;1" />). We gave a short semi-inductive argument covering this case (this is Section 5 of the paper). The argument is only semi-inductive, as it requires the full assertion of Tomaszewski for any n'&lt;n, and gives only the case (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ba_2%3E1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1+a_2&gt;1" class="latex" title="a_1+a_2&gt;1" />) for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />. But this means that if we can handle all other cases by other methods then we will be done.</em></p>
<p><em>The semi-inductive argument takes only 3 pages. Handling the other cases takes 72 more pages and requires several new tools, but is closer to things that were done in previous works. (Actually, after we found the 3-page argument, we were quite sure we will be able to finalize the proof; this indeed happened, but took a year).”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Most of the paper deals with the case of small coefficients. This requires several ideas and new tools.</p>
<h3>Rademacher sums: Improved Berry-Esseen and local tail inequalities</h3>
<p>If all coefficients are “sufficiently small”, then we can<br />
approximate X by a Gaussian and the inequality should follow. However, using the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry%E2%80%93Esseen_theorem">Berry-Esseen bound</a>, this holds only if all coefficients are less than 0.16.<br />
Nathan and Ohad showed that for Rademacher sums, namely random variables of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X%3D%5Csum+a_i+x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X=\sum a_i x_i" class="latex" title="X=\sum a_i x_i" />, as discussed in the conjecture, a stronger Berry-Esseen<br />
bound can be obtained, and this bound shows immediately that Tomaszewski’s assertion holds whenever all coefficients are less than 0.31. The stronger bound stems<br />
from a method of Prawitz, presented in the 1972 paper. H. Prawitz, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03461238.1972.10404645">Limits for a distribution, if the characteristic function is given in a finite domain</a>, which appeared in the Scandinavian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Actuarial</span> journal.</p>
<p>The second tool is local tail inequalities for Rademacher sums, of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr%5Ba%3CX%3Cb%5D+%5Cleq+%5CPr%5Bc%3CX%3Cd%5D%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Pr[a&lt;X&lt;b] \leq \Pr[c&lt;X&lt;d]," class="latex" title="\Pr[a&lt;X&lt;b] \leq \Pr[c&lt;X&lt;d]," /> where <em>a,b,c,d</em> satisfy certain conditions. Inequalities of this kind were obtained before by Devroye and Lugosi in the 2008 paper:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1686">Local tail bounds for functions of independent random variables</a>.</p>
<p>These local tail inequalities already have some other applications, e.g., to analysis of Boolean functions. They were developed and applied in an earlier paper paper of Keller and Klein: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07429">Biased halfspaces, noise sensitivity, and relative Chernoff inequalities</a>. Let me mention my related MO question <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/85835/a-variance-tail-description-for-continuous-probability-distributions">A variance tail description for continuous probability distributions.</a></p>
<h3>A couple more ingredients</h3>
<p><strong>A  stopping time argument.</strong> Variants of Tomaszewski’s problem appeared in various fields. The problem was stated independently in a 2002 paper by Ben-Tal, Nemirovski, Roos, <a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/SIOPT_RQP_2002.pdf">Robust solutions of uncertain quadratic and conic-quadratic problems.</a>  A stopping time argument introduced there (for proving a lower bound of 1/3) played a crucial role in subsequent works and the critical semi-inductive argument by Nathan and Ohad.</p>
<p><strong>Refinements of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev%27s_inequality">Chebyshev’s inequality</a>.</strong>  (Did you know Chebyshev’s full name? Ans: Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev.)</p>

<h3>Questions and connections that come to mind</h3>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong> What can be said about families <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ccal+F&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\cal F" class="latex" title="\cal F" /> of signs that can serve as those signs for which  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7C%5Cepsilon_1a_1%2B%5Cepsilon_2a_2%2B%5Ccdots+%2B%5Cepsilon_n+a_n%7C+%5Cle+1+%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="|\epsilon_1a_1+\epsilon_2a_2+\cdots +\epsilon_n a_n| \le 1 ," class="latex" title="|\epsilon_1a_1+\epsilon_2a_2+\cdots +\epsilon_n a_n| \le 1 ," /> for some vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a" class="latex" title="a" />.</p>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong> What can be said about the complex version or even more generally about high dimensions?</p>
<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Are there any relations to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1971442?seq=1">Littlewood-Offord type problems</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Q4:</strong> Is there any relation to the <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-s096-topics-in-mathematics-of-data-science-fall-2015/projects/MIT18_S096F15_Open0.1.pdf">Komlos Conjecture</a>?</p>

The Busy Beaver function, with its incomprehensibly rapid growth, has captivated generations of computer scientists, mathematicians, and hobbyists. In this survey, I offer a personal view of the BB function 58 years after its introduction, emphasizing lesser-known insights, recent progress, and especially favorite open problems. Examples of such problems include: when does the BB function first exceed the Ackermann function? Is the value of BB(20) independent of set theory? Can we prove that BB(n+1)&gt;2^BB(n) for large enough n? Given BB(n), how many advice bits are needed to compute BB(n+1)? Do all Busy Beavers halt on all inputs, not just the 0 input? Is it decidable, given n, whether BB(n) is even or odd?</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>My newest arXiv preprint is “Acutely triangulated, stacked, and very ununfoldable polyhedra” with Erik and Martin Demaine (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14525">arXiv:2007.14525</a>). It’s about polyhedra with acute-triangle faces that cannot be unfolded without cutting their surface into many separate polygons. I <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/07/22/three-cccg-videos.html">already posted a video for the paper</a> so see that for more information.</p>

<p>Instead, I thought I’d go into a little more detail about a throwaway remark in the video and the paper (one that I already got an email query about). It says that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_polyhedron">ideal hyperbolic polyhedra</a> can always be unfolded (into the hyperbolic plane). These polyhedra are the hyperbolic convex hulls of finitely many limit points of the hyperbolic space; their faces are ideal polygons, glued together along entire hyperbolic lines. More strongly, if you cut an ideal polyhedron along any spanning tree of its vertices and edges, the result always unfolds into a convex ideal hyperbolic polygon. Here, for instance, is a net for an ideal cube:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ideal-cube-net.svg" alt="Net for an ideal cube" /></p>

<p>I don’t know of a previous reference for this result, and the paper and video state it without proof (because it’s an introductory remark and not the topic of the paper), but it’s easy to prove a stronger statement by induction: any collection of ideal hyperbolic polygons (like the faces of an ideal polyhedron), when connected edge-to-edge in a complex with the connectivity of a tree (like the faces of any convex polyhedron when you cut it along a spanning tree), unfolds to an ideal convex polygon. As a base case, when you have one polygon in your collection, it unfolds to itself. When you have more than one, find a leaf polygon of the tree structure, remove it, and unfold the rest into a convex ideal polygon. Now add back the leaf. It needs to be connected to the rest of the complex along a hyperbolic line, which (by the induction hypothesis that the rest unfolds convexly) has the rest of the complex on one side and an empty hyperbolic halfplane on the other side. Any convex ideal polygon can be placed within this halfplane so that the side on which it should be glued matches up with the boundary line of the halfplane, with enough freedom to match up the points along this line that should be matched up.</p>

<p>This caused me to wonder: which Euclidean convex polyhedra have the same property, that cutting them along any spanning tree leads to a convex unfolding? The answer is: not very many. By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_theorem_on_total_angular_defect">Descartes’ theorem on total angular defect</a>, the angular defects at the vertices of a convex polyhedron add up to \(4\pi\). If a polyhedron is to have all spanning trees produce a (weakly) convex unfolding, then each vertex has to have angular defect at least \(\pi\), because otherwise cutting along a spanning tree that has a leaf at that vertex will make an unfolding that is non-convex at that vertex. And this is the only thing that can go wrong, because if all angular defects are at least \(\pi\) then the unfolding will be convex at each of its vertices and cannot self-overlap.</p>

<p>So to answer the question about Euclidean polyhedra with all unfoldings convex, we need only look for ways to partition the total angular defect of \(4\pi\) among some set of vertices so that each one gets at least \(\pi\). If we know the defects of all the vertices and the distances between vertices, then by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandrov%27s_uniqueness_theorem">Alexandrov’s uniqueness theorem</a> the shape of the polyhedron will be determined. Since we’re using Alexandrov, we should also consider a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedron">dihedron</a> (two mirror-image convex faces glued at their edges) to be a special case of a polyhedron. This leaves, as the only cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A triangular dihedron based on a right or acute triangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A rectangular dihedron.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A tetrahedron with angular defect exactly \(\pi\) at each vertex.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/convex-unfoldings.svg" alt="Convex unfoldings of dihedra and a disphenoid" /></p>

<p>The unfoldings of the dihedra have two copies of their face, mirrored across a joining edge. The tetrahedra with all-convex unfoldings are exactly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disphenoid">disphenoids</a>, the tetrahedra whose four faces are congruent. They unfold either to a copy of the same face shape,
expanded by a factor of two in each dimension and creased into four copies along its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_triangle">medial triangle</a>, or a parallelogram, creased to form a strip of four congruent triangles. Their unfoldings were discussed by Jin Akiyama in his paper “Tile-makers and semi-tile-makers” (<em>American Mathematical Monthly</em> 2007, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00029890.2007.11920450">doi:10.1080/00029890.2007.11920450</a>, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27642275">jstor:27642275</a>), as part of a broader investigation of polyhedra whose every unfolding tiles the plane.</p>

The disjointness problem - where Alice and Bob are given two subsets of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ and they have to check if their sets intersect - is a central problem in the world of communication complexity. While both deterministic and randomized communication complexities for this problem are known to be $\Theta(n)$, it is also known that if the sets are assumed to be drawn from some restricted set systems then the communication complexity can be much lower. In this work, we explore how communication complexity measures change with respect to the complexity of the underlying set system. The complexity measure for the set system that we use in this work is the Vapnik–Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. More precisely, on any set system with VC dimension bounded by $d$, we analyze how large can the deterministic and randomized communication complexities be, as a function of $d$ and $n$.  The $d$-sparse set disjointness problem, where the sets have size at most $d$, is one such set system with VC dimension $d$. The deterministic and the randomized communication complexities of the $d$-sparse set disjointness problem have been well studied and is known to be $\Theta \left( d \log \left({n}/{d}\right)\right)$ and $\Theta(d)$, respectively, in the multi-round communication setting. In this paper, we address the question of whether the randomized communication complexity is always upper bounded by a function of the VC dimension of the set system, and does there always exist a gap between the deterministic and randomized communication complexity for set systems with small VC dimension. 

In this paper, we construct two natural set systems of VC dimension $d$, motivated from geometry. Using these set systems we show that the deterministic and randomized communication complexity can be $\widetilde{\Theta}\left(d\log \left( n/d \right)\right)$ for set systems of VC dimension $d$ and this matches the deterministic upper bound for all set systems of VC dimension $d$. We also study the deterministic and randomized communication complexities of the set intersection problem when sets belong to a set system of bounded VC dimension. We show that there exists set systems of VC dimension $d$ such that both deterministic and randomized (one-way and multi-round) complexities for the set intersection problem can be as high as $\Theta\left( d\log \left( n/d \right) \right)$, and this is tight among all set systems of VC dimension $d$.</div>
