We prove that a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for a special case of multiplayer (multiprover) games implies super-linear lower bounds for multi-tape Turing machines with advice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first connection between parallel repetition and lower bounds for time complexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition theorem with more than two players.

Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of block rigidity, extending Valiant's notion of rigidity [Val77]. While rigidity was originally defined for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear functions, we extend and study both rigidity and block rigidity for general (multi-output) functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger, Szemer{\'{e}}di and Trotter [PPST83], we show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape Turing machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the non-uniform setting, where the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape.

We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that, a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit block-rigid function. The games in that class have the following property that may be of independent interest: for every random string for the verifier (which, in particular, determines the vector of queries to the players), there is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts if and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent games. The theorem that we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\Omega(n)}$, where $n$ is the number of repetitions.

As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional size-depth tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions over large sets.</div>

<p>Election security has been studied for many years by <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/rsa-cryptographer-ronald-rivest-seeks-secure-elections-20200312/">computer scientists</a>, but it is not as often that it attracts so much mainstream attention. I would never have expected to see my former Princeton colleague <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/">Andrew Appel</a> on a Sean Hannity segment tweeted by President Trump.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/image.png"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/image.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-7899" /></a></figure>



<p></p>



<p>It may seem that even if it has partisan motivations, the recent GOP interest in election security is overall a positive thing. Who wouldn’t want elections to be more secure? Who wouldn’t want less fraud? However, in a very precise sense, the definition of “election security” used by the GOP these days corresponds to <strong>election insecurity</strong>.</p>



<p>To understand this claim, consider what it means for an election to be secure. (Let’s focus just on the correctness aspect of the count, since it is at the heart of the current issues, and not on the very interesting privacy aspect.) Computer scientists use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08554">the technical terms</a> “<strong>cast as intended</strong>“, “<strong>recorded as cast</strong>“, and “<strong>tallied as recorded</strong>“. In other words: if a voter X intends to cast vote for candidate Y,  then this vote should be recorded and tallied, and only such votes should be tallied.</p>



<p>With mail-in voting, there are several potential points of failure on the path between voter intent and the final tally:</p>



<ol><li>Mail can be lost or delayed too much, leading to the vote not counting.</li><li>A third party could intercept the ballot and impersonate the voter.</li><li>A ballot may not be formatted properly in some way, leading to it being disqualified.</li><li>There can be errors or hacks in the tallying process.</li></ol>



<p>Election security is about combatting points 1-4 (of which the last 3 are also applicable to in-person voting) , ideally in a way that is <em>verifiable</em> to the individual voters. Achieving verifiability while maintaining secrecy and not requiring the voter to trust complex technology is a challenging task, but there have been some proposed solutions (see above links).<br /><br />The Hannity segment and much of the “Dominion” non story focused on point 4. This is an important point, but as <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2020/11/13/did-sean-hannity-misquote-me/">Appel himself notes</a>, paper ballots, which are mostly used in the US, serve as a way to audit counting. Re-counting is important, and is commonly done, but such recounts often change the total counts by relatively little (and the changes mostly cancel out). For example, here is the list of ballots changed and reasons from the Wisconsin 2016 count (taken from <a href="https://t.co/AUagggIp6j?amp=1">this paper</a>)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Emk1EJaU4AAtAJm?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" alt="Image" /></figure>



<p>In contrast, many of the legal cases by the Trump campaign focused on signature verification and other ballot irregularities. There are two main reasons why a signature would not match between a ballot and driver’s license or other records:</p>



<ol><li>The signature may have been forged by someone trying to impersonate the voter.<br /></li><li>The voter’s signature might not very consistent, or maybe they have more than one signature (for example, I sometimes sign in Hebrew and sometimes in English) .</li></ol>



<p>Empirically, reason 2 is much more common than reason 1. If a ballot is tossed out because of the second reason it corresponds to a <strong>break between the voter intent and the final tally</strong>, and hence it is a case of <em>election insecurity</em>. For this reason, making more stringent signature checks could make elections less secure!</p>



<p>While President Trump might claim on Twitter that the election was stolen by a massive conspiracy involving forging of tens of thousands of ballots, this is not the actual content of the court cases (especially after some <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/lawyers-pan-significant-shrinkage-of-trump-campaigns-pennsylvania-lawsuit-only-addresses-a-handful-of-ballots/">recent</a> <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/484456818/Redline-Trump-Complaint">amendments</a>). For example, at the heart of the PA case is the process of “<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/">curing a ballot</a>“. This is when a ballot is disqualified due to some technical issue, and a voter has a chance to fix it. Curing a ballot ensures that the voters intent is captured, and hence makes elections more secure. </p>



<p>In PA, the decision of whether to notify voters in such cases was left to the counties, and apparently Democrat-controlled counties were more likely to do so Republican-controlled counties. This is a shame, and had the Trump campaign asked to extend the deadline for curing  ballots, then I would think it makes perfect sense. However, this is not what their lawsuit is about. To quote their complaint: <em>“plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction requiring the County Election Boards to invalidate ballots cast by voters who were notified and given an opportunity to cure their invalidly cast mail-in ballot.”</em> This are ballots where there is no question of the eligibility of the voter, nor of the accuracy of their intent, yet the Trump campaign seeks to prevent them from counting. I call this election insecurity.</p>

stochastic gradient descent. Recently, decentralized stochastic optimization
methods have attracted a lot of attention, mainly due to their low iteration
cost, data locality and data exchange efficiency. They are generalizations of
algorithms such as SGD and Local SGD. An additional important contribution of
this work is the additions to the analysis of acceleration of stochastic
methods, which allows achieving acceleration in the decentralized case.

approximations to $F(v)-F(u)$ for frequency vectors $v\succeq u$ and a given
function $F$. We show how to use such estimators to carefully trade error for
memory in an iterative manner. The function $F$ is generally non-linear, and we
give the first difference estimators for the frequency moments $F_p$ for
$p\in[0,2]$, as well as for integers $p&gt;2$. Using these, we resolve a number of
central open questions in adversarial robust streaming and sliding window
models.
</p>
<p>For adversarially robust streams, we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to
$F_p$ using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\log n}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ bits of
space for $p\in[0,2]$, and using
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}n^{1-2/p}\right)$ bits of space
for integers $p&gt;2$. We also obtain an adversarially robust algorithm for the
$L_2$-heavy hitters problem using $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log
n}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ bits of space. Our bounds are optimal up to
$\text{poly}(\log\log n + \log(1/\epsilon))$ factors, and improve the
$\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}$ dependence of Ben-Eliezer, et al. (PODS 2020, best paper
award) and the $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2.5}}$ dependence of Hassidim, et al.
(NeurIPS 2020, oral presentation).
</p>
<p>For sliding windows, we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $F_p$ using
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\log^2 n}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ bits of space for
$p\in(0,2]$, resolving a longstanding question of Braverman and Ostrovsky (FOCS
2007). For example, for $p = 2$ we improve the dependence on $\epsilon$ from
$\frac{1}{\epsilon^4}$ to an optimal $\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}$.
</p>
<p>For both models, our dependence on $\epsilon$ shows, up to
$\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ factors, that there is no overhead over the standard
insertion-only data stream model for any of these problems.

Specifically, we prove that any truthful mechanism guaranteeing a

valuations over $m$ items requires $\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^2 \cdot m))$
communication, whereas a non-truthful algorithm by Dobzinski and Schapira [SODA

<p>We obtain our separation by proving that any {simultaneous} protocol ({not}

reconfiguration problem on connected partitions of a connected graph $G$. A
partition of $V(G)$ is \emph{connected} if every part induces a connected
subgraph. In many applications, it is desirable to obtain parts of roughly the
same size, possibly with some slack $s$. A \emph{Balanced Connected
$k$-Partition with slack $s$}, denoted \emph{$(k,s)$-BCP}, is a partition of
$V(G)$ into $k$ nonempty subsets, of sizes $n_1,\ldots , n_k$ with
$|n_i-n/k|\leq s$, each of which induces a connected subgraph (when $s=0$, the
$k$ parts are perfectly balanced, and we call it \emph{$k$-BCP} for short).
</p>
<p>A \emph{recombination} is an operation that takes a $(k,s)$-BCP of a graph
$G$ and produces another by merging two adjacent subgraphs and repartitioning
them. Given two $k$-BCPs, $A$ and $B$, of $G$ and a slack $s\geq 0$, we wish to
determine whether there exists a sequence of recombinations that transform $A$
into $B$ via $(k,s)$-BCPs. We obtain four results related to this problem: (1)
When $s$ is unbounded, the transformation is always possible using at most
$6(k-1)$ recombinations. (2) If $G$ is Hamiltonian, the transformation is
possible using $O(kn)$ recombinations for any $s \ge n/k$, and (3) we provide
negative instances for $s \leq n/(3k)$. (4) We show that the problem is
PSPACE-complete when $k \in O(n^{\varepsilon})$ and $s \in
O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$, for any constant $0 &lt; \varepsilon \le 1$, even for
restricted settings such as when $G$ is an edge-maximal planar graph or when
$k=3$ and $G$ is planar.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Michel Schellekens <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07278">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Comparison-based algorithms are algorithms for which the execution of each
operation is solely based on the outcome of a series of comparisons between
elements. Comparison-based computations can be naturally represented via the
following computational model: (a) model data structures as partially-ordered
finite sets; (b) model data on these by topological sorts; (c) considering
computation states as finite multisets of such data; (d) represent computations
by their induced transformations on states. In this view, an abstract
specification of a sorting algorithm has input state given by any possible
permutation of a finite set of elements (represented, according to (a) and (b),
by a discrete partially-ordered set together with its topological sorts given
by all permutations) and output state a sorted list of elements (represented,
again according to (a) and (b), by a linearly-ordered finite set with its
unique topological sort).
</p>
<p>Entropy is a measure of "randomness" or "disorder." Based on the
computational model, we introduce an entropy conservation result for
comparison-based algorithms: "quantitative order gained is proportional to
positional order lost." Intuitively, the result bears some relation to the
messy office argument advocating a chaotic office where nothing is in the right
place yet each item's place is known to the owner, over the case where each
item is stored in the right order and yet the owner can no longer locate the
items. Formally, we generalize the result to the class of data structures
representable via series-parallel partial orders--a well-known computationally
tractable class. The resulting "denotational" version of entropy conservation
will be extended in follow-up work to an "operational" version for a core part
of our computational model.

and algorithm design. Rather than using off the shelf algorithms that only have
worst case performance guarantees, practitioners often optimize over large
families of parametrized algorithms and tune the parameters of these algorithms
using a training set of problem instances from their domain to determine a
configuration with high expected performance over future instances. However,
most of this work comes with no performance guarantees. The challenge is that
for many combinatorial problems of significant importance including
partitioning, subset selection, and alignment problems, a small tweak to the
parameters can cause a cascade of changes in the algorithm's behavior, so the
algorithm's performance is a discontinuous function of its parameters.
</p>
<p>In this chapter, we survey recent work that helps put data-driven
combinatorial algorithm design on firm foundations. We provide strong
computational and statistical performance guarantees, both for the batch and
online scenarios where a collection of typical problem instances from the given
application are presented either all at once or in an online fashion,
respectively.

determine. The oracle can answer queries of the form "Is $s$ a substring of
$S$?". The \emph{Substring Query Complexity} of a string $S$, denoted
$\chi(S)$, is the minimum number of adaptive substring queries that are needed
to exactly reconstruct (or learn) $S$. It has been introduced in 1995 by Skiena
and Sundaram, who showed that $\chi(S) \geq \sigma n/4 -O(n)$ in the worst
case, where $\sigma$ is the size of the alphabet of $S$ and $n$ its length, and
gave an algorithm that spends $(\sigma-1)n+O(\sigma \sqrt{n})$ queries to
reconstruct $S$. We show that for any binary string $S$, $\chi(S)$ is
asymptotically equal to the Kolmogorov complexity of $S$ and therefore lower
bounds any other measure of compressibility. However, since this result does
not yield an efficient algorithm for the reconstruction, we present new
algorithms to compute a set of substring queries whose size grows as a function
of other known measures of complexity, e.g., the number {\sf rle} of runs in
$S$, the size $g$ of the smallest grammar producing (only) $S$ or the size
$z_{no}$ of the non-overlapping LZ77 factorization of $S$. We first show that
any string of length $n$ over an integer alphabet of size $\sigma$ with {\sf
rle} runs can be reconstructed with $q=O({\sf rle} (\sigma + \log \frac{n}{{\sf
rle}}))$ substring queries in linear time and space. We then present an
algorithm that spends $q \in O(\sigma g\log n) \subseteq O(\sigma z_{no}\log
(n/z_{no})\log n)$ substring queries and runs in $O(n(\log n + \log \sigma)+
q)$ time using linear space. This algorithm actually reconstructs the suffix
tree of the string using a dynamic approach based on the centroid
decomposition.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Baris Irhan <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07107">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>A new predictor-corrector type incremental algorithm is proposed for the
exact construction of weighted straight skeletons of 2D general planar polygons
of arbitrary complexity based on the notion of deforming polygon. In the
proposed algorithm, the raw input provided by the polygon itself is enough to
resolve edge collapse and edge split events. Neither the construction of a
kinetic triangulation nor the computation of a motorcycle graph is required.
Due to its incremental nature, there is always a room in the algorithm for the
interactive construction of the straight skeleton. The proposed algorithm is of
predictor-corrector type. In the algorithm, the edge collapse and edge split
events are tackled by a completely different novel original approach which is
first of its kind. In the predictor step, the position of the vertices is
advanced in time by direct integration assuming no event. Then predicted
positions are corrected by using linear interpolation if there are edge
collapse or edge split events within the same increment. In the algorithm edge
collapse and edge split events are detected by, respectively, edge swap and
edge penetration. The proposed algorithm has been used to construct roof
topology starting from a floor plan of various complexity ranging from simple
convex to highly nonconvex with holes. In order to construct, improve and test
the building blocks of the underlying algorithm, a graphical user interface,
Straight Skeleton Development Kit, has also been developed in parallel by the
author using C++ programming language.

rank-3 hypergraphs, and is achieved by a natural iterated rounding algorithm.
While the general conjecture remains open, we give several new improved bounds.
In particular, we show that the iterated rounding algorithm gives $\sum_{e \in
M} (|e|-\delta(e))\, w(e) \geq w^*$, where $\delta(e) = |e|/(|e|^2+|e|-1)$,
improving upon the baseline guarantee of $\sum_{e \in M} |e|\,w(e) \geq w^*$.

<p>The news: In 1981, Paul Erdős and András Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Hong Liu and Richard Montgomry <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15802">have just proved</a> that the answer is positive!  They also proved a variety of other old standing conjectures. This is remarkable. Congratulations!</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before going on let me pose an even stronger conjecture</span></p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> The sum of the reciprocals of the odd<strong> induced</strong> cycle lengths in a <em>triangle-free</em> graph with no triangles and infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite.</p>
<p>The same conclusion should apply to graphs with bounded clique numbers; it is related to the general area of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\chi" class="latex" title="\chi" />-boundedness, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/when-a-few-colors-suffice/">this post</a> and this <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~pds/papers/chibounded/paper.pdf">recent survey</a> by Alex Scott and Paul Seymour.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Returning to Liu and Montgomry’s breakthrough</span>, let me mention two other conjectures that Hong and Richard proved in the same paper:</p>
<p>A) (Conjecture by Erdős from 1984) There is a constant <em>d</em> such that any graph with average degree <em>d</em> has a cycle whose length is a power of 2.</p>
<p>B) (Conjecture by Carsten Thomassen from 1984) for every <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-11-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-84"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-85"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-86">k</span></span></span></span></em>, there is some <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-12-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-87"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-88"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-89">d</span></span></span></span></em> so that every graph with average degree at least <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-13-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-90"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-91"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-92">d</span></span></span></span></em> has a subdivision of the complete graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K_k" class="latex" title="K_k" /> in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times.</p>
<p>I am thankful to Benny Sudakov for telling me about the new result.</p>
<p>A key ingredient of the proof is the study of expanders that you can always find in graphs. Komlós and Szemerédi showed in 1996 that every graph <em>G</em> contains an expander with comparable average degree to <em>G </em>and since their work, with greater and greater sophistication, finding expanders in general graphs has become an important tool for a large number of extremal problems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, Erdős and Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}(G)" /> be the set of cycle lengths in a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)" /> be the set of odd numbers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}(G)" />. We prove that, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> has chromatic number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_%7B%5Cell%5Cin++%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29%7D1%2F%5Cell%5Cgeq+%281%2F2-o_k%281%29%29%5Clog+k.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k." class="latex" title="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k." /> This solves Erdős and Hajnal’s odd cycle problem, and, furthermore, this bound is asymptotically optimal.<br />
In 1984, Erdős asked whether there is some d such that each graph with chromatic number at least d (or perhaps even only average degree at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />) has a cycle whose length is a power of 2. We show that an average degree condition is sufficient for this problem, solving it with methods that apply to a wide range of sequences in addition to the powers of 2.<br />
Finally, we use our methods to show that, for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />, there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> so that every graph with average degree at least d has a subdivision of the complete graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K_k" class="latex" title="K_k" /> in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. This confirms a conjecture of Thomassen from 1984.</p></div>

Please contact me (reingold@stanford.edu) for details and please forward to any relevant individual. Some comments:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The Simons Collaboration will offer additional postdoc opportunities across the participating institutions. To be advertised soon.</li></ol>



<ul><li>The perspective taken in both these projects is of TOC but the research will gain from collaborations with other fields within and outside of CS (Statistics, Economics, Philosophy, Law, Social Sciences at large). I will therefore be open to postdocs with various backgrounds (and would consider co-hosting with colleagues in other fields).</li></ul>

Both are on You tube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtIT-jr1hmQ">Trebek hosts wheel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwVNmYjClXE">Pat hosts Jeopardy</a> Alex's hosting was more fun because- well, you can see for yourself. </p><p>2) Aside from that one day, Alex Trebek hosted <i>Jeopardy</i> every night since he began in 1984. </p><p>3) My favorite pangram (sentence that has all 26 letters) is</p><p>Watch <i>Jeopardy!</i>, Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game show. </p><p>(See my post on natural pangrams <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/11/can-you-measure-which-panagrams-are.html">here</a> for... more natural pangrams and a discussion of what natural means.) </p><p>It's my favorite since I can really imagine someone saying it. The show should have used it for its tagline. And now they can't :-(</p><p>4) From Alex's comments he seems to like high scoring games that are not run-a-ways. He also likes when people bet big on the daily doubles and on<i> final Jeopardy</i>.  I think he liked having long win streaks like Ken Jenning's  and James Holzhauer, but see point 7 below.  I think he didn't like it when people go for the high scoring questions first (perhaps looking for the Daily Double) since sometimes the category name is not quite clear (e.g., <i>Country Groups</i> could be things like<i> NATO </i>or things like <i>The Charlie Daniels Band</i>) so you want to do a cheap question to get your feet wet, and also easier for the audience to see what the category means.  IMHO they should really make the Daily Double Uniformly distributed on all the squares instead of having it tend to be the bigger-money questions. </p><p>5) When the final <i>Jeopardy</i> category is  revealed he sometimes says <i>that's a  good category!</i> or <i>that sounds hard. </i> Makes me wonder that if he makes no comment he is thinking<i> that's a stupid categor</i>y  or <i>Gee that's easy.</i></p><p>6) Because of the pandemic they could not, for a while, make new shows. Hence  they aired old shows including the  first ever Alex-Trebek-<i>Jeopardy</i> (the show had been hosted by Art Fleming and the Trebek-version was really a reboot). From that show I found out WHY it's called<i> Jeopardy</i> (a question I had never thought about). It's because if you get an answer WRONG you can LOSE money- that's the Jeopardy. Not really a good name, but by now everyone knows the show by that name.</p><p>7) Art Fleming also died of pancreatic cancer, back in 1995 (he was 70). Coincidence? Well, yes, though two game show hosts of the same show dying of the same disease 25 years apart could be the premise of a really bad murder mystery. </p><p>8) Alex makes some small talk with the contestants  (though some is edited for time). Things like <i>I hear you have a book on muffins that is not a cookbook-- what's that all about?</i>' I wonder if during Ken Jenning's 74-long winning streak, towards the end,  Alex ran out of things to ask him. I can imagine <i>I hear you're pretty good at Jeopardy.</i></p><p>9) I wonder how good Alex would be playing <i>Jeopardy</i>. When he hosted <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> he said in passing that he would NEVER go on <i>Jeopardy</i> as a contestant, so he doesn't think he would do well. He could be wrong about that since over time they ask questions that are not quite repeats but draw on the same knowledge- and he's heard all of them. However, it could be that he is too busy concentrating on other things to really absorb all of this knowledge. </p><p>10) The <i>we give the answers you give the questions </i>is a bit odd. However, in my classes I  sometimes say  <i>We'll Trebek this - we know what the answer is, we have to find the question</i>.</p><p>11) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7UgxCayfV0">This</a> youtube video is of a contestant singing WORDS to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme song that he wrote.The contestant  refers to Jon Stewart as having also written words to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme, but I can't find that anywhere- if you can, let me know. </p><p>12) Weird Al did a novelty song about <i>Jeopardy</i> using Art Fleming in the video (see  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvUZijEuNDQ">here</a>)  I always hoped he would update it and use Alex Trebek. He never did and now he can't :-( OR-with todays technology maybe he can. Here's hoping!</p><p>13) Alex Trebek was in a category by himself!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>The use of Nash’s Hex lemma in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/10/hex-books-queues.html">my previous post</a>, according to which any 2-coloring of a triangular grid has a long monochromatic path, naturally raises the question: for which graphs other than the triangular grid is this true? In that post I mentioned that it is also true for certain outerplanar graphs, but false for bipartite graphs and for subcubic graphs. Here’s another class of graphs for which it is false: the graphs of bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a>. These graphs can always be 2-colored in a way that breaks up all long paths, leaving the remaining monochromatic paths of bounded size.</p>

<p>Rather than dealing with pathwidth directly, I want to formulate it geometrically in terms of interval graphs. Every graph can be completed (by adding extra edges) to form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_graph">interval graph</a> of the same pathwidth; an interval graph has one-dimensional closed intervals as its vertices, connected by an edge whenever they intersect. The pathwidth of an interval graph is always one less than the maximum number of intervals that overlap at the same point (their ply). So rather than looking at graphs of bounded pathwidth I’ll be considering sets of intervals of bounded ply. For example in the illustration below which I drew a few years ago for Wikipedia, the intervals shown have ply 3, and their interval graph has pathwidth 2.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/interval-graph.svg" alt="A set of intervals and their associated interval graph" /></p>

<p>Intervals with low ply that are all either nested or disjoint can have no long paths in their intersection graph regardless of coloring. In any set of intervals forming a path, the path can pass through the outermost level of nesting at most once, subdividing it into two smaller paths with lower ply. It follows by induction the number of intervals in the path can be at most \(2^{\operatorname{ply}}-1\). (This is the standard argument behind an equivalence in graphs between longest path length and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-depth">tree-depth</a>.) So if we could partition an arbitrary set of intervals into two subsets within which all intervals are nested or disjoint, we’d be done. For instance, in the example above, the partition into \(\{A,B,F\}\) and \(\{C,D,E,G\}\) works. Not every set of intervals can be partitioned in this way, but I’ll show below that it’s always possible to lengthen some intervals, keeping the ply small, so that the lengthened intervals can be partitioned (colored) into two nested subsets.</p>

<p>As a subroutine in the construction, let’s find a set of points with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each interval lies strictly between the leftmost and rightmost selected points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No interval covers more than one selected point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The union of the intervals that cover selected points equals the union of all the intervals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This can be done by a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selects an uncovered interval endpoint until the intervals that cover selected points also cover all other interval endpoints. Finish by selecting any two points to the left and right of all the intervals, and then number the selected points as \(x_0,x_1,\dots\) in left-to-right order. For example, one possible choice for our example would have \(x_0\) to the left of the intervals, \(x_1\) at the left endpoint of \(D\), \(x_2\) at the left endpoint of \(F\), and \(x_3\) to the right of the intervals. For this choice, \(B\) and \(E\) do not cover any selected points, but that’s not a problem. It’s not necessary to optimize how many points are selected.</p>

<p>Call an interval “odd” if it covers an odd-numbered point \(x_i\) and “even” if it covers an even-numbered point. In our example, \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\) are odd, and \(F\), and \(G\) are even, but \(B\) and \(E\) are neither odd nor even. We will color the odd intervals blue and the even intervals red. Because they are different colors, we don’t have to worry about nesting between odd and even intervals. However, the intervals that contain any single point \(x_i\) will have the same color and need to be lengthened to nesting intervals. To do so, we extend all these intervals to a single longer interval, from just after \(x_{i-1}\) to just before \(x_{i+1}\). Because of the way the points \(x_i\) were chosen, this does not create new intersections between intervals of the same color, and it makes all colored intervals nest with all uncolored ones (not just with each other). However, it can also increase the ply. If the ply was \(p\) previously, it can increase by as much as \(2p-1\), when a point that was previously covered by only one odd or even interval becomes covered by \(2p-1\) more of them.</p>

<p>Finally, we apply the same coloring and lengthening process recursively, to the remaining subsets of uncolored intervals between each pair of selected points.
To make sure the intervals stay nested after lengthening, we take care in each recursive subproblem to select its first and last points to be inside all intervals of the outer problem that contain the subproblem. Because every point in an interval of a recursive subproblem is also in at least one of the outer colored intervals, the recursive subproblem has smaller ply than the initial ply of the outer problem. The recursion stops at ply 2; for this ply the intersection graph is a tree (more precisely a caterpillar) and it is possible to 2-color the intervals without any lengthening so that no two intervals of the same color intersect, by 2-coloring the tree.</p>

<p>So if we start with intervals of ply 2, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply 2 again (no change to the ply). If we start with intervals of ply 3, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply at most 8, because the ply-3 interval-lengthening process added at most 5 to the existing ply. More generally for any starting ply \(p\) the new ply will be at most \(p^2+p-4\). And since the interval graph for the lengthened intervals has no monochromatic path with more than \(2^{p^2+p-4}-1\) intervals in it, neither does the interval graph for the original intervals, with the same 2-coloring.</p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wolfgang Kühnel</span></p>
<p>Today I want to talk about a new result in a newly arXived paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02703">A subexponential size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb RP^n" class="latex" title="\mathbb RP^n" /> by Karim Adiprasito, Sergey Avvakumov, and Roman Karasev</a>. Sergey Avvakumov gave about it a <strong>great</strong> zoom seminar talk about the result in our combinatorics seminar. <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=602454e6-d104-42fe-849c-ac6000b7517b">Here is the link</a>.</p>
<p>The question is very simple: <strong>W<span style="color: #0000ff;">hat is the smallest number of vertices required to triangulate the <em>n</em>-dimensional real projective space?</span></strong></p>
<p>The short paper exhibits a triangulation with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp+%28%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Csqrt+n+%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)" class="latex" title="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)" /> vertices.  This is the first construction that requires subexponential number of vertices in the dimension. The best lower bound by Pierre Arnoux and Alexis Marin (from 1999) are quadratic, so there is quite a way to go with the problem. I am thankful to Ryan Alweiss who was the first to tell me about the new result.</p>
<h2>Reasons to care</h2>
<p>Representing a topological space using simplicial complexes arose in the early days of algebraic topology, but there are certainly more “efficient” representations. What is the reason to to care specifically about representations via simplicial complexes? Here are my answers</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructions of triangulated manifolds with few vertices are occasionally amazing mathematical objects.</li>
<li>Simplicial complexes arise in many combinatorial and algebraic contexts,</li>
<li>The study of face numbers of simplicial complexes with various topological properties is often related to deep questions in algebra, geometry, and topology,</li>
<li>We care also about other types of representation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kühnel and Lassmann’s complex projective plane with nine vertices and other miracles</h2>
<p>You may all be familiar with the 6-vertex triangulation of the projective space. It is obtained by identifying opposite faces of the icosahedron. It is 2-neighborly, namely every pair of vertices span an edge of the triangulation. (It also played a role in my high dimensional extension of Cayley’s counting trees formula.) The existence of 2-neighborly triangulations of other closed surfaces is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heawood_conjecture">Heawood 1890 conjecture</a> solved by Ringel and Young in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1980 Wolfgang Kühnel set out to construct a 3-neighborly triangulation of the complex projective plane with 9 vertices. The construction, achieved in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316583900055?via%3Dihub">a paper by Kühnel and Lassmann</a> (who also proved uniqueness), and discussed in <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/howison/newbanchoff/publications/pdfs/9Vertex.pdf">a paper of the same year by Kühnel and Banchof</a>, is, in my view, among the most beautiful constructions in mathematics with additional hidden structures and many connections. Some motivation to the work came from the study of tight embeddings of smooth manifolds and Morse theory.</p>
<p>Ulrich Brehm and Kühnel <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040938387900425?via%3Dihub">proved</a> that if a <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3">d</span></span></span></span>-manifold has fewer than <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-4"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-5"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-6">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">⌈</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-10"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-11">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-12">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-13">⌉</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-14">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-15">3</span></span></span></span> vertices then it is homeomorphic to a sphere, and if it has exactly <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-16"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-17"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-18">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-19">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-20">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-21"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-22"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-23">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-24">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-25">)</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-26">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-27">3</span></span></span></span> vertices and is not a sphere, then <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-4-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-28"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-29"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-30">d</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-31">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-32">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-33">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-34">4</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-35">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-36">8</span></span></span></span> or <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-37"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-38"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-39">16</span></span></span></span> and the manifold has a nondegenerate height function with exactly three critical points. The 6-vertex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb RP^2" class="latex" title="\mathbb RP^2" /> and the 9-vertex $\mathbbCP^2$ are examples for dimensions 2 and 4. We can expect further such examples for projective planes over the quaternions and octonions. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01934320">Brehm and Kühnel</a> constructed three 8-dimensional 5-neighborly “manifolds” which are not combinatorially isomorphic. It is conjectured but not known that they all triangulate the quaternionic projective plane.</p>

<p>Here is a brief description of Sergey Avvakumov’s lecture. (As far as I could see the proof of their result is fully presented along with  3 other proofs for basic related results.)</p>

A simple inductive constructions of  a triangulation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R+P%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb R P^n" class="latex" title="\mathbb R P^n" />.</p>

<h2>Open problems and Low dimensions</h2>
<p>Of course a main question is what is the minimum number of vertices required for a triangulation of n dimensional real projective space. What about the n-dimensional complex projective space? What is the situation for low dimensions? See also the paper by Sonia Balagopalan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6149">On a vertex-minimal triangulation of RP^4</a>.</p></div>

<div class="content">
We construct two classes of algebraic code families which are efficiently list decodable with small output list size from a fraction $1-R-\epsilon$ of adversarial errors where $R$ is the rate of the code, for any desired positive constant $\epsilon$. The alphabet size depends only on $\epsilon$ and is nearly-optimal.

The first class of codes are obtained by folding algebraic-geometric codes using automorphisms of the underlying function field. The second class of codes are obtained by restricting evaluation points of an algebraic-geometric code to rational points from a subfield. In both cases, we develop a linear-algebraic approach to perform list decoding, which pins down the candidate messages to a subspace with a nice "periodic" structure.

To prune this subspace and obtain a good bound on the list-size, we pick subcodes of these codes by pre-coding into certain subspace-evasive sets which are guaranteed to have small intersection with the sort of periodic subspaces that arise in our list decoding. We develop two approaches for constructing such subspace-evasive sets. The first is a Monte Carlo construction of hierearchical subspace-evasive (h.s.e) sets which leads to excellent list-size but is not explicit. The second approach exploits a further ultra-periodicity of our subspaces and uses a novel construct called subspace designs, which were subsequently constructed explicitly and also found further applications in pseudorandomness.

To get a family of codes over a fixed alphabet size, we instantiate our approach with algebraic-geometric codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields. Combining this with pruning via h.s.e sets yields codes list-decodable up to a $1-R-\epsilon$ error fraction with list size bounded by $O(1/\epsilon)$, matching the existential bound for random codes up to constant factors. Further, the alphabet size can be made $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2))$ which is not much worse than the lower bound of $\exp(\Omega(1/\epsilon))$. The parameters we achieve are thus quite close to the  existential bounds in all three aspects---error-correction radius, alphabet size, and list-size---simultaneously. This construction is, however, Monte Carlo and the claimed list decoding property only holds with high probability. Once the code is (efficiently) sampled, the encoding/decoding algorithms are deterministic with a running time $O_\epsilon(N^c)$ for an absolute constant $c$, where $N$ is the code's block length.

Using subspace designs instead for the pruning, our approach yields a deterministic construction of an algebraic code family of rate $R$ with efficient list decoding from $1-R-\epsilon$ fraction of errors over an alphabet of constant size $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2))$.  The list size bound is upper bounded by a very slowly growing function of the block length $N$; in particular, it is at most $O(\log^{(r)} N)$ (the $r$'th iterated logarithm) for any fixed integer $r$. The explicit construction avoids the shortcoming of the Monte Carlo sampling at the expense of a worse list size.</div>

<p>
Jemma Lorenat is an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer College</a> in Los Angeles. She teaches and does research on the history of mathematics.<br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/12/the-art-of-math/jemma/" rel="attachment wp-att-17751"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/jemma.png?w=600" alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-17751" /></a></p>
<p>
Today I thought we’d look at some of her work. </p>
<p>
History of math is one topic that we have focused on many times before. More on that in a moment. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Her Art </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
But before we do that I wish to present Lorenat’s art work. My late father, Jack Lipton, was an artist and so perhaps I have a genetic interest in art. Lorenat is an artist besides being a mathematician. You can see some of her drawings of famous mathematicians <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/portrait-gallery">here</a>. Her elegant style I find appealing. See if you like it as much as I do. My dad taught me: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A clean drawing is more difficult to execute than a busy one. It is hard to hide flaws when your art is clean. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Her drawings are clean indeed. </p>
<p>
Here are three of Lorenat’s drawings of the following three famous mathematicians in some order: Which is which? Prizes will not be given to those with correct answers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Eric Temple Bell <p></p>
</li><li>
Jacques Hadamard <p></p>
</li><li>
Henri Lebesgue
</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Her Research </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lorenat’s research is on the history of mathematics. My first choice is to create math, but I am intrigued by the history of who did what, when, and why. We must understand history—at least in broad strokes—if we are to continue to make progress. History helps us understand how progress was made and how it was not. History teaches us much about our field, about mathematics. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/topics/history.html">Several</a> online <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/masters/hist_frame.htm">sources</a> show the field’s breadth and scope. Among issues and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematics_history_topics">topics</a>, we note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who is a result named for? <p></p>
</li><li>
Who gets the credit for a result? <p></p>
</li><li>
What is the strongest result known? <p></p>
</li><li>
Is this result correct?
</li></ul>
<p>
It is fun to see the process in action. One example I have been involved in for a long time is the study of vector addition systems and reachability problems. There continues to be exciting news, for instance, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07115.pdf">paper</a> last year showing that a central reachability problem is vastly harder than had been conjectured. I will discuss, however, an issue from two centuries ago that Lorenat has illuminated.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Duality Controversy </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lorenat has a <a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/78167-culturalcontextconference2015.pdf">talk</a> on the geometric theory of duality. It was a prime example of a controversy in the discover of a basic math idea. Here duality means: Given a statement from projective geometry we can flip points and lines and still leave its correctness invariant. This is the duality: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++points+%5Ciff+lines.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " /></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<table style="margin: auto;">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
In complexity theory we have our own duality. Instead of flipping points and lines we can exchange boolean operations 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AND+%5Ciff+OR%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " /></p>
<p>and also exchange 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0+%5Ciff+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " /></p>
<p>	 Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x+%5Cwedge+y%29+%5Cvee+%28x+%5Cwedge+z%29+%5Ciff+%28x+%5Cvee+y%29+%5Cwedge+%28x+%5Cvee+z%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " /></p>
<p>		 Lorenat’s talk highlights a controversy between: Joseph Diaz Gergonne, Jean-Victor Poncelet, and Julius Plucker. Her work is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/science-in-context/article/polemics-in-public-poncelet-gergonne-plucker-and-the-duality-controversy/C305E6B9326F2AC4C8AC31D4194FEDC6">here</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A plagiarism charge in 1827 sparked a public controversy centered between Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867) and Joseph-Diez Gergonne (1771-1859) over the origin and applications of the principle of duality in geometry. Over the next three years and through the pages of various journals, monographs, letters, reviews, reports, and footnotes, vitriol between the antagonists increased as their potential publicity grew. While the historical literature offers valuable resources toward understanding the development, content, and applications of geometric duality, the hostile nature of the exchange seems to have deterred an in-depth textual study of the explicitly polemical writings. We argue that the necessary collective endeavor of beginning and ending this controversy constitutes a case study in the circulation of geometry. In particular, we consider how the duality controversy functioned as a medium of communicating new fundamental principles to a wider audience of practitioners. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A further comment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Of this feud, Pierre Samuel has quipped that since both men were in the French army and Poncelet was a general while Gergonne a mere captain, Poncelet’s view prevailed, at least among their French contemporaries. </em>
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Nov. 14):</span></strong> I now have a deluge of serious hosting offers—thank you so much, everyone!  No need for more.</p>



<p></p><hr /><p></p>



<p>Since I’m now feeling better that the first authoritarian coup attempt in US history will probably sort itself out OK, here’s a <em>real</em> problem:</p>



<p>Nearly a score years ago, I created the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a>, a procrastination project turned encyclopedia of complexity classes.  Nearly half a score years ago, the Zoo moved to my former employer, the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum Computing</a> in Waterloo, Canada, which graciously hosted it ever since.  Alas, IQC has decided that it can no longer do so.  The reason is new regulations in Ontario about the accessibility of websites, which the Zoo might be out of compliance with.  My students and I were willing to look into what was needed—like, does the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#ph">polynomial hierarchy</a> need ramps between its levels or something?  The best would be if we heard from actual blind or other disabled complexity enthusiasts about how we could improve their experience, rather than trying to parse bureaucratese from the Ontario government.  But IQC informed us that in any case, they can’t deal with the potential liability and their decision is final.  I thank them for hosting the Zoo for eight years.</p>



<p>Now I’m looking for a volunteer for a new host.  The Zoo runs on the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> platform, which doesn’t work with my own hosting provider (Bluehost) but is apparently easy to set up if you, unlike me, are the kind of person who can do such things.  The IQC folks kindly offered to help with the transfer; I and my students can help as well.  It’s a small site with modest traffic.  The main things I need are just assurances that you can host the site for a long time (“forever” or thereabouts), and that you or someone else in your organization will be reachable if the site goes down or if there are other problems.  I own the complexityzoo.com domain and can redirect from there.</p>



<p>In return, you’ll get the immense prestige of hosting such a storied resource for theoretical computer science … plus free publicity for your cause or organization on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and the eternal gratitude of thousands of my readers.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re <em>into</em> complexity theory, and you want to update or improve the Zoo while you’re at it, then so much the awesomer!  It could use some updates, badly.  But you don’t even <em>need</em> to know P from NP.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, leave a comment or shoot me an email.  Thanks!!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Announcement:</span></strong> I’ll once again be doing an Ask-Me-Anything session at the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B (“Quantum to Business”)</a> conference, December 8-10.  Other speakers include Umesh Vazirani, John Preskill, Jennifer Ouellette, Eric Schmidt, and many others.  Since the conference will of course be virtual this year, registration is a lot cheaper than in previous years.  Check it out!  (Full disclosure: Q2B is organized by <a href="https://qcware.com/">QC Ware, Inc.</a>, for which I’m a scientific advisor.)</p></div>

<p><br />The 34th International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2020) was held on October 12-16, 2020, as a virtual conference. As such, the opportunity for community members to get to know each other in an informal environment was lacking. To address this need, we arranged two types of virtual networking events. We hope that these events planted the seeds for many future collaborations and that there will be an opportunity for those involved to meet in person next time.</p>



<p><strong>MoPS (Meet other Postdoc and Students) Sessions<br /></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home</a></p>



<p>To allow junior members of the community to get to know one another, we arranged MoPS sessions, which we have not seen done before. There were more than 50 participants who took part in the sessions, with representation from a host of countries throughout the world. Sessions were held in 10-time slots before, during, and after DISC. In each session, there would typically be 5 members representing a mixture of Bachelor’s students, Masters students, PhDs, postdocs, and others. Care was taken to include at least one postdoc or Ph.D. in each session so that Bachelors and Masters students might benefit from their experience. Groups were formed with the goal of allowing participants from different countries and institutions to share their experiences and research journeys with one another. Based on the feedback for this event, it would appear that that goal was met and the participants came away with more of a sense of community.</p>

<p>The Junior-Senior meetings were organized to provide an opportunity for junior researchers to meet with senior researchers. Fourteen sessions were conducted, where each one brought together one senior and 3-5 juniors. In these sessions,  the juniors got a chance to interact with seniors in the field and profit from their experience. Discussions covered a variety of topics such as how to approach research, how to deal with the job market, or perhaps more personal concerns like work-life balance. We collected amazing feedback from the participants, who claimed that this was a fruitful and interesting experience.</p></div>

Computational pseudorandomness studies the extent to which a random variable $\bf{Z}$ looks like the uniform distribution according to a class of tests $\cal{F}$. Computational entropy generalizes computational pseudorandomness by studying the extent which a random variable looks like a \emph{high entropy} distribution. There are different formal definitions of computational entropy with different advantages for different applications. Because of this, it is of interest to understand when these definitions are equivalent.
  We consider three notions of computational entropy which are known to be equivalent when the test class $\cal{F}$ is closed under taking majorities. This equivalence constitutes (essentially) the so-called \emph{dense model theorem} of Green and Tao (and later made explicit by Tao-Zeigler, Reingold et al., and Gowers). The dense model theorem plays a key role in Green and Tao's proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions and has since been connected to a surprisingly wide range of topics in mathematics and computer science, including cryptography, computational complexity, combinatorics and machine learning. We show that, in different situations where $\cal{F}$ is \emph{not} closed under majority, this equivalence fails. This in turn provides examples where the dense model theorem is \emph{false}.</div>

<p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, Nov 20th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (13:00 Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC, 23:30 Indian Time).  <strong>Himanshu Tyagi </strong>from IISc will speak about “<strong>General lower bounds for estimation under information constraints</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  We present very general lower bounds for parametric estimation when only limited information per sample is allowed. These limitations can arise, for example, in form of communication constraints, privacy constraints, or linear measurements. Our lower bounds hold for discrete distributions with large alphabet as well as continuous distributions with high-dimensional parameters, apply for any information constraint, and are valid for any $\ell_p$ loss function. Our bounds recover both strong data processing inequality based bounds and Cramér-Rao based bound as special cases.</p>



<p>This talk is based on joint work with Jayadev Acharya and Clément Canonne.</p>

Higher order random walks (HD-walks) on high dimensional expanders have played a crucial role in a number of recent breakthroughs in theoretical computer science, perhaps most famously in the recent resolution of the Mihail-Vazirani conjecture (Anari et al. STOC 2019), which focuses on HD-walks on one-sided local-spectral expanders. In this work we study the spectral structure of walks on the stronger two-sided variant, which capture wide generalizations of important objects like the Johnson and Grassmann graphs. We prove that the spectra of these walks are tightly concentrated in a small number of strips, each of which corresponds combinatorially to a level in the underlying complex. Moreover, the eigenvalues corresponding to these strips decay exponentially with a measure we term the depth of the walk.
    
    Using this spectral machinery, we characterize the edge-expansion of small sets based upon the interplay of their local combinatorial structure and the global decay of the walk's eigenvalues across strips. Variants of this result for the special cases of the Johnson and Grassmann graphs were recently crucial both for the resolution of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot et al. FOCS 2018), and for efficient algorithms for affine unique games over the Johnson graphs (Bafna et al. Arxiv 2020). For the complete complex, our characterization admits a low-degree Sum of Squares proof. Building on the work of Bafna et al., we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for affine unique games over the Johnson scheme. The soundness and runtime of our algorithm depend upon the number of strips with large eigenvalues, a measure we call High-Dimensional Threshold Rank that calls back to the seminal work of Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer (FOCS 2011) on unique games and threshold rank.</div>
