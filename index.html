<p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, Nov 20th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (13:00 Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC, 23:30 Indian Time).  <strong>Himanshu Tyagi </strong>from IISc will speak about “<strong>General lower bounds for estimation under information constraints</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  We present very general lower bounds for parametric estimation when only limited information per sample is allowed. These limitations can arise, for example, in form of communication constraints, privacy constraints, or linear measurements. Our lower bounds hold for discrete distributions with large alphabet as well as continuous distributions with high-dimensional parameters, apply for any information constraint, and are valid for any $\ell_p$ loss function. Our bounds recover both strong data processing inequality based bounds and Cramér-Rao based bound as special cases.</p>



<p>This talk is based on joint work with Jayadev Acharya and Clément Canonne.</p>

Higher order random walks (HD-walks) on high dimensional expanders have played a crucial role in a number of recent breakthroughs in theoretical computer science, perhaps most famously in the recent resolution of the Mihail-Vazirani conjecture (Anari et al. STOC 2019), which focuses on HD-walks on one-sided local-spectral expanders. In this work we study the spectral structure of walks on the stronger two-sided variant, which capture wide generalizations of important objects like the Johnson and Grassmann graphs. We prove that the spectra of these walks are tightly concentrated in a small number of strips, each of which corresponds combinatorially to a level in the underlying complex. Moreover, the eigenvalues corresponding to these strips decay exponentially with a measure we term the depth of the walk.
    
    Using this spectral machinery, we characterize the edge-expansion of small sets based upon the interplay of their local combinatorial structure and the global decay of the walk's eigenvalues across strips. Variants of this result for the special cases of the Johnson and Grassmann graphs were recently crucial both for the resolution of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot et al. FOCS 2018), and for efficient algorithms for affine unique games over the Johnson graphs (Bafna et al. Arxiv 2020). For the complete complex, our characterization admits a low-degree Sum of Squares proof. Building on the work of Bafna et al., we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for affine unique games over the Johnson scheme. The soundness and runtime of our algorithm depend upon the number of strips with large eigenvalues, a measure we call High-Dimensional Threshold Rank that calls back to the seminal work of Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer (FOCS 2011) on unique games and threshold rank.</div>

We present an explicit and efficient algebraic construction of capacity-achieving list decodable codes with both constant alphabet and constant list sizes. More specifically, for any $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, we give an algebraic construction of an infinite family of error-correcting codes of rate $R$, over an alphabet of size $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$, that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$-fraction of errors with list size at most $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$. Moreover, the codes can be encoded in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, the output list is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$, and a basis for this subspace can be found in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$. Thus, both encoding and list decoding can be performed in \emph{fully polynomial-time} $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, except for pruning the subspace and outputting the final list which takes time $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(n)$. In contrast, prior explicit and efficient constructions of capacity-achieving list decodable codes either required a much higher complexity in terms of $1/\epsilon$ (and were additionally much less structured), or had super-constant alphabet or list sizes.

Our codes are quite natural and structured. Specifically, we use algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with evaluation points restricted to a subfield, and with the message space restricted to a (carefully chosen) linear subspace. Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield evaluation points is contained in an affine shift of the image of a \emph{block-triangular-Toeplitz (BTT) matrix}, and that the list size can potentially be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a \emph{BTT evasive subspace}, which is a large subspace that intersects the image of any BTT matrix in a constant number of points. We further show how to explicitly construct such BTT evasive subspaces, based on the explicit subspace designs of Guruswami and Kopparty (\emph{Combinatorica}, 2016), and composition.</div>

This paper shows that there exist Reed--Solomon (RS) codes, over large finite fields, that are combinatorially list-decodable well beyond the Johnson radius, in fact almost achieving list-decoding capacity. In particular, we show that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1]$ there exist RS codes with rate $\Omega(\frac{\epsilon}{\log(1/\epsilon)+1})$ that are list-decodable from radius of $1-\epsilon$. We generalize this result to obtain a similar result on list-recoverability of RS codes. Along the way we use our techniques to give a new proof of a result of Blackburn on optimal linear perfect hash matrices, and strengthen it to obtain a construction of strongly perfect hash matrices. 

To derive the results in this paper we show a surprising connection of the above problems to graph theory, and in particular to the tree packing theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte. En route to our results on RS codes, we prove a generalization of the tree packing theorem to hypergraphs (and we conjecture that an even stronger generalization holds). We hope that this generalization to hypergraphs will be of independent interest.</div>

<p>As announced <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">earlier</a> I am currently teaching a course on “interactive proofs with quantum devices” in Paris. The course is proceeding apace, even though the recent lockdown order in France means that we had to abandon our beautiful auditorium at the Institut Henri Poincaré and retreat behind the fanciful Zoom backgrounds whose pretension is a sad reminder of what our summers used to be (Banff, anyone?). A possible upshot is that more may be able to attend the now-online course; if you are interested see the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/">course page</a> for info. (Things are actually fairly good here–in spite of the apparently strict restrictions on daily outings (max 1h, 1km) you can count on the French to bend things their way; most shops are closed but the streets remain quite busy.)</p>



<p>We just finished a sequence of four lectures on the Mahadev “classical verification of quantum computation” protocol. In the process of preparing the lectures I arrived at a presentation of the protocol that is fairly self-contained, so I decided to compile the associated lecture notes as a stand-alone group of 4 lectures that is available <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp_verification.pdf">here</a>. The notes are aimed at beginning graduate students with a first course in quantum computing and in complexity desiring to gain a concrete understanding of the inner workings of the result; the notes are a bit lengthy but this in part because they take the time to introduce related concepts and slowly build up to the main result. Overall, my hope is that these should be relatively easily readable and provide a good technical introduction to the Mahadev result on classical verification, including an almost complete analysis of her protocol (there are a few explicitly declared shortcuts that help simplify the presentation without hiding any important aspects). For additional background you can also consult the full <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp.pdf">10-week notes</a>. Comments on the notes are welcome; I’m afraid they most likely contain numerous typos so if you find any please feel free to correct them directly on the associated <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/9892211158zrwmqnxtvcxm">overleaf document</a>.</p>



<p>The last three lectures of the course will be devoted to the problem of testing under spatial assumptions, building up to an introduction to the proof of MIP* = RE. If all goes well I’ll aim to prepare some stand-alone notes for that part as well.</p></div>

<p>Today’s online world and the emerging internet of things is built around a Faustian bargain:  consumers (and their internet of things) hand over their data, and in return get customization of the world to their needs.  Is this exchange of privacy for convenience inherent? At first sight one sees no way around because, of course, to allow machine learning on our data we have to hand our data over to the training algorithm.</p>

<p>Similar issues arise in settings other than consumer devices. For instance, hospitals may wish to pool together their patient data to train a large deep model. But privacy laws such as HIPAA forbid them from sharing the data itself, so somehow they have to train a deep net on their data without revealing their data. Frameworks such as Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) have been proposed for this but it is known that sharing gradients in that environment leaks a lot of information about the data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935">Zhu et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p>Methods to achieve some of the above  so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicit in today’s organization of the online world.</p>

<p>This blog post discusses the current set of solutions,  how they don’t quite suffice for above questions, and the story of a new solution, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02772">InstaHide</a>, that we proposed, and takeaways from a recent attack on it by a Google team.</p>

<h2 id="existing-solutions-in-cryptography">Existing solutions in Cryptography</h2>

<p>Classic solutions in cryptography do allow you to in principle outsource any computation to the cloud without revealing your data. (A modern method is Fully Homomorphic Encryption.) Adapting these ideas to machine learning  presents two major obstacles: (a) (serious issue) huge computational overhead, which essentially rules it out for today’s large scale deep models (b) (less serious issue) need for special setups —e.g., requiring every user to sign up for public-key encryption.</p>

<p>Significant research efforts are being made to try to overcome these obstacles and we won’t survey them here.</p>

<h2 id="differential-privacy-dp">Differential Privacy (DP)</h2>

<p>Differential privacy (<a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2006/40040493/40040493.pdf">Dwork et al., 2006</a>, <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">Dwork&amp;Roth, 2014</a>) involves adding carefully calculated amounts of noise during training. This is a modern and rigorous version of classic    <em>data anonymization</em> techniques whose canonical application is release of noised census data to protect privacy of individuals.</p>

<p>This notion was adapted to machine learning by positing that “privacy” in machine learning refers to trained classifiers not being dependent on data of individuals. In other words, if the classifier is trained on data from N individuals, it’s behavior should be essentially unchanged (statistically speaking) if we omit data from any individual. Note that this is a weak notion of privacy: it does not in any way hide the data from the company.</p>

<p>Many tech companies have adopted differential privacy in deployed systems but the following two caveats are important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 1): In deep learning applications, DP’s provable guarantees are very weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying DP to deep learning involves noticing that the gradient computation amounts to adding gradients of the loss corresponding to individual data points, and that adding noise to those individual gradients in calculated doses can help make the overall classifier limit its dependence on the individual’s datapoint.</p>

<p>In practice provable bounds require adding so much gradient noise that accuracy of the trained classifier plummets. We do not know of any successful training that achieved accuracy &gt; 75 percent on CIFAR10 (or any that achieved accuracy even 10 percent on ImageNet). Furthermore, achieving this level of accuracy involves <strong>pretraining</strong> the classifier model on a large set of <strong>public</strong> images and then using the private/protected images  only to fine-tune the parameters.</p>

<p>Thus it is no surprise that firms today usually apply DP with very low noise level, which give essentially no guarantees. Which brings us to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 2): DP’s guarantees (and even weaker guarantees applying to deployment scenarios) possibly act as a fig leaf that allows firms to not address  the kinds of privacy violations that the person on the street actually worries about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DP’s provable guarantee (which as noted, does not hold in deployed systems due to the low noise level used) would only ensure that  a deployed ML software that was trained with data from tens of millions of users will not accidentally reveal private information of any user.</p>

<p>But that threat model would seem remote to the person on the street. The privacy issue they worry about more is that copious amounts of our data are continuously collected/stored/mined/sold, often by entities we do not even know about. While  lax regulation is primarily to blame,  there is also the technical hurdle  that  there  is no <strong>practical way</strong> for consumers to hide their data while at the same time benefiting from customized ML solutions that improve their lives.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the question we started with: <em>Could consumers allow machine learning to be done on their data without revealing their data?</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proposed-solution-instahide">A proposed solution: InstaHide</h2>

<p>InstaHide is a new concept: it hides or “encrypts” images to protect them somewhat,  while still allowing standard deep learning pipelines to be applied on them. The deep model is trained entirely on encrypted images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The training speed and accuracy is only slightly worse than vanilla training: one can achieve a test accuracy of ~ 90 percent on CIFAR10 using encrypted images with a computation overhead $&lt; 5$ percent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to privacy, like every other form of cryptography, its security is based upon conjectured difficulty of the underlying computational problem.
(But we don’t expect breaking it to be as difficult as say breaking RSA.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-instahide-encryption-works">How InstaHide encryption works</h3>

<p>Here are some details. InstaHide  belongs to the class of subset-sum type encryptions (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/biwx.pdf">Bhattacharyya et al., 2011</a>), and was inspired by a data augmentation technique called Mixup (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). It views images as vectors of pixel values. With vectors you can take linear combinations. The figure below shows the result of a typical MixUp: adding  0.6 times the bird image  with 0.4 times the airplane image. The image labels can also be treated as one-hot vectors, and they are mixed using the same coefficients in front of the image samples.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="60%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/mixup.png" />
</p>

<p>To encrypt the bird image, InstaHide does mixup (i.e., combination with nonnegative coefficients) with one other randomly chosen training image, and with two  other images chosen randomly from a large public dataset like imagenet.  The coefficients 0.6., 0.4 etc. in the figure  are also chosen at random. Then it takes this composite image and for every pixel value, it randomly flips the sign. With that, we get the encrypted images and labels. All random choices made in this encryption act as a one-time key that is never re-used to encrypt other images.</p>

<p>InstaHide has a parameter $k$ denoting how many images are mixed; in the picture, we have $k=4$. The figure below shows this encryption mechanism.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="80%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/instahide.png" />
</p>

<p>When plugged into the standard deep learning with a private dataset of $n$ images, in each epoch of training (say $T$ epochs in total), InstaHide will re-encrypt each image in the  dataset using a random one-time key. This will gives $n\times T$ encrypted images in total.</p>

<h3 id="the-security-argument">The security argument</h3>

<p>We conjectured, based upon intuitions from computational complexity of the k-vector-subset-sum problem (citations), that extracting information about the images could time $N^{k-2}$. Here $N$, the size of the public dataset, can be tens or hundreds of millions, so it might be infeasible for real-life attackers.</p>

<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/Hazelsuko07/InstaHide_Challenge">challenge dataset</a> with $k=6, n=100, T=50$ to enable further investigation of InstaHide’s security.</p>

<h2 id="google-teams-recent-attack-on-instahide">Google Team’s recent attack on InstaHide</h2>

<p>Recently, researchers at Google have shared with us a manuscript with a two-step reconstruction attack (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05315.pdf">Carlini et al., 2020</a>)  against InstaHide.</p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: They used 11 hours on Google’s best GPUs to get partial recovery of our 100 challenge encryptions and  120 CPU hours to break the encryption completely. Furthermore, the latter was possible entirely because we used an insecure random number generator, and they used exhaustive search over random seeds.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now the details.</p>

<p>The attack takes $n\times T$ InstaHide-encrypted images as the input, ($n$ is the size of the private dataset, $T$ is the number of training epochs), and returns a reconstruction of the private dataset. It goes as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Map $n \times T$ encryptions into $n$ private images, by clustering encryptions of a same private image as a group. This is achieved by firstly building a graph representing pairwise similarity between encrypted images, and then assign each encryption a private image. In their implementation, they train a neural network to annotate pairwise similarity between encryptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, given the encrypted images and the mapping, they solve a nonlinear optimization problem via gradient desent to recover an approximation of the original private dataset.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using Google’s powerful GPU, it took them 10 hours to train the neural network for similarity annotation, and about another hour to get an approximation of our challenge set of $100$ images with $k=6, n=100, T=50$. This gave them vaguely correct images, with significant unclear areas and color shift.</p>

<p>They also proposed a different strategy which abuses the vulnerability of NumPy and PyTorch’s random number generator (<em>Aargh; we didn’t use a secure random number generator.</em>) They did  brute force search of $2^{32}$ possible initial random seeds, which allows them to reproduce the randomness during encryption, and thus perform a pixel-perfect reconstruction. As they reported, this attack takes 120 CPU hours (they parallelize across 100 cores to obtain the solution in a little over an hour). We will have this implementation flaw fixed in an updated version.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-this-attack">Thoughts on this attack</h3>

<p>Though the attack is clever and impressive, we feel that the long-term take-away is still unclear for several reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variants of InstaHide seem to evade the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The challenge set contained 50 encryptions each of 100 images. This corresponds to using encrypted images for 50 epochs. But as done in existing settings that use DP, one can pretrain the deep model using non-private images and then fine-tune it with fewer epochs of the private images. Using a similar pipeline DPSGD (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133">Abadi et al., 2016</a>), by pretraining a ResNet-18 on CIFAR100 (the public dataset) and finetuning  for $10$ epochs on CIFAR10 (the private dataset)  gives accuracy of 83 percent, still far better than any provable guarantees using DP on this dataset. The Google team conceded that their attack probably would not work in this setting.</p>

<p>Similarly using InstaHide purely at inference time (i.e., using ML, instead of training ML) still should be completely secure since only one encryption of the image is released. The Google attack can’t work here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InstaHide was never intended to be a mission-critical encryption like RSA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>InstaHide is designed to give users and the internet of things a <em>light-weight</em> encryption method that allows them to use machine learning without giving eavesdroppers or servers access to their raw data. There is no other cost-effective alternative to InstaHide for this application. If it takes Google’s powerful computers a few hours  to break our challenge set of 100 images, this is not yet a cost-effective attack  in the intended settings.</p>

<p>More important, the challenge dataset corresponded to an ambitious form of security, where the encrypted images themselves are released to the world. The more typical application is a Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) scenario: the adversary observes shared gradients that are computed using encrypted images (he also has access to the trained model). The attacks in this paper do not currently apply to that scenario. This is also the idea in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06053"><strong>TextHide</strong></a>, an adaptation of InstaHide to text data.</p>

<h2 id="takeways">Takeways</h2>

<p>Users need lightweight encryptions that can be applied in real time to large amounts of data, and yet allow them to take benefit of Machine Learning on the cloud. Methods to do so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicitly assumed in today’s tech world.</p>

<p>InstaHide is the only such tool right now, and we now know that it provides moderate security that may be enough for many applications.</p></div>

<p>My latest preprint is “Stack-number is not bounded by queue-number”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04195">arXiv:2011.04195</a>, with Vida Dujmović, Robert Hickingbotham, Pat Morin, and David R. Wood; Hickingbotham is an undergraduate student of Wood at Monash University. It solves a question implicit in the work of Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0405031">1992</a>) on whether graphs of bounded queue number have bounded stack number (they don’t), disproves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankenship%E2%80%93Oporowski_conjecture">a conjecture of Blankenship and Oporowski</a> (1999) on whether subdividing a graph of unbounded stack number can reduce its stack number to bounded (it can), and answers a question of Bonnet, Geniet, Kim, Thomassé, and Watrigant (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09877">to appear at SODA 2021</a>) on whether graphs of unbounded stacknumber can have bounded sparse twin-width (they can). And it does so in part using an old trick from combinatorial game theory from a mathematician who won a Nobel prize for his work in game theory. But what are stack number and queue number? And what could combinatorial games possibly have to do with these sorts of questions in structural graph theory?</p>

<p>The game in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)">Hex</a>, in which two players take turns placing their stones on hexagonal cells connected into a triangular grid and arranged in a rhombus. Each player tries to form a path of stones connecting two sides of the rhombus while simultaneously trying to block the other player from making a path. The rendering below from <a href="https://www.hexwiki.net/">HexWiki</a> shows a Hex board with a game in progress:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/HexWiki.jpg" alt="CC-BY-SA POV-Ray image of a Hex game, by Twixter on HexWiki, from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hexposition02.jpg and https://www.hexwiki.net/index.php/File:Hexposition02.jpg" /></p>

<p>In tic-tac-toe, a similar game on a square grid, both players can end up blocking each other, producing a drawn game. But as John Nash famously proved in 1952, this can’t happen in Hex: every game ends with one or the other player forming a path. This inability to draw is usually explained as a topological property of disks in the plane, equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem">Brouwer fixed-point theorem</a>, although it also has a simple combinatorial proof involving walking along the boundary between the two colors of stones on a filled board, starting from a corner of the rhombus, and observing that the walk can only end at a non-opposite corner. But the lack of draws also implies the following statement about graphs: if you form a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_tiling">triangular grid</a> (the graph of positions and adjacencies of stones in Hex), and label its vertices with two colors (the colors of the stones of the two Hex players), then it must contain a long path: at least long enough to reach from one side of the Hex board to the other.</p>

<p>The same combinatorial proof for the Hex board works for any planar triangulation of a disk whose boundary can be divided into four paths with opposite pairs of paths far apart. Even some outerplanar graphs have the same long-path property. Suppose, for instance, that an outerplanar triangulated disk has a complete binary tree for its dual graph. Then we can form a long path by starting at a vertex of the root triangle and repeatedly walking down the tree, at each step moving to a neighbor of the same color whose triangle is closest in the dual tree. This walk takes a long step (such as the step on the top edge of the red path shown below) only when stepping from a vertex whose neighbors include a long path of the other color (the blue path shown below), and otherwise it takes many steps.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/outerplanar-path-property.svg" alt="An outerplanar graph in which every 2-coloring has a long monochromatic path" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, the square grid or other bipartite graphs don’t have the long path property, because if you color them bipartitely then there are no nontrivial monochromatic paths. Neither do subcubic graphs, because their maximum cuts always partition them into two subsets whose longest path has length at most one. The Hex board graph turns out to be the right choice for our purposes, because as well as the long path property it has bounded degree (unlike the outerplanar example) and a nice regular planar structure making stack and queue layouts easy.</p>

<p>So what are these layouts? Stack layout is another name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_embedding">book embedding</a>, in which the vertices of a graph are arranged in a line and its edges are placed without crossings into “pages”, half-planes bounded by the line. If you traverse the vertices of the graph in the order of the line, add an edge to its page when you traverse its first endpoint, and remove an edge from the page when you traverse the second endpoint, then the order of additions and removals is last-in-first-out, the same as a stack. The stack number or book thickness is the smallest number of pages you need to construct a layout like this. Below is an <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2015/10/03/why-shallow-minors.html">example I’ve used before</a>, a 3-page book embedding of the complete graph \(K_5\), whose stack number is three:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2015/3page-K5.svg" alt="Book embedding" /></p>

<p>If you replace the last-in-first-out ordering of additions and removals in a stack by first-in-first-out ordering, you get a queue. So a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_number">queue layout</a> is just an ordering of the vertices into a line, and a partition of the edges into “pages”, so that the traversal of the vertices by their line order produces a queue ordering of additions and removals of edges within each page. As <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18469-7_7">Auer et al described at GD 2010</a>, these layouts can also be described topologically, by representing each page as a cylinder with the line going longitudinally along it, and requiring each edge to be placed in such a way that it loops all the way around the cylinder. The queue number is the minimum number of these queues, or cylindrical pages, that you need to organize the graph in this way. It’s also closely related to the compact layout of graphs in 3d.</p>

<p>Below is an example I recently drew for a new Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffle-exchange_network">shuffle-exchange networks</a>. These are very nonplanar graphs, but the layout shown can almost be drawn without crossings on two cylinders (one for the edges that bend around the left side of the vertices, another for the edges on the right) or on a single surface with a figure-eight cross-section, formed by gluing two cylinders together on a line. However, this only takes care of the curved edges. If you look closely, there are also short horizontal edges between consecutive vertices, which in a queue layout would need to wrap around another third cylinder. So these graphs have queue number at most three.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/Order-4_shuffle-exchange.svg" alt="Shuffle-exchange network" /></p>

<p>With all that as background, the central example in our new preprint is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs">Cartesian product</a> of a triangular grid with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)">star</a>. It looks like this, but possibly with a bigger grid or star:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/star-times-hex.svg" alt="Cartesian product of a star with a triangular grid" /></p>

<p>The reason Cartesian products are useful in this context is that they behave nicely for queue layouts but not quite as nicely for stack layouts. If two graphs \(G\) and \(H\) both have queue layouts with a bounded number of queues, and in addition the layout of \(H\) is <em>strict</em>, meaning that within each page, each vertex has at most one earlier and one later neighbor, then we can lay out their product by grouping the vertices of the product into copies of \(G\) and placing each copy separately, with the order of the copies determined by the layout of \(H\). The resulting layout will still have a bounded queue number.  The star has bounded queue number, but its layouts are not strict, because it has high degree at the center of the star. As a planar graph the triangular grid has bounded queue number, and because it also has bounded degree its layouts can be made strict. Therefore, the product graph again has bounded queue number.</p>

<p>For stack layouts, a similar product layout works, but only when \(H\) is bipartite. We can reverse the ordering within the copies of \(G\) coming from one side of the bipartition, and the edges going from one copy to another will still be stack-ordered. But when \(H\) is not bipartite, there is no way to consistently choose which copies of \(G\) to reverse. The long path property of Hex boards, in some sense, provides a quantitative measure for the fact that their graphs are far from being bipartite.</p>

<p>Of course, this only shows that a certain stack layout doesn’t work, not that all layouts fail. Our proof that all stack layouts of our product graph fail proceeds in a sequence of reductions in which we assume we are given a layout, and successively reduce it to more-constrained layouts on smaller graphs until reaching a contradiction. The first reductions use the pigeonhole principle to find products of the grid with a smaller star, in which all leaf copies of the grid have the same layout. Next we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">Erdős–Szekeres theorem</a> to find a product with an even smaller star, in which each copy of the star is consistently ordered by the layout in one of two ways. Finally, we use the result about long paths in Hex to find a product of this small star with a path, in which all copies of the star are consistently ordered in the same way, and prove that this ordering of this graph cannot have a bounded stack number.</p>

<p>Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg introduced both stack number and queue number in their 1992 work, and provided an example for which the stack number is exponentially bigger than the queue number, naturally raising the question whether even bigger separations are possible. Our work settles this question by showing that there is no function (exponential or otherwise) that can be used to bound stack number as a function of queue number. In the opposite direction, Heath, Leighton &amp; Rosenberg conjectured that queue number cannot be made to grow significantly more quickly than stack number, but this remains open.</p>

<p>In 1999, Blankenship and Oporowski observed that subdividing the edges of a graph can lead to better stack layouts: for instance adding a single subdivision point to each edge of a complete graph reduces the stack number from linear to the square root of the number of vertices. They conjectured that this improvement cannot be too extreme: reducing the stack number from non-constant to constant should require a non-constant number of subdivision points. Our example disproves the Blankenship–Oporowski conjecture. The star-triangular grid product graph has non-constant stack number, but because it has bounded queue number its subdivisions with three subdivision points per edge have bounded stack number, according to a result of Dujmović and Wood (<a href="https://dmtcs.episciences.org/346">2005</a>). The same paper of Dujmović and Wood also stated the question of whether stack number can be bounded by a function of queue number more explicitly.</p>

<p>The definition of twin-width is too technical to summarize here; see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09877">forthcoming SODA paper by Bonnet et al.</a>, which shows among other results that it is bounded for graphs of bounded stack number. Our results show that this is not an equivalence: there exist graphs (including the star-triangular grid products) that have unbounded stack number, but still have bounded sparse twin-width.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity of voting schemes to mistakes and manipulations</h2>
<p>Do the results of the recent election accurately reflect public opinion?<br />
Or are they the result of some minor local manipulations, and a few random<br />
mistakes such as voters confusion, or counting errors.</p>
<p>There are many potential schemes for electing a president, each with its<br />
own features. One important feature of a scheme is the agreement of the<br />
actual outcome of the election with the outcome of the ideal<br />
implementation of the election which disregards potential mistakes and<br />
mischief. If it is probable that the ideal and the actual outcomes differ,<br />
then frequently the outcome of the election will be in doubt.</p>
<p>In recent years, some mathematical efforts have been devoted to trying to<br />
understand which procedures are “stable” to these potential perturbations<br />
and which are “sensitive”. While the motivation for these studies came<br />
from questions in probability and statistical physics, These mathematical<br />
studies can shed some light on the current presidential election. In<br />
particular, a recent paper by Professors Itai Benjamini and Oded Schramm<br />
from Microsoft research and the Weizmann Institute and Gil Kalai from the<br />
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, soon to be published in the prestigious<br />
French journal Publication I.H.E.S., suggests that the “popular vote”<br />
method is much more stable against mistakes than other voting method.</p>
<p>One example of a decision procedure that we encounter in nature is the<br />
neuron. The neuron has to make its decisions based on many inputs; each<br />
represents the strength of electrical currents at the synapses entering<br />
the neuron. Based on these inputs, the neuron should decide whether to<br />
fire its axon going out of the neuron. It is quite likely that some small<br />
perturbations occur at each of the input synapses. It is therefore<br />
expected that the decision procedure of the neuron will be “stable” to<br />
these perturbations.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence indicates that neurons may be modeled as the<br />
following simple procedure. The neuron looks at some weighted sum of its<br />
inputs and makes a decision according to how large this sum is . If the<br />
sum is large, then one decision is made , while if it is small another<br />
decision is made .</p>
<p>The counterpart of this procedure for elections would be counting the<br />
votes and deciding according to the majority of the votes. Mathematical<br />
proofs have been given to show that this decision procedure is the most<br />
stable among all decision procedures.</p>
<p>More complicated neural networks consist of a hierarchy of neurons where<br />
the outputs of neurons in lower levels of the hierarchy are the inputs to<br />
neurons in the higher levels. Some of these networks have been proven to<br />
be much more sensitive to noise than a single neuron.</p>
<p>The counterpart of neural network in the political system may sound<br />
familiar: The voters are divided into groups (states) and each group<br />
chooses its candidate based on the majority vote. Then some weighted<br />
majority of the votes of the states is taken to be the elected president.</p>
<p>The mathematical theorems imply that this system is much more sensitive to<br />
minor mistakes.</p>
<p>If the overwhelming majority of the population is voting for the same<br />
candidate then it doesn’t really matter which voting scheme we use. All of<br />
the natural schemes are “stable”. On the other hand, when the population<br />
is almost evenly split, different schemes behave differently.</p>
<p>The mathematical reasoning behind the stability of the majority vote goes<br />
back to Abraham DeMoivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace (18th century). This<br />
reasoning implies, for example, that in a population of 98,221,798 votes,<br />
if there is a bias of 222,880 for one candidate, then this candidate will<br />
be chosen, even if for each voter there is a small chance that his or her<br />
vote is not counted or counted wrongly (the results of the last election<br />
as of 11/13/00). As long as mistakes for both sides are equally likely,<br />
the result will correctly reflect the bias in the public opinion.</p>
<p>Thus, in this presidential election while the gap between the two<br />
candidates is only 0.2% of the votes it is still large enough so that the<br />
outcome is immune even if a fairly large percent (10% for example) of the<br />
votes were counted mistakenly (assuming the mistakes were random and<br />
independent.)</p>
<p>On the other hand the gap of a 388 votes among the 6,000,000 million votes<br />
in Florida (about 0.05% of the votes) may well be too small to overcome<br />
the effect of random mistakes in counting the votes, even if the chance<br />
for a mistake is fairly small (1%, say). It can well be argued that just<br />
because of the (unavoidable) mistakes in counting the votes in Florida<br />
(putting aside all other controversies surrounding the vote there) we will<br />
never be able to know who got the majority of votes among the voters of<br />
Florida. To understand why the picture is so different as far as the<br />
popular vote is concerns in the entire nation and the popular vote in the<br />
state of Florida we should note that the stability against mistakes<br />
increases dramatically as the number of voters rise. (And also, of course,<br />
as the gap between the candidates rise.)</p>
<p>The discrepancy between our ability to call the winner in the popular vote<br />
and disability to call the winner in the electoral college (which is the<br />
winner of the election according to the constitution) is not unexpected.</p>
<p>The new results by Benjamini, Schramm and Kalai show that for many models<br />
majority is the scheme which is least sensitive to noise. In these models<br />
it is assumed that voters make their decisions independently and the<br />
mistakes are symmetric and independent for different voters. It is shown<br />
then that for models resembling the current voting scheme in the U.S.A, if<br />
the population is almost evenly split, the scheme is much more sensitive<br />
to noise than the majority scheme. In particular a tiny fraction of<br />
mistakes is very likely to reverse the ideal outcome of the election.<br />
Moreover, if the elections are almost balanced, then the results are too<br />
close to call.</p>
<p>If the outcomes do not show significant bias towards one of the candidates<br />
then in the “popular-vote” method the probability of random independent<br />
mistakes which effect one in every A votes has a chance of one in the<br />
square-root of A to switch the outcome of the elections. In a method like<br />
the “electoral college” the chance is increased to something like one in<br />
the fourth root of A.</p>
<p>If the popular vote is significantly tilted towards one of the candidates<br />
than the effect of mistakes becomes smaller for all voting methods but<br />
much more so for the popular-vote method.</p>
<p>The study of the sensitivity of voting procedures to small errors for such<br />
models is based on mathematical tools from “harmonic analysis”, and<br />
provides a classification of the voting schemes which are very sensitive<br />
to small amounts of noise and those which are more stable. In particular<br />
among all symmetric voting procedures (i.e., all voters have the same<br />
power), the popular majority is the most robust.</p>
<p>For further technical reading and the precise formulation of the<br />
mathematical theorems see <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.PR/9811157" rel="nofollow">http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.PR/9811157</a></p>
<p>A word of warning is in place. The precise expected effect of mistakes<br />
will depend on the specific statistical model for the voting patterns and<br />
for the noise created by counting errors and biases. For example, more<br />
recent work by Claire Kanyon from Orsay university, Elchanan Mossel from<br />
Microsoft research and Yuval Peres from Berkeley and the Hebrew<br />
University, gives quite a different picture for different models based on<br />
the famous “Ising model” from Physics. We expect that the qualitative<br />
conclusion of the research by Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm applied to the<br />
case of U.S. presidential elections and that the popular vote method is<br />
much more stable to noise and biases than the electoral college method.<br />
For definite conclusions, however, some statistical work on actual voting<br />
data should be carried out. Choosing the most appropriate voting method<br />
involve, of course, many, primarily non-mathematical considerations.</p>

(IEEE Trans.~Inform.~Theory, 1968) to learn a tree-structured graphical model
of a distribution. For a distribution $P$ on $\Sigma^n$ and a tree $T$ on $n$
nodes, we say $T$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximate tree for $P$ if there is a
$T$-structured distribution $Q$ such that $D(P\;||\;Q)$ is at most
$\varepsilon$ more than the best possible tree-structured distribution for $P$.
We show that if $P$ itself is tree-structured, then the Chow-Liu algorithm with
the plug-in estimator for mutual information with $\widetilde{O}(|\Sigma|^3

for $P$ with constant probability. In contrast, for a general $P$ (which may
not be tree-structured), $\Omega(n^2\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples are necessary to
find an $\varepsilon$-approximate tree. Our upper bound is based on a new
conditional independence tester that addresses an open problem posed by
Canonne, Diakonikolas, Kane, and Stewart~(STOC, 2018): we prove that for three
random variables $X,Y,Z$ each over $\Sigma$, testing if $I(X; Y \mid Z)$ is $0$
or $\geq \varepsilon$ is possible with $\widetilde{O}(|\Sigma|^3/\varepsilon)$

(|\Sigma|^2n\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples from a distribution $P$ over $\Sigma^n$,
one can efficiently learn the closest $T$-structured distribution in KL
divergence by applying the add-1 estimator at each node.

for recommender systems and least-squares regression that are comparable to
their quantum analogues. De-quantizing such algorithms has received a flurry of
attention in recent years; we obtain sharper bounds for these problems. More
significantly, we achieve these improvements by arguing that the previous
quantum-inspired algorithms for these problems are doing leverage or
ridge-leverage score sampling in disguise. With this recognition, we are able
to employ the large body of work in numerical linear algebra to obtain
algorithms for these problems that are simpler and faster than existing
approaches.
</p>
<p>We also consider static data structures for the above problems, and obtain
close-to-optimal bounds for them. To do this, we introduce a new randomized
transform, the Gaussian Randomized Hadamard Transform (GRHT). It was thought in
the numerical linear algebra community that to obtain nearly-optimal bounds for
various problems such as rank computation, finding a maximal linearly
independent subset of columns, regression, low rank approximation, maximum
matching on general graphs and linear matroid union, that one would need to
resolve the main open question of Cohen (SODA, 2016) regarding the logarithmic
factors in existing oblivious subspace embeddings. We bypass this question,
using GRHT, and obtain optimal or nearly-optimal bounds for these problems. For
the fundamental problems of rank computation and finding a linearly independent
subset of columns, our algorithms improve Cheung, Kwok, and Lau (JACM, 2013)
and are optimal to within a constant factor and a $\log\log(n)$-factor,
respectively. Further, for constant factor regression and low rank
approximation we give the first optimal algorithms, for the current matrix
multiplication exponent.

translations tile $\mathbb{R}^n$? Since any such body must have volume $1$, the
isoperimetric inequality implies that its surface area must be at least
$\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Remarkably, Kindler et al.\ showed that for general bodies
$B$ this is tight, i.e.\ that there is a tiling body of $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose
surface area is $O(\sqrt{n})$.
</p>
<p>In theoretical computer science, the tiling problem is intimately to the
study of parallel repetition theorems (which are an important component in
PCPs), and more specifically in the question of whether a "strong version" of
the parallel repetition theorem holds. Raz showed, using the odd cycle game,
that strong parallel repetition fails in general, and subsequently these ideas
were used in order to construct non-trivial tilings of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, motivated by the study of a symmetric parallel repetition, we
consider the symmetric variant of the tiling problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show
that any symmetric body that tiles $\mathbb{R}^n$ must have surface area at
least $\Omega(n/\sqrt{\log n})$, and that this bound is tight, i.e.\ that there
is a symmetric tiling body of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with surface area $O(n/\sqrt{\log
n})$. We also give matching bounds for the value of the symmetric parallel
repetition of Raz's odd cycle game.
</p>
<p>Our result suggests that while strong parallel repetition fails in general,
there may be important special cases where it still applies.

This technique only applies when the union $U$ of the computed shortest paths
is a forest. We show that given a plane undirected weighted graph $U$ and a set

the lengths of $k$ non-crossing shortest paths joining the $k$ terminal pairs

is the number of edges in $\pi$. As a consequence, the problem of computing
multi-terminal distances in a plane undirected weighted graph can always be
solved in $O(n \log k)$ worst-case time.

distance between any pair of vertices. Computing the Diameter of a graph with
$m$ edges requires $m^{2-o(1)}$ time under the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH), which can be prohibitive for very large graphs, so efficient
approximation algorithms for Diameter are desired.
</p>
<p>There is a folklore algorithm that gives a $2$-approximation for Diameter in
$\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Additionally, a line of work concludes with a
$3/2$-approximation algorithm for Diameter in weighted directed graphs that
runs in $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time. The $3/2$-approximation algorithm is known
to be tight under SETH: Roditty and Vassilevska W. proved that under SETH any
$3/2-\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for Diameter in undirected unweighted
graphs requires $m^{2-o(1)}$ time, and then Backurs, Roditty, Segal,
Vassilevska W., and Wein and the follow-up work of Li proved that under SETH
any $5/3-\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for Diameter in undirected
unweighted graphs requires $m^{3/2-o(1)}$ time.
</p>
<p>Whether or not the folklore 2-approximation algorithm is tight, however, is
unknown, and has been explicitly posed as an open problem in numerous papers.
Towards this question, Bonnet recently proved that under SETH, any
$7/4-\epsilon$ approximation requires $m^{4/3-o(1)}$, only for directed
weighted graphs.
</p>
<p>We completely resolve this question for directed graphs by proving that the
folklore 2-approximation algorithm is conditionally optimal. In doing so, we
obtain a series of conditional lower bounds that together with prior work, give
a complete time-accuracy trade-off that is tight with all known algorithms for
directed graphs. Specifically, we prove that under SETH for any $\delta&gt;0$, a
$(\frac{2k-1}{k}-\delta)$-approximation algorithm for Diameter on directed
unweighted graphs requires $m^{\frac{k}{k-1}-o(1)}$ time.

random variables having only Bernoulli access to their parameters. Bernoulli
access to a parameter $p \in [0,1]$ means the algorithm does not know $p$, but
has sample access to independent draws of a Bernoulli random variable with mean
equal to $p$. In this paper, we study the problem of Bernoulli factories for
polytopes: given Bernoulli access to a vector $x\in \mathcal{P}$ for a given
polytope $\mathcal{P}\subset [0,1]^n$, output a randomized vertex such that the
expected value of the $i$-th coordinate is \emph{exactly} equal to $x_i$. For
example, for the special case of the perfect matching polytope, one is given
Bernoulli access to the entries of a doubly stochastic matrix $[x_{ij}]$ and
asked to sample a matching such that the probability of each edge $(i,j)$ be
present in the matching is exactly equal to $x_{ij}$.
</p>
<p>We show that a polytope $\mathcal{P}$ admits a Bernoulli factory if and and
only if $\mathcal{P}$ is the intersection of $[0,1]^n$ with an affine subspace.
Our construction is based on an algebraic formulation of the problem, involving
identifying a family of Bernstein polynomials (one per vertex) that satisfy a
certain algebraic identity on $\mathcal{P}$. The main technical tool behind our
construction is a connection between these polynomials and the geometry of
zonotope tilings. We apply these results to construct an explicit factory for
the perfect matching polytope. The resulting factory is deeply connected to the
combinatorial enumeration of arborescences and may be of independent interest.
For the $k$-uniform matroid polytope, we recover a sampling procedure known in
statistics as Sampford sampling.

integers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$ and a target integer $t$ with $t &gt; a_i$ for all $i$,
determine if there is an $S \subseteq [n]$ such that $\sum_{i \in S} a_i = t$.
The well-known pseudopolynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm [Bellman,
1957] solves Subset Sum in $O(nt)$ time, while requiring $\Omega(t)$ space.
</p>
<p>In this paper we present algorithms for Subset Sum with $\tilde O(nt)$
running time and much lower space requirements than Bellman's algorithm, as
well as that of prior work. We show that Subset Sum can be solved in $\tilde
O(nt)$ time and $O(\log(nt))$ space with access to $O(\log n \log \log n+\log
t)$ random bits. This significantly improves upon the $\tilde O(n
t^{1+\varepsilon})$-time, $\tilde O(n\log t)$-space algorithm of Bringmann
(SODA 2017). We also give an $\tilde O(n^{1+\varepsilon}t)$-time,
$O(\log(nt))$-space randomized algorithm, improving upon previous
$(nt)^{O(1)}$-time $O(\log(nt))$-space algorithms by Elberfeld, Jakoby, and
Tantau (FOCS 2010), and Kane (2010). In addition, we also give a $\mathrm{poly}
\log(nt)$-space, $\tilde O(n^2 t)$-time deterministic algorithm.
</p>
<p>We also study time-space trade-offs for Subset Sum. For parameter $1\le k\le
\min\{n,t\}$, we present a randomized algorithm running in $\tilde O((n+t)\cdot
k)$ time and $O((t/k) \mathrm{polylog} (nt))$ space.
</p>
<p>As an application of our results, we give an
$\tilde{O}(\min\{n^2/\varepsilon, n/\varepsilon^2\})$-time and
$\mathrm{polylog}(nt)$-space algorithm for "weak" $\varepsilon$-approximations
of Subset Sum.

$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, for any fixed constant $d \geq 2$. We
determine the optimal dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the running time of an
algorithm that computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate tour, under a plausible
assumption. Specifically, we give an algorithm that runs in
$2^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})} n\log n$ time. This improves the
previously smallest dependence on $\varepsilon$ in the running time
$(1/\varepsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}n \log n$ of the algorithm
by Rao and Smith (STOC 1998). We also show that a
$2^{o(1/\varepsilon^{d-1})}\text{poly}(n)$ algorithm would violate the
Gap-Exponential Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH).
</p>
<p>Our new algorithm builds upon the celebrated quadtree-based methods initially
proposed by Arora (J. ACM 1998), but it adds a simple new idea that we call
\emph{sparsity-sensitive patching}. On a high level this lets the granularity
with which we simplify the tour depend on how sparse it is locally. Our
approach is (arguably) simpler than the one by Rao and Smith since it can work
without geometric spanners. We demonstrate the technique extends easily to
other problems, by showing as an example that it also yields a Gap-ETH-tight
approximation scheme for Rectilinear Steiner Tree.

quantum-inspired moves in mathematical games with perfect information and no
chance. The beauty of quantum games-succinct in representation, rich in
structures, explosive in complexity, dazzling for visualization, and
sophisticated for strategic reasoning-has drawn us to play concrete games full
of subtleties and to characterize abstract properties pertinent to complexity
consequence. Going beyond individual games, we explore the tractability of
quantum combinatorial games as whole, and address fundamental questions
including:
</p>
<p>Quantum Leap in Complexity: Are there polynomial-time solvable games whose
quantum extensions are intractable?
</p>
<p>Quantum Collapses in Complexity: Are there PSPACE-complete games whose
quantum extensions fall to the lower levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy?
</p>
<p>Quantumness Matters: How do outcome classes and strategies change under
quantum moves? Under what conditions doesn't quantumness matter?
</p>
<p>PSPACE Barrier for Quantum Leap: Can quantum moves launch PSPACE games into
outer polynomial space
</p>
<p>We show that quantum moves not only enrich the game structure, but also
impact their computational complexity. In settling some of these basic
questions, we characterize both the powers and limitations of quantum moves as
well as the superposition of game configurations that they create. Our
constructive proofs-both on the leap of complexity in concrete Quantum Nim and
Quantum Undirected Geography and on the continuous collapses, in the quantum
setting, of complexity in abstract PSPACE-complete games to each level of the
polynomial-time hierarchy-illustrate the striking computational landscape over
quantum games and highlight surprising turns with unexpected quantum impact.
Our studies also enable us to identify several elegant open questions
fundamental to quantum combinatorial game theory (QCGT).

Bulatov</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/r/Rafiey:Akbar.html">Akbar Rafiey</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03700">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>In this paper we consider the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP for short), in
which we are given real polynomials $f_0, f_1, \dots, f_k$ and the question is
to decide whether $f_0$ belongs to the ideal generated by $f_1, \dots, f_k$. In
the more stringent version the task is also to find a proof of this fact. The
IMP underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz,
Polynomial Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. In the majority of such applications
the IMP involves so called combinatorial ideals that arise from a variety of
discrete combinatorial problems. This restriction makes the IMP significantly
easier and in some cases allows for an efficient algorithm to solve it.
</p>
<p>In 2019 Mastrolilli initiated a systematic study of IMPs arising from
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) of the form CSP($\Gamma$), that is, CSPs
in which the type of constraints is limited to relations from a set $\Gamma$.
He described sets $\Gamma$ on a 2-element set that give rise to polynomial time
solvable IMPs and showed that for the remaining ones the problem is hard. We
continue this line of research.
</p>
<p>First, we show that many CSP techniques can be translated to IMPs thus
allowing us to significantly improve the methods of studying the complexity of
the IMP. We also develop universal algebraic techniques for the IMP that have
been so useful in the study of the CSP. This allows us to prove a general
necessary condition for the tractability of the IMP, and three sufficient ones.
The sufficient conditions include IMPs arising from systems of linear equations
over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime, and also some conditions defined through special kinds
of polymorphisms.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/k/Kunisky:Dmitriy.html">Dmitriy Kunisky</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03693">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Analysis of low-degree polynomial algorithms is a powerful, newly-popular
method for predicting computational thresholds in hypothesis testing problems.
One limitation of current techniques for this analysis is their restriction to
Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions. We expand this range of possibilities by
performing the low-degree analysis of hypothesis testing for the Morris class
of exponential families, giving a unified treatment of Gaussian, Poisson,
gamma, binomial, negative binomial, and generalized hyperbolic secant
distributions. We then give several algorithmic applications.
</p>
<p>1. In models where a random signal is observed through an exponential family,
the success or failure of low-degree polynomials is governed by the $z$-score
overlap, the inner product of $z$-score vectors with respect to the null
distribution of two independent copies of the signal.
</p>
<p>2. In the same models, testing with low-degree polynomials exhibits channel
monotonicity: the above distributions admit a total ordering by computational
cost of hypothesis testing, according to a scalar parameter describing how the
variance depends on the mean in an exponential family.
</p>
<p>3. In a spiked matrix model with a particular non-Gaussian noise
distribution, the low-degree prediction is incorrect unless polynomials with
arbitrarily large degree in individual matrix entries are permitted. This shows
that polynomials summing over self-avoiding walks and variants thereof, as
proposed recently by Ding, Hopkins, and Steurer (2020) for spiked matrix models
with heavy-tailed noise, are suboptimal for this model. Thus low-degree
polynomials appear to offer a tradeoff between robustness and strong
performance fine-tuned to specific models, and may struggle with problems
requiring an algorithm to first examine the input and then use some
intermediate computation to choose from one of several inference subroutines.

a globally optimal assignment for Markov Random Fields with Potts pairwise
potentials, with a catch: the returned assignment is only guaranteed to be
optimal in a small perturbation of the original problem instance. In other
words, all local minima with respect to expansion moves are global minima to
slightly perturbed versions of the problem. On "real-world" instances, MAP
assignments of small perturbations of the problem should be very similar to the
MAP assignment(s) of the original problem instance. We design an algorithm that
can certify whether this is the case in practice. On several MAP inference
problem instances from computer vision, this algorithm certifies that MAP
solutions to all of these perturbations are very close to solutions of the
original instance. These results taken together give a cohesive explanation for
the good performance of "graph cuts" algorithms in practice. Every local
expansion minimum is a global minimum in a small perturbation of the problem,
and all of these global minima are close to the original solution.

relationships in networked decision systems ubiquitously. An ordered tree is a
rooted tree where the order of the subtrees (children) of a node is
significant. In combinatorial optimization, generating ordered trees is
relevant to evaluate candidate combinatorial objects. In this paper, we present
an algebraic scheme to generate ordered trees with $n$ vertices with utmost
efficiency; whereby our approach uses $\mathcal{O}(n)$ space and
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ time in average per tree. Our computational studies have shown
the feasibility and efficiency to generate ordered trees in constant time in
average, in about one tenth of a millisecond per ordered tree. Due to the 1-1
bijective nature to other combinatorial classes, our approach is favorable to
study the generation of binary trees with $n$ external nodes, trees with $n$
nodes, legal sequences of $n$ pairs of parentheses, triangulated $n$-gons,
gambler's sequences and lattice paths. We believe our scheme may find its use
in devising algorithms for planning and combinatorial optimization involving
Catalan numbers.

learning mixtures of Gaussians and algorithmic robust statistics. In particular
we give the first provably robust algorithm for learning mixtures of any
constant number of Gaussians. We require only mild assumptions on the mixing
weights (bounded fractionality) and that the total variation distance between
components is bounded away from zero. At the heart of our algorithm is a new
method for proving dimension-independent polynomial identifiability through
applying a carefully chosen sequence of differential operations to certain
generating functions that not only encode the parameters we would like to learn
but also the system of polynomial equations we would like to solve. We show how
the symbolic identities we derive can be directly used to analyze a natural
sum-of-squares relaxation.

large minimum vertex degrees: Every $n$-vertex $2$-connected graph $G$ with
minimum vertex degree $\delta\geq 2$ contains a cycle with at least
$\min\{2\delta,n\}$ vertices. In particular, if $\delta\geq n/2$, then $G$ is
Hamiltonian. The proof of Dirac's theorem is constructive, and it yields an
algorithm computing the corresponding cycle in polynomial time. The
combinatorial bound of Dirac's theorem is tight in the following sense. There
are 2-connected graphs that do not contain cycles of length more than
$2\delta+1$. Also, there are non-Hamiltonian graphs with all vertices but one
of degree at least $n/2$. This prompts naturally to the following algorithmic
questions. For $k\geq 1$,
</p>
<p>(A) How difficult is to decide whether a 2-connected graph contains a cycle
of length at least $\min\{2\delta+k,n\}$?
</p>
<p>(B) How difficult is to decide whether a graph $G$ is Hamiltonian, when at
least $n - k$ vertices of $G$ are of degrees at least $n/2-k$?
</p>
<p>The first question was asked by Fomin, Golovach, Lokshtanov, Panolan,
Saurabh, and Zehavi. The second question is due to Jansen, Kozma, and Nederlof.
Even for a very special case of $k=1$, the existence of a polynomial-time
algorithm deciding whether $G$ contains a cycle of length at least
$\min\{2\delta+1,n\}$ was open. We resolve both questions by proving the
following algorithmic generalization of Dirac's theorem: If all but $k$
vertices of a $2$-connected graph $G$ are of degree at least $\delta$, then
deciding whether $G$ has a cycle of length at least $\min\{2\delta +k, n\}$ can
be done in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$.
</p>
<p>The proof of the algorithmic generalization of Dirac's theorem builds on new
graph-theoretical results that are interesting on their own.

(\acrshort{fd}) has not been widely adopted for large-scale regression tasks.
Prior work has shown randomized sketches (i) perform worse in estimating the

estimating the bias and/or variance on sketched ridge regression. We give the
first constant factor relative error bounds on the bias \&amp; variance for

as patrolling and tracking, information gathering, and pick-up and delivery
problems, offering significantly higher performance than single-robot systems.
A fundamental building block in most multi-robot systems is task allocation:
assigning robots to tasks (e.g., patrolling an area, or servicing a
transportation request) as they appear based on the robots' states to maximize
reward. In many practical situations, the allocation must account for
heterogeneous capabilities (e.g., availability of appropriate sensors or
actuators) to ensure the feasibility of execution, and to promote a higher
reward, over a long time horizon. To this end, we present the FlowDec algorithm
for efficient heterogeneous task-allocation achieving an approximation factor
of at least 1/2 of the optimal reward. Our approach decomposes the
heterogeneous problem into several homogeneous subproblems that can be solved
efficiently using min-cost flow. Through simulation experiments, we show that
our algorithm is faster by several orders of magnitude than a MILP approach.

A famous conjecture of Tuza states that the minimum number of edges needed to cover all the triangles in a graph is at most twice the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles.  This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by Aharoni and Zerbib who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture, and also studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional version of the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically, we give a factor $t/2+ O(\sqrt{t \log t})$ approximation based on LP rounding for an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problem (AHTP). The objective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of $(t-1)$-sized subsets of vertices of an input $t$-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge contains one of these subsets.

Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph versions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and matchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a ``tent" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We give a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free hypergraphs, and indeed $\mathcal{F}$-free hypergraphs for any finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include almost all the vertices.


The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as instances of vertex cover on \emph{simple} hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise share at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor $t$ approximation for vertex cover is hard to improve for simple $t$-uniform hypergraphs. However, for set cover on simple $n$-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm achieves a factor $(\ln n)/2$, better than the optimal $\ln n$ factor for general hypergraphs.</div>

<p>There are people who really, genuinely, believe, as far as you can dig down, that winning is everything—that however many lies they told, allies they betrayed, innocent lives they harmed, etc. etc., it was all justified by the fact that <strong>they won and their enemies lost</strong>.  Faced with such sociopaths, people like me typically feel an irresistible compulsion to <em>counterargue</em>: to make the sociopath realize that winning is <em>not</em> everything, that truth and honor are terminal values as well; to subject the sociopath to the standards by which the rest of us are judged; to find the conscience that the sociopath buried even from himself and drag it out into the light.  Let me know if you can think of any case in human history where such efforts succeeded, because I’m having difficulty doing so.</p>



<p>Clearly, in the vast majority of cases if not in all, the only counterargument that a sociopath will ever understand is <em>losing</em>.  And yet not just any kind of losing suffices.  For victims, there’s an <em>enormous</em> temptation to turn the sociopath’s underhanded tools against him, to win with the same deceit and naked power that the sociopath so gleefully inflicted on others.  And yet, if that’s what it takes to beat him, then you have to imagine the sociopath deriving a certain perverse satisfaction from it.</p>



<p>Think of the movie villain who, as the panting hero stands over him with his lightsaber, taunts “Yes … yes … destroy me!  Do it now!  Feel the hate and the rage flow through you!”  What happens next, of course, is that the hero angrily decides to give the villain one more chance, the ungrateful villain lunges to stab the hero in the back or something, and only then does the villain die—either by a self-inflicted accident, or else killed by the hero in immediate self-defense.  Either way, the hero walks away with victory <em>and</em> honor.</p>



<p>In practice, it’s a tall order to arrange all of that.  This explains why sociopaths are so hard to defeat, and why I feel so bleak and depressed whenever I see one flaunting his power.  But, you know, the great upside of pessimism is that it doesn’t take much to beat your expectations!  Whenever a single sociopath <em>is</em> cleanly and honorably defeated, or even just rendered irrelevant—no matter that the sociopath’s friends and allies are still in power, no matter that they’ll be back to fight another day, etc. etc.—it’s a genuine occasion for rejoicing.</p>



<p>Anyway, that pretty much sums up my thoughts regarding Arthur Chu.  In other news, hooray about the election!</p></div>

Valiant (1980) showed that general arithmetic circuits with negation can be exponentially more powerful than monotone ones. We give the first qualitative improvement to this classical result: we construct a  family of polynomials $P_n$ in $n$ variables, each of its monomials has positive coefficient, such that $P_n$ can be computed by a polynomial-size \emph{depth-three formula} but every monotone circuit computing it has size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/4}/\log(n))}$. 

The polynomial $P_n$ embeds the $\text{SINK}\circ \text{XOR}$ function devised recently by Chattopadhyay, Mande and Sherif (2020) to refute the Log-Approximate-Rank Conjecture in communication complexity. To prove our lower bound for $P_n$, we develop a general connection between corruption of combinatorial rectangles by  any function $f \circ \text{XOR}$ and corruption of product polynomials by a certain polynomial $P^f$ that is an arithmetic embedding of $f$. This connection should be of independent interest.

Using further ideas from communication complexity, we construct another family of set-multilinear polynomials $f_{n,m}$ such that both $F_{n,m} - \epsilon\cdot f_{n,m}$ and $F_{n,m} + \epsilon\cdot f_{n,m}$ have monotone circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(n/\log(n))}$ if $\epsilon \geq 2^{- \Omega( m )}$ and $F_{n,m} = \prod_{i=1}^n \big(x_{i,1} +\cdots+x_{i,m}\big)$, with $m = O( n/\log n )$. The polynomials $f_{n,m}$ have 0/1 coefficients and are in VNP. Proving such lower bounds for monotone circuits has been advocated recently by Hrubeš (2020) as a first step towards proving lower bounds against general circuits via his new approach.</div>

<div class="content">
In this work, we initiate the study of proximity testing to Algebraic Geometry (AG) codes. An AG code $C = C(\mathcal C, \mathcal P, D)$ is a vector space associated to evaluations on $\mathcal P$ of functions in the Riemann-Roch space $L_\mathcal C(D)$. The problem of testing proximity to an error-correcting code $C$ consists in distinguishing between the case where an input word, given as an oracle, belongs to $C$ and the one where it is far from every codeword of $C$. AG codes are good candidates to construct \emph{short} proof systems, but there exists no efficient proximity tests for them. We aim to fill this gap.

We construct an Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for some families of AG codes by generalizing an IOPP for Reed-Solomon codes, known as the \textsf{FRI} protocol and introduced by Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh and Riabzev in 2018. We identify suitable requirements for designing efficient IOPP systems for AG codes. In addition to proposing the first proximity test targeting AG codes, our IOPP admits quasilinear prover arithmetic complexity and sublinear verifier arithmetic complexity with constant soundness for meaningful classes of AG codes. We take advantage of the algebraic geometry framework that makes any group action on the curve that fixes the divisor $D$ translate into a decomposition of the code $C$. Concretely, our approach relies on Kani's result that splits the Riemann-Roch space of any invariant divisor under this action into several explicit Riemann-Roch spaces on the quotient curve. Under some hypotheses, these spaces behave well enough to define an AG code $C'$ on the quotient curve so that a proximity test to $C$ can be reduced to one to $C'$. Iterating this process thoroughly, we end up with a membership test to a code with significantly smaller length.</div>

<div class="content">
A function $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ from a product domain $\mathcal{D}_1 \times \cdots \times \mathcal{D}_n$ to an abelian group $\mathcal{G}$ is a direct sum if it is of the form $f_1(x_1) + \cdots + f_n(x_n)$.  We present a new 4-query direct sum test with optimal (up to constant factors) soundness error.  This generalizes a result of Dinur and Golubev (RANDOM 2019) which is tailored to the target group $\mathcal{G} = \mathbb{Z}_2$.  As a special case, we obtain an optimal affinity test for $\mathcal{G}$-valued functions on domain $\{0, 1\}^n$ under product measure.  Our analysis relies on the hypercontractivity of the binary erasure channel.

We also study the testability of function partitionability over product domains into disjoint components. A $\mathcal{G}$-valued $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is $k$-direct sum partitionable if it can be written as a sum of functions over $k$ nonempty disjoint sets of inputs.  A function $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ with unstructured product range $\mathcal{R}^k$ is  direct product partitionable if its outputs depend on disjoint sets of inputs.  

We show that direct sum partitionability and direct product partitionability are one-sided error testable with $O((n - k)(\log n + 1/\epsilon) + 1/\epsilon)$ adaptive queries and $O((n/\epsilon) \log^2(n/\epsilon))$ nonadaptive queries, respectively.  Both bounds are tight up to the logarithmic factors for constant $\epsilon$ even with respect to adaptive, two-sided error testers.  We also give a non-adaptive one-sided error tester for direct sum partitionability with query complexity $O(kn^2 (\log n)^2 / \epsilon)$.</div>

<p><br /></p><p>1) Biden will be the oldest president (measuring by when they take the oath of office), at 78. The next two are Trump 70 and Reagan 69. Biden will be older entering office then Reagan was leaving office. </p><p>After Biden, Trump, Reagan:</p><p>William Henry Harrison 68. Why do some people have middle names that are commonly spoken and some do not? Others with middle names spoken: Lee Harvey Oswald, John Wilkes Booth. </p><p>James Buchanan 65</p><p>George H. W. Bush 64. Why do some people have their initials commonly spoken and others do not? In this case it may be to distinguish from W. Why are some people known by their middle initial? Well, actually one that I know of, W.</p><p>Youngest was Theodore Roosevelt 42 who took the office after McKinley was assassinated . Kennedy was youngest to take the oath after being ELECTED at 43. Theodore Roosevelt was known as TR. John F Kennedy is often called JFK. Franklin D Roosevelt was called FDR. Why are some people known by their initials? In these cases maybe to distinguish them from other Roosevelts and Kennedys.</p><p>2) Right now it looks like GA will go for Biden. This surprises me. I had heard `GA is on the verge of turning blue and always will be.'</p><p>3) Dem-Blue, Rep-Red always puzzled me since I thought Red was associated with communism.</p><p>4) A quote from the Trump/Schwartz  book THE ART OF THE DEAL about why Carter was a one-termer  is rather predictive:</p><p>See <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/drudge-trump-election-con/">here</a></p><p>(I've heard Schwartz referred to as a ghost writer. That is not true-- Tony Schwartz's name is ON THE COVER, so he is not a ghostwriter.)</p><p>5) During the Trump administration UAE, Bahrain, and Sudan all recognized Israel (gee, when I see it on a map I recognize it, why did it take them so long :-) ). See <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-bahrain-israel-united-arab-emirates-sudan-07fe32a9ac1bd3afe5c503d4ff6bc859">here</a>. All three deals were brokered by the US so Trump could  take credit here. So why didn't he? One answer is that the left-wing lame stream media didn't cover it much. But FOX didn't cover it much. Trump didn't mention it much. Trump didn't even mention it as a way to complain about media coverage. So- independent of if you think Trump deserves credit here or not, I am interested in why he didn't brag about this one. (When I have asked this question people point out that Trump's base would not care about this. But Trump could complain that Obama got a Nobel Peace prize for nothing, and he got these deals done and hasn't, gotten a Nobel Prize because of the fake-Nobel-Committee and channel this into anti-Obama sentiment.)(ADDED LATER- some of the comments have corrected me and say that Trump DOES mention it-- A LOT. My bad. Still do not know if Fox News mentioned it much.) (ADDED LATER- another comment on my blog pointed to three times Fox News DID talk about this achievement.)</p><p>6) Truth avoids imitating  art: Watch Season five of the HBO show VEEP for how m</p><p>messy a close election can be. </p><p>7) I think Biden will end up being president and the transition will be peaceful. Why? Fox News and other conservative organizations are urging Trump to concede. Republican state legislators are NOT trying to find ways to overturn the results in their states. Judges have found NO evidence for the kinds of fraud that Trump is complaining about. Many Republicans are silent (John Oliver says that means they SUPPORT  Trumps allegations, but I think it means they are NOT supporting Trump's allegations.) </p><p> Why is the Republican establishment NOT backing Trumps claims of fraud? Here are some thoughts.</p><p>a) Because the allegations of fraud are not just false but obviously false.  </p><p>b) Because they think that it is better for the country to have a clean transition.</p><p>c) Because they are tired of Trump also and realize he is not good for the party brand (a bit late now).</p><p>d) Corrupting the electoral process is a bridge to far. (Where did that phrase come from?)</p><p>e) I wonder if Trump himself would have preferred to lose in 2016 and go around having rallies, perhaps have his own TV network. RALLIES are fun, RUNNING THE COUNTRY is not. So those around him may want him to go back to his original plan. </p><p>8) Did Nate (the only pollster with a one-word-name) do well this time around  He thinks so, see <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/nate-silver-tells-fivethirtyeight-critics-fuck-you-we-did-a-good-job">here</a>. Its not even clear he did badly in 2016- he gave Trump a 20% chance in 2016 and a 10% chance this time. </p><p>9) I think that if  we had not had a pandemic then  Trump would have won. Two reasons: the country thinks he handled it badly, and it may have literally killed some of his voters.  As a final note on that: Mark Meadows (WH Chief of staff) has COVID. I am surprised Pence didn't get it-- thought maybe he did or will. </p><p>10) Why did people in the Trump WH who one assumes know that Covid is serious and that masks and social distancing were  way to prevent it, not do these simple things?  Perhaps they thought (correctly) that the more people thing about covid, the more likely Trump loses, so they took a risk. Alas, those that trade their health for electability get neither. </p><p>11) Neither Pence nor Harris is particularly young or old as VP's go. </p><p>Youngest: John Breckenridge, 36. Buchanan's VP</p><p>Second Youngest: Richard Nixon, 40, Eisenhower's VP</p><p>Oldest: Alben Barkley, 71, Truman's VP</p><p>Second oldest: Charles Curtis, 69, Hoover's VP</p><p>Pence was 57 when took the oath, Harris will be 56. </p><p>12) If Biden wins then on Jan 20 when he takes the oath there will be 5 living Ex-presidents:Carter, Clinton, W, Obama, Trump (assuming they all stay alive until then). This ties the record for most living ex-presidents. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/12/george-hw-bush-passed-away-some-non.html">here</a> for my blog post on this. Getting to 6 will be difficult since Carter is 96 years old. </p><p>13) Neither Lance nor I have blogged much about the election, or even about politics. One reason is that whatever I want to say Scott says better (Scott and Lance are the only theory bloggers known by just their first names). I was going to point to Scott's  political blogs but that was hard since he often has blog posts about multiple topics (Like his post about  Mike Pence thinking that the Ind of CH is a sort of relativism that also allows for adultery to be considered okay (see <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/mike-pence-argued-for-criminalization-of-adultery-before-joining-trump-ticket-e27e8a423caa/">here</a> for Pence's pre-Trump views on adultery)  Actually Scott never blogged about Pence and CH  but after reading his posts they kind of blur in my mind.) I will point to one blog entry of his  that I suspect will NOT be relevant but is still very interesting: <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4845">Will he go?</a></p><p>14) Trump claimed the polls showing he was behind were false and part of a conspiracy. I am not sure how this conspiracy would work. If people think their candidate is ahead or behind, then does that affect how or if they vote? Do people say `Gee X is winning, I'll vote for them' ? I doubt it. There are two ways such a conspiracy could work (1)  claim was that some candidate was WAY ahead (it would not matter which one) so you should not bother to vote (2)   in a primary where you are voting on who you think will win the general election.  He also claimed that the early returns saying Biden was winning was a conspiracy. Same problem there- how would that work. This isn't just Trump, other politicians in diff  years claim that early-returns saying X is winning might make it harder for Y to win. I can't see how. </p><p>15) Kamala Harris will be the first women, the first African-American, and the first Asian Veep.  Trivia: There has been a Native American Veep- who was it? More trivia- who coined the term <i>Veep? </i>I won't answer these here, but they might be on my Prez Quiz that I will post after the new President is sworn in.  </p><p>Can she be BOTH the first African-American and the first Asian? Yes.</p><p>16) In my lifetime the election for President was  SETTLED when the losing candidate conceded. This was good for the country's mindset that YES the president is known and even the other candidate agrees. What if Trump does not concede? I doubt this has any practical affect, except that  on Jan 20 he might be trying to arrange a moving van at the last minute. But if the losing candidate does not concede then when is the matter settled?  When the major news venues say it is? Which ones are major? What if there was a really close election and diff news networks declared diff candidates to have won? This does not seem to be a problem for this election cycle, but it is a question: When is the matter SETTLED in that the country ACCEPTS the result, if the losing candidate does not concede?</p><p>17) Carter beat incumbent Ford, but they became friends. Clinton beat incumbent Bush Sr, but they became friends. This is understandable in that so few people are president so they have a shared experience. I doubt that Trump and Biden will become friends.</p><p>18)   Bill Clinton's staff removed W's from the typewriters and did some other damage before W moved into the WH see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/12/us/white-house-vandalized-in-transition-gao-finds.html">here</a>.  This is NOT a tradition, nor is it acceptable in any way, shape. or form.  I do not know of any other similar cases in America (if you do, let me know in the comments).  I wonder if Trump will do damage  to the WH before he leaves. Do presidents put a deposit down on the WH so that any damage they do, they pay for? I  doubt it, but it would be a good idea. </p><p>19)  Obama and Trump had a cordial 90 minute meeting, see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/us/politics/white-house-transition-obama-trump.html">here</a>, after Trump won but before he moved in. This makes perfect sense--outgoing presidents know stuff and have experiences worth sharing with the next president.   Obama said North Korea would be a problem and it is (Trump later tried to spin this--`Obama said it would be hard, but it was easy') I wonder if Trump and Biden will have any kind of meeting, cordial or not. </p><p>20) Every state that went for H Clinton in 2016 went for Biden in 2020. The following states went for Trump in 2016 but went for Biden in 2020: Wisc, Mich, PA, AZ, and maybe Georgia and maybe NC (frankly I doubt NC). There was a plausible  scenario (I forget what it was) where Biden would have won 270-268. </p><p>21) Did Third parties matter? In PA the Libertarian Candidate Jo Jorgenson got 1.1% of the vote which was larger than the diff between Biden (49.7) and Trump (49.1) (The Green party either wasn't on the ballot or got so few votes it was not counted). If most of the Libertarians voted for Trump then he would have won PA and possibly the election. However, Trump is not really a Libertarian, so I doubt that would have happened As for the entire country: (1) . The Libertarians got 1.14% of the total vote in 2020, as opposed to 3.25% in 2016, (2)  The Green party got 1.06% in 2016 and 0.02% in 2020. </p><p>21) I was not particular impressed with the satires of the debates and other political satire on SNL this year. Not sure why- maybe Trump is too wild  to satirize and Joltin Jo is too boring. But the following I DID like and is now more relevant. Watch the whole thing since the first half looks like a real ad.</p><p><a href="https://deadline.com/2020/10/snl-cast-members-2020-trump-1234603033/">here</a><br /></p></div>

In this work we ask the following basic question:  assume the vertices of an expander graph are labelled by $0,1$. What "test" functions $f : \{ 0,1\}^t \to \{0,1\}$ cannot  distinguish  $t$ independent samples from those obtained by a random walk? The expander hitting property due to Ajtai, Komlos and Szemeredi (STOC 1987) is captured by the $\mathrm{AND}$ test function, whereas the fundamental expander Chernoff bound due to Gillman (SICOMP 1998), Heally (Computational Complexity 2008) is about test functions indicating whether the weight is close to the mean. In fact, it is known that all threshold functions are fooled by a random walk (Kipnis and Varadhan, Communications in Mathematical Physics 1986).  Recently, it was shown that even the highly sensitive $\mathrm{PARITY}$ function is fooled by a random walk (Ta-Shma; STOC 2017).  

We focus on balanced labels. Our first main result is proving that all symmetric functions are fooled by a random walk. Put differently, we prove a central limit theorem (CLT) for expander random walks with respect to the total variation distance, significantly strengthening the classic CLT for Markov Chains that is established with respect to the Kolmogorov distance due to Kipnis and Varadhan. Our approach significantly deviates from prior works. We first study how well a Fourier character $\chi_S$ is fooled by a random walk as a function of $S$. Then, given a test function $f$, we expand $f$ in the Fourier basis and combine the above with known results on the Fourier spectrum of $f$. 

We also proceed further and consider general test functions - not necessarily symmetric. As our approach is Fourier analytic, it is general enough to analyze  such versatile test functions. For our second result, we prove that random walks on sufficiently good expander graphs fool tests functions computed by $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits, read-once branching programs, and functions with bounded query complexity.</div>

An error correcting code $\mathcal{C} \colon \Sigma^k \to \Sigma^n$ is list-recoverable from input list size $\ell$ if for any sets $\mathcal{L}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{L}_n \subseteq \Sigma$ of size at most $\ell$, one can efficiently recover the list $\mathcal{L} = \{ x \in \Sigma^k : \forall j \in [n],  \mathcal{C}(x)_j \in \mathcal{L}_j \}$.  While list-recovery has been well-studied in error correcting codes, all known constructions with "efficient" algorithms are not efficient in the parameter $\ell$.  In this work, motivated by applications in algorithm design and pseudorandomness, we study list-recovery with the goal of obtaining a good dependence on $\ell$.  We make a step towards this goal by obtaining it in the weaker case where we allow a randomized encoding map and a small failure probability, and where the input lists are derived from unions of codewords.  As an application of our construction, we give a data structure for the heavy hitters problem in the strict turnstile model that, for some parameter regimes, obtains stronger guarantees than known constructions.</div>

<p>Sorry for the delay in writing this monthly digest: we hope you didn’t spend the week frantically refreshing your browsers! We found four papers this month: let’s dive in.</p>



<p><strong>A Structural Theorem for Local Algorithms with Applications to Coding, Testing, and Privacy</strong>, by Marcel Dall’Agnol, Tom Gur, and Oded Lachish (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/154/">ECCC</a>). This paper introduces the notion of “robust (local) algorithm,” an abstraction which encompasses may types of algorithms: e.g., property testing algorithms, locally decodable codes, etc. The main result of this work is that any (possibly adaptive) \(q\)-query robust local algorithm can be transformed into a non-adaptive, <em>sample-based</em> one making \(n^{1-1/(q^2\log q)}\) queries (where \(n\) is the input size). Here, “sample-based” means that the algorithm doesn’t get to make arbitrary queries, but just gets to observe randomly chosen coordinates of the input. As application of this result, the authors derive new upper and lower bounds for several of the types of local algorithms mentioned above, resolving open questions from previous works.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Tail Weight of a Distribution Via Hazard Rate</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Amartya Shankha Biswas, Kavya Ravichandran, Ronitt Rubinfeld (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02888">arXiv</a>). The authors consider, from the point of view of distribution testing, the question of deciding whether data is <em>heavy-tailed</em>: as would, for instance, data following a power law. The paper first sets out to formalize the question, and discusses various possible definitional choices before setting on one; after which it provides a test, and analyzes its sample complexity as a function of various parameters (such as smoothness of the unknown distribution). The authors finally back these results with empirical evaluation of their algorithm.</p>



<p><strong>On Testing of Samplers</strong>, by Kuldeep S. Meel, Yash Pote, Sourav Chakraborty (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12918">arXiv</a>). Suppose you are given a (known) distribution \(p\) over some domain \(\Omega\), and want to sample from it conditioned on some predicate \(\varphi\). Now someone comes to you with an algorithm which does exactly that, efficiently, and cheaply: great! But can you easily check that you’re not getting fooled, and that this sampler actually does what it claims? This paper provides this: an algorithm which accepts if the sampled distribution is \(\varepsilon\)-close to what it should (roughly, in a multiplicative, KL divergence sense), and rejects if it’s \(\varepsilon’\)-far (in total variation distance). The number of samples required is polynomial in \(\varepsilon’-\varepsilon\), and depends on some characteristic of \(p\) and \(\varphi\), the “tilt” (ratio between max and min probability of the conditional distribution).</p>



<p>Finally, an omission from late September:<br /><strong>Sample optimal Quantum identity testing via Pauli Measurements</strong>, by Nengkun Yu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11518">arXiv</a>). The abstract is concise and clear enough to speak for itself: “In this paper, we show that \(\Theta(\textrm{poly}(n)\cdot\frac{4^n}{\varepsilon^2})\) is the sample complexity of testing whether two \(n\)-qubit quantum states \(\rho\) and \(\sigma\) are identical or \(\varepsilon\)-far in trace distance using two-outcome Pauli measurements.”</p>
