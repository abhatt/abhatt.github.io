<p>It’s the last day of classes for the winter quarter here at UCI, and a good time for some spring cleaning of old bookmarked links. Probably also a good time for a reminder that Google+ is shutting down in two weeks so if, like me, you still have links to it then you don’t have long to replace them with archived copies before it gets significantly more difficult.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-terminates-subscriptions-worlds-largest-scientific-publisher-push-open-access-publicly">The University of California cancels its subscriptions to Elsevier journals after failing to agree on open access</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101672959195728560"></a>). I support this decision, but it means that new papers in Elsevier journals will be harder for me to read. (I will still have access to pre-2019 papers.) More recently, <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/03/13/norwegian-universities-ditch-elsevier">Norway has also cancelled its subscriptions</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My keyboard needed replacement but fortunately the <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/">Apple Keyboard Service Program</a> came through (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101683848227213394"></a>).</p>

David Roberts summarizes the state of play in the claimed proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abc_conjecture"> conjecture</a>. The linked site, <em>Inference Review</em>, looks like an interesting platform for <a href="https://inference-review.com/topic/mathematics/">essays on mathematics</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S">Plan S</a> is a push for funding agencies to require research to be open access. While it’s no surprise that <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/02/19/publishers-express-concern-about-unintended-consequences-plan-s">publishers would push back</a>, there are concerns from the side of open access “that the technical requirements are too high and will result in only large, well-funded publishers and repositories to become compliant”. See the opinions from the <a href="https://euro-math-soc.eu/news/19/02/8/feedback-ems-implementation-plan-s">European Mathematical Society</a>, <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/arxiv/2019/02/04/arxivs-feedback-on-the-guidance-on-the-implementation-of-plan-s/">arXiv</a>, and <a href="https://www.coar-repositories.org/news-media/coar-feedback-on-the-guidance-on-implementation-of-plan-s/">Confederation of Open Access Repositories</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101699226916200843"></a>).</p>

    <p>I’m currently preparing a couple of papers, in the LaTeX format for the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/publikationen/lipics/">LIPIcs computer science conference proceedings series</a>. I’ve written here before about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/05/25/lipics-autoref-lemma.html">the trickery needed to get the hyperref package and autoref macro to work in LIPIcs</a>. Now, finally, with the v2019 version of LIPIcs format, it’s much easier: just add [autoref] to the options in the documentclass. Why they don’t turn this on by default is beyond me (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101705996579583347"></a>).</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is mostly just to signal-boost Konstantin Kakaes’s article in MIT <em>Technology Review</em>, entitled <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613123/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/">“No, scientists didn’t just ‘reverse time’ with a quantum computer.”</a>  The title pretty much says it all—but if you want more, you should read the piece, which includes the following droll quote from some guy calling himself “Director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>Incredibly, the time-reversal claim has now gotten uncritical attention in <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Discover</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, my Facebook feed, and elsewhere—hence this blog post, which has basically no content except “the claim to have ‘reversed time,’ by running a simulation backwards, is exactly as true and as earth-shattering as a layperson might think it is.”</p>



<p>If there’s anything interesting here, I suppose it’s just that “scientists use a quantum computer to reverse time” is one of the purest examples I’ve ever seen of a scientific claim that basically amounts to a mind-virus or meme optimized for sharing on social media—discarding all nontrivial “science payload” as irrelevant to its propagation. </p></div>

<p>My 1983 Ph D thesis was on Helly-type theorems which is an exciting part of discrete geometry and, in the last two decades, I have had an ongoing research project with Roy Meshulam on topological Helly-type theorems. The subject found new connections with structural graph theory and <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="1903.00245v1-abstract-full">Gyárfás-type problems, and also with high-dimensional expanders. </span> We already devoted quite a few posts directly and indirectly to Helly-type theorems.</p>
<p>In this post I would like to report on two recent related breakthroughs, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">one by Andreas Holmsen and Dong-Gyu Lee</a>, and the other <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00245">by Andreas Holmsen</a>. These developments are related to problems that are described in <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/imre.pdf">Problems for Imre Bárány’s birthday,</a> and to my earlier 2004 Oberwolfach report “<a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/ow04.pdf">Expectations from commutative algebra</a>“.

<h3>Helly theorem, colorful Helly, and the Fractional Helly Theorem.</h3>
<p>You can find the statements of Helly theorem, Radon theorem, and the colorful Caratheodory theorem in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-1/">this post</a>.  The colorful Helly theorem was first observed by Lovasz. The fractional Helly theorem was first proved by Katchalski and Liu.</p>
<p><strong>The colorful Helly theorem:</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_1%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}" class="latex" title="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}" /> be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" /> nonempty families of convex sets in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" />. If for every choice of a <em>transversal</em> – one set from every family – there is a point in common to all the chosen sets then for one of the families, there is a point in common to all sets in the family.</p>
<p>[Sorry, I got it wrong first, thanks to Shakhar Smorodinsky for alerting me.<del><span style="color: #555555;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">]</span></span></del></p>
<p><strong>The fractional Helly theorem:</strong> For every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha &gt;0" class="latex" title="\alpha &gt;0" /> there is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta &gt;0" class="latex" title="\beta &gt;0" /> such that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_1%2CK_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+K_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_1,K_2,\dots, K_n" class="latex" title="K_1,K_2,\dots, K_n" /> are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> convex sets in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> and at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha" class="latex" title="\alpha" /> fraction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d%2B1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(d+1)" class="latex" title="(d+1)" />-tuples of the sets have a point in common then a fraction of at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta" class="latex" title="\beta" /> of the sets have a point in common.</p>
<p>I should mention that these theorems do not follow combinatorially from Helly’s theorem itself. They manifest deep properties of hypergraphs coming from geometry, and it is an important question to give general abstract properties, combinatorial or topological leading to such properties.</p>
<p>The result of Holmsen and Lee asserts roughly that the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from Radon’s theorem! Holmsen’s result asserts that  the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from the colorful Helly theorem!</p>
<h2>Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee: Fractional Helly from Radon</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">Radon numbers and the fractional Helly theorem</a></p>
<p>Authors: Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A basic measure of the combinatorial complexity of a convexity space is its Radon number. In this paper we show a fractional Helly theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number, answering a question of Kalai. As a consequence we also get a weak epsilon-net theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number. This answers a question of Bukh and extends a recent result of Moran and Yehudayoff.</p>

<p class="authors"><span class="search-hit">Author:</span> Andreas F. Holmsen</p>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>A result due to Gyárfás, Hubenko, and Solymosi (answering a question of Erdös) states that if a graph G on n vertices does not contain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" title="K_{2,2}" /> as an induced subgraph yet has at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%7B%7Bn%7D+%5Cchoose+%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c{{n} \choose {2}}" class="latex" title="c{{n} \choose {2}}" /> edges, then G has a complete subgraph on at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%2F10n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c^2/10n" class="latex" title="c^2/10n" /> vertices. In this paper we suggest a “higher-dimensional” analogue of the notion of an induced <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" title="K_{2,2}" /> which allows us to generalize their result to k-uniform hypergraphs. Our result also has an interesting consequence in discrete geometry. In particular, it implies that the fractional Helly theorem can be derived as a purely combinatorial consequence of the colorful Helly theorem.</p>

The colourful Carathéodory theorem states that, if 0 is in the convex hull of each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S_i" class="latex" title="S_i" />, then there exists a colourful simplex T containing 0 in its convex hull. Deza, Huang, Stephen, and Terlaky (Colourful simplicial depth, Discrete Comput.

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We show that the Radon number characterizes the existence of weak nets in separable convexity spaces (an abstraction of the euclidean notion of convexity). The construction of weak nets when the Radon number is finite is based on Helly’s property and on metric properties of VC classes. The lower bound on the size of weak nets when the Radon number is large relies on the chromatic number of the Kneser graph. As an application, we prove a boosting-type result for weak <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-6"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-7"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8">ϵ</span></span></span></span>-nets.</p>

<p>Here's an old trick that we found useful for proving some tight complexity lower bounds. You are given <em>m</em> coins, each of weight either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, and a modern scale that can tell you the total weight of any chosen subset of coins. How many weighings do you need to identify which coin is which? Checking each coin individually uses <em>m</em> weighings, but can you do less?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In any weighing, we try some unknown number of weight-<em>a</em> coins between 0 and <em>m</em>, so this results in one of <em>m</em> + 1 possible values, giving us at most log(<em>m</em> + 1) bits of information. In total we need m bits of information to identify each coin, so clearly we will need at least Ω(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) weighings.</p>

<p>It turns out that this many is in fact enough, and this generalizes to various other settings with less restricted weights. This is the basis for two of our recent results: a tight complexity lower bound for Integer Linear Programming with few constraints and for multicoloring (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_coloring#Definitions">b-fold coloring</a>), assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. The trick allows us to use constraints that check the value of some number between 0 and <em>m</em> to indeed extract about log(<em>m</em>) bits of new information from each, in a way that is general enough to check <em>m</em> clauses of a 3-CNF-SAT instance using only <em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) constraints.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Detecting matrices</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to rephrase this coin-weighing problem is as follows: the unknown coin weights are described by a (column) vector <em>x</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>. A subset of coins is described by a characteristic (row) vector <em>v</em> in {0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> and the resulting value of the weighing is the dot product <em>v</em> <strong>·</strong> <em>x</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For a number of weighings <em>k</em>, the row vectors form a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with <em>k</em> rows and <em>m</em> columns, while the obtained values are simply the <em>k</em>-element vector <em>M x</em>. The condition that these values are enough to identify each entry of <em>x</em> is formalized as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br />
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is called a <em>detecting matrix</em>. In other words, instead of checking x = y entry by entry, it suffices to compare the k entries of M x and M y. (An equivalent definition is to require that the kernel of <em>M</em> is trivial on {-1,0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, since we could instead compare (<em>x</em> - <em>y</em>)/(<em>a</em> - <em>b</em>) with zero). A generalization for <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {0, 1, …, <em>d</em> - 1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> was first proved by <a href="https://doi.org/10.4153/CMB-1965-034-2">(Lindström 1965)</a> (in fact he proves the constant hidden behind <em>O</em> is 2 log<sub>2</sub>(<em>d</em>) and cannot be improved, for any <em>d</em>), giving a deterministic, poly-time construction. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.162.2327">(Bshouty 2009)</a> gives a more direct and general construction using Fourier analysis. However, a random matrix can be shown to be detecting with fairly elementary methods.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Integer Linear Programming</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In ILP we are given a matrix <em>A</em> with <em>n</em> columns and <em>m</em> rows, a vector <em>b</em> with <em>m</em> entries, and we ask for a vector <em>x</em> with <em>n</em> non-negative integer entries such that <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em>. So each of the <em>m</em> rows is a linear equality to be satisfied. What is the complexity for small <em>m</em>?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We start with an instance <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em> encoding a suitable 3-CNF-SAT instance of size <em>O</em>(<em>m</em>) in a straightforward way, using only {0,1,2,3} entries in <em>A</em> and <em>b</em>. Instead of checking each row individually, we use detecting matrices to check them in bunches, reducing our problem to an equivalent instance <em>M A x</em> = <em>M b</em>. The matrix <em>M A </em>of the new instance has only O(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows (at the cost of having larger entries in <em>M b</em>). With some tinkering, this simple reduction shows that, assuming ETH, ILP with <em>m</em> constraints cannot be solved in time 2<sup><em>o</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup>, even when the matrix has only 0-1 entries and <em>b</em> has poly(<em>m</em>) entries. This matches a recent (surprisingly simple and clever!) 2<sup><em>O</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup> algorithm by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3175322">Eisenbrand and Weismantel (SODA 2018)</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One caveat when applying detecting matrices is that we do not know any bound on one side, <em>A x</em>, except that it is a non-negative integer vector. Fortunately, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010033">(Grebinsky &amp; Kucherov 2000)</a> showed that a random 0-1 matrix satisfies the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>d</em>,<em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> <em>log</em> <em>d</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br />
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in ℕ<sup><em>m</em></sup> with ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>d</em> <em>m</em>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here no upper bound on <em>x</em> is needed, because a single row in <em>M</em> full of ones is enough to guarantee that the sum of entries is the same: ‖<em>x</em>‖<sub>1</sub> = ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub>. However, it remains an open problem to find a deterministic construction (we work around this by giving a somewhat weaker construction). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01296.pdf">the full paper (STACS 2019)</a> for details (with Dušan Knop and Michał Pilipczuk). The reduction for <em>multicoloring</em> is quite different and more problem-specific, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03432">the full paper (ESA 2017)</a> for definitions (with Marthe Bonamy, Łukasz Kowalik, Michał Pilipczuk and Arkadiusz Socała).</p>

algorithm achieves a running time of O(2^k p(n + k)), where p is the polynomial
running time for planar Max-Cut. The only previously known similar algorithm
[8] is restricted to 1-planar graphs (i.e., at most one crossing per edge) and
its dependency on k is of order 3^k . A direct consequence of our result is
that Max-Cut is fixed-parameter tractable w.r.t. the crossing number, even
without a given drawing.

Social Network Analysis (SNA) has played an important role in reducing criminal
activities (e.g., counter terrorism) via detecting the influential users in
such networks. There are various popular measures to quantify how influential
or central any vertex is in a network. As expected, strategic and influential
miscreants in covert networks would try to hide herself and her partners
(called {\em leaders}) from being detected via these measures by introducing
new edges. Waniek et al. show that the corresponding computational problem,
called Hiding Leader, is NP-Complete for the degree and closeness centrality
measures. We study the popular core centrality measure and show that the
problem is NP-Complete even when the core centrality of every leader is only
$3$. On the contrary, we prove that the problem becomes polynomial time
solvable for the degree centrality measure if the degree of every leader is
bounded above by any constant. We then focus on the optimization version of the
problem and show that the Hiding Leader problem admits a $2$ factor
approximation algorithm for the degree centrality measure. We complement it by
proving that one cannot hope to have any $(2-\varepsilon)$ factor approximation
algorithm for any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$ unless there is a $\varepsilon/2$
factor polynomial time algorithm for the Densest $k$-Subgraph problem which
would be considered a significant breakthrough.

algorithmically-directed growth. Systems capable of such behavior typically
make use of "glue cooperation" in which the glues on at least $2$ sides of a
tile must match and bind to those exposed on the perimeter of an assembly for
that tile to attach. However, several models have been developed which utilize
"weak cooperation", where only a single glue needs to bind but other
preventative forces (such as geometric, or steric, hindrance) provide
additional selection for which tiles may attach, and where this allows for
algorithmic behavior. In this paper we first work in a model where tiles are
allowed to have geometric bumps and dents on their edges. We show how such
tiles can simulate systems of square tiles with complex glue functions (using
asymptotically optimal sizes of bumps and dents), and also how they can
simulate weakly cooperative systems in a model which allows for duples (i.e.
tiles either twice as long or twice as tall as square tiles). We then show that
with only weak cooperation via geometric hindrance, no system in any model can
simulate even a class of tightly constrained, deterministic cooperative
systems, further defining the boundary of what is possible using this tool.

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Semidefinite programming is a powerful tool in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the random hyperplane rounding method of Goemans and Williamson has been extensively studied for more than two decades, resulting in various extensions to the original technique and beautiful algorithms for a wide range of applications. Despite the fact that this approach yields tight approximation guarantees for some problems, like Max Cut, for many others, like Max Sat, Max DiCut, and constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints, the tight approximation ratio is still unknown. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that very few techniques for rounding semi-definite relaxations are known.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a new general and simple method for rounding semi-definite programs, based on Brownian motion. Our approach is inspired by recent results in algorithmic discrepancy theory. We develop and present tools for analyzing our new rounding algorithms, utilizing mathematical machinery from the theory of Brownian motion, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. Focusing on constraint satisfaction problems, we apply our method to several classical problems, including Max Cut, Max 2-Sat, and Max DiCut, and derive new algorithms that are competitive with the best known results. We further show that our algorithms can be used, together with the Sum of Squares hierarchy, to approximate constraint satisfaction problems subject to multiple global cardinality constraints.</p>

I got my MIT degree in Applied Mathematics so I don't count, but I know plenty of MIT computer scientists and the one undeniable truth is that I don't want any of them flying my plane.<br />
<br />
I also agree with the Donald that a complex environment can often lead to confusion, especially in an emergency. HCI matters.<br />
<br />
But that's where it stops. Better technology in the plane and on the ground, combined with better procedures have all but eliminated deadly major commercial airplane crashes in the US and quite rare in the world at large. I'll call that more than a "little gain". I remember the "old and simpler" days where we had deadly airline crashes every few months. No thanks.<br />
<br />
I've had great discussions with some of the aerospace engineering professors at Georgia Tech. The amount of effort to get the "front-of-the-plane" software right via formal methods and rigorous testings has become harder to engineer than the plane itself. The "back-of-the-plane" software that controls the video screens and WiFi gets less attention. I can live with safety over movies.<br />
<br />
When technology makes things much safer, whether it be planes or self-driving cars, the rare accidents become far more noticeable. while we should use these opportunities to learn and make things safer, the rare accidents help us realize just how much more safer technology can make us.<br /></div>

<div class="content">
<p>As I said in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/12/counting-polygon-triangulations.html">my previous post</a> my two SoCG papers both
involved trying and failing to prove something else, and writing down
what I could prove instead. For the one that appears today, “Cubic
planar graphs that cannot be drawn on few lines” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05256">arXiv:1903.05256</a>),
that something else was Open Problem 16.14 of my book, which can be
rephrased as: does there exist a family of planar graphs that cannot be
drawn planarly with all vertices on a constant number of convex curves?</p>

<p>Instead I expand on something that was already known, the existence of
planar graphs that cannot be drawn with all vertices on a constant
number of lines.</p>

<p>There were two previously known methods for constructing such graphs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_network">planar
3-tree</a>. This
is a planar graph formed by recursively subdividing triangles into three
smaller triangles. If the vertices are drawn on some family of lines,
the line through the subdivision point must miss one of the three
smaller triangles, so by induction you can be forced to use a
non-constant number of lines. But the bound you get is only logarithmic.<sup id="fnref:book"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/13/planar-graphs-needing.html#fn:book" class="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/planar-3-tree.svg" alt="Planar 3-tree" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a maximal planar graph whose dual graph has no long paths.
In a maximal planar graph, any line through many vertices can be
translated into a path through many dual vertices. So if there is no
long dual path there must be many lines. This gives a polynomial lower
bound on the number of lines, but with a tiny exponent.<sup id="fnref:dual"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/03/13/planar-graphs-needing.html#fn:dual" class="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>The new paper finds a third method:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a graph that has many disjoint collections of many nested cycles.
Drawing a big set of nested cycles on a small
number of lines necessarily uses up one of the crossing points of the lines.
So if there are more nests than crossing points, one of them will have
to use many lines.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/spiderwebs.svg" alt="Graph with many disjoint collections of many nested cycles" /></p>

<p>This leads to stronger polynomial bounds, but also (more importantly I
think) wider families of planar graphs that need non-constant numbers of
lines. For instance, it works for series-parallel graphs of maximum
degree three, which are far from being maximal planar. And even though
every tree can be drawn with its vertices on two lines, adding a single
vertex to a tree can produce a graph that requires a non-constant number
of lines.</p>

Throughout my 9 years at MIT, Manolis was one of my best friends there, even though our research styles and interests might seem distant.  He and I were in the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Early_Career_Award_for_Scientists_and_Engineers">PECASE</a> class; see if you can spot us both in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/pecase.jpg">this photo</a> (in the rows behind America’s last sentient president).  My and Manolis’s families also became close after we both got married and had kids.  We still keep in touch.</p>



<p>Today Manolis will be celebrating his 42nd birthday, with a <a href="https://twitter.com/manoliskellis/status/1104873813685272576">symposium on the meaning of life</a> (!).  He asked his friends and colleagues to contribute talks and videos reflecting on that weighty topic.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/aar-manolis.mp4">here’s a 2-minute birthday video</a> that I made for Manolis before I really understood what he wanted.  Unlike the first video, this one has no academic content, but it does involve me wearing a cowboy hat and swinging a makeshift “lasso.”</p>



<p>Happy birthday Manolis!</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>In some sense both of my accepted papers at SoCG are about a situation where I really wanted to prove something else, wasn’t able to, and wrote up what I could prove instead. The one whose preprint appears today, “Counting polygon triangulations is hard” (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04737">arXiv:1903.04737</a>), proves that it’s -complete to count the triangulations of a polygon with holes.</p>

<p>It’s easy to prove that it’s -hard to count maximum non-crossing subsets of line segment arrangements: the intersections graphs of line segments include all the planar graphs, so this follows immediately from the -completeness of maximum independent sets in planar graphs. The gadgets in my paper (drawn below) turn a single line segment into a part of a polygon for which many triangulations use diagonals in approximately the same position as the line segment, and there are few other triangulations. By using these gadgets, one could easily construct a polygon in which most of the triangulations correspond to maximum non-crossing subsets, showing that it’s also -hard to count triangulations. But this is unsatisfactory because it’s the wrong kind of completeness. For counting problems, we want -completeness, not just -hardness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/tricount-gadgets.svg" alt="Gadgets for proving hardness of polygon triangulation" /></p>

<p>The reason the outline above isn’t already a -completeness proof is that we need to control the rest of the triangulation better. It’s not enough for most triangulations to come from maximum non-crossing subsets. We need each maximum non-crossing subset of line segments to contribute exactly the same number of triangulations (or at least a predictable and controlled number) so that we can recover the number of maximum non-crossing subsets from the number of triangulations. The gadgets control the parts of the triangulation near each segment of the non-crossing subsets, but we also need to control the parts of the triangulation that are not near those segments. Achieving this took much of the work in my new paper. There are two main ideas: First, we use special arrangements with the property that, when you close off the gadgets of a maximum non-crossing subset, the remaining parts of the polygon form pieces of predictable shapes for which we can count the triangulations. In these arrangements, there are two colors of segments, red and blue; each blue segment is crossed by two red segments, and each red segment is crossed in the order blue-red-blue. So we need a new counting reduction from graph independent sets that produces arrangements of this type. And second, we decompose the total number of maximum non-crossing subsets into a sum of smaller numbers, of subsets that have a given number of red segments. Subsets with the same number of red segments leads to the same numbers of triangulations, allowing the terms in the sum to be recovered from the number of triangulations.</p>

<p>A secondary goal was to do this all using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">polynomial-time counting reduction</a> rather than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_reduction">Turing reductions</a> that are more commonly used for -completeness. One cannot use an even stronger notion of reduction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimonious_reduction">parsimonious reductions</a>, to reduce  problems that might have zero solutions to a problem like triangulation that always has at least one. But to me, counting reductions are more closely analogous to the many-one reductions used for -completeness. We can use them, so we should use them. So the reductions in the paper are polynomial-time counting reductions, but more work would be needed to prove that the starting graph problem I used (counting independent sets in regular planar graphs) is complete for those reductions.</p>

<p>Surprisingly to me, this appears to be the first published proof of a -completeness result in two-dimensional computational geometry. And although some 2d geometric structures have been proven -hard to construct (and therefore -hard to count) it seems to be the first hardness proof of any kind for counting 2d structures that can be constructed rather than counted in polynomial time. But as I said at the top of this post, it’s not what I really wanted to prove. I was hoping to prove hardness for counting non-crossing structures on point sets, such as simple polygons, triangulations, non-crossing matchings, or pointed pseudotriangulations. The polygon question was suggested to me by Sara Billey when I visited her last April, in connection with a different problem we were working on (and still haven’t published). And counting the triangulations of a point set would fit the theme of my recent book, because this count is a numerical parameter that depends only on the order type of the points and mostly behaves monotonically under point deletion (exception: delete the center point of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincunx">quincunx</a>). Instead I had to settle for polygon triangulations. But maybe another paper can take this line of research one step farther, to counting problems on points.</p>

A graph $G$ has an \emph{$S$-factor} if there exists a spanning subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that for all $v \in V: \deg_F(v) \in S$.
The simplest example of such factor is a $1$-factor, which corresponds to a perfect matching in a graph. In this paper we study the computational complexity of finding $S$-factors in regular graphs.
Our techniques combine some classical as well as recent tools from graph theory.</div>

We provide new upper bounds on the complexity of the s-t-connectivity problem in planar graphs, thereby providing additional evidence that this problem is not complete for NL. This also yields a new upper bound on the complexity of computing edit distance. Building on these techniques, we provide new upper bounds on the complexity of several other computational problems on planar graphs. All of these problems are shown to be solvable in logarithmic time on a concurrent-read exclusive-write (CREW) PRAM. The new upper bounds are provided by making use of a known characterization of CREW algorithms in terms of "unambiguous" AC$^1$ circuits. This seems to be the first occasion where this characterization has been used in order to provide new upper bounds on natural problems.</div>

When I first saw the definition of NP-Complete I first thought<i> if there are NP-complete problems I suspect they are contrived. </i>When I saw the proof that  SAT is NP-complete I thought <i>okay, so there is one natural problem  NP-complete by a trick of encoding, but I suspect there aren't any more.</i>  I then read Karp's article that had 22 NP-complete problems. I thought <i>okay, there are 22, but I suspect there are no more. </i>No I didn't think that. But the point is that Cook and Karp together birthed modern complexity theory by introduction NP-completeness and showing that there are MANY natural problems that are NP-complete.<br />
<br />
How many people has Richard Karp inspired? I don't know but I suspect it's a  cardinal between countable and the reals so it may depend on your model of set theory. Later in this post I will present Samir Khuller's story of how Richard Karp inspired him.<br />
<br />
How to honor him?  The Simons inst. is currently welcoming contributions to the Richard M Karp Fund, which honors the scientific contributions of Founding Director Dick Karp. The fund will provide vital support for the mission and activities of the Simons institute. They have a deadline of Pi-Day. You can go <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/support/donate">here</a> to contribute and/or <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/goldwasserkarp.txt">here</a> for a letter from Shafi Goldwasser, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Umesh Vazirani about the fund.<br />

OKAY, Samir's story:<br />

<b>Mentoring and Influence via a Train Journey...</b></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Almost to the day, 33 years ago I was running from my dorm room to catch an unreliable bus to the train station as I headed home for a mid-semester break.  On the way,I  stopped by the mailroom, and not knowing where to put the CACM that had just arrived,  stuffed it into the side of my bag and in the process, dropping my   notebook in the process. On the train, when I looked for my  notebook to go over  some material I realized it was missing! All I had was a CACM and a very long train ride. Skimming through the journal, I found Karp’s Turing Award article “Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness“. I  started reading this article, and was riveted! It was one of those life changing moments for me, when my immediate future became clear - I wanted to study Theoretical Computer Science and specifically the complexity of combinatorial problems. Without ever having met Dick Karp, he changed my life forever.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I met Dick long after he influenced me via his Turing Award Lecture and it was a real privilege to have had the opportunity to interview him via a fireside chat at Simons. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1DT_UeJwps">here</a>.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I am delighted about the fund Bill mentions above as the money that goes to it will help inspire others as Karp inspired me.</div>

<em>Bill and Clyde’s new book</em><br />
<font color="#000000"></font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/10/problems-with-a-point/gasarchkruskal/" rel="attachment wp-att-15675"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/gasarchkruskal.png?w=200&amp;h=114" alt="" width="200" class="alignright wp-image-15675" height="114" /></a></p>
<p></p><p>
Bill Gasarch and Clyde Kruskal are colleagues in Computer Science at the University of Maryland. They have just seen the publication of their <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261">book</a> <em>Problems With a Point</em>.</p>
<p>
Today Dick and I congratulate them on the book and give a brief overview of it.</p>
<p>
The tandem of Bill and Clyde were <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/theorems-are-forever-a-great-one-from-1492/">featured</a> before on this blog in connection with a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.138.6154">series</a> of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/3apsurvey.pdf">papers</a> with James Glenn on sets of numbers that have no arithmetical progressions of length 3. </p>
<p>
Can a “series” have only two members? We could add a third <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11821069_13">paper</a> to the series, but it is by Glenn and Bill with Richard Beigel rather than Clyde and is on the different topic of multi-party communication complexity. But Clyde gets into the act since it is the topic of Chapter 19 of the book. That chapter analyzes a game form of problems that go back to a 1983 <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/multiparty-vdw.pdf">paper</a> by Dick with Ashok Chandra and Merrick Furst. Does this mean Dick should get some royalties? Note that this last link is to Bill’s website. And ‘vdw’ in this link seems to refer to van der Waerden’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waerden's_theorem">theorem</a>, which is a pillar of both Ramsey theory and number theory, which in turn receive much attention in the book.</p>
<p>
My last paragraph flits through divergent questions but they are representative of things that we working mathematical computing theorists think about every day—and of various kinds of content in the book. Of course, Bill partners on Lance Fortnow’s prominent <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/">blog</a> and so has shared all kinds of these musings. The book, which incorporates numerous posts by Bill but is not a “blog book” <em>per-se</em>, furnishes contexts for them. Let’s look at the book.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Book </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The book has three main parts, titled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stories With a Point. <p></p>
</li><li>
Problems With a Point. <p></p>
</li><li>
Theorems With a Point.
</li></ul>
<p>
All the chapters except three are prefaced with a section titled “Point”—or “The Point” or “Points”—after one sentence on prior knowledge needed, which often reads, “None.”</p>
<p>
The first part begins with a chapter titled, “When Terms From Math are Used By Civilians,” one of several with social discussion. The second is about how human aspects of sports upset statistical regularities one might expect to see. For example, many more baseball hitters have had season batting averages of .300 than .299 or .301, evidently because .300 is a “goal number” everyone strives to meet. There are numerous things in the book I didn’t know. </p>
<p>
The next chapter largely reproduces this record-long <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/07/disproofing-myth-that-many-early.html">post</a> on the blog but adds much extra commentary. Then there are chapters on what makes a mathematical function worth defining, on how mathematical objects are named, on Bill’s visit to a “Gathering for [Martin] Gardner” <a href="http://www.gathering4gardner.org/">conference</a>, on coloring the plane, two on imagined applications of Ramsey Theory to medieval history, and one on the methodological and social impact of having theorems that represent barriers to ways of trying to prove other theorems. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Chapter Ten </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This last chapter of Part I <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/lets-prove-something-instead-of-proving.html">draws</a> on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/04/but-seriously-now-folks-what-do-you.html">several</a> of Bill’s <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/other-fields-of-math-dont-prove-barrier.html">posts</a>. It goes most to the heart of what we all in computational complexity grapple with daily and benefits from having more context: As we just mused in this blog’s 10-year anniversary <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/18/have-ten-years-brought-us-closer/">post</a>, the major questions in complexity are not only as open as when we started, but as open as when the field started 50-plus years ago. There has barely been any discernible direct progress, and this is not only a concern for entering students but a retardant on everyone—about which we’ve given <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/09/18/lets-mention-foundations/">exhortation</a>.</p>
<p>
There are instead <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/barriers-to-pnp-proofs/">barrier</a> theorems saying <em>why</em> the main questions will not be resolvable by the very techniques that were used to build the field. Of three broad categories of barriers, “oracle results” de-fang all the methods typically taught in intro graduate complexity courses. Those methods meter computations at inputs and outputs but not how they “progress” inside toward a solution. Oracle languages supply blasts of external information that either make progress trivially quick or allow conditioning the terms of the complexity-class relation under analysis to information in the oracle that is tailored to obfuscate. Oracles of the former kind usually collapse complexity classes together, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A =}" class="latex" title="{A =}" /> any polynomial-space complete language making <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EA+%3D+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A}" />, whereas oracles <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> of the latter kind drive them apart (so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5EB+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5EB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}^B \neq \mathsf{NP}^B}" />) but often for reasons that frustrate as much as enlighten. When contemplating a new complexity class relation it is incumbent to frame a “relativized” version of it and see if some oracles can make it true and others false. Such oracle constructions were initially easy to come by—“fast food” for research—but their ultimate besideness-of-the-point is reflected in this early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/05/21/i-hate-oracle-results/">post</a> by Dick.</p>
<p>
Next after oracles is the “Natural Proofs” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">barrier</a>, which basically cuts against all the techniques taught in advanced graduate complexity courses unless they can somehow be weirdly narrow or intensely complex in their conceptual framing. The attitude on those is captured by the title of another early <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">post</a> by Dick titled, “Who’s Afraid of Natural Proofs?” The third barrier is <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/algstoc.pdf">algebrization</a>, which cuts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem#Results_about_difficulty_of_proof">against</a> efforts to escape from oracles. </p>
<p>
Amid all this environment of obstruction, what of consequence can we prove? Well, the chapter on this has by far the highest concentration of Bill’s trademark all-capital letters and exclamation points. The initial “Point” section is titled, “Rant.” (The chapter also includes a page on the attempts to prove Euclid’s parallel postulate, which might be called the original “problem with a point.”)</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Part II </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Much of Part II involves the kind of problems that were used or considered for high-school mathematics competitions. By definition those are not research problems but they often point toward frontiers by representing accessible cases of them. The appealing ones blend equal parts research relevance, amusement value, and reward of technical command. Often they require mathematical “street smarts” and a repertoire of useful tricks and proof patterns. Practicing researchers will find this aspect of the book most valuable. The problems are mainly on the number-theory side of recreational mathematics, plus geometric and coloring problems. Egyptian fractions, prime-factor puzzles, sums over digits, summation formulas, and of course Ramsey theory all make their appearance. Here is one problem I mention partly to correct a small content error, where the correction seems to make the problem more interesting. Say that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" title="{C(n,m)}" /> holds if there are integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cn_m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n_1,\dots,n_m}" class="latex" title="{n_1,\dots,n_m}" /> such that </p>

<p>A general principle discovered by Joseph Sylvester gives cases such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%281861%2C5%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C(1861,5)}" class="latex" title="{C(1861,5)}" /> being witnessed by </p>

<p>How can it and related ideas be extended to other cases? The particular problem is given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> to find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%3D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m_n =}" class="latex" title="{m_n =}" /> the least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%28n%2Cm%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C(n,m)}" class="latex" title="{C(n,m)}" /> holds—and to find a witnessing sum. The error is an assertion that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n+%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m_n \leq n}" class="latex" title="{m_n \leq n}" /> “by writing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> as a sum of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />‘s,” but then the reciprocals add up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. So is there any bound on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m_n}" class="latex" title="{m_n}" />? That is rather fun to think about. </p>

This problem’s chapter is made from a short <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/12/is-this-problem-too-hard-for-hs-math.html">post</a> with an enormous comments section.  There is also a chapter on the boundary between a fair problem and a “trick question” that much extends an April Fool’s post on the blog.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Part III </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Part III continues the nature of the problem content with emphasis on the worths of proofs of theorems. One illustration involving perfect numbers and sums of cubes notes that the proof loses value because it also applies to certain non-perfect numbers. Two things <em>en-passant</em>: First, Lemma 21.1 in this chapter needs qualification that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a,b}" class="latex" title="{a,b}" /> are relatively prime and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x+1}" class="latex" title="{x+1}" /> is prime. Second, this prompts me to note <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/03/09/">via</a> Gil Kalai the discovery by Tim Browning that the number 33 is a sum of three cubes: </p>

Gil points to a Quora <a href="https://affinemess.quora.com/HOLY-CRAP-33-IS-THE-SUM-OF-THREE-CUBES">post</a> by Alon Amit. There is only the bare equation on Browning’s <a href="http://pub.ist.ac.at/~tbrownin/">homepage</a>, and nothing about his methods or how much he used computer search is known. The theme of proofs by computer runs through several chapters of Bill and Clyde’s book. It is also <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">current</a> on Scott Aaronson’s blog—we would be remiss if we did not mention Scott in this post—and more widely.</p>
<p>
The penultimate chapter covers the beautiful theory of rectangle-free colorings of grids. We mentioned Bill’s involvement with this Ramsey-style problem in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/how-deep-is-your-coloring/">post</a> on what happened to be this blog’s third anniversary. We connected it to Kolmogorov complexity, which together with uncomputability is the subject of the last chapter. This and other chapters I’ve mentioned exemplify how the research ambit connects traditional mathematics with the terms and concerns of computing theory. How to work in this ambit may be the greatest value of the book for students. In all I found the book light, lighthearted, and enlightening.</p>

The big open problem with the book is how it might help gear us up to tackle the big open problems.</p>

The polarization lemma for statistical distance ($\mathrm{SD}$), due to Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003), is an efficient transformation taking as input a pair of circuits $(C_0,C_1)$ and an integer $k$ and outputting a new pair of circuits $(D_0,D_1)$ such that if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1)\geq\alpha$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \geq 1-2^{-k}$ and if $\mathrm{SD}(C_0,C_1) \leq \beta$ then $\mathrm{SD}(D_0,D_1) \leq 2^{-k}$. The polarization lemma is known to hold for any constant values $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$, but extending the lemma to the regime in which $\alpha^2 \leq \beta &lt; \alpha$ has remained elusive. The focus of this work is in studying the latter regime of parameters. Our main results are:

1. Polarization lemmas for different notions of distance, such as Triangular Discrimination ($\mathrm{TD}$) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence ($\mathrm{JS}$), which enable polarization for some problems where the statistical distance satisfies $\alpha^2 &lt; \beta &lt; \alpha$. We also derive a polarization lemma for statistical distance with any inverse-polynomially small gap between $\alpha^2$ and $\beta$ (rather than a constant).

2. The average-case hardness of the statistical difference problem (i.e., determining whether the statistical distance between two given circuits is at least $\alpha$ or at most $\beta$), for any values of $\beta &lt; \alpha$, implies the existence of one-way functions. Such a result was previously only known for $\beta &lt; \alpha^2$.

3. A (direct) constant-round interactive proof for estimating the statistical distance between any two distributions (up to any inverse polynomial error) given circuits that generate them.</div>

Via <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4133">Scott</a>, John Horgan wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">blog post</a> following on his 1993 Scientific American article <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">The Death of Proof</a>. The article talked about computer-generated proofs, experimental mathematics and even mentioned some of our work on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/103418.103428">transparent proofs</a> (basically time-efficient probabilistically checkable proofs). I got (sarcastically I think) accused of killing mathematics after that article but of course we had traditional proofs about probabilistically check proofs. Andrew Wiles got a sidebar titled "A Splendid Anachronism?" for merely solving the most famous open problem in all of mathematics. Somehow traditional mathematical proofs survived the article.<div>

<blockquote class="tr_bq">
TCS is surely blessed with mathematical beauty. As a graduate student a long time ago, it was mathematical beauty that attracted me to TCS, and continued to lead my research for many years. I find computational complexity theory (or complexity theory, for short), with its theorems (for example, the time-hierarchy and space-hierarchy theorems) and its open questions (for example, P vs NP), to be hauntingly beautiful. Beauty, yes; but what about truth?</blockquote>
Here here on the beauty of complexity. So what about truth? I cover much of this in my <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/9/38904-the-status-of-the-p-versus-np-problem/fulltext">P v NP survey</a>. In short the P v NP captures the most critical aspects of what is efficiently computable but it is not the endpoint. Nevertheless P v NP captures both truth and beauty and that's why the problem has so captivated and guided me throughout my research career.</div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spending your life staring at a (traditional) computer screen may not be ideal for your eyes (and more); so since an early age I have been dreaming of a “purely mechanical” monitor that you could stare at more or less indefinitely, like at parchment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This dream is now becoming reality, sort of.  The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dasung-Ink-Paperlike-13-3-Monitor/dp/B07GWGFW1B/ref=asc_df_B07GWGFW1B/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=309743296044&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4273202700836301476&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9002067&amp;hvtargid=pla-571127059636&amp;psc=1">Dasung E-ink monitor </a>has no backlight and instead reportedly uses electric flows to move ink droplets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After some consideration, spending yet more hours reading reviews online and watching youtube videos about it sealed the deal.  I shelled out $1300 and bought the thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have had it for a few days now and I am sort of happy. I went from using a giant 30-inch monitor far away (my theory for avoiding eye strain) to using a ~13-inch monitor at pretty much the same distance as reading a book. I had to avoid sunlight, now I seek it (see the picture).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/20190307_094550.jpg?w=640" alt="20190307_094550" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-624" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monitor makes your computer look like Windows 3.1 on a monochrome screen from the 80’s. The refresh is slow, and there is a ghosting effect, meaning there are shadows of previous images — which you can clear out. Also, it’s 4:3 instead of 16:9, which is a pain because it means I have to change resolution when I am forced to use my other monitor (for example if I have to check colors — the screen is gray-scale, did I mention that?). It makes browsing the internet quite painful, which is a nice side effect.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contrary to advice, I am using it as my primary monitor. I am sort of happy with it and don’t regret buying it. I have started writing and reading papers with it and it’s working well enough.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think as soon as the technology improves the market for these things will be huge.  Already having a 17″ monitor in 16:9 ratio, ideally touch-screen, even if gray scale, would be a dream come true.</p></div>

<p>In 1993, the science writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horgan_(journalist)">John Horgan</a>—who’s best known for his book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Science-Knowledge-Twilight-Scientific/dp/0465065929">The End of Science</a></em>, and (of course) for <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/scott-aaronson-answers-every-ridiculously-big-question-i-throw-at-him/">interviewing me in 2016</a>—wrote a now-(in)famous cover article for <em>Scientific American</em> entitled <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4e56/c6fea76922082400dfc6e13a3a169ae7b9a6.pdf">“The Death of Proof.”</a>  Mashing together a large number of (what I’d consider) basically separate trends and ideas, Horgan argued that math was undergoing a fundamental change, with traditional deductive proofs being replaced by a combination of non-rigorous numerical simulations, machine-generated proofs, probabilistic and probabilistically-checkable proofs, and proofs using graphics and video.  Horgan also suggested that Andrew Wiles’s then-brand-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem">proof</a> of Fermat’s Last Theorem—which might have looked, at first glance, like a spectacular counterexample to the “death of proof” thesis—could be the “last gasp of a dying culture” and a “splendid anachronism.”  Apparently, “The Death of Proof” garnered one of the largest volumes of angry mail in <em>Scientific American</em>‘s history, with mathematician after mathematician arguing that Horgan had strung together half-digested quotes and vignettes to manufacture a non-story.</p>



<p>Now Horgan—who you could variously describe as a wonderful sport, or a ham, or a sucker for punishment—has written a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/the-horgan-surface-and-the-death-of-proof/">26-year retrospective</a> on his “death of proof” article.  The prompt for this was Horgan’s recent discovery that, back in the 90s, David Hoffman and Hermann Karcher, two mathematicians annoyed by the “death of proof” article, had named a nonexistent mathematical object after its author.  The so-called <em><a href="https://minimalsurfaces.blog/home/repository/non-existent-surfaces/the-horgan-surface/">Horgan surface</a></em> is a minimal surface that numerical computations strongly suggested should exist, but that can be rigorously proven not to exist after all.  “The term was intended as an insult, but I’m honored anyway,” Horgan writes.</p>



<p>As a followup to his blog post, Horgan then decided to solicit commentary from various people he knew, including yours truly, about “how proofs are faring in an era of increasing computerization.”  He wrote, “I’d love to get a paragraph or two from you.”  Alas, I didn’t have the time to do as requested, but only to write <i>eight</i> paragraphs.  So Horgan suggested that I make the result into a post on my own blog, which he’d then link to.  Without further ado, then:</p>



<hr />



<p>John, I like you so I hate to say it, but the last quarter century has not been kind to your thesis about “the death of proof”!  Those mathematicians sending you the irate letters had a point: there’s been no fundamental change to mathematics that deserves such a dramatic title.  Proof-based math remains quite healthy, with (e.g.) a solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture">Poincaré conjecture</a> since your article came out, as well as to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05363">Erdős discrepancy problem</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadison%E2%80%93Singer_problem">Kadison-Singer conjecture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan%27s_conjecture">Catalan’s conjecture</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.308.998&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">bounded gaps in primes</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">testing primality in deterministic polynomial time</a>, etc. — just to pick a few examples from the tiny subset of areas that I know anything about.</p>



<p>There are evolutionary changes to mathematical practice, as there always have been.  Since 2009, the website <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/">MathOverflow</a> has let mathematicians query the global hive-mind about an obscure reference or a recalcitrant step in a proof, and get near-instant answers.  Meanwhile <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/">“polymath” projects</a> have, with moderate success, tried to harness blogs and other social media to make advances on long-standing open math problems using massive collaborations.</p>



<p>While humans remain in the driver’s seat, there are persistent efforts to increase the role of computers, with some notable successes.  These include Thomas Hales’s 1998 computer-assisted proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Kepler Conjecture</a> (about the densest possible way to pack oranges) — now fully machine-verified from start to finish, after <del>the </del><em><del>Annals of Mathematics</del></em><del> refused to publish a mixture of traditional mathematics and computer code</del> (seems this is not exactly what happened; see the comment section for more).  It also includes William McCune’s 1996 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_algebra">Robbins Conjecture</a> in algebra (the computer-generated <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/eqp-theorem.proof.txt">proof</a> was only half a page, but involved substitutions so strange that for 60 years no human had found them); and at the “opposite extreme,” the 2016 solution to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">Pythagorean triples problem</a> by Marijn Heule and collaborators, which weighed in at 200 terabytes (at that time, “the longest proof in the history of mathematics”).</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that someday, computers will replace humans at all aspects of mathematical research — but it’s also conceivable that, by the time they can do that, they’ll be able to replace humans at music and science journalism and everything else!</p>



<p><a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/proofs.ppt">New notions of proof</a> — including probabilistic, interactive, zero-knowledge, and even quantum proofs — have seen further development by theoretical computer scientists since 1993.  So far, though, these new types of proof remain either entirely theoretical (as with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01664">quantum proofs</a>), or else they’re used for cryptographic protocols but not for mathematical research.  (For example, zero-knowledge proofs now play a major role in certain cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zcash">Zcash</a>.)</p>



<p>In many areas of math (including my own, theoretical computer science), proofs have continued to get longer and harder for any one person to absorb.  This has led some to advocate a split approach, wherein human mathematicians would talk to each other only about the handwavy intuitions and high-level concepts, while the tedious verification of details would be left to computers.  So far, though, the huge investment of time needed to write proofs in machine-checkable format — for almost no return in new insight — has prevented this approach’s wide adoption.</p>



<p>Yes, there are non-rigorous approaches to math, which continue to be widely used in physics and engineering and other fields, as they always have been.  But none of these approaches have displaced proof as the gold standard whenever it’s available.  If I had to speculate about why, I’d say: if you use non-rigorous approaches, then even if it’s clear to you under what conditions your results can be trusted, it’s probably much less clear to others.  Also, even if only one segment of a research community cares about rigor, whatever earlier work that segment builds on will need to be rigorous as well — thereby exerting constant pressure in that direction.  Thus, the more collaborative a given research area becomes, the more important is rigor.</p>



<p>For my money, the elucidation of the foundations of mathematics a century ago, by Cantor, Frege, Peano, Hilbert, Russell, Zermelo, Gödel, Turing, and others, still stands as one of the greatest triumphs of human thought, up there with evolution or quantum mechanics or anything else.  It’s true that the ideal set by these luminaries remains mostly aspirational.  When mathematicians say that a theorem has been “proved,” they still mean, as they always have, something more like: “we’ve reached a social consensus that all the ideas are now in place for a strictly formal proof that could be verified by a machine … with the only task remaining being massive rote coding work that none of us has any intention of ever doing!”  It’s also true that mathematicians, being human, are subject to the full panoply of foibles you might expect: claiming to have proved things they haven’t, squabbling over who proved what, accusing others of lack of rigor while hypocritically taking liberties themselves.  But just like love and honesty remain fine ideals no matter how often they’re flouted, so too does mathematical rigor.</p>



<p><strong><font color="red">Update:</font></strong> <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/okay-maybe-proofs-arent-dying-after-all/">Here’s Horgan’s new post</a> (entitled “Okay, Maybe Proofs Aren’t Dying After All”), which also includes a contribution from Peter Woit.<br /></p></div>

In this note, we give a short, simple and almost completely self contained proof of a classical result of Kaltofen [Kal86, Kal87, Kal89] which shows that if an n variate degree $d$ polynomial f can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size s, then each of its factors can be computed by an arithmetic circuit of size at most poly(s, n, d). 

However, unlike Kaltofen's argument, our proof  does not  directly give an efficient algorithm for computing the circuits for the factors of f.</div>

We say that a first-order formula $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ over $\mathbb{R}$ defines a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$, if for every $x_1,\dots,x_n\in\{0,1\}$, $A(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is true iff $f(x_1,\dots,x_n)=1$. We show that:

(i) every $f$ can be defined by a formula of size $O(n)$, 
(ii) if $A$ is required to have at most $k\geq 1$ quantifier alternations, there exists an $f$ which requires  a formula of size $2^{\Omega(n/k)}$. 
 
The latter result implies several previously known as well as some new lower bounds in computational complexity. We note that (i) holds over any field of characteristic zero, and (ii) holds for any real closed or algebraically closed field.</div>

This text is a development of  a preprint of Ankit Gupta. 

We present an approach for devising a deterministic polynomial time whitekbox identity testing (PIT) algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.
This approach is similar to Kayal-Saraf approach for depth-$3$ circuits. Kayal and Saraf  based their algorithm on Sylvester-Gallai-type theorem about linear polynomials. We show how it is possible to generalize this approach to depth-$4$ circuits. However we failed to implement this plan completely. We succeeded to construct a polynomial time deterministic algorithm for depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin and its correctness requires a hypothesis. Also we present a  polynomial-time (unconditional) algorithm for some subclass of   depth-$4$ circuits with bounded top fanin.</div>

We show that strong-enough lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits or the non-negative rank of a matrix imply unconditional lower bounds in arithmetic or Boolean circuit complexity. First, we show that if a polynomial $f\in {\mathbb {R}}[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ of degree $d$ has an arithmetic circuit of size $s$ then $(x_1+\dots+x_n+1)^d+\epsilon f$ has a monotone arithmetic circuit of size $O(sd^2+n\log n)$, for some $\epsilon&gt;0$.  Second, if $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is a Boolean function,  we associate with $f$ an explicit exponential-size matrix $M(f)$ such that the Boolean circuit size of $f$ is at least $\Omega(\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))- 2n)$, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix and $\hbox{rk}_+$ denotes the non-negative rank of a matrix. In fact, the quantity $\min_{\epsilon &gt;0}(\hbox{rk}_+(M(f)-\epsilon J))$ characterizes how hard is it to distinguish rejecting and accepting inputs of $f$ by means of a linear program. 
Finally, we introduce a proof system resembling the Boolean monotone calculus and show that similar $\epsilon$-sensitive lower bounds on monotone arithmetic circuits imply lower bounds on proof-size in the system.</div>
