<p><img src="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/decentralizingdraft-01.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 328px; height: 150px;" alt="" />Blockchains and decentralized ledgers are creating a new reality for modern society. A major scientific impact of this new reality is that it creates an interdisciplinary arena where traditionally independent research areas, such as cryptography and game theory/economics, need to work together to address the relevant questions. The Simons Institute’s Fall 2019 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/proofs2019"><span>Proofs, Consensus, and Decentralizing Society</span></a> fostered much-needed cross-disciplinary collaboration by bringing together researchers from these disciplines.</p>



<h2 id="an-interdisciplinary-research-arena."><strong>An interdisciplinary research arena</strong></h2>



<p>The study of the interplay of cryptography and game theory/economics within the blockchain consists of several subareas. Here we discuss three such areas, with a focus on Bitcoin, as one of the most widely studied and adopted to date blockchains and cryptocurrencies. We stress that the relevant literature is huge and that discussing it all here is beyond the scope of this research vignette.</p>



<ol><li> <p><u><span>Cryptographic security and economic robustness</span></u><span>. </span>The works of Garay <span>et al.</span> [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Garay et al. 2015">12</a>] and Pass <span>et al.</span> <span class="citation">[<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Pass, Seeman, and Shelat, 2017">17</a>]</span> initiated the rigorous cryptographic study of the Bitcoin blockchain protocol and proved that under common assumptions about the underlying hash function and assuming the majority of the hashing power in the system is invested in executing the Bitcoin protocol (rather than attacking it), the protocol achieves a number of basic properties, such as <span>common prefix</span> (corresponding to the traditional notion of safety), <span>chain growth</span> (corresponding to liveness), and <span>chain quality</span> (ensuring that honest parties get to contribute blocks at an acceptable frequency). Follow-up work by Badertscher <span>et al.</span> [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Badertscher et al., 2017">4</a>] defined the functionality offered by the Bitcoin ledger and proved the protocol’s security under the above honest-majority assumption in a composable framework. This enables using the ledger functionality directly — without worrying about implementation details — within higher-level protocols. These initial works have ignited a number of follow-ups aiming at relaxing the underlying assumptions and/or tuning the protocol abstraction to better capture reality.</p> <p>Parallel to the cryptographic security of blockchain protocols, their economic robustness — i.e., their resilience to incentive-driven attacks/misbehavior — has been extensively investigated. A classical example here is the work of Eyal and Sirer [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Eyal and Sirer, 2014">9</a>]<span class="citation">,</span> which abstracted the protocol execution as a simple mining game and demonstrated that by withholding mined blocks and strategically releasing them, attackers with favorable network conditions might be incentivized to deviate from the Bitcoin protocol, even when they control only a minority of the hashing power. Note that such deviations cannot affect the worst-case security guarantees established in the cryptographic security proofs, but they can push them to their limits. For instance, although a selfish miner cannot break common prefix and chain quality, they can temporarily create the longest-allowed forks and/or minimize the number of blocks contributed by honest miners to the worst-case value allowed by chain quality.</p> </li><li> <p><span><u>Economics on blockchains</u></span>. Independently of the questions about their economic robustness, blockchains and their associated cryptocurrencies have created a new scientific playground for economists and game theorists to develop and test new theories and confirm old ones. Indicatively, Huberman <span>et al.</span> [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Huberman, Leshno, and Moallemi, 2019">15</a>] investigated how an ideal abstraction of Bitcoin yields a new market design paradigm where market forces do not control the functionality of the underlying payment system. They showed how analyzing this paradigm can explain behavioral aspects of Bitcoin and pointed to interesting modifications that can affect the efficiency of the protocol itself. Similarly, Benigno <span>et al.</span> [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Benigno, Schilling, and Uhlig, 2019">5</a>] demonstrated how under common economics assumptions, equipping a two-country economy with a global cryptocurrency can create market forces driving the nominal interest rates to be equal in the two countries and yielding a rate relation between the two national currencies; and Prat and Walter [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Prat and Walter, 2018">18</a>] proposed a model using the Bitcoin-U.S. dollar exchange rate to forecast the computing power of the Bitcoin network.</p> </li><li> <p><u><span>Blockchain-induced incentives on cryptographic protocols</span></u>. A third type of blockchain-related problem where cryptography and game theory meet is the design of more efficient and resilient cryptographic protocols using incentives induced by blockchains and cryptocurrencies. The classical example here is <span>fair multiparty computation</span> (in short, fair MPC). In MPC, <em><span class="math inline">n</span></em> parties wish to run a protocol to jointly compute a function on their private data. Fairness in this context requires that if a worst-case adversary — controlling and coordinating the (malicious) parties attacking the protocol — learns (any information on) the output, then the honest parties should also learn it. Cleve’s well-known impossibility result [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Cleve, 1986">8</a>] mandates that if the adversary controls a majority of parties, then fairness is impossible. Intuitively, the reason is that as the protocol has to tolerate any adversarial coalition, the actual corrupted parties might be the ones to first jointly learn such information; once they do, they can stop playing, thereby preventing other parties from also learning it. In [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Andrychowicz et al. 2014">2</a>, <a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Bentov and Kumaresan 2014">6</a>]<span class="citation">,</span> it was shown that using the Bitcoin blockchain as an automated escrow mechanism, one can enforce a version of fairness based on collaterals where either nobody learns any information or if someone does and prevents others from also learning it, then he loses his collateral to them. Assuming the adversary values his collateral higher than breaking fairness, this mechanism induces a fair evaluation. These results were subsequently extended to ensure robustness [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Kiayias, Zhou, and Zikas, 2016">16</a>], i.e., ensure that the protocol will not fail and either it will fairly conclude or the adversary will lose his collateral.</p></li></ol>

<h2 id="a-joint-collaborative-framework">A joint collaborative framework</h2>



<p>The above three layers of blockchain-inspired cross-disciplinary problems have mostly been studied independently by the two communities. The result is that they might include assumptions about the abstraction offered by the other discipline that might be too strong to realize. For example, the study of economics on blockchains typically abstracts the underlying blockchain as an ideal trusted ledger whose basic security properties do not depend on the economic mechanisms built on top of them. It is not hard to see that studying economics on top of such an idealized setting can become problematic when the relevant theories are applied in reality, with the actual blockchain protocol. Indeed, these theories and associated mechanisms can affect and/or give new insights on the incentives of parties maintaining the blockchain itself, which in turn can affect the economic robustness of the underlying blockchain and thereby the trustworthiness of the foundational ideal-blockchain assumption.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/newsletter-images/zikaspic2.png" alt="" /></figure>



<p>The above state of affairs calls for a unified treatment and associated framework that can address these interdependencies between the different layers.</p>



<p>A candidate for a first level of abstraction toward such a unification is the <span>rational protocol design</span> (RPD) framework of Garay <span>et al.</span> [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Garay et al. 2013">10</a>]. Rather than using the traditional approach of capturing a distributed protocol as a sequential game among the participants, RPD takes a cryptography-inspired approach to address the incentives of a malicious attacker to create party collusions and use them to attack the protocol, and the incentives of honest parties to stick to their protocol in the threat of such attacks. In fact, as demonstrated in [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Garay et al. 2015">11</a>, <a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Garay, Tackmann, and Zikas, 2015">13</a>]<span class="citation">,</span> the framework is suitable for capturing and analyzing fairness guarantees similar to those implied by the above collateral-based fairness mechanisms.</p>



<p>Most relevant to blockchains, our recent work [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Badertscher et al., 2018">3</a>] demonstrated how the RPD framework can be tuned to address the needs of the economic-robustness analysis of Bitcoin. We proved that when the Bitcoin-protocol version from [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Garay, Kiayias, and Leonardos 2015">12</a>,<span class="citation"> <a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Pass, Seeman, and Shelat, 2017">17</a>, <a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Badertscher et al., 2017">4</a>]</span> (i.e., the Bitcoin “backbone” with fixed hash-puzzle difficulty) is considered in isolation (where the miners’ utility depends only on their costs and rewards in the protocol), then assuming a sufficiently high Bitcoin-to-hashing-cost ratio, running the protocol strictly dominates attacking it even for a majority-controlling attacker. This indicates, among other things, that the deviations resulting from selfish-mining are in part the result of the difficulty readjustment mechanism. A number of different extensions of this result and applications of the RPD framework were discussed during the Simons Institute program. This includes investigating the forces that tame the attacker even in light of difficulty readjustment, capturing and formally analyzing more recent incentive-driven attacks, and addressing the effect of mining pools on Bitcoin’s security.</p>



<p>A major advantage of RPD when applied to analyze blockchains is its composability guarantees. On the one hand, stability (or strategy-proofness) statements in RPD can be done assuming access to ideally behaving (cryptographic) primitives, such as ideal commitments, signatures, etc. A universal composition theorem provided by the framework ensures then that these idealized statements are preserved even when those primitives are replaced by their cryptographic implementations. Such replacement is known not to be problematic in traditional game-theoretic cryptography models [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Gradwohl, Livne, and Rosen, 2010">14</a>]. Revising further game-theoretic notions of stability that allow for such replacement is an active research direction that was discussed during the Simons Institute program.</p>



<p>On the other hand, a stability statement in the RPD model specifies the ideal system and proves that it is implemented under an attacker incentivized by the assumed utilities. For example, [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Badertscher et al., 2018">3</a>] shows that under the incentives created by a high-enough ratio of Bitcoin reward to hashing cost, the fixed-difficulty version of the Bitcoin protocol realizes the same transaction ledger as in [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Badertscher et al., 2017">4</a>] but without the honest majority of hashing power assumption. The advantage of such a statement is that the economic analysis of a blockchain-based system (whether a market design or a cryptographic protocol) can now use the ledger from [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Badertscher et al., 2017">4</a>] as an ideal abstraction of Bitcoin’s ledger, provided the mechanism built on top of it does not affect the underlying realization statement. Using this principle, in [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Ciampi, Lu, and Zikas, 2020">7</a>] we devised a mechanism for leveraging blockchains to remove the mediator from a mediated game and replace it with a weaker assumption of local cryptographically secure hardware, thereby circumventing a powerful impossibility result from [<a href="https://blog.simons.berkeley.edu/feed/#Alwen et al. 2012">1</a>].</p>



<p>The research described here demonstrates the potential of the RPD framework to serve as common ground for the unified study of blockchains by the cryptography and game theory communities. Without further ramifications, however, the simple two-party game structure of the framework might restrict its expressivity. The study of alternative frameworks and their connection with RPD is an important research direction. The Simons Institute program on <span>Proofs, Consensus, and Decentralizing Society</span> brought together researchers from both these areas and has been a greenhouse for exchanging ideas toward such a unified theory.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Thirty years ago, I was in the middle of the second semester of my third year of undergrad, and one of the courses that I was enrolled in was on information theory. I was majoring in computer science, a major that had just been established at Sapienza University when I signed up for it in 1989, <s>organized by a computer science department that had also just been established in 1989</s>. A computer science department was established in 1991.</p>



<p>The new Sapienza computer science department was founded mostly by faculty from the Sapienza mathematics department, plus a number of people that came from other places to help start it. Among the latter, Renato Capocelli had moved to Rome from the University of Salerno, where he had been department chair of computer science.</p>



<p>Capocelli worked on combinatorics and information theory. In the early 90s, he had also become interested in the then-new area of zero-knowledge proofs.</p>



<p>Capocelli taught the information-theory course that I was attending, and it was a very different experience from the classes I had attended up to that point. To get the new major started, several professors were teaching classes outside their area, sticking close to their notes. Those teaching mathematical classes, were experts but were not deviating from the definition-theorem-proof script. Capocelli had an infectious passion for his subject, took his time to make us gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts of information theory, was full of examples and anecdotes, and  always emphasized the high-level idea of the proofs.</p>



<p>I subsequently met several other charismatic and inspiring computer scientists and mathematicians, though Capocelli had a very different personality from most of them. He was like an earlier generation of Southern Italian intellectuals, who could be passionate about their subject in a peculiarly non-nerdy way, loving it the way one may love food, people, nature, or a full life in general.</p>



<p>On April 8, 1992, Renato Capocelli <a href="https://www.di.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/dipartimento/capocelli.pdf">died suddenly and unexpectedly</a>, though his memory lives on in the many people he inspired. The Computer Science department of the University of Salerno was named after him for a period of time.</p></div>

Two of the most useful cryptographic primitives that can be constructed from one-way functions are pseudorandom generators (PRGs) and universal one-way hash functions (UOWHFs). The three major efficiency measures of these primitives are: seed length, number of calls to the one-way function, and adaptivity of these calls. Although a long and successful line of research studied these primitives, their optimal efficiency is not yet fully understood: there are gaps between the known upper bound and the known lower bound for black-box constructions.

Interstingly, the first construction of PRGs by H ?astad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP ’99], and the UOWHFs construction by Rompel [STOC ’90] shared a similar structure. Since then, there was an improvement in the efficiency of both constructions: The state of the art construction of PRGs by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [STOC ’10] uses $O(n^4)$ bits of random seed and $O(n^3)$ non-adaptive calls to the one-way function, or alternatively, seed of size $O(n^3)$ with $O(n^3)$ adaptive calls (Vadhan and Zheng [STOC ’12]). Constructing a UOWHF with similar parameters is still an open question. Currently, the best UOWHF construction by Haitner, Holenstein, Reingold, Vadhan, and Wee [Eurocrypt ’10] uses $O(n^{13})$ adaptive calls with a key of size $O(n^5)$.

In this work we give the first non-adaptive construction of UOWHFs from arbitrary one-way functions. Our construction uses $O(n^9)$ calls to the one-way function, and key of length $O(n^{10})$. By the result of Applebaum, Ishai, and Kushilevitz [FOCS ’04], the above implies the existence of UOWHFs in NC0, given the existence of one-way functions in NC1. We also show that the PRG construction of Haitner et al., with small modifications, yields a relaxed notion of UOWHFs. In order to analyze this construction, we introduce the notion of next-bit unreachable entropy, which replaces the next-bit pseudoentropy notion, used in the PRG construction above.</div>

<p>Illinois Tech removed the last of their mandatory masking restrictions yesterday. Chicago had zero Covid deaths. Yet I still get messages like this in my twitter feed.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don't care who you are. If I see you without a mask indoors when infections are rampant and there are many still at risk, I will see you as ignorant of science, narcissistic, and uncaring of the vulnerable around you. I will truly see you unmasked for what you are.</p>— Bill Comeau 🇨🇦🇺🇦 (@Billius27) <a href="https://twitter.com/Billius27/status/1510714029072912390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p></p><p>The science is unequivocal for vaccines, which do a good job preventing infection and a strong job saving lives. I just got my second booster on Sunday.</p><p>Masks give you some protection but nothing like the vaccines. It's impossible to completely remove the risk of Covid so people need to make their own choices and tradeoffs. If you are vaccinated your chance of serious illness is tiny, whether or not your wear a mask. And mask wearing is not cost-free.</p><p>I just don't like wearing masks. Wearing a mask bends my ears and is mildly painful. People can't always understand me when I talk through a mask, and they can't read my facial expressions. People and computers don't recognize me in a mask. Masks fog up my glasses. I can't exercise with a mask, it gets wet with sweat and hard to breath.

<p>After my <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2021/07/28/chess-com-55-1000/">previous post, </a>a reader (who amazingly has a nearly identical playing routine) pointed me to it.  It’s great!  Much better than chess.com.</p>



<p>“<em>No ads, no subscriptions; but open-source and passion.</em>“</p>



<p>“<em>Are some features reserved to Patrons? No, because Lichess is entirely free, forever, and for everyone. That’s a promise.</em>“</p>



<p>It doesn’t get better than that, in this world; and that’s why I love computers and the community surrounding them.</p>



<p>Another good news is that I got tired of 5 | 5!  The games are just too slow, and my chess isn’t even worth this much of my time.  I am now playing 3 | 2.  It’s fun the adrenaline kick I get with every match.  Also I got much stricter with my routine, and I don’t lose more than once a day.</p>



<p>Here’s my <a href="https://lichess.org/@/EAmaiLeNuvole">profile</a>.  It’s an anagram of my unpronounceable name which can be loosely translated as <em>…and I loved the clouds.</em></p>



<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Excessive activity and blunders merely reflect my generous sharing of credentials.</p>



<p>And then I thought, why don’t we automatically analyze existing games to find interesting situations, and present them to the user as a puzzle?  Naturally, the beauty — and dismay — of living in the AI (after-internet) era is that… <a href="https://chesstempo.com/chess-tactics/">it’s already done</a>.</p>



<p>OK, time for my daily fix.</p></div>

<div class="content">
We consider the range avoidance problem (called Avoid): given the description of a circuit $C:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^\ell$ (where $\ell &gt; n$), find a string $y\in\{0, 1\}^\ell$ that is not in the range of $C$. This problem is complete for the class APEPP that corresponds to explicit constructions of objects whose existence follows from the probabilistic method (Korten, FOCS 2021). 
    
Motivated by applications in explicit constructions and complexity theory, we initiate the study of the range avoidance problem for weak circuit classes, and obtain the following results:
    
    
1. Generalising Williams's connections between circuit-analysis algorithms and circuit lower bounds (J. ACM 2014), we present a framework for solving C-Avoid in $FP^{NP}$ using circuit-analysis data structures for C, for "typical" multi-output circuit classes C. As an application, we present a non-trivial $FP^{NP}$ range avoidance algorithm for De Morgan formulas.
An important technical ingredient is a construction of rectangular PCPs of proximity, building on the rectangular PCPs by Bhangale, Harsha, Paradise, and Tal (FOCS 2020).
        
2. Using the above framework, we show that circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$ are equivalent to circuit-analysis algorithms with $E^{NP}$ preprocessing. This is the first equivalence result regarding circuit lower bounds for $E^{NP}$. Our equivalences have the additional advantages that they work in both infinitely-often and almost-everywhere settings, and that they also hold for larger (e.g., subexponential) size bounds.

3. Complementing the above results, we show that in some settings, solving C-Avoid would imply breakthrough lower bounds, even for very weak circuit classes C. In particular, an algorithm for $AC^0$-Avoid with polynomial stretch (i.e., $\ell = poly(n)$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$, and an algorithm for $NC^0_4$-Avoid with very small stretch (i.e., $\ell = n + n^{o(1)}$) implies lower bounds against $NC^1$ and branching programs.

4. We show that Avoid is in FNP if and only if there is a propositional proof system that breaks every non-uniform proof complexity generator. This result connects the study of range avoidance with fundamental questions in proof complexity.</div>

We show that a randomly chosen linear map over a finite field gives a good hash function in the $\ell_\infty$ sense.  More concretely, consider a set $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^n$ and a randomly chosen linear map $L :  \mathbb{F}_q^n \to  \mathbb{F}_q^t$ with $q^t$ taken to be sufficiently smaller than $|S|$. Let $U_S$ denote a random variable distributed uniformly on $S$. Our main theorem shows that, with high probability over the choice of $L$, the random variable  $L(U_S)$ is close to uniform in the $\ell_\infty$ norm.  In other words, every element in the range $\mathbb{F}_q^t$ has about the same number of elements in $S$ mapped to it. This complements the widely-used Leftover Hash Lemma (LHL) which proves the analog statement under the statistical, or $\ell_1$, distance  (for a richer class of functions) as well as prior work on the expected largest 'bucket size' in linear hash functions  [ADMPT99].  Our proof leverages a connection between linear hashing and the finite field Kakeya problem and extends some of the tools developed in this area, in particular the polynomial method.</div>

We prove that the proof system OBDD(and, weakening) is not automatable unless P = NP. The proof is based upon the celebrated result of Atserias and Muller [FOCS 2019] about the hardness of automatability for resolution. The heart of the proof is lifting with a multi-output indexing gadget from resolution block-width to dag-like multiparty number-in-hand communication protocol size with $o(n)$ parties, where $n$ is the number of variables in the non-lifted formula. A similar lifting theorem for protocols with $n + 1$ participants was proved by Göös et. el. [STOC 2020] to establish the hardness of automatability result for Cutting Planes.</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In their highly influential paper, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004) introduced the notion of a relaxed locally decodable code (RLDC). Similarly to a locally decodable code (Katz-Trevisan; STOC 2000), the former admits access to any desired message symbol with only a few queries to a possibly corrupted codeword. An RLDC, however, is allowed to abort when identifying corruption. The natural analog to locally correctable codes, dubbed relaxed locally correctable codes (RLCC), was introduced by Gur, Ramnarayan and Rothblum (ITCS 2018) who constructed asymptotically-good length-$n$ RLCC and RLDC with $(\log{n})^{O(\log\log{n})}$ queries.

In this work we construct asymptotically-good RLDC and RLCC with an improved query complexity of $(\log{n})^{O(\log\log\log{n})}$. To achieve this, we devise a mechanism--an alternative to the tensor product--that squares the length of a given code. Compared to the tensor product that was used by Gur et al. and by many other constructions, our mechanism is significantly more efficient in terms of rate deterioration, allowing us to obtain our improved construction.</div>

<p class="justify-text">In <a href="https://francisbach.com/von-neumann-entropy/">last month blog post</a>, I presented the von Neumann entropy. It is defined as a spectral function on positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices, and leads to a Bregman divergence called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_relative_entropy">von Neumann relative entropy</a> (or matrix Kullback Leibler divergence), with interesting convexity properties and applications in optimization (mirror descent, or smoothing) and probability (concentration inequalities for matrices). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This month, I will show how the relative entropy relates to usual notions of information theory when applied to specific covariance matrices or covariance operators, with potential applications to all areas where entropy plays a role, and with a simple use of quantum information theory. This post is based on a recent preprint: see all details in [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>], as well as the conclusion section below for several avenues for future work.</p>



<h2>Von Neumann relative entropy between covariance matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider some set \(\mathcal{X}\), with a probability distribution \(p\). We assume given a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\), from \(\mathcal{X}\) to a \(d\)-dimensional vector space. This naturally defines a (non-centered) <em>covariance matri</em>x $$ \Sigma_{p} = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \varphi(x) \varphi(x)^\top dp(x), $$ which is a \(d \times d\) symmetric PSD matrix. We will assume throughout this post that the set \(\mathcal{X}\) is compact and that the Euclidean norm of \(\varphi\) is bounded on \(\mathcal{X}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given two distributions \(p\) and \(q\), and their associated covariance matrices \(\Sigma_p\) and \(\Sigma_q\), we can compute their von Neumann relative entropy as: $$ D( \Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) = {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma_p ( \log \Sigma_p \, – \log \Sigma_q) \big] – {\rm tr}\big[  \Sigma_p \big] +  {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma_q \big] .$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">We immediately get that \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) is always non-negative, and zero if and only if \(\Sigma_p = \Sigma_q\). This property, that makes it a potentially interesting measure of dissimilarity, is shared among all Bregman divergences on covariance matrices, and has been extensively used in data science (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/kulis09a/kulis09a.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/060649021">3</a>]). What makes the von Neumann entropy special?</p>



<p class="justify-text">One important property is that it is jointly convex in \(p\) and \(q\), but this is also shared by other divergences [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>, Appendix A.4]. What really makes the von Neumann entropy special is its explicit link with with information theory.</p>



<h2>Finite sets with orthonormal embeddings</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Let’s start with the simplest situation. If \(\mathcal{X}\) is finite with \(d\) elements, and we have an orthonormal embedding, that is, for all \(x,y \in \mathcal{X}\), \(\varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y) = 1_{x = y}\), then, after a transformation by a rotation matrix, we can assume that each \(\varphi(x)\) is one element of the canonical basis, and all covariance matrices are diagonal (without the rotation, we would have that all covariance matrices are jointly diagonalizable), and for probability distributions \(p\) and \(q\), using the same notation for their probability mass functions, we have: $$D( \Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)  = \sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)} = D(p \|q ), $$ which is exactly the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leilbler</a> (KL) divergence between the two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) [4].</p>



<p class="justify-text">Can we push this further beyond finite sets and finite-dimensional feature maps, and obtain a link with classical notions from information theory?</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first remark is the invariance by rotation within the feature space (that is, if we replace \(\varphi(x)\) by \(R \varphi(x)\), where \(R\) is an \(d \times d\) orthogonal matrix, the von Neumann entropy does not change), so that it depends only on the dot-product \(k(x,y) = \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\), which is the traditional kernel function. As will see, this opens us the entire area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method">kernel machines</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A second remark is that we can go infinite-dimensional, and replace \(\mathbb{R}^d\) by any Hilbert space. This complicates a bit the exposition, and I refer to [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for more formal definitions. In this post, I will shamelessly go infinite-dimensional by using matrices with infinite dimensions when needed.</p>



<h2>Lower-bound on Shannon relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We first upper-bound \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) by joint convexity of the von Neumann relative entropy (see <a href="https://francisbach.com/von-neumann-entropy/">last post</a>) and Jensen’s inequality: $$ D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) =  D \Big( \int_{\mathcal{X}}\varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top dp(x) \Big\| \int_{\mathcal{X}} \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top dp(x) \Big)$$ $$\ \ \,  \leqslant  \int_{\mathcal{X}} D \Big( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top \Big\| \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \Big) dp(x).$$ The two matrices  \( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top\) and \(\frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \) are proportional to each other, and have \(\varphi(x)\) as the only eigenvector with a potentially non zero eigenvalue, so that we have $$ D \Big( \varphi(x)  \varphi(x)^\top \Big\| \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \varphi(x)   \varphi(x)^\top \Big) =  \| \varphi(x) \|^2  \bigg[ \log \Big( \frac{dp}{dq}(x) \Big)  \ – 1 +  \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \bigg].$$ Integrating with respect to \(p\) leads to cancellations: $$  D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \leqslant \int_{\mathcal{X}}\| \varphi(x) \|^2  \log \Big( \frac{dq}{dp}(x) \Big) dp(x) \tag{1}.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">If we assume a unit norm bound on all features, that is, \(\| \varphi(x)\| \leqslant 1\) for all \(x \in \mathcal{X}\), we get  $$  D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \leqslant  \int_{\mathcal{X}} \log \Big( \frac{ dp}{dq}(x) \Big) dp(x) = D(p\|q), $$ and thus we have found a lower bound on the regular Shannon relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>From relative entropy to entropy. </strong>We can also define a new notion of entropy by considering the relative entropy with respect to the uniform distribution on \(\mathcal{X}\), which we denote \(\tau\). That is, defining \(\Sigma\) the covariance matrix for the uniform distribution, we consider $$ H(\Sigma_p) = \ – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma),$$ which is thus greater than (with a unit norm bound on all features) $$- \int_{\mathcal{X}}   \log \big( \frac{d p}{d \tau}(x)\big) dp(x),$$ which is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_entropy">differential entropy</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We now look at a few simple examples, and present further properties later (such as a well-defined bound in the other direction). We consider only one-dimensional examples, but the theory extends to all dimensions and all kernels. In particular, finite large sets such as \(\{-1,1\}^d\) can be considered (see [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>]).</p>



<h2>Polynomials and moments</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider \(\mathcal{X} = [-1,1]\) and \(\varphi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{r+1}\) spanning all degree \(r\) polynomials, with \(k(x,y) = \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\). For these examples, \(\Sigma_p\) is composed of all classical moments of order up to \(2r\). </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Regular polynomial kernel. </strong>Following traditional kernel methods, we can first consider \(\displaystyle k(x,y) = \frac{1}{2^r} ( 1 + xy)^r\), which corresponds to $$\varphi(x)_j =  \frac{1}{2^{r/2}} {{ r \choose j}\!\!}^{1/2} x^j,$$ for \(j \in \{0,\dots,r\}\). We also have \(\sup_{ x\in \mathcal{X} } k(x,x) = 1\), which allows for the Shannon relative entropy upper-bound. Let us consider two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) on \([-1,1]\), and understand if letting \(r\) go to infinity leads to a good estimation of the Shannon relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, we consider the distribution \(p\) with density \(\frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2}\) (this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">Beta distribution</a>  affinely rescaled to \([-1,1]\) instead of \([0,1]\)), plotted below, and \(q\) the uniform distribution, with density \(1/2\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="290" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/density.png" class="wp-image-6964" height="181" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">All moments are available in closed form (see end of post), and the Shannon relative entropy is equal to \(D(p\|q) = \int_{-1}^1 \! \frac{2}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2} \log \frac{4}{\pi} \sqrt{1-x^2} dx \approx 0.0484\). We can then compute for various values of \(r\), \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), which is plotted below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="289" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/reg_pol_kernel-2.png" class="wp-image-6937" height="269" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We should hope that the approximation improves as we use more monomials, but this is not the case. As common in kernel methods, the standard polynomial kernel does not have a good behavior. This is partly due to the fact that \(k(x,x) = \big( \frac{1+x^2}{2} \big)^r\) is far from uniform on \([-1,1]\).</p>



<p>Let’s now consider a better polynomial kernel.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Christofell-Darboux kernels. </strong>Other polynomial bases could be used as well beyond \(1, X, \dots, X^r\), in particular any basis of polynomials with increasing degrees \(P_0, \dots, P_r\) can be used, in particular polynomials that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_polynomials">orthogonal</a> with respect to a probability distribution on \([-1,1]\), with $$ \varphi(x)_j = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_r}} P_j(x) \mbox{ and } k(x,y) = \frac{1}{\alpha_r} \sum_{j=0}^r P_j(x) P_j(y),$$ where \(\alpha_r\) is here to ensure that \(k(x,x) \leqslant 1\) on \([-1,1]\). The kernel function \(k(x,y)\) has then itself a simple expression through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoffel%E2%80%93Darboux_formula">Christoffel–Darboux formula</a>, as $$ k(x,y) \propto   \frac{P_r(x)P_{r+1}(y)-P_r(y)P_{r+1}(x)}{x-y},$$ with an explicit proportionality constant. For more details on these kernels and their application to data analysis, see [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01845137v3/document">5</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">For example, for <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev polynomials</a>, which are orthonormal with respect to the probability measure with density \(\big(\pi \sqrt{1-x^2}\big)^{-1}\) on \([-1,1]\), we have \(P_0 = 1\), \(P_1 =  \sqrt{2} X\), and \(P_2 = \sqrt{2}( 2X^2 – 1) \), and more generally, for \(k&gt;0\), \(P_k(\cos \theta) = \sqrt{2}\cos k\theta\). One can then check that for \(x = \cos \theta\) and \(y = \cos \eta\), we have $$k(x,y) = \frac{1}{2} \Big( \frac{ \sin ( 2r+1)( \theta-\eta)/2}{\sin ( \theta-\eta)/2} + \frac{ \sin ( 2r+1)( \theta+\eta)/2}{\sin ( \theta+\eta)/2}  \Big).$$ Moreover, we can check that $$ \sup_{x \in \, [-1,1]} k(x,x) = 2r+1, $$ leading to \(\alpha_r = 2r+1\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"> </p>



<p class="justify-text">As shown below, after computing (still in closed form, see end of the post) \(\Sigma_p\) and \(\Sigma_q\), we can plot the relative entropy, and compare it to the true one. This leads to an improved estimation.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="293" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/cheb_pol_kernel-2.png" class="wp-image-6936" height="273" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This is better, but still not quite there, and we get in fact convergence to exactly one half of the true relative entropy. The motivated reader will check that the limit of \(k(x,x)\) when \(r \) tends to infinity is \(1/2\) for all \(x \in (-1,1)\), and \(1\), for \(x \in \{-1,1\}\) (that is, the upper-bound of \(1\) is valid, but it is almost surely equal to \(1/2\)). This is where we lose the factor of \(1/2\) in Eq. (1) above.</p>



<p class="justify-text">One key overall insight is that the span of the feature space is not the only important aspect in the approximation, and that some rescalings are better than others (more on this below when optimize with respect to the chosen basis). Given that we end up estimating entropies from moments, it would be clearly interesting to compare with other ways of estimating entropies from moments, such as using asymptotic expansions based on Edgeworth expansions [8].</p>



<h2>Fourier series and translation-invariant kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We still consider \(\mathcal{X} = [-1,1]\). For a \(2\)-periodic function \(q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), such that \(q(0) = 1\), with Fourier series \(\hat{q}: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{C}\), we can consider $$k(x,y) = q(x-y) = \sum_{\omega \in \mathcal{Z}} \hat{q}(\omega) e^{i\pi \omega(x-y)}.$$ We can for example take $$q(x) = \frac{\sin ( 2r+1) \pi x/2}{(2r+1)\sin \pi x/2} $$ which corresponds to \(\hat{q}(\omega) = \frac{1}{2r+1} 1_{|\omega| \leqslant r}\), and having $$ \varphi(x)_\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2r+1}} e^{ i\pi \omega x } $$ for \(\omega \in \{-r-1,\dots,r+1\}\) (we consider complex-valued features for simplicity). We refer to this kernel as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_kernel">Dirichlet kernel</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Link with eigenvalues of Toeplitz matrices.</strong> For the specific choice of the Dirichlet kernel, the element of the covariance matrix indexed by \(\omega\) and \(\omega’\) has value \(\int_{-1}^1 e^{i\pi (\omega-\omega’)} dp(x)\), which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_function_(probability_theory)">characteristic function</a> of \(p\) evaluated at \(\pi(\omega-\omega’)\). One consequence is that \(\Sigma_p\) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix">Toeplitz matrix</a> with constant values across all diagonals. It is then well-known that as \(m\) goes to infinity, the eigenvalues of \(\Sigma_p\) are tending in distribution to \(p\) (see [<a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~gray/CIT006-journal.pdf">10</a>]), which provides another proof of good estimation of the entropy in this very particular case.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that we could also consider an infinite-dimensional kernel \(q(x) =\Big( 1+ \frac{\sin^2 \pi x/2}{\sinh^2 \sigma}\Big)^{-1}\) which corresponds to \( \hat{q}(\omega) \propto e^{-2\sigma |\omega|}\), where the link with Toeplitz matrices does not apply. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Increasing number of frequencies. </strong>We can then plot the estimation of the same relative entropy as for polynomial kernels, as the number of frequency grows (we can still get the Fourier moments in closed form, see end of post).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="305" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dirichlet_kernel-1.png" class="wp-image-6944" height="283" /></figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">We now see that as the dimension of the feature space grows, we get a perfect estimation of the relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">This estimation is provably from below, but how far is it? How big \(r\) needs to be? </p>



<h2>Upper-bound trough quantum information theory</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to find a lower-bound \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), we cannot rely on Jensen’s inequality, as it is in the wrong direction (this happens a lot!). But here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information">quantum information theory</a> can come to the rescue. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Using the covariance matrix \(\Sigma\) associated to the uniform distribution \(\tau\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), we consider the PSD matrices \(D(y)\), indexed by \(y \in \mathcal{X}\), equal to $$D(y) = \Sigma^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \varphi(y)^\top \Sigma^{-1/2},$$ for which we have $$\int_{\mathcal{X}} D(y) d\tau(y) =\Sigma^{-1/2} \Big( \int_{\mathcal{X}}  \varphi(y) \varphi(y)^\top d\tau(y)\Big)\Sigma^{-1/2} =   I. $$ We can now consider, in quantum information theory terms, that each \(D(y)\) corresponds to a measurement that can be applied to a density operator, and that we look at measures obtained from \(p\), as \(\tilde{p}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_p)\), and from \(q\) as \(\tilde{q}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_q)\). This is a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_operation">quantum operation</a> because the matrices \(D(y)\) are PSD and sum to identity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The monotonicity of the von Neumann entropy with respect to quantum operations [9] applies, and we immediately get $$D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \geqslant \int_{\mathcal{X}} \tilde{p}(y) \log \frac{ \tilde{p}(y)}{\tilde{q}(y)} d\tau(y).$$ The lower-bound can be seen as the Shannon relative entropy \(D( \tilde{p} \| \tilde{q} )\) between the distributions with density \(\tilde{p}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) with respect to \(\tau\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">These densities have direct relationships with \(p\) and \(q\). Indeed,  we have $$\tilde{p}(y) = {\rm tr } ( D(y) \Sigma_p) = \int_{\mathcal{X}} \big( \varphi(x)^\top \Sigma^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \big)^2 dp(x).$$ Denoting $$h(x,y) = \big( \varphi(x)^\top \Sigma_\tau^{-1/2} \varphi(y) \big)^2,$$ we have \(\int_{\mathcal{X}} h(x,y) d\tau(x) = \| \varphi(y)\|^2\) for all \(y \in \mathcal{X}\), and thus, when the features have unit norms, we can consider \(h\) as a smoothing kernel, and thus \(\tilde{p}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) as smoothed versions of \(p\) and \(q\). Thus, overall we have: $$D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q}) \leqslant D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)  \leqslant D(p\|q),$$ and we have sandwitched the kernel relative entropy by Shannon relative entropies.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can then characterize the error made in estimating the relative entropy by measuring how the smoothing kernel \(h(x,y)\) differs from a Dirac. In  [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>, Section 4.2], I show how, for metric spaces, the difference between \(D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q})\) and \(D({p} \|{q}) \), and thus between \(D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\) and \(D(\tilde{p} \| \tilde{q})\), is upperbounded by an explicit function of \(p\) and \(q\), times $$ \sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} h(x,y) d(x,y)^2 d\tau(y),$$ which is indeed small when \(h(x,y)\) is closed to a Dirac.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For the Dirichlet kernel presented above, we can show that $$h(x,y) = \frac{1}{4r+2} \bigg( \frac{\sin ( 2r+1) \pi (x-y)/2}{\sin \pi (x-y)/2}\bigg)^2,$$ and that the quantity above characterizing convergence scales as \(1 / (2r+1)\), thus providing an explicit convergence rate. As an illustration, we plot the smoothing kernel at \(y=0\), that is, \(h(x,0)\) in regular scale (left) and log-scale (right), for the Dirichlet kernel above (for which we have unit norm features) for various values of \(r\). We see how it converges to a Dirac as \(r\) grows.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="503" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/smoothh_both-2.gif" class="wp-image-6999" height="223" /></figure></div>



<h2>Estimation</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Above, we have relied on finite-dimensional feature maps and explicit expectations under \(p\) and \(q\). This is clearly not scalable to generic situations and potentially infinite-dimensional feature spaces. But we can rely here on 30 years of progress in kernel methods.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For simplicity here, we will only estimate the von Neumann entropy \({\rm tr}\big[ \Sigma_p \log \Sigma_p \big]\) from \(n\) independent and identically distributed samples. The natural estimator is \({\rm tr}\big[ \hat{\Sigma}_p \log \hat{\Sigma} _p \big]\), where \(\hat{\Sigma}_p\) and \(\hat{\Sigma}_q\) are empirical covariance matrices (the averages of \(\varphi(x_i) \varphi(x_i)^\top\) over all data points \(x_1,\dots,x_n\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text">In order to compute it efficiently, we can use the usual kernel trick, exactly as used within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_principal_component_analysis">kernel principal component analysis</a>, and if \(K\) is the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix associated with the \(n\) data points, then the eigenvalues of \(\frac{1}{n} K\) and \(\hat{\Sigma}_p\) are the same, and thus $$  {\rm tr}\big[ \hat{\Sigma}_p \log \hat{\Sigma} _p \big] =  {\rm tr}\big[ \big(\frac{1}{n}K  \big)\log \big( \frac{1}{n} K \big)  \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In terms of statistical analysis, we refer to [1] where it is shown that the difference between the estimate and the true value is of order \(C / \sqrt{n}\), with an explicit constant \(C\), for a wide range of kernels. Surprisingly, there is no need to add any form of regularization.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Entropy estimation. </strong>Together with the approximation result presented above, by letting \(r\) go to infinity for the Dirichlet kernel, we get an estimator of the regular Shannon entropy which is not that bad (see [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.02141">7</a>] for an optimal one).</p>



<h2>Learning representations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above for polynomials, a key question is how to choose a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}^d\). Given that we have a lower-bound on the relative entropy, it is tempting to try to <em>maximize</em> this lower bound, subject to \(\forall x \in \mathcal{X}\), \(\| \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\|^2 \leqslant 1\). The magic is that this is a tractable optimization problem (concave maximization with convex constraints) in the kernel function \((x,y) \mapsto \varphi(x)^\top \varphi(y)\). This is not an obvious result (in fact, I first tried to prove that the von Neumann relative entropy was convex in the kernel, while it is in fact concave). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for the concavity proofs and simple optimization algorithms.</p>



<h2>Duality and log-partition functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given that our kernel notions of relative entropies are lower bounds on the regular notions, by the traditional convex duality results between maximum entropy and log-partition functions (see, e.g., [<a href="https://www.nowpublishers.com/article/DownloadSummary/MAL-001">11</a>]), we should obtain upper-bounds on log-partition functions. This is exactly what we can get, we simply provide the gist here and refer to [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">1</a>] for further details. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Given a probability distribution \(q\) on \(\mathcal{X}\) and a function \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\), the log-partition function is defined as $$a(f) = \log \bigg( \int_{\mathcal{X}} e^{f(x)} dq(x)\bigg) \tag{2}.$$ It plays a crucial role in probabilistic and statistical inference, and obtaining upper-bounds is instrumental in deriving approximate inference algorithms [11]. A classical convex duality result shows a link with the Shannon relative entropy, as we can express \(a(f)\) as $$a(f) = \sup_{ p\  {\rm probability} \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x) \ – D( p \| q).$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Assuming that all features have unit norm, we have \(D(p \|q) \geqslant D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q)\), and thus $$ a(f) \leqslant \sup_{ p \ {\rm probability} \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x)\  – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q),$$ which is itself smaller than the supremum over all signed measures with unit mass (thus removing the non-negativity constraint). Therefore, $$ a(f) \leqslant \sup_{ p \ {\rm measure}} \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x)\  – D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q) \tag{3},$$ which can be made computationally tractable in a number of cases.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I tried to exhibit a new link between kernels and information theory, which mostly relies on the convexity properties of von Neumann entropy and a bit of quantum analysis. Clearly, the practical relevance of this link remains to be established, but it opens tractable information theory tools to all types of data on which positive kernels can be defined (essentially all of them), with many potential avenues for future work.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Multivariate modelling.</strong> Regular entropies and relative entropies are used extensively in data science, such as for variational inference, but also to characterize various forms of statistical dependences between random variable. It turns out that the new kernel notions allow for this as well, connecting with a classical line of work within kernel methods [<a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bach02a/bach02a.pdf">12</a>, <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume11/sriperumbudur10a/sriperumbudur10a.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Other divergences.</strong> I have focused primarily on the link with Shannon relative entropies, but most of the results extend to all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a>. For example, we can get kernel-based lower bounds on the square <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellinger_distance">Hellinger distance</a>, or the \(\chi^2\)-divergences.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kernel sum-of-squares with a probabilistic twist.</strong> As a final note, there is a link between the new notions of kernel entropies with global optimization with <a href="https://francisbach.com/finding-global-minima-with-kernel-approximations/">kernel sum-of-squares</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11978">14</a>]. Indeed, in Eq. (2), if we add a temperature parameter \(\varepsilon\) and define $$a_\varepsilon(f) =\varepsilon  \log \bigg( \int_{\mathcal{X}} e^{f(x) / \varepsilon} dq(x) \bigg), $$ then when \(\varepsilon\) tends to zero, \(a_\varepsilon(f) \) tends to \(\sup_{x \in \mathcal{X}} f(x)\). The lower bound from Eq. (3) then becomes $$\sup_{ p \ {\rm measure}}  \int_{\mathcal{X}} f(x) dp(x) \ – \varepsilon D(\Sigma_p \| \Sigma_q),$$ which exactly tends to the sum-of-squares relaxation for the optimization problem. Given that for global optimization, smoothness can be leveraged to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, we can imagine something similar for log-partition functions and entropies.</p>

Given query access to a monotone function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ with certificate complexity $C(f)$ and an input $x^{\star}$, we design an algorithm that outputs a size-$C(f)$ subset of $x^{\star}$ certifying the value of $f(x^{\star})$. Our algorithm makes $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries to $f$, which matches the information-theoretic lower bound for this problem and resolves the concrete open question posed in the STOC '22 paper of Blanc, Koch, Lange, and Tan [BKLT22].

We extend this result to an algorithm that finds a size-$2C(f)$ certificate for a real-valued monotone function with $O(C(f) \cdot \log n)$ queries. We also complement our algorithms with a hardness result, in which we show that finding the shortest possible certificate in $x^{\star}$ may require $\Omega\left(\binom{n}{C(f)}\right)$ queries in the worst case.</div>

<p>A brief summary: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.17207">In the paper, A proof of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture,</a> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jinyoungpark">Jinyoung Park</a> and <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~huypham/">Huy Tuan Pham</a> proved the 2006 expectation threshold conjecture posed by Jeff Kahn and me. The proof is wonderful. Congratulations Jinyoung and Huy Tuan!</p>
<p>The 2006 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603218">expectation threshold conjecture</a> gives a justification for a naive way to estimate the threshold probability of a random graph property. Suppose that you are asked about the critical probability for a random graph in G(n,p) for having a perfect matching (or a Hamiltonian cycle). You compute the expected number of perfect matchings and realize that when p is C/n this expected number equals 1/2. (For Hamiltonian cycles it will be C’/n.) Of course, if the expectation is one half, the probability for a perfect matching can still be very low; indeed, in this case, an isolated vertex is quite likely but when there is no isolated vertices the expected number of perfect matchings is rather large. Our 2006 conjecture boldly asserts that the gap between the value given by such a naive computation and the true threshold value is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. Jeff and I tried hard to find a counterexample but instead we managed to find more general and stronger forms of the conjecture that we could not disprove.</p>
<p>Two years ago Keith Frankston, Jeff Kahn, Bhargav Narayanan, and Jinyoung Park proved a weak form of the conjecture which was proposed in a 2010 paper by Michel Talagrand. (See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/">this post</a>.) Indeed, the expectation threshold conjecture had some connections with a 1995 paper of Michel Talagrand entitled <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-0348-9090-8_25">Are all sets of positive measure essentially convex?</a> In a 2010 STOC paper <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Are Many Small Sets Explicitly Small?</a> Michel formulated a whole array of interesting conjectures and commented that he feels that these conjectures are related to the expectation threshold conjecture to which he offered a weaker fractional version. This weak version suffices for various applications of the original conjecture. Keith, Jeff, Bhargav, and Jinyoung’s work built on the breakthrough work of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang on the Erdős-Rado ‘sunflower’ conjecture. </p>
<p>Proving the full expectation threshold conjecture looked like a  difficult task. The only path that people saw was to try to relate Talagrand’s fractional expectation threshold with our expectation threshold. (Indeed Talagrand also conjectured that they only differ by a multiplicative constant factor. This looked if true very difficult to prove.)  However this is not the path taken by Jinyoung Park and Huy Tuan Pham and they found a direct simple argument! Jinyoung and Huy Tuan also used their method to settle one of the central conjectures (Conj 5.7) from <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.165.6973&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Talagrand’s paper</a> and this will be presented in a forthcoming paper.</p>
<p>The <em>logn</em> gap in our conjecture looked rather narrow but now that it was proved we can ask for conditions that will guarantee a smaller gap. For example, when is the gap only a constant?</p>

We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game $\mathcal G$ with value less than one, whose query distribution has the support $\mathcal S = \{(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)\}$ of hamming weight one vectors, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ decays polynomially fast to zero; that is, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal  G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal  G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Following the recent work of Girish, Holmgren, Mittal, Raz and Zhan (STOC 2022), our result is the missing piece that implies a similar bound for a much more general class of multiplayer games: For $\textbf{every}$ 3-player game $\mathcal G$ over $\textit{binary questions}$ and $\textit{arbitrary answer lengths}$, with value less than 1, there is a constant $c = c(\mathcal G)&gt;0$ such that the value of the game $\mathcal G^{\otimes n}$ is at most $n^{-c}$.
	
Our proof technique is new and requires many new ideas. For example, we make use of the Level-$k$ inequalities from Boolean Fourier Analysis, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been explored in this context prior to our work.</div>

Mr. Apollinax might have made a good escort for Lofa Polir, had she lived a hundred years ago. The titular character of a <a href="https://interestingliterature.com/2017/09/a-short-analysis-of-t-s-eliots-mr-apollinax/">poem</a> written circa 1915 by Thomas Eliot was based on Bertrand Russell, whose 1901 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">paradox</a> revealed a gaping inconsistency in set theory as it was then known. Russell spent much of the intervening years trying to repair the gap via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory#History">type theory</a>.</p>
<p>
Today we present a recently-discovered inconsistency in the type theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> programming language, which forced a feature-chopping <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/type-projection.html">revision</a> in its new version <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html">3.0</a>. Then, in a worldwide exclusive, we reveal a new theorem by Polir that explains why such inconsistencies are <em>inevitable</em>.</p>
<p>
Ernst Zermelo had already noticed the paradox in 1899 but brushed it off because his axiom system already evaded it. It is possible that Georg Cantor knew it in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BtZM33PzV9UC&amp;pg=PA923&amp;lpg=PA923&amp;dq=Cantor+letter+to+Dedekind+and+Hilbert+about+inconsistency&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hE28iI4IT4&amp;sig=ACfU3U2CMPDUFBheRaXGQcIMFngE-Iytdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj1j-7ej_T2AhXJY98KHd7WDuUQ6AF6BAgOEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Cantor letter to Dedekind and Hilbert about inconsistency&amp;f=false">letters</a> in 1897 to Richard Dedekind and David Hilbert. I could call this a continuation of a theme we’ve often addressed about discoveries not being named for their first discoverers, but I will not, for this reason: The discover<b>ee</b> was Gottlob Frege, who immediately recognized that the treatise on set theory he was about to publish had been devastated by the paradox. And the person he heard that from, in June 1902, was Russell—not any of his own compatriots.</p>
<p>
The poem comes with an epigram from a Greek text by Lucian satirically praising the painter Zeuxis of Herakleia: “Ω τῆς καινότητος. Ἡράκλεις, τῆς παραδοξολογίας. εὐμήχανος ἄνθρωπος.”  The reference <a href="https://genius.com/annotations/3603099/standalone_embed">translation</a> Eliot had to hand goes: “Such novelty! Heavens, what paradoxes! How inventive he is!”  I believe, however, that Eliot intended a more-particulate reading: “Oh for his innovation! Hercules, his paradoxology! Sweet machine man!”  That goes better with the poem <a href="https://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/content/mr-apollinax">text</a> and with aspects of Russell that were visible to Eliot at the time.  We’ll only talk about the <i>paradoxology</i>.  Russell was well aware that other monsters besides his own were lurking, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene-Rosser_paradox">ones</a> that emerged in the US.  What if patching paradoxes is just the way of progress?  Let’s see this play out in the Scala programming language.</p>
<p></p><h2> The Inconsistency </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The root of the inconsistency is allowing <em>projection</em> of an <em>abstract</em> type. Let’s explain the former concept with concrete types first. A standard way to represent trees and other graphs is by having a nested node class, for instance:</p>
<p><code><br />
class BinaryTree[A &lt;: Comparable[A]] {</code></p>
<p>   class Node(var left: Node, var item: A, var right: Node)</p>
<p>   private var root: Node = null<br />
   //etc.<br />
}<br />
</p>
<p>
A key wrinkle of Scala is that if you have two different trees <font size="+1"><tt>T1</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2</tt></font>, then <font size="+1"><tt>T1.Node</tt></font> and <font size="+1"><tt>T2.Node</tt></font> are separate types. This notion of <em>path-dependent types</em> enables the compiler to catch bugs where you might try to connect a node on one tree as a child of a node in the other tree. If there were just one <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree.Node</tt></font> type, as is standard in Java for instance, then you could easily make this kind of bug and the compiler would not bat an eye.</p>
<p>
If you really do want to combine nodes from two different trees, however, you can do so via code using the projection type <font size="+1"><tt>BinaryTree#Node</tt></font>. The hash sign # makes this defined to be the <i>supertype</i> of nodes of all possible binary trees. </p>
<p>
The <font size="+1"><tt>[A &lt;: Comparable[A]]</tt></font> part means that the tree can hold any type <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> of data that extends a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> called <font size="+1"><tt>Comparable</tt></font>, whose function is to mandate having a comparison function for <font size="+1"><tt>A</tt></font> so that the tree can be kept sorted. The symbol <font size="+1"><tt>&gt;:</tt></font> written the other way means supertype rather than subtype.</p>
<p>
We could try to make our binary tree class more versatile by making it more abstract. By itself it could be a <font size="+1"><tt>trait</tt></font> so as to allow deferred implementations. It could try to define a more general notion of <font size="+1"><tt>Node</tt></font> that might relate more directly to stored data, for instance strings or numbers. This is not to say such abstractions are necessarily well-motivated, but the point is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The Scala compiler defines what is workable. <p></p>
</li><li>
Its notion of workability is based on mathematical type theory. <p></p>
</li><li>
Lots of abstract constructions are made workable to encourage creativity.
</li></ul>
<p>
Workability is not supposed to lead to type errors, however. That is the unsoundness allowed in versions 2.x of Scala.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Code </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
If you have a lot of time—time to read the longest <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2013/11/15/the-graph-of-math/">post</a> ever on this blog—then you can draw some motivation for the unsound code. That post shows how to represent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann-Bernays-Godel_set_theory">NBG</a> version of set theory, due to John von Neuman, Paul Bernays, and Kurt Gödel, as an infinite graph. At the top of the graph are nodes representing the class of all sets and various other expansive types, which are symbolized by <font size="+1"><tt>V</tt></font> in the post. At the bottom is a node for the null set identified with <font size="+1"><tt>O</tt></font>. We can think of them as representing “zones” for possible supertypes and subtypes of some types of interest, such as string and number. </p>
<p>
Aside from some abstract manipulation of types, the following code does nothing except compose two versions of the identity function, applied to a <font size="+1"><tt>String</tt></font>. As you are welcome to try yourself, it compiles in Scala 2.x. But before you try to run it, you can ask yourself: exactly what number would the string “Hello World!” become?</p>
<p>
<code><br />
/** File "Unsound.scala", mod by KWR from the last example in<br />
    <a href="https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html" rel="nofollow">https://lptk.github.io/programming/2019/09/13/type-projection.html</a><br />
 */<br />
object Unsound extends App {</code></p>
<p>   trait VZone { type Node &gt;: String }<br />
   trait OZone { type Node &lt;: Double }</p>
<p>   def liftup[A &lt;: VZone]: String =&gt; A#Node<br />
      = (x =&gt; x)<br />
   def godown[A &lt;: OZone]: A#Node =&gt; Double<br />
      = (x =&gt; x)</p>
<p>   def hole[A &lt;: VZone with OZone]: String =&gt; Double<br />
      = (x =&gt; godown[A](liftup[A](x)))</p>
<p>   println(hole("Hello World!"))<br />
}<br />
</p>
<p>
The point remains, however, that this program is accepted as a “theorem” in the logical theory underlying the Scala 2.x type system. That theory is thereby unsound.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Lofa Polir’s Theorem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A point we have been at pains to make is that this kind of happening is far from rare. Systems are proven secure and then break all the time. Creating more ways to write correct programs has created new ways to have bugs, even as the frequency of old kinds of bugs is reduced. As with the Earth’s ozone hole, the situation is not worsening but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
Dr. Polir’s new theorem not only explains why but also argues that we should be neither surprised nor dismayed by this state of affairs. It can be given the following intuitive statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> There is a sound theory <b>A.F.</b> that can be represented as a complexity-bounded limit of inconsistent theories, but not as an effective limit of consistent theories. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The soundness is with respect to the standard model of arithmetic and includes every statement of arithmetic proved in set theory. The clever new idea in her proof is the manner of the proof itself: it formalizes and self-applies a criterion of <em>feasible correctness in the limit</em> for a sequence of incorrect proofs. </p>
<p>
The upshot is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The most productive and feasible way to do mathematics is to design inconsistent theories and fix them incrementally, rather than to demand global correctness from the get-go. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Before Dr. Polir types up her paper, she has a request for readers of this blog: What should the initials <b>A.F.</b> of her theory stand for? The name “Arithmetical Foundations” is both hackneyed and taken. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What do you think Lofa’s <b>A.F.</b> stands for? </p>

<i>If a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent.—Alan Turing</i></p>
<p>
Jack Dongarra has just won the 2021 <a href="https://amturing.acm.org">Turing Award</a>. Congrats to him. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/31/the-2021-turing-award/jd/" rel="attachment wp-att-19835"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/jd.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19835" height="168" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Dongarra is a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee. He has connections to the nearby Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to Rice University, and in England to the University of Manchester—Turing’s academic home.  The nub of ACM’s <a href="https://awards.acm.org/about/2021-turing">article</a> says the following, with <i>linear algebra</i> emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dongarra’s major contribution was in creating open-source software libraries and standards which employ linear algebra as an intermediate language that can be used by a wide variety of applications. These libraries have been written for single processors, parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. Dongarra’s libraries also introduced many important innovations including autotuning, mixed precision arithmetic, and batch computations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dongarra’s doctoral advisor was Cleve Moler decades ago in 1980.  I always think we should thank our advisors—having been one myself.  But they continued on parallel tracks in the 1980s.  Moler had invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB">MATLAB</a> in the 1970s, but with the advent of IBM PCs in the 1980s, realized their promise for bringing advanced numerical computations into wide use.  Moler and John Little and Steve Bangert co-founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathWorks">MathWorks</a> in 1984 to market their rewrite of MATLAB in C.  Dongarra went on to co-write a host of mathematical tools: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms">BLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPACK</a> (which succeeded his work with Moler and others on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EISPACK">EISPACK</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK">LINPACK</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatically_Tuned_Linear_Algebra_Software">ATLAS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPCG_benchmark">HPCG</a>, and much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Why The Turing Award? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dongarra received the Turing for his software—code that has had significant impact in many areas of computational science from data analytics, healthcare, renewable energy, weather prediction, genomics, and economics, to name a few. His work was over four decades of writing code that can solve linear systems. Such systems occur in just about all of engineering and science. They challenge us because we constantly wish to solve bigger and more difficult systems. And we are able to solve bigger systems because computers continue to get faster—able to do more operations per second. </p>
<p>
However, the challenge was and is that while computers get faster every year, <em>how</em> they get faster remains involved. They cannot just compute faster but how they get faster continues to be complex. If a computer just got faster every year, then Dongarra would <b>not</b> have been able to win a Turing award. That how they get faster is more complex, more involved, that made his Turing award possible. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> Why So Hard? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are some of the challenges that Dongarra had to fight, and continues to fight?  We can build off the following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111021183914/http://www.csbruce.com/~csbruce/quotes/craig-cut.html">quip</a> by the Canadian software developer Craig Bruce:</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s hardware that makes a machine fast. It’s software that makes a fast machine slow.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
And in 1980 we could add: what could make an IBM PC fast?</p>
<p>
The goal of Dongarra’s software was to run fast on the current hardware systems. The challenge over the decades is simple:  As hardware systems were improved in performance they did not simply get faster. They needed to change how they worked in order to get faster.  The systems changed from single processors, to parallel computers, multicore nodes, and multiple GPUs per node. These changes made the ability to exploit the potential performance harder and harder. </p>
<p>
Let’s assume, for example, that the hardware could not go 100X faster but could execute 100 operations at the same time. Then provided we can exploit this parallelism we can make the hardware seem to be 100 times faster. But if we cannot exploit this, we are in trouble. This is the key issue that Dongarra faced. This challenge is exactly what made his work so difficult and important.</p>
<p></p><h2>The Test of Time</h2><p></p>
<p>
The solutions found by Dongarra and his co-workers were definitive enough, and the core of linear algebra in LINPACK pure enough, that it could yield a salient benchmark of hardware power.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks">LINPACK benchmark suite</a> won <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/22/business/technology-measuring-how-fast-computers-really-are.html">agreement</a> by the early 1990s as giving the definitive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500">measure</a> of hardware power.  A decade ago, they began <a href="https://news.utk.edu/2013/07/10/professor-jack-dongarra-announces-supercomputer-benchmark/">updating</a> it to involve HPCG.</p>
<p>
Thus it is not enough to say that this work has stood the test of time: it <b>is</b> the test of time.  And this is carrying into the future.  A high LINPACK score in 2013 was an early <a href="https://newatlas.com/d-wave-quantum-computer-supercomputer-ranking/27476/">indicator</a> of the power achievable by D-Wave’s quantum adiabatic hardware.  An <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/value-of-quantum-computing-benchmarks">article</a> last month titled “The Race to Quantum Advantage Depends on Benchmarking” includes LINPACK as a contender.  There is recent work toward a more-tailored <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~linlin/presentations/202007_GoogleQuantum_LinLin_handout.pdf">quantum LINPACK</a> benchmark.</p>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>

Some interesting milestones about the Turing awards are:  The first recipient of the award, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, an American computer scientist who wrote the compiler for the ALGOL computer programming language. The first woman to win the prize was Frances Allen, in 2006, for her work in compiler optimization, which contributed to the development of parallel execution in multiprocessing. The youngest recipient was Donald Knuth, who was 36 when he received the award in 1974 for his work on algorithms and computer programming. The oldest recipient was Alfred Aho, who was 79 when he received the award in 2020 for his work on algorithms and the theory of programming language implementation.  I knew all the above winners pretty well. Rich DeMillo and I wrote a paper with Perlis in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">1979</a>.  </p>
<p>
Turing himself was also a pioneer in AI, of course.  He thought about how computers could reason, how they could think.  What directions will the Turing Awards take in the future—and will they reflect this side of Turing’s vision more?</p></div>

In continuation to our recent work on noncommutative
 polynomial factorization, we consider the factorization problem for
 matrices of polynomials and show the following results.
\begin{itemize}  
\item Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries
  $M_{ij}$ are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring
  $\mathbb{F}_q\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a
  noncommutative arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a
  randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and
  $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization of $M$ as a matrix product
  $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix factor $M_i$ is
  irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each $M_i$
  are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that are output
  as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
  algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
\item A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose
  entries are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
  field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals
  we obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Reproducibility is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of reproducibility have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the reproducibility crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that don’t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new notion of reproducibility for randomized algorithms. This notion ensures that with high probability, an algorithm returns exactly the same output when run with two samples from the same distribution. Despite the exceedingly strong demand of reproducibility, there are efficient reproducible algorithms for several fundamental problems in statistics and learning. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a modest increase in sample complexity, and we use this to construct reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters and medians. Using these ideas, we give the first reproducible algorithm for learning halfspaces via a reproducible weak learner and a reproducible boosting algorithm. We initiate the study of lower bounds and inherent tradeoffs for reproducible algorithms, giving nearly tight sample complexity upper and lower bounds for reproducible versus non-reproducible SQ algorithms. Finally, we discuss connections to other well-studied notions of algorithmic stability, such as differential privacy.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Meyn</a> (University of Florida) and <a href="http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gergely Neu</a> (Pompeu Fabra University)</p>



<p>One theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning is optimal control, usually rooted in the Markovian variety known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDP model consists of a state process, an action (or input) process, and a one-step reward that is a function of state and action. The goal is to obtain a policy (function from states to actions) that is optimal in some predefined sense. Chris Watkins introduced the Q-function in the 1980s as part of a methodology for reinforcement learning. Given its importance for over three decades, it is not surprising that the question of the true meaning of <em>Q</em> was a hot topic for discussion during the Simons Institute’s Fall 2020 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theory of Reinforcement Learning</a>.</p>



<p>This short note focuses on interactions at the start of the program, and research directions inspired in part by these interactions. To start with, <em>who is Q</em>? Was this code for one of Watkins’ friends at Cambridge? The question was posed early on, which led to an online investigation. The mystery was shattered through a response from Chris: we now know that the letter <em>Q</em> stands for <em>quality</em>, not Quinlyn or Quincy. To discuss further questions and potential answers requires some technicalities.</p>



<p>The discounted-cost optimality criterion is a favorite metric for performance in computer science and operations research, and is the setting of the original Q-function formulation. The definition requires a state process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span> and an action (or input) process <span class="math inline">\(\{A_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span>, evolving on respective spaces (which are assumed discrete in this note). There is a controlled transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that describes dynamics: <span class="math inline">\(X_{k+1}\)</span> is distributed according to <span class="math inline">\(P(\cdot|x,a)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_k=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>, for any action sequence that is adapted to the state sequence.</p>



<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> denoting the discount factor, the Q-function is the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation <span class="math inline">\(T^*Q = Q\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is the Bellman operator: <span class="math display">\[\left(T^*Q\right)(x,a) = r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\]</span> This must hold for each state-action pair <span class="math inline">\((x,a)\)</span>, with the maximum over all possible actions. This is a version of the dynamic programming (DP) equation that has been with us for about seven decades.</p>



<p>The magic of Q-learning, which is based on this DP equation, is that the maximum appears within an expectation. This makes possible the application of Monte Carlo methods to obtain an approximate solution based solely on observations of the actual system to be controlled, or through simulations.</p>



<p>One core idea of modern reinforcement learning (RL) is to find approximate solutions of the DP equation within a function class (e.g., neural networks, as popularized by the deep Q-learning approach of Mnih et al., 2015). While success stories are well-known, useful theory is scarce: we don’t know if a solution exists to an approximate DP equation except in very special settings, and we don’t know if a good approximation will lead to good performance for the resulting policy. We don’t even know if the recursive algorithms that define Q-learning will be stable — estimates may diverge to infinity.</p>



<p>There are many ways to read these negative results, and indeed many articles have been written around this subject. Our own reading is probably among the most radical: without understanding the issues around the existence of solutions to these DP equation approximations or their interpretation, we should search for alternative approximations of dynamic programming suitable for application in RL.</p>



<p>These concerns were raised at Sean Meyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUaFu3WzW7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot camp lecture</a>, where he called on listeners to revisit an alternate foundation of optimal control: the linear programming (LP) approach introduced by Manne (1960) and further developed by Denardo (1970) and d’Epenoux (1963). The message was greeted with enthusiasm from some attendees, including Gergely Neu, who responded, “You have blown my mind!” He had been working on his own formulation of this idea, which became logistic Q-learning (more on this below).</p>



<span id="more-636"></span>



<p>The least-squares approach that is central to most traditional RL algorithms (such as DQN) is replaced by an LP, so that we move from <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> approximation. There is ample motivation for this point of view:</p>



<ul><li>
		<p>Lyapunov theory and the theory of inverse dynamic programming provide firm motivation: a good approximation of the DP equation in an <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> sense implies strict bounds on closed-loop performance of the resulting policy. You can learn more about this theory in standard RL texts, and Meyn’s new RL monograph to appear this year.</p>
	</li><li>
		<p>The LP approach reframes the DP approximation as a numerical optimization problem rather than a root-finding problem. Existence of a solution is guaranteed under minimal assumptions, even when working with a restricted set of candidate solutions.</p>
	</li></ul>



<p>Despite these advantages, LP-based approaches were left out of the mainstream RL tool kit until recently. One reason may be a glaring gap in the framework: the classical LPs are phrased in terms of state-value functions and not Q-functions! This means it was not obvious how to bring in Monte Carlo methods for algorithm design.</p>



<p>In 2020, we independently discovered the following LP that can be used to cast Q-learning as a constrained optimization problem — the so-called DPLP: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} \mbox{minimize } \qquad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_{a} Q(X,a)\right] \\ \mbox{subject to } \qquad &amp; Q(x,a) \ge r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Without any constraints on the function class, the optimizer is the solution to the DP equation. The constraints amount to the DP inequality <span class="math inline">\(Q \ge T^* Q\)</span>, which tells us only <em>negative</em> deviations should be penalized! This is to be contrasted with the commonly used squared Bellman error criterion that penalizes deviations of both signs. In seeking an approximation within a function class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it is not at all difficult to ensure a feasible solution exists, even when there is no theory to ensure that an approximate Bellman optimality operator has a fixed point.</p>



<p>There are a variety of possible ways of turning <span> this</span> insight into practical algorithms. One path (taken by Bas-Serrano et al., 2021) is to replace the hard constraint in the LP with a smooth upper bound on the expected constraint violations, resulting in the following unconstrained minimization problem: <span class="math display">\[%  \mbox{minimize } \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}[\max_a Q(X,a)] + \frac 1\eta \log 
% \mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}[e^{\eta(r(X,A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|X,A)}[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)] – Q(X,A))}].
\mbox{minimize} \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_a Q(X,a)\right] + \frac 1\eta \log 
\mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}\left[e^{\eta((T^*Q)(X,A) – Q(X,A))}\right].\]</span> Bas-Serrano et al. (2021) dubbed the above objective function the “logistic Bellman error” and have shown that it enjoys several favorable properties that make it an ideal objective for stochastic optimization. Interactions at the Simons Institute led to the development of another related algorithmic framework called “convex Q-learning,” in which the hard constraints in the LP are replaced with a different continuous approximation (Lu et al., 2021).</p>



<p>It is straightforward to derive practical algorithms from both approaches by replacing the expectations with sample averages. This approach led to good empirical performance, along with the beginnings of theory for convergence and performance bounds.</p>



<p>The LP approach had been simmering in the background over the prior decade: de Farias and Van Roy (2003) proposed an LP approach for approximate dynamic programming, and Mehta and Meyn (2009) contains foundations for convex Q-learning, including a variant of the DPLP for deterministic systems in continuous time.</p>



<p>The new techniques bring challenges that must be overcome before these LP-based approaches can take on the world. One is that these optimization problems can be very poorly conditioned. Another is that the approximation may greatly underestimate the true Q-function when using a poor choice of function class for approximation. We remain optimistic: just like the RL community has successfully developed numerical recipes for addressing the much more severe issue of nonexistence of fixed points to the approximate Bellman operators, we believe that similar know-how can be developed for LP-based methods if theorists and practitioners join forces. Now that we understand where Q comes from, let us decide together where it will go next!</p>



<p><em>Acknowledgment</em>. The authors owe a great debt to the Simons Institute for providing inspiration and interactions throughout the fall program. In particular, our joint work (Lu et al., 2021) was in large part an outcome of discussions at the meeting. The LP approach is one theme of the new textbook (Meyn, 2022), and the impact of the program is seen throughout the book.</p>

Keith Kirkpatrick is the author of an interesting CACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/4/259392-still-waiting-for-self-driving-cars/fulltext">article</a> on self-driving cars. It is titled “Still Waiting For Self-Driving Cars” and appears in the news section of this month’s issue. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss why it has been so difficult to get self-driving cars started.</p>
<p>
Kirkpatrick’s article starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Over the past decade, technology and automotive pundits have predicted the “imminent” arrival of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without any active monitoring or input from a human driver. Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017. Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Issue </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As printed in the current CACM issue, his article says the following on page 13:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A potential intermediate solution currently being tested in Germany is to utilize remote drivers to control vehicles. Vay, a Berlin-based startup, has been testing a fleet of remote-controlled electric vehicles in that city and plans to roll out a mobility service in Europe and potentially the U.S. this year. The service will allow customers to order a remote-controlled car and have it drive them to their desired destination; on arrival, they get out if the vehicle and leave it to a human teledriver miles away to either park the vehicle or steer it to the next client. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I claim this shows the issue that we have with automatic driving systems. There is a typo in the above paragraph. A typo that shows what we are up against in the attempt to make automatic driving systems. </p>
<p>
<b>DO YOU SEE IT?</b></p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p></p><p><br />
We claim that a typo like this in a CACM article is part of the reason it is so hard to make self-driving cars. Do you agree? Or is the typo not critical? While we’re at it, does the title of this post have a typo?  Read on…</p>
<p>
Ken contributes a more difficult example of this kind, one he used while addressing the same issue of AI advances in his department’s Freshman Seminar. It relates to a later section in Kirkpatrick’s article, where he discusses the issue of</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …testing to ensure vehicle navigation systems understand the complex social interactions that often occur between oncoming and adjacent drivers, or drivers and pedestrians. Generally, if a pedestrian is about to cross or is crossing a street, the driver and pedestrian will make eye contact, and will use nonverbal cues to indicate the direction and speed of their movement. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Over to Ken:</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ken’s Example </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is the relevant portion of the White House <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia">transcript</a> of Barack Obama’s July 2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia—the one with the notorious phrase “you didn’t build that”:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/youdidntbuildthat/" rel="attachment wp-att-19798"><img width="363" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/YouDidntBuildThat.jpg?resize=363%2C229&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19798" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>
The question we could submit to Google—whose own automated-driving efforts have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html">difficulties</a> with interpreting rules—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What does the word “that” in “you didn’t build that” refer to? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
By rules of linguistic derivation, the answer seems clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The word “that” refers to the most recent noun, which is “business.” <p></p>
</li><li>
The dashes ‘- -‘ connect two parts that refer to each other. <p></p>
</li><li>
The word cannot anyway refer to “roads and bridges” because that is plural whereas “that” is singular, like “business.” <p></p>
</li><li>
(The preceding point is not a self-contradiction because in quotes, “roads and bridges” is a phrase—singular.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Now please take a minute-plus to listen to the actual delivery of this part of the speech (you may need to click back from 0:00:08 to 0:00:00 to get the start):</p>
<p></p><center><br />
<br />
</center><p></p>
<p></p><p><br />
First, the transcript is missing a word: Obama actually said “<em>that</em>—you didn’t build <em>that</em>.” Perhaps having a rhetorically emphasized <em>that</em> right after “business” makes the semantic designation even clearer? But then notice that the part “if you’ve got a business” was delivered in a quick and parenthetical manner inside the full phrase “Somebody invested in roads and bridges … you didn’t build that.” </p>
<p>
The interpretation that the “that” refers to <em>infrastructure</em> is supported by the speech’s immediate segue to the Internet, sandwiched around “somebody else made that happen.” Going out to sources, Obama was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html">channeling</a> a point already notoriously made by Elizabeth Warren in a 2011 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-agenda/elizabeth-warrens-quote-reihan-salam/">speech</a>. But without going out to sources—something we cannot expect an AI to do in the moment—there is Obama’s next sentence (also included in the speech clip):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Whether Obama intended to say that people did not build their businesses can still be argued, but that’s not the real point. My first point is that AIs based on current art for ascribing meanings not only would make that ascription, but <em>should</em> do so for overall consistency. And the second, larger, point at the end of my <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse199/InternetAndData199np.pdf">slides</a>, where I get to hard AI problems, is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We base our confidence in developing AI systems on Alan Turing’s principle that whatever the human mind can resolve, a computer can be programmed to apprehend and execute. But what if important data, on fine scales, concern matters that our human minds cannot resolve? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
CACM puts in a bubble Kirkpatrick’s quoting another expert that “it will take years and massive compute power to train self-driving systems to understand the nonverbal cues that pass between drivers and pedestrians.”  We believe the task and need of getting cars to <em>self-derive</em> meanings is greater still.  </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Do these issues say anything about the difficulty of getting code right? We think so, but what do you think?</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p><strong>The 2022 STOC Test of Time Award</strong> recognizes papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. This is the second year of this annual award. There are three awards, targeting the STOC conferences 10, 20, and 30 years prior to the year in which the award is given. While there is a preference for papers in the target years (and nominations from those years are encouraged), in each of these award categories it is also possible to nominate STOC conference papers published up to four conferences earlier than the targeted conference. Thus, the 2022 STOC Test of Time Awards will be for papers presented at the STOC conferences in 2008-2012, 1998-2002, and 1988-1992. The awards, which will be presented at STOC 2022, include a prize of US $500 per author as well as complimentary registration for all authors who attend the conference at which the award is given.</p>



<h2>Nomination Procedure</h2>



<p>Nominations should be sent to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>stoc22.tot.award@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>with a subject line of <strong>“STOC Test of Time Award” </strong>no later than <strong>April 30, 2022</strong>. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. A nomination may be accompanied by up to three additional endorsement letters, which may be sent by the endorsers directly to the same email address with the same subject line. Self-nominations are disallowed. </p>



<h2>Selection</h2>



<p>The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the SIGACT Executive Committee. For 2022 the selection committee consists of Toniann Pitassi (Columbia), Satish Rao (Berkeley), Salil Vadhan (Harvard, chair), Avi Wigderson (Institute for Advanced Study). </p>



<p>In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including but not limited to:</p>



<ol><li>Opening up a new area of research</li><li>Introducing new techniques</li><li>Solving a problem of lasting importance</li><li>Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines.</li></ol>



<p>The committee expects to select exactly one paper for each award. However, when circumstances justify it, up to three may be selected. The committee may consider papers that were not explicitly nominated and gather additional input from experts, but formal nominations are extremely helpful in the committee’s deliberations and strongly encouraged.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  In the Pandora’s Box problem, the algorithm is provided with a number of boxes with unknown (stochastic) rewards contained inside them. The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora’s Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that different random variables in the input are distributed independently. As such it does not capture many real-world settings. In this work, we provide the first algorithms for Pandora’s Box-type problems with correlations. In the independent setting, optimal algorithms are non-adaptive and based on the notion of the Gittins index. These techniques fail to extend to the correlated case. We assume that the algorithm has access to samples drawn from the joint distribution on input and provide solutions that require few samples; are computationally efficient; and guarantee approximate optimality. <br />This is joint work with Evangelia Gergatsouli, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang and appeared in FOCS’20.</p>

The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$.    Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets,  where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
    
    We prove that the above statement can be generalized to approximate spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</div>

Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main solving approaches for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). One of the differences between QCDCL and propositional CDCL is that QCDCL typically follows the prefix order of the QBF for making decisions.
We investigate an alternative model for QCDCL solving where decisions can be made in arbitrary order. The resulting system QCDCL-ANY is still sound and terminating, but does not necessarily allow to always learn asserting clauses or cubes. To address this potential drawback, we additionally introduce two subsystems that guarantee to always learn asserting clauses (QCDCL-UNI-ANY) and asserting cubes (QCDCL-EXI-ANY), respectively.
We model all four approaches by formal proof systems and show that QCDCL-UNI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on false formulas, whereas QCDCL-EXI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on true QBFs. Technically, this involves constructing specific QBF families and showing lower and upper bounds in the respective proof systems.
We complement our theoretical study with some initial experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.</div>

<p>I ran the SIGACT Book Review Column from 1997-2015 (18 years). You can find all of my columns, plus reviews I did for Fred, <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>.</p><p>When I handed it off to Fred Green I gave him this sage advice:</p><p>                   <i>Nobody should do this kind of job for more than about 5 years.</i></p><p>He ran the SIGACT Book Review Column since the end of 2015. You can find some of his columns <a href="http://mathcs.clarku.edu/~fgreen/SIGACTReviews/bookrev/bookrev.html">here</a>.</p><p>Fred is taking my advice and looking for a successor.</p><p>SO, this blog is a call to ask</p><p>                 DO YOU WANT TO BE THE SIGACT NEWS BOOK REVIEW EDITOR?</p><p>If so then email</p><p>Fred: fgreen@clarku.edu</p><p><br /></p><p>DO NOT BE SHY! I suspect he won't get many applicants, so if you want the job its probably yours.</p><p><br /></p><p>PROS</p><p>1) You get to skim lots of books and read some of  them.</p><p>2) You get some free books.</p><p>3) You get plugged into the book community (this helped me when I wrote my two books).</p><p>4) You'll have two Veteran Book Review Editors happy to review for you.</p><p>5) You get to decide the direction the column goes in.</p><p>Both Fred and I did mostly CS theory books. However:</p><p>a) I did more combinatorics, educational, history, and Computers &amp; Society books than usual.</p><p>b) Fred did more Number Theory and Physics than usual.</p><p>(Since I did the job 18 years and Fred for 6, its not clear what <i>usual</i> means.) </p><p><br /></p><p>CONS</p><p>1) You have to get out a book review column 4 times a year.</p><p>2) You have to find reviewers for books and then email them when the reviews are due.</p><p>(I think Fred is still waiting for me to review a Biography of Napier. Oh well. On the other hand, I was the one who liked having history books, which may explain why Fred never hassled me about it.) </p><p><br /></p><p>ADVICE</p><p>Prob should be done by someone who already has Tenure. While seeing and skimming thosebooks is GOOD for your research career, and good in the long-termsomeone pre-tenure really needs to get papers out in the short term.

<p>This fall, I taught my course <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/">CS 127: Cryptography</a>, based on my lecture notes: <a href="https://intensecrypto.org/">“An intensive introduction to cryptography”</a>. This is a course that starts with no background knowledge, and gets to advanced concepts including lattice-based (aka “post quantum”) encryption, fully homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, multiparty secure computation, software obfuscation, quantum computing and crypto, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/projects/">As in previous years</a>, I had an fantastic group of students, several of whom produced impressive course projects. These include the following: </p>



<p><strong>Gavin Uberti</strong>, <strong>Kevin Luo</strong>, <strong>Oliver Cheng,</strong>  and <strong>Wittmann Goh</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04581">implemented Witness Encryption</a>. Witness encryption is a cool concept whereby you can encrypt a secret X (for example the private key corresponding to a bitcoin wallet) so that people can decrypt X if and only if they can find a solution to some puzzle P. You can do this <em>even if you don’t know a solution yourself!</em> So for example you could use this to offer an automatically paying reward for a formal proof of the Reimann Hypothesis, or as they did, offer 2270  Satoshis to anyone solving this Soduko puzzle:</p>

<p><strong>Simas Sakenis</strong> wrote a <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/simas_project.pdf">survey of proofs of stake in cryptocurrencies</a>,  providing a uniform formalizaiton of proofs of work and proofs of stake, and explaining the difference. </p>



<p><strong>Michael Kiestra</strong> and <strong>Beatrice Nash</strong> proposed  <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/kiestra_nash.pdf">CLAMBAKE</a>,  a protocol that uses broadcast encryption and Yao’s garbled circuits to achieve a privacy-preserving protocol for facilitating access to controlled resources such as university buildings.</p>



<p>(There were more projects in the course, but some students preferred not to post these publicly since they are still working on them; I will update this post with more projects if appropriate.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Pessiland is the worst of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds: it is a world where NP is hard on average and pseudorandom generators do not exist. Excluding Pessiland (i.e., showing the equivalence between average-case hardness of NP and the existence of pseudorandom generators) is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science. In this talk, we propose to consider PH (Polynomial Hierarchy) variants of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds. Our main result is to unconditionally rule out PH variants of Pessiland. I will also mention recent progress on excluding PH Heuristica: average-case hardness of PH follows from exponential worst-case hardness of PH.</p>

<p>I am on the <a href="https://focs2022.eecs.berkeley.edu/cfp.html">FOCS 2022 </a>Program Committee, and I am overjoyed that the PC meeting will be virtual.  Hopefully, the days are over when the program chair can brush aside all cost-benefit considerations, impose their backyard on far-away scholars who need service items, and then splash their offspring at the welcome party.</p>



<p>I am also overjoyed that we will be implementing double-blind reviews.  This issue has been discussed and ridiculed at length.  Admittedly, it makes it harder to adhere to Leonid Levin’s 1995 influential <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/202840.606487">STOC Criteria</a></em>.  For example, if a reviewer wanted to trash a paper based on the fact that the authors are not in the position to judge their own work, now they’ll have to check online for talks or preprints to know who the authors are.  Given the volume of reviews, it’s reasonable to expect that in some cases the reviewer won’t be able to conclusively exclude that a letter-writer is among the authors.  In such a situation they can resort to writing a very long, thorough, and competent review whose most significant digit is the STOC/FOCS death sentence: <em>weak accept</em>.</p>



<p>No, I actually do have something more constructive to say about this.  I was — as they say — privileged to serve on many NSF panels.  As an aside, it’s interesting that there the track-record of the investigators <em>is </em>a key factor in the decision; in fact, according to many including myself, it should carry even more weight, rather than forcing investigators to fill pages with made-up directions most of which won’t pan out.  But that’s another story; what is relevant for this post is that each panel begins with a quick “de-biasing” briefing, which I actually enjoy and from which I learnt something.  For example, there’s a classic experiment where the ratio of females hired as musicians increases if auditions hide the performer behind a tent and make them walk in on carpet so you can’t tell what shoes they are wearing.  Similar experiments exist that hide names from the folders of applicants, etc.  What I propose is to do a similar thing when reviewing papers.  That is, start with a de-biasing briefing: tell reviewers to ask themselves whether their attitude towards a paper would be different if:</p>



<ol><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were ultra-big shots, or</li><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were hapless nobodies, or</li><li>The proofs in this paper could be simplified dramatically to the point that even I understand them, or</li><li>This result came with a super-complicated proof which I can’t even begin to follow, or</li></ol>



<p>What other questions would be good to ask?</p></div>

<p>During the early parts of the cold war of the 20th century, we saw two almost independent developments of computational complexity, in the west and in the then USSR. There was little communication between the two groups, and countless theorems proven twice, most notably the seminal NP-complete papers of Cook and Levin. To understand more, I recommend the two articles about the early days of complexity by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1981.10005">Juris Hartmanis</a> and by <a href="https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1984.10036">Boris Trakhtenbrot</a>.</p><p>Russia's invasion and relentless bombing in Ukraine have quickly separated the east and the west again. </p><p>Our first concern needs to be with Ukraine and its citizens. We hope for a quick end to this aggression and Ukraine remaining a free and democratic country. Ukrainian cities have undergone massive damage, and even in the best possible outcome it will take years if not decades to fully rebuild the country. </p><p>Terry Tao has been <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/resources-for-displaced-mathematicians/">collecting resources</a> for displaced mathematicians due to the crisis.</p><p>We've cut off ties with Russia institutions. In our world, major events to be held in Russia, including the <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/">International Congress of Mathematics</a> and the <a href="https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/csr2022/">Computer Science in Russia</a> conference are being moved online. I was invited to workshops in St Petersburg in 2020 and 2021, both cancelled due to Covid, and was looking forward to one in 2022, which if it happens, will now happen without me. </p><p>The music world has has cancelled some stars, most notably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/ukraine-putin-valery-gergiev-anna-netrebko.html">Valery Gergiev and Anna Netrebko</a>, due to their close ties to Putin. It's rare that we do the same to mathematicians for political reasons though <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/imus-non-controversial-changing-name-of.html">not unheard of</a>. I suspect most of our colleagues in Russia oppose the war in Ukraine, or would if they had accurate information of what was going on. I have several Russian friends and colleagues including <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/compressing-in-moscow.html">two I travelled to Moscow in 2019 to honor</a> and would hate to be disconnected from them.</p><p>It's way too early to know how this will all play out. Will we see a quick Russian retreat? Not likely. Will we see a situation that sees a mass migration of Ukranian and Russian mathematicians and computer scientists to Europe and North America, like in the 1990's? Possibly. We will see a repeat of the cold war, disconnected internets and science on both sides happening in isolation? I hope not but we can't rule it out.</p></div>

Neil L. is a leprechaun. He has been visiting me or Ken once every year since we started GLL. We had never seen a leprechaun before we began the blog—there must be some connection. </p>
<p>
Today we want to share the experience we each had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.<br />
<span id="more-19755"></span></p>
<p>
That’s right—Neil visited both of us separately. Four years ago, when I had major heart surgery on St. Patrick’s Eve, Neil <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">came</a> to my previous New York apartment, grabbed a page of my notes, and took it to Ken. The past two years, Ken was on Zoom with me when Neil appeared. This time, Neil had a bone to pick with Ken—after posing a problem to me.</p>

</p><p></p><h2> Neil’s Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Kathryn, my dear wife, and I are still in our new midtown Manhattan apartment after my procedure two weeks ago. She went to sleep in the bedroom, but I stayed up awaiting Neil’s arrival. I must have dozed off, but jolted awake to his laugh and the waft of his pipe’s green smoke.</p>
<p>
Neil said hi and explained right away that he had a problem. “A classic problem that leprechauns have faced forever.” I nodded to him and rubbed my eyes to be awake enough to listen. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The other day I was minding me business and I fell into a trap. Nasty fall. The trapper was an old foe of mine. She told me she had three wishes. And I was bound to grant them as usual. Sae much, sae normal. But then she breached the rules. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> No More Wishes </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Now I knew the rules of wishes, so Neil did not have to tell me: Must be about something contingent, not love or death, no self-transmogrification, and most of all—well, let’s hear it from the genie in Disney’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)">Aladdin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Three wishes, three. Uno, dos, tres, no substitutions, exchanges, or refunds, and ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p></font><p><font color="darkgreen">
Neil picked up his story: “Her first two wishes were:<br />
</font> </p>
<ol>
<li>
A pot of gold coins. <p></p>
</li><li>
Another pot of gold.
</li></ol>
<p><font color="darkgreen"></font></p><font color="darkgreen">
<p>
Those were fair and I showed I could handle them forthwith. But then she asked for: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘Please ten chirag oil lamps, each with a genie who can grant three wishes.’ </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This was terrible. It sent me to the lore. Ye cannot ask your servant for more wishes. Ye cannot involve another leprechaun. But lamps of themselves are just objects. That a <em>chirag</em> lamp has a genie is like an oyster has a pearl. Even if half the lamps be duds, that still  compounds the wishes—and she wished for ten that were not duds.”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Math and Myth </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Neil puffed a few more times, as if really expecting an answer from me. He even prompted, “What do ye think?” </p>
<p>
That sent me into befuddlement. Usually I try to engage Neil on a <em>math</em> problem, to trick him into telling the answer to Riemann or factoring or P=NP. But despite the “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{&gt; 3}" class="latex" />” aspect, this wasn’t math—it was more about <em>myth</em>. Math I can take seriously, but with weighty matters personal and worldwide, I did not want to play “meta” games. </p>
<p>
Neil read my mind: “Nay, I assure ye—it be really about math. Even the Riemann—”</p>
<p>
That made me think: if Neil knew that it had real math content, he must know the answer already. No sense groping for it groggily. I just retorted: “I don’t want to guess the answer. Please just tell me.”</p>
<p>
“Ye know there be only one way I ever tell ye answers…”</p>
<p>
“Sure. OK.” I really wanted to join Kathryn for some sleep.</p>
<p>
I blinked as Neil vanished in green light. Only his pipe smoke remained, and it curled around into a shape I couldn’t place at first. It took awhile to become sharp enough that I could tell what it was:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/17/meta-wishes/greenzeta/" rel="attachment wp-att-19758"><img width="60" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GreenZeta.png?resize=60%2C123&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19758" height="123" /></a></p>
<p></p><h2> Myth and Math </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I, Ken, shall tell the rest. Ordinarily, I would have been eager to engage Neil again about the NCAA basketball tournaments. But I too am too touched by the same weighty matters, and quite forgot the day.</p>
<p>
My unawareness did not matter because Neil apparated and instantly started confronting me: “What gave ye the mickey to <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/">write</a> of mathematics being ’emergent’? Ye dinna even define it.”</p>
<p>
I had to concede I’d not only been vague but had analogized it too to two senses of “emergent” in philosophy. I started to explain: “It’s like Albert Einstein’s famous question, ‘Did God have a choice?’ among physical laws. Now about math…”</p>
<p>
Neil cut me off: “When Einstein said ‘God,’ he meant nature—but when <em>you</em> say it, you mean leprechauns. You are asking: ‘Do we leprechauns have the power to change mathematical truths in advance of your learning them?’ That’s our turf—!”</p>
<p>
I stammered that I had a right to pose the question and had not meant to insinuate. But Neil kept on: “If we really could change outcomes then what would <em>maths</em> rest on? On <em>myths</em> just as well. But where ye speak of <em>law</em>, we have <em>lore</em>. Established rules. And they suffice.”</p>
<p>
This was waxing cryptic and I thought bringing up Kurt Gödel would only make it more so. Neil sensed I was adrift and went on: “I shall inform ye via the same story I told Dick.”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Neil’s Solution </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Neil unfurled his story. At his same pause, one perception dawned on me: “Neil, did the lady’s wish imply a recursion—meaning the genies would be asked for a wish generator in the same proportion?”</p>
<p>
Neil nodded: “The lore says yes—the lore on hearing what is said. That is what I consulted it for. The rest I could work out on paper.” </p>
<p>
The paper part was easy up to a point. The wishes implied an infinite summation: the original <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3}" class="latex" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{30}" class="latex" /> more of the ten genies, with the third wishes to each bringing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{30}" class="latex" /> at the next level, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30+%5Ccdot+10+%3D+300%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{30 \cdot 10 = 300}" class="latex" /> more wishes there, and so on. In sum, </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3+%2B+30+%2B+300+%2B+3000+%2B+%5Ccdots+%3D+3%5Ccdot+%281+%2B+10+%2B+100+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3 + 30 + 300 + 3000 + \cdots = 3\cdot (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>wishes. Clearly the number of wishes is bounded by the series </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot%281+%2B+10+%2B+3%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+100+%2B+5%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+7%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot(1 + 10 + 3^{\log_2 10} + 100 + 5^{\log_2 10} + 6^{\log_2 10} + 7^{\log_2 10} + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Which equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%5Ccdot+%5Czeta%28-%5Clog_2+10%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3\cdot \zeta(-\log_2 10)}" class="latex" />. Without asking Neil how he’d computed that, I went to an <a href="https://solvemymath.com/online_math_calculator/number_theory/riemann_function/index.php">online</a> zeta <a href="https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1180573439">calculator</a> and obtained a bounding total of </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot+0.006023525392866159581193...+%5C%3B%5C%3B%3D+%5C%3B%5C%3B%2B0.018070576178598478743579...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot 0.006023525392866159581193... \;\;= \;\;+0.018070576178598478743579... " class="latex" /></p>
<p>wishes. Neil puffed and chortled and finished his story:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “So the unlucky lass had wished herself into wishing a grand total of less than one-fiftieth of a wish. Since only whole wishes can be honoured, this sprang me from the trap and kept me both me pots o’ gold to boot. I gave her one coin as a peace offering.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I joined the laughter for just a moment. This followed mathematical rules but outlandishly, and I groped for the point. But Neil supplied it directly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some of your fellow travelers have felt reaching answers by non-constructive methods to be less outlandish only in degree not kind. If ye later apprehend the answer by calculation—which is what your post styled as “emergent” knowledge—then it must be exactly the same object previously described non-constructively. Thus in the realms ye ascribed to us wee folk, we are the guardians and gatekeepers of truth, not the forgers of it.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Neil tipped his hat and simply faded out—no green smoke for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Can Neil’s zeta-function calculations insulate against any attempt at recursively gaining infinite wishes? The zeta function whips up and down in tune with the Bernoulli numbers, but the leprechauns do have freedom to choose a bounding series. Or is there an infinite series scheme that rises above 3 wishes even so? We hope this has given some St. Patrick’s Day diversion.</p>
