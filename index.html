<div class="content">
In a seminal work, Kopparty et al. (J. ACM 2017) constructed asymptotically good $n$-bit locally decodable codes (LDC) with $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\log{n}})}$ queries. A key ingredient in their construction is a distance amplification procedure by Alon et al. (FOCS 1995) which amplifies the distance $\delta$ of a code to a constant at a  $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ multiplicative cost in query complexity. Given the pivotal role of the AEL distance amplification procedure in the state-of-the-art constructions of LDC as well as LCC and LTC, one is prompt to ask whether the $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ factor in query complexity can be reduced.

Our first contribution is a significantly improved distance amplification procedure for LDC. The cost is reduced from $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ to, roughly, the query complexity of a length $1/\delta$ asymptotically good LDC. We derive several applications, one of which allows us to convert a $q$-query LDC with extremely poor distance $\delta = n^{-(1-o(1))}$ to a constant distance LDC with $q^{\mathrm{poly}(\log\log{n})}$ queries. As another example, amplifying distance $\delta = 2^{-(\log{n})^\alpha}$, for any constant $\alpha &lt; 1$, will require $q^{O(\log\log\log{n})}$ queries using our procedure.

Motivated by the fruitfulness of distance amplification,  we investigate the natural question of rate amplification. Our second contribution is identifying a rich and natural class of LDC and devise two (incomparable) rate amplification procedures for it. These, however, deteriorate the distance, at which point a distance amplification procedure is invoked. Combined, the procedures convert any $q$-query LDC in our class, having rate $\rho$ and, say, constant distance, to an asymptotically good LDC with $q^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\rho)}$ queries.</div>

In March many Colleges sent students home and the rest of the semester was online. This was quite disruptive for the students. Schools, quite reasonably, wanted to make it less traumatic for students.<br />
<br />
So what to do about grades? There are two issues. I state the options I have heard.<br />
<br />
<br />
ISSUE ONE  If P/F How to Got About it?<br />
<br />
1) Grade as usual.<br />
<br />
2) Make all classes P/F.<br />
<br />
PRO: Much less pressure on students.<br />
<br />
CON: Might be demoralizing for the good students.<br />
<br />
3) Make all classes P/F but allow students to opt for letter grades BUT they must decide before the last day of class. Hence teachers must post cutoffs before the final is graded<br />
<br />
CON: Complicated and puts (a) teachers in an awkward position of having to post cutoffs before the final, and (b) puts students in an awkward position of having to predict how well they would do.<br />
<br />
CON: A student can blow off a final knowing they will still get a D (passing) in the course.<br />
<br />
PRO: Good students can still get their A's<br />
<br />
CAVEAT: A transcript might look very strange. Say I was looking at a graduate school applicant and I see<br />
<br />
Operating Systems: A<br />
<br />
Theory of Computation: P<br />
<br />
I would likely assume that the Theory course the student got a C. And that might be unfair.<br />
<br />
3) Make all classes P/F but allow students to opt for letter grades AFTER seeing their letter grades. <br />
<br />
PRO: Less complicated an awkard<br />
<br />
PRO: A students blah blah<br />
<br />
CAVEAT above still applies.<br />
<br />
ISSUE TWO If P/F what about a D in the major<br />
<br />
At UMCP COMP SCI (and I expect other depts)<br />
<br />
a D is a passing grade for the University<br />
<br />
but<br />
<br />
a D is not a passing grade for the Major.<br />
<br />
So if a s CS Major gets a D in Discrete Math that does not count for the major--- they have to take it over again.<br />
<br />
But if classes are P/F what do do about that.<br />
<br />
Options<br />
<br />
1) Students have to take classes in their major for a letter grade.<br />
<br />
CON: The whole point of the P/F is to relieve pressure on the students in these hard times.<br />
<br />
PRO: None.<br />
<br />
2) Students taking a course in their major who get a D will still get a P on the transcript but will be told that they have to take the class over again.<br />
<br />
3) Do nothing, but tell the students<br />
<br />
IF you got a D in a course in your major and you are taking a sequel, STUDY HARD OVER THE SUMMER!<br />
<br />
4) Do nothing, but tell the teachers<br />
<br />
Students in the Fall may have a weak background. Just teach the bare minimum of what they need for the major.<br />
<br />
(Could do both 3 and 4)<br />
<br />
SO- what is your school doing and how is it working?</div>

documents are organized in a {\em category tree} with a pre-defined number $h$
of categories. This situation occurs e.g. with taxomonic trees in biology or
subject classification systems for scientific literature. Given a string
pattern $p$ and a category (level in the category tree), we wish to efficiently
retrieve the $t$ \emph{categorical units} containing this pattern and belonging
to the category. We propose several efficient solutions for this problem. One
of them uses $n(\log\sigma(1+o(1))+\log D+O(h)) + O(\Delta)$ bits of space and
$O(|p|+t)$ query time, where $n$ is the total length of the documents, $\sigma$
the size of the alphabet used in the documents and $\Delta$ is the total number
of nodes in the category tree. Another solution uses
$n(\log\sigma(1+o(1))+O(\log D))+O(\Delta)+O(D\log n)$ bits of space and
$O(|p|+t\log D)$ query time. We finally propose other solutions which are more
space-efficient at the expense of a slight increase in query time.

proven to be NP-hard. In this paper we specifically simulate the geographical
placement of facilities to provide adequate service to customers. Determining
reasonable center locations is an important challenge for a management since it
directly effects future service costs. Generally, the objective is to place the
central nodes such that all customers have convenient access to them. We
analyze the problem and compare different placement strategies and evaluate the
number of required centers. We use several existing approaches and propose a
new heuristic for the problem. For our experiments we consider various
scenarios and employ simulation to evaluate the performance of the optimization
algorithms. Our new optimization approach shows a significant improvement. The
presented results are generally applicable to many domains, e.g., the placement
of military bases, the planning of content delivery networks, or the placement
of warehouses.

M. van Rooij</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01588">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Treewidth is a measure of how tree-like a graph is. It has many important
algorithmic applications because many NP-hard problems on general graphs become
tractable when restricted to graphs of bounded treewidth. Algorithms for
problems on graphs of bounded treewidth mostly are dynamic programming
algorithms using the structure of a tree decomposition of the graph. The
bottleneck in the worst-case run time of these algorithms often is the
computations for the so called join nodes in the associated nice tree
decomposition.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we review two different approaches that have appeared in the
literature about computations for the join nodes: one using fast zeta and
M\"obius transforms and one using fast Fourier transforms. We combine these
approaches to obtain new, faster algorithms for a broad class of vertex subset
problems known as the [\sigma,\rho]-domination problems. Our main result is
that we show how to solve [\sigma,\rho]-domination problems in $O(s^{t+2} t n^2
(t\log(s)+\log(n)))$ arithmetic operations. Here, t is the treewidth, s is the
(fixed) number of states required to represent partial solutions of the
specific [\sigma,\rho]-domination problem, and n is the number of vertices in
the graph. This reduces the polynomial factors involved compared to the
previously best time bound (van Rooij, Bodlaender, Rossmanith, ESA 2009) of $O(
s^{t+2} (st)^{2(s-2)} n^3 )$ arithmetic operations. In particular, this removes
the dependence of the degree of the polynomial on the fixed number of
states~$s$.

that arises in the construction of convolutional neural networks on surfaces.
Due to curvature, the transport of filter kernels on surfaces results in a
rotational ambiguity, which prevents a uniform alignment of these kernels on
the surface. We propose a network architecture for surfaces that consists of
vector-valued, rotation-equivariant features. The equivariance property makes
it possible to locally align features, which were computed in arbitrary
coordinate systems, when aggregating features in a convolution layer. The
resulting network is agnostic to the choices of coordinate systems for the
tangent spaces on the surface. We implement our approach for triangle meshes.
Based on circular harmonic functions, we introduce convolution filters for
meshes that are rotation-equivariant at the discrete level. We evaluate the
resulting networks on shape correspondence and shape classifications tasks and
compare their performance to other approaches.

analysis. Given a set of pointers, the task is to produce a useful
over-approximation of the memory locations that each pointer may point-to at
runtime. The most common formulation is Andersen's Pointer Analysis (APA),
defined as an inclusion-based set of $m$ pointer constraints over a set of $n$
pointers. Existing algorithms solve APA in $O(n^2\cdot m)$ time, while it has
been conjectured that the problem has no truly sub-cubic algorithm, with a
proof so far having remained elusive. It is also well-known that $APA$ can be
solved in $O(n^2)$ time under certain sparsity conditions that hold naturally
in some settings. Besides these simple bounds, the complexity of the problem
has remained poorly understood.
</p>
<p>In this work we draw a rich fine-grained complexity landscape of APA, and
present upper and lower bounds. First, we establish an $O(n^3)$ upper-bound for
general APA, improving over $O(n^2\cdot m)$ as $n=O(m)$. Second, we show that
sparse instances can be solved in $O(n^{3/2})$ time, improving the current
$O(n^2)$ bound. Third, we show that even on-demand APA ("may a specific pointer
$a$ point to a specific location $b$?") has an $\Omega(n^3)$ (combinatorial)
lower bound under standard complexity-theoretic hypotheses. This formally
establishes the long-conjectured "cubic bottleneck" of APA, and shows that our
$O(n^3)$-time algorithm is optimal. Fourth, we show that under mild
restrictions, APA is solvable in $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$ time, where
$\omega&lt;2.373$ is the matrix-multiplication coefficient. It is believed that
$\omega=2+o(1)$, in which case this bound becomes quadratic. Fifth, we show
that even under such restrictions, even the on-demand} problem has an
$\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound under standard complexity-theoretic hypotheses, and
hence our algorithm is optimal when $\omega=2+o(1)$.

local search algorithms. Local search is a basic algorithm design technique and
is widely used for various combinatorial optimization problems. To analyze
local search algorithms for set function maximization, we propose a new notion
called localizability of set functions, which measures how effective local
improvement is. Moreover, we provide approximation guarantees of standard local
search algorithms under various combinatorial constraints in terms of
localizability. The main application of our framework is sparse optimization,
for which we show that restricted strong concavity and restricted smoothness of
the objective function imply localizability, and further develop accelerated
versions of local search algorithms. We conduct experiments in sparse
regression and structure learning of graphical models to confirm the practical
efficiency of the proposed local search algorithms.

agent (player, robot, etc.): the "open" and "close" tunnel sets the gadget's
state to open and closed, respectively, while the "traverse" tunnel can be
traversed if and only if the door is in the open state. We prove that it is
PSPACE-complete to decide whether an agent can move from one location to
another through a planar assembly of such door gadgets, removing the
traditional need for crossover gadgets and thereby simplifying past
PSPACE-hardness proofs of Lemmings and Nintendo games Super Mario Bros., Legend
of Zelda, and Donkey Kong Country. Our result holds in all but one of the
possible local planar embedding of the open, close, and traverse tunnels within
a door gadget; in the one remaining case, we prove NP-hardness.
</p>
<p>We also introduce and analyze a simpler type of door gadget, called the
self-closing door. This gadget has two states and only two tunnels, similar to
the "open" and "traverse" tunnels of doors, except that traversing the traverse
tunnel also closes the door. In a variant called the symmetric self-closing
door, the "open" tunnel can be traversed if and only if the door is closed. We
prove that it is PSPACE-complete to decide whether an agent can move from one
location to another through a planar assembly of either type of self-closing
door. Then we apply this framework to prove new PSPACE-hardness results for
eight different 3D Mario games and Sokobond.

number of machine learning pipelines, especially in latent variable models. We
show how to do this efficiently in the streaming setting. Given a set of $n$
vectors, each in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we present algorithms to select a sublinear
number of these vectors as coreset, while guaranteeing that the CP
decomposition of the $p$-moment tensor of the coreset approximates the
corresponding decomposition of the $p$-moment tensor computed from the full
data. We introduce two novel algorithmic techniques: online filtering and
kernelization. Using these two, we present four algorithms that achieve
different tradeoffs of coreset size, update time and working space, beating or
matching various state of the art algorithms. In case of matrices (2-ordered
tensor) our online row sampling algorithm guarantees $(1 \pm \epsilon)$
relative error spectral approximation. We show applications of our algorithms
in learning single topic modeling.

the beacon is a point required to be remain nonstrictly outside a polygon, and
the ball is a point always moving instantaneously and maximally toward the
beacon subject to staying nonstrictly within the same polygon? Kouhestani and
Rappaport [JCDCG 2017] gave an algorithm for determining whether a
ball-capturing beacon strategy exists, while conjecturing that such a strategy
always exists. We disprove this conjecture by constructing orthogonal and
general-position polygons in which the ball and the beacon can never be united.

complex service systems. Typical challenges include the placement of warehouses
in logistics or positioning of servers for content delivery networks. We
previously have proposed Dragoon as an effective algorithm to approach the
k-center problem. This paper evaluates Dragoon with a focus on potential worst
case behavior in comparison to other techniques. We use an evolutionary
algorithm to generate instances of the k-center problem that are especially
challenging for Dragoon. Ultimately, our experiments confirm the previous good
results of Dragoon, however, we also can reliably find scenarios where it is
clearly outperformed by other approaches.

algorithm, even one that is not based on top-down heuristics. We complement our
algorithmic guarantee with a near-matching $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log s)}$ lower
bound.

whether there are functions which can only be approximated by sufficiently deep
networks, assuming their size is bounded. However, for constant depths,
existing results are limited to depths $2$ and $3$, and achieving results for
higher depths has been an important open question. In this paper, we focus on
feedforward ReLU networks, and prove fundamental barriers to proving such
results beyond depths $4$, by reduction to open problems and natural-proof
barriers in circuit complexity. To show this, we study a seemingly unrelated
problem of independent interest: Namely, whether there are polynomially-bounded
functions which require super-polynomial weights in order to approximate with
constant-depth neural networks. We provide a negative and constructive answer
to that question, by showing that if a function can be approximated by a
polynomially-sized, constant depth $k$ network with arbitrarily large weights,
it can also be approximated by a polynomially-sized, depth $3k+3$ network,
whose weights are polynomially bounded.

online scheduling. The goal is to assign a sequence of jobs to $m$ identical
parallel machines so as to minimize the maximum completion time of any job.
Already in the 1960s, Graham showed that Greedy is $(2-1/m)$-competitive. The
best deterministic online algorithm currently known achieves a competitive
ratio of 1.9201. No deterministic online strategy can obtain a competitiveness
smaller than 1.88.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we study online makespan minimization in the popular
random-order model, where the jobs of a given input arrive as a random
permutation. It is known that Greedy does not attain a competitive factor
asymptotically smaller than 2 in this setting. We present the first improved
performance guarantees. Specifically, we develop a deterministic online
algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 1.8478. The result relies on a
new analysis approach. We identify a set of properties that a random
permutation of the input jobs satisfies with high probability. Then we conduct
a worst-case analysis of our algorithm, for the respective class of
permutations. The analysis implies that the stated competitiveness holds not
only in expectation but with high probability. Moreover, it provides
mathematical evidence that job sequences leading to higher performance ratios
are extremely rare, pathological inputs. We complement the results by lower
bounds, for the random-order model. We show that no deterministic online
algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than 4/3. Moreover, no
deterministic online algorithm can attain a competitiveness smaller than 3/2
with high probability.

Recent work of [ASWB20] has initiated the study of delayed hits: a phenomenon
in caches that occurs when the latency between the cache and backing store is
much larger than the time between new requests. We present two results for the
delayed hits caching model.
</p>
<p>(1) Competitive ratio lower bound. We prove that the competitive ratio of the
algorithm in [ASWB20], and more generally of any deterministic online algorithm
for delayed hits, is at least Omega(kZ), where k is the cache size and Z is the
delay parameter.
</p>
<p>(2) Antimonotonicity of the delayed hits latency. Antimonotonicity is a
naturally desirable property of cache latency: having a cache hit instead of a
cache miss should result in lower overall latency. We prove that the latency of
the delayed hits model is not antimonotone by exhibiting a scenario where
having a cache hit instead of a miss results in an increase in overall latency.
We additionally present a modification of the delayed hits model that makes the
latency antimonotone.

(QAOA) that uses Grover-like selective phase shift mixing operators. GM-QAOA
works on any NP optimization problem for which it is possible to efficiently
prepare an equal superposition of all feasible solutions; it is designed to
perform particularly well for constraint optimization problems, where not all
possible variable assignments are feasible solutions. GM-QAOA has the following
features: (i) It is not susceptible to Hamiltonian Simulation error (such as
Trotterization errors) as its operators can be implemented exactly using
standard gate sets and (ii) Solutions with the same objective value are always
sampled with the same amplitude.
</p>
<p>We illustrate the potential of GM-QAOA on several optimization problem
classes: for permutation-based optimization problems such as the Traveling
Salesperson Problem, we present an efficient algorithm to prepare a
superposition of all possible permutations of $n$ numbers, defined on O(n^2)
qubits; for the hard constraint $k$-Vertex-Cover problem, and for an
application to Discrete Portfolio Rebalancing, we show that GM-QAOA outperforms
existing QAOA approaches.

assigning groups of items among multiple knapsacks, considering knapsack
capacities. Either all items in a group are assigned or none at all. We propose
algorithms which guarantee that rewards are not less than the optimal solution,
with a bound on exceeded knapsack capacities. To obtain capacity-feasible
solutions, we propose a binary-search heuristic combined with these algorithms.
We test the performance of the algorithms and heuristics in an extensive set of
experiments on randomly generated instances and show they are efficient and
effective, i.e., they run reasonably fast and generate good quality solutions.

provinces) are proportional to a thematic mapping variable (e.g., population or
gross domestic product). A cartogram is called contiguous if it keeps
geographically adjacent regions connected. Over the past few years, several web
tools have been developed for the creation of contiguous cartograms. However,
most of these tools do not advise how to use cartograms correctly. To mitigate
these shortcomings, we attempt to establish good practices through our recently
developed web application go-cart.io: (1) use cartograms to show numeric data
that add up to an interpretable total, (2) present a cartogram alongside a
conventional map that uses the same color scheme, (3) indicate whether the data
for a region are missing, (4) include a legend so that readers can infer the
magnitude of the mapping variable, (5) if a cartogram is presented
electronically, assist readers with interactive graphics.

using the point-to-plane cost, which aims to jointly optimize depth sensor
poses and plane parameters for 3D reconstruction. We call this least-squares
problem \textbf{Planar Bundle Adjustment} (PBA), due to the similarity between
this problem and the original Bundle Adjustment (BA) in visual reconstruction.
As planes ubiquitously exist in the man-made environment, they are generally
used as landmarks in SLAM algorithms for various depth sensors. PBA is
important to reduce drift and improve the quality of the map. However, directly
adopting the well-established BA framework in visual reconstruction will result
in a very inefficient solution for PBA. This is because a 3D point only has one
observation at a camera pose. In contrast, a depth sensor can record hundreds
of points in a plane at a time, which results in a very large nonlinear
least-squares problem even for a small-scale space. Fortunately, we find that
there exist a special structure of the PBA problem. We introduce a reduced
Jacobian matrix and a reduced residual vector, and prove that they can replace
the original Jacobian matrix and residual vector in the generally adopted
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. This significantly reduces the
computational cost. Besides, when planes are combined with other features for
3D reconstruction, the reduced Jacobian matrix and residual vector can also
replace the corresponding parts derived from planes. Our experimental results
verify that our algorithm can significantly reduce the computational time
compared to the solution using the traditional BA framework. Besides, our
algorithm is faster, more accuracy, and more robust to initialization errors
compared to the start-of-the-art solution using the plane-to-plane cost

PageRank (PPR), a popular technique that samples a small community from a
massive network. We study a setting where the entire network is expensive to
thoroughly obtain or maintain, but we can start from a seed node of interest
and "crawl" the network to find other nodes through their connections. By
crawling the graph in a designed way, the PPR vector can be approximated
without querying the entire massive graph, making it an alternative to snowball
sampling. Using the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel, we study whether
the PPR vector can select nodes that belong to the same block as the seed node.
We provide a simple and interpretable form for the PPR vector, highlighting its
biases towards high degree nodes outside of the target block. We examine a
simple adjustment based on node degrees and establish consistency results for
PPR clustering that allows for directed graphs. We illustrate the method with
the Twitter friendship graph and find that (i) the adjusted and unadjusted PPR
techniques are complementary approaches, where the adjustment makes the results
particularly localized around the seed node and (ii) the bias adjustment
greatly benefits from degree regularization.

<p>Today, I interrupt the news of the rapid disintegration of the United States of America, on every possible front at once (medical, economic, social…), to bring you something far more important: a long-planned <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/06/01/99-scott-aaronson-on-complexity-computation-and-quantum-gravity/">two-hour podcast</a>, where theoretical physicist and longtime friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/">Sean Carroll</a> interviews yours truly about complexity theory!  Here’s Sean’s description of this historic event:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There are some problems for which it’s very hard to find the answer, but very easy to check the answer if someone gives it to you. At least, we think there are such problems; whether or not they really exist is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P vs NP problem</a>, and actually proving it will win you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">a million dollars</a>. This kind of question falls under the rubric of “computational complexity theory,” which formalizes how hard it is to computationally attack a well-posed problem. Scott Aaronson is one of the world’s leading thinkers in computational complexity, especially the wrinkles that enter once we consider quantum computers as well as classical ones. We talk about how we quantify complexity, and how that relates to ideas as disparate as creativity, knowledge vs. proof, and what all this has to do with black holes and quantum gravity.</p></blockquote>



<p>So, OK, I guess I should also comment on the national disintegration thing.  As someone who was once himself the victim of a crazy police overreaction (albeit, trivial compared to what African-Americans regularly deal with), I was moved by the scenes of police chiefs in several American towns taking off their helmets and joining protesters to cheers.  Not only is that a deeply moral thing to do, but it serves a practical purpose of quickly defusing the protests.  Right now, of course, is an <em>even worse time than usual</em> for chaos in the streets, with a lethal virus still spreading that doesn’t care whether people are congregating for good or for ill.  If rational discussion of policy still matters, I support the current push to end the “qualified immunity” doctrine, end the provision of military training and equipment to police, and generally spur the nation’s police to rein in their psychopath minority.</p></div>

<p><em>[Note: While I and many others are fortunate to be able to go on with our work, deadlines, and (as mentioned in this post) seminars, this is not the case for many in the U.S. following yet another demonstration that black lives don’t matter as much as they should in this country. I would like to relay <a href="https://twitter.com/red_abebe/status/1267145593991946245">Rediet Abebe’s call</a> to support local organizations. As Rediet says “These problems have been and will be here for a very long time. We’re not solving racism this month.”. –Boaz]</em></p>



<p>For the last year, I have been co organizing a <a href="https://mltheory.org/#talks">theory of machine learning seminar</a> at Harvard. Following the format of our prior Harvard/MSR/MIT theory reading group, these have been extended blackboard talks with plenty of audience interaction.</p>



<p>Following COVID-19, the last three talks in the semester (by Moritz Hardt,  Zico Kolter, and Anima Anandkumar)  were given virtually. Frankly, I was at first unsure whether these seminars can work in the virtual format but was pleasantly surprised. Talks have been very interactive, with plenty of audience participation in the chat channel. In fact, the virtual format has some <em>advantages </em>over physical talks. Sometimes a question will be asked and answered by a co-author over chat, without the speaker needing to interrupt the talk.</p>



<p>Since the seminars were so successful, we decided to continue holding them over the summer. We have an exciting line up of confirmed speakers, and more will come soon. See <a href="https://mltheory.org/#talks">our webpage</a> for more details, which also contains a google calendar and a mailing list you can sign up for to get the Zoom link.</p>



<p>Confirmed speakers so far include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://www.sohldickstein.com/">Jascha Sohl-Dickstein</a> – June 11</li><li><a href="https://www.neyshabur.net/">Behnam Neyshabur</a> – June 18</li><li><a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a> – July 9</li><li><a href="https://www.cohennadav.com/">Nadav Cohen</a> – August 6</li><li><a href="https://maithraraghu.com/">Maithra Raghu</a> – date tbd</li><li><a href="https://research.google/people/HanieSedghi/">Hanie Sedghi</a> – date tbd</li></ul>

<p class="justify-text">Supervised learning methods come in a variety of flavors. While local averaging techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">nearest-neighbors</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision trees</a> are often used with low-dimensional inputs where they can adapt to any potentially non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs, methods based on empirical risk minimization are the most commonly used in high-dimensional settings. Their principle is simple: optimize the (potentially regularized) risk on training data over prediction functions in a pre-defined set of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When the set of a functions is a convex subset of a vector space with a finite-dimensional representation, with standard assumptions, the corresponding optimization problem is convex. This has the benefits of allowing a thorough theoretical understanding of the computational and statistical properties of learning methods, which often come with strong theoretical guarantees, in terms of running time [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980">1</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1080173">2</a>, <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">3</a>] or prediction performance on unseen data [<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/all_of_statistics.pdf">5</a>]. In particular, the linear parameterization can be done either explicitly by building a typically large finite set of features, or implicitly through the use of kernel methods and then a series of dedicated algorithms and theories can be leveraged for efficient non-linear predictions [6, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">7</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6978-falkon-an-optimal-large-scale-kernel-method.pdf">8</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, linearly-parameterized sets of functions do not include neural networks, which lead to state-of-the-art performance in most learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, in particular through the use of deep and convolutional neural networks [<a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">9</a>].</p>



<h2>Two-layer neural networks with “relu” activations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The goal of this blog post is to provide some understanding of why supervised machine learning work for the simplest form of such models: $$ h(x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i ( b_i^\top x)_+ = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \max\{ b_i^\top x,0\},$$ where the input \(x\) is a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and \(m\) is the number of hidden neurons. The weights \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>output weights</em>, while the weights \(b_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>input weights</em>. The rectified linear unit (“relu”) [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf">10</a>] activation is used, and our results will depend heavily on its positive homogeneity (that is, for \(\lambda &gt; 0\), \((\lambda u)_+ = \lambda u_+\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="407" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nn_single_blog.png" class="wp-image-3829" height="292" />Two-layer neural network in dimension \(d = 6\) with \(m=4\) hidden neurons, and a single output.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Note that this is an idealized and much simplified set-up for deep learning, as there is a single hidden-layer, no convolutions, no pooling, etc. As I will show below, this simple set-up is already complex to understand, and I believe it captures some of the core difficulties associated with non-convexity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The first question that one may come to after decades of research in learning theory is: <em>why is it so hard to analyze?</em>  </p>



<p class="justify-text">There are at least two major difficulties:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Non-linearity</strong>: the dependence on the input weights \(b_i\)’s is non-linear because of the activation function, typically leading to non-convex optimization problems.</li><li><strong>Overparameterization</strong>: The number \(m\) of hidden neurons is very large (often so large that the number of parameters \(m(d+1)\) exceeds the number of observations), which is hard in terms of optimization and potentially generalization to unseen data. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we will leverage the overparameterization and take \(m\) tending to infinity (without any dependence on the number of observations), which will allow us to derive theoretical results. We will leverage two key properties of the problem:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Separability</strong> of the model in \(w_i = (a_i,b_i)\), that is, the prediction function \(h(x)\) is the sum of terms which are independently parameterized, as \(h = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i)\), where \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\), with \(\mathcal{F}\) a space of functions. In our situation, \(p = d+1\) and: $$ \Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+. $$ In other words,  there is no parameter sharing among hidden neurons. Unfortunately, this does not generalize to more than a single hidden layer.</li><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: the relu activation is positively homogeneous so that as as function of \(w = (a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d\), \(\Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+\) is positively 2-homogeneous, that is, \(\Phi(\lambda w) = \lambda^2 \Phi(w)\) for \(\lambda &gt; 0\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this sequence of two blog posts, following a recent trend in optimization and machine learning theory [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">12</a>], optimization and statistics cannot be separated and need to be tackled together. I will focus on gradient flows on empirical or expected risks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will cover optimization and how over-parameterization leads to global convergence for 2-homogeneous models, a recent result obtained two years ago with <a href="https://lchizat.github.io/">Lénaïc Chizat</a> [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]. This requires tools from optimal transport which I will briefly describe (for more details, see, e.g., [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will focus on generalization capabilities and the several implicit biases associated with gradient descent in this context [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8559-on-lazy-training-in-differentiable-programming.pdf">15</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>



<h2>Infinitely wide limit and probability measures</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Following the standard learning set-up, our goal will be to minimize with respect to the prediction function \(h\) the functional \(R\) defined as $$ R(h) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x,y)} \big[ \ell( y, h(x) ) \big],$$ where \(\ell(y,h(x))\) is the loss incurred by outputting \(h(x)\) when \(y\) is the true label. Even within deep learning, this loss is most often convex in its second argument, such as for least-squares or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification">logistic</a> losses. Thus, I will assume that \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p>The expectation can be considered in two scenarios:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Empirical risk</strong>: this corresponds to the situation where we have observations \((x_j,y_j)\), \(j=1,\dots,n\), coming from some joint distribution on \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\). Minimizing \(R\) then may not lead to any guarantee on unseen data unless some explicit or implicit regularization is used. In next blog post, I will consider the implicit regularization effect of gradient-based algorithms.</li><li><strong>Expected risk (or generalization performance)</strong>: The expectation is taken with respect to unseen data, and thus its value (or a gradient) cannot be computed. However, any training observation \((x_j,y_j)\) can lead to an unbiased estimate, and if single pass stochastic gradient is used, our guarantees will be on the expected risk.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The main and very classical idea is to consider the minimization of $$ G(W) = G(w_1,\dots,w_m) = R \Big( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i) \Big),$$ and see it as the minimization of $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ with respect to a probability measure \(\mu\), with the equivalence for $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ where \(\delta(w_i)\) is the Dirac measure at \(w_i\). See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="615" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/diracs_measures-1-1024x156.png" class="wp-image-3852" height="93" />Left: discrete probability measure. Right: measure with density.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) is large, we can represent any measure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_measures#Weak_convergence_of_measures">weak sense</a> (that is, expectations of any continuous and bounded functions can be approximated). The benefits of considering the space of all measures instead of discrete measures have been used already in variety of contexts in machine learning, statistics and signal processing [<a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">17</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2800-convex-neural-networks.pdf">18</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">19</a>]. In this blog post, the key benefit is that the set of measures in convex and \(h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \) is linear in the measure \(\mu\), so that our optimization problem has become convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, (1) It does not buy much in practice, as the set of probability measures is infinite-dimensional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank–Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe algorithms</a> can be used, but the choice of new neurons is a difficult optimization problem, NP-hard for the threshold activation function [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070685798">20</a>], with polynomial potentially high complexity for the relu activation [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v65/goel17a/goel17a.pdf">21</a>], and (2) this is not what is used in practice, which is (stochastic) gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Finite-dimensional gradient flow</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will consider the gradient flow $$\dot{W} = \ – m \nabla G(W),$$ (where \(m\) is added as a normalization factor to allow a well-defined limit when \(m\) tends to infinity). This is still not exactly what is used in practice, but, as explained in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month post</a>, this is a good approximation of gradient descent (if using the empirical risk, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on the empirical risk only), or stochastic gradient descent (if doing a single pass on the data, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on unseen data). This is a non-convex dynamics, with stationary points and local minima, even when \(m\) is large (see, e.g., [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/safran18a/safran18a.pdf">27</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Two main questions arise: (1) what does the gradient flow dynamics converge to when the number of neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, and (2) can we get any global convergence guarantees for the limiting dynamics?</p>



<h2>Mean-field limit and Wasserstein gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) tends to infinity, since we want to use the measure representation, we need to understand the effect of performing the gradient flow jointly on \(w_1,\dots,w_m\) on the measure $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ and see if we can take a limit when \(m\) tends to infinity. This process of taking limits is common in physics and often referred to as the “mean-field” limit, and has been considered in a series of recent works [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05438">22</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/33/E7665.full.pdf">23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00915">24</a>]. To avoid too much technicality, I will assume that the map \(\Phi\) is sufficiently differentiable, which unfortunately exclude the relu activation; for dedicated results, see [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flows on metric spaces.</strong> In order to understand the dynamics in the space of probability measures, we need to take a step backward and realize that gradient flows can be defined for many functions \(f\) on any metric space \(\mathcal{X}\). Indeed, it can be seen as the limit of taking infinitesimal steps of length \(\gamma\), where each new iterate \(x_{k+1}\) (corresponding to the value at time \(k\gamma\)) is defined recursively from \(x_k\) as $$x_{k+1} \in \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}}\  f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma} d(x,x_k)^2.$$ As shown in [<a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/ambrosio.pdf">25</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">26</a>], with some form of interpolation, this defines a curve with prescribed values \(x_k\) at each \(\gamma k\), and when the step-size \(\gamma\) goes to zero, this curves “converges” to the gradient flow.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="419" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/euler-1024x520.png" class="wp-image-3960" height="212" />Gradient flow in bold black, with interpolating curve in red from 14 points \(x_0,\dots,x_{13}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For the space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) with the Euclidean distance and a continuously differentiable function \(f\), we obtain that $$x_{k+1} = x_k – \gamma f'(x_k) + o(\gamma),$$ and we get the usual gradient flow associated to \(f\), and the scheme above is nothing less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler discretization</a> that was described <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Vector space gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> Probability measures are a convex subset of measures with finite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation#Total_variation_of_probability_measures">total variation</a>, which is equal to the \(\ell_1\)-norm between densities when the two probability measures have densities with respect to the same base measure. It is a normed vector space for which we could derive our first type of gradient flow, which can be seen as a continuous version of Frank-Wolfe algorithm, where atoms are added one by one, until convergence.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above, the fact that atoms are created sequentially seems attractive computationally. However, (1) deciding which one to add is a computationally hard problem, and (2) the flow on measures cannot be approximated by a finite evolving set of “particles” (here hidden neurons each defined by a vector \(w \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Wasserstein gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> There is another natural distance here, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric">Wasserstein distance</a> (sometimes called the Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance). In order to remain short, I will only define it between empirical measures $$\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i) \mbox{ and } \nu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(v_i)$$ with the same number of points. The squared 2-Wasserstein distance is obtained by minimizing $$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \| w_j – v_{\sigma(j)} \|_2^2$$ over all permutations \(\sigma: \{1,\dots,m\} \to \{1,\dots,m\}\). See illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="573" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein-2-1024x307.png" class="wp-image-3886" height="171" />Wasserstein distance between two empirical measures: (left) original observations of two empirical measures with \(m = 11\) points, (right) assigning all black points to red points by minimizing the sum of squared distances between assigned points.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This can be extended to any pair of probability measures, and used within gradient flows, it has a very natural decoupling property: if \(\mu\) is fixed, and \(\nu\) is within a small distance of \(\mu\) in Wasserstein distance, then the optimal permutation above will always be the same, that is, locally, the Wasserstein distance is a sum of squared Euclidean distances. Then, the Wasserstein gradient flow will lead to \(m\) independent local regular Euclidean gradient flows, which interact through the gradient term as: $$ \dot{w}_i = \ –  \nabla \Phi(w_i)  \nabla R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi d\mu \Big),$$ where the Jacobian \(\nabla \Phi(w_i)\) is a linear operator from \(\mathcal{F}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^p\), and \( \nabla R: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\) the gradient operator of \(R\). Since \(\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i)\), the dynamics of each particle interacts through the gradient of \(R\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="456" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein_flows-1024x508.png" class="wp-image-3890" height="225" />Gradient flow for \(m=7\) interacting particles.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive reasoning above is behind the formal result for the function $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ that the limit of the Euclidean gradient flow on each particle when \(m\) tends to infinity, is exactly the Wasserstein gradient flow of \(F\). While I have proposed an intuitive explanation, this can be made more formal in particular through the use of partial differential equations on the density of the measure [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>] (see also nice <a href="http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~kcraig/math/curriculum_vitae_files/NIPS_120917.pdf">slides</a> from Katy Craig on Wasserstein gradient flows).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stationary points.</strong> Since \(R\) is assumed convex over the convex set of probability measures, all local minima of \(R\) are global, and we should expect the gradient flow to converge to global optimum from any initial measure. This is true for the gradient flow associated with the total variation metric. However this is not true for the Wasserstein gradient flow, for which stationary points which are not global minimizers exist (given that for discrete measures this corresponds to classical backpropagation, this is well known to anybody who has ever trained a neural network). Note that there exists a notion of convexity for Wasserstein gradient flows, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_convexity">geodesic convexity</a>, but the function \(F\) is not geodesically convex in general.</p>



<h2>Global convergence</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now describe the main result from our recent work with Lénaïc [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]: under assumptions described below, for the function \(F\) defined above, if the Wasserstein gradient flow converges to a measure, this measure has to be a global minimum of \(F\) (note that we cannot prove it is always convergent).</p>



<p class="justify-text">On top of technical regularity assumptions that I will not describe here, we need two crucial broad assumptions:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong> of the function \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \to \mathcal{F}\). We need a condition of this form, since if \(R\) is a linear function, then \(F(\mu)\) is of the form \(F(\mu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \psi(w)d\mu(w)\) with \(\psi(w) = R(\Phi(w))\), and the Wasserstein gradient flow will converge to a weighted some of Diracs at all local minimizers of \(\psi\), which is typically not a global minimizer.</li><li><strong>Initialization with positive mass in all directions</strong>. That is, \(w_i\)’s are uniformly distributed on the sphere or Gaussian, which is the de facto choice in practice. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration</strong>. We illustrate the result above by considering \(R\) as the square loss and \(y\) being generated from \(x\) through a neural network with \(m_0=5\) neurons. When running the gradient flow above, as soon as \(m \geqslant 5\), the model is sufficiently flexible to attain zero loss, which is thus the global optimum of the cost function. However, the gradient flow may not reach it, as it gets trapped in a local optimum. Our theoretical result suggests that when \(m\) is large, we should converge to the original neurons, which we see below. The surprising (and still unexplained) phenomenon is that \(m\) does not need to be much larger than \(m_0\) to see practical global convergence.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="389" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ReLU_m5-1024x683.png" class="wp-image-3942" height="259" />Position of \(m = 5\) neurons, plotted as \(|a_i| b_i \in \mathbb{R}^2\) for a two-dimensional problem. The five dotted lines are the directions of the generating neurons. Although \(m\) is large enough to lead to the global optimum, the flow gets stuck in a local optimum.</figure></div>

<h2>Discussion and open problems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described theoretical results showing the benefits of overparameterization: when the number of hidden neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, then the corresponding gradient flow converges to the global optimum of the cost function. The proof relies notably on homogeneity properties of the relu activation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The main weakness of  this result is that is only <em>qualitative</em>: we cannot quantify how big \(m\) need to be to be close to the infinite width limit, or how fast the gradient flow converges to the global optimum. These are still open problems. Additional interesting areas of research are to extend these results to convolutional and/or deep networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know that we can obtain global convergence, I will describe next month the generalization properties when interpolating the training data with an overparameterized relu network [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>

A collection of sets displays a proximity gap with respect to some property if for every set in the collection, either (i) all members are $\delta$-close to the property in relative Hamming distance or (ii) only a tiny fraction of members are $\delta$-close to the property. In particular, no set in the collection has roughly half of its members $\delta$-close to the property and the others $\delta$-far from it.

We show that the collection of affine spaces displays a proximity gap with respect to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, even over small fields, of size polynomial in the dimension of the code, and the gap applies to any $\delta$ smaller than the Johnson/Guruswami-Sudan list-decoding bound of the RS code. We also show near-optimal gap results, over fields of (at least) linear size in the RS code dimension, for $\delta$ smaller than the unique decoding radius. Finally, we discuss several applications of our proximity gap results to distributed storage, multi-party cryptographic protocols, and concretely efficient proof systems.

We prove the proximity gap results by analyzing the execution of classical algebraic decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes (due to Berlekamp-Welch and Guruswami-Sudan) on a formal element of an affine space. This involves working with Reed-Solomon codes whose base field is an (infinite) rational function field. Our proofs are obtained by developing an extension (to function fields) of a strategy of Arora and Sudan for analyzing low-degree tests.</div>

Arvind Mithal—almost always referred to as Arvind—is now the head of the faculty of computer science at a Boston trade school. The school, also known as MIT, is of course one of the top places for all things computer science. From education to service to startups to research, MIT is perhaps the best in the world.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might discuss one of Arvind’s main research themes.</p>
<p>
Although this work started in the 1980’s I believe that it underscores an important point. This insight might apply to current research topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing">quantum computers</a>.</p>
<p>
But first I cannot resist saying something personal about him. Arvind is a long time friend of mine, and someone who gets the <i>stuck in elevator measure</i> of many hours. This measure is one I made up, but I hope you get the idea.</p>
<p>
Arvind is the only name I have ever known for Arvind. I was a bit surprised to see that the Wikipedia reference for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_(computer_scientist)">him</a> states his “full” name. He told me that he found having one name—not two—was a challenge. For example, he sometimes had to explain when arriving at a check-in desk at a conference that he only had one name. His name tag often became: </p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The prehistory </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
About forty years ago one of the major open problem in CS was how to make computers go faster. It is still an issue, but in the 1980’s this problem was one of all-hands-on-deck. It was worked on by software engineers, by electrical engineers, by researchers of all kinds including complexity theorists. Conferences like FOCS and STOC—hardcore theory conferences—often contained papers on how to speed up computations. </p>
<p>
Two examples come to mind:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array">systolic</a> arrays led by Hsiang-Tsung Kung then at CMU. Also his students, especially Charles Leiserson, made important contributions. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracomputer">Ultracomputer</a> led by Jacob Schwartz at NYU. An ultracomputer has N processors, N memories and an N log N message-passing switch connecting them. Note, the use of “N” so you can <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/">tell</a> that it came from a theorist. </p>
<p>
Arvind tried to make computers faster by inventing a new type of computer architecture. Computers then were based on the classic von Neumann architecture or control flow architecture. He and his colleagues worked for many years trying to replace this architecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow#Hardware_architecture">dataflow</a>. </p>
<p>
A bottleneck in von Neumann style machines is caused by the program counter fetch cycle. Each cycle the program counter decides which instruction to get, and thus which data to get. These use the same hardware channel, which causes the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann bottleneck</a>. We have modified Wikipedia’s graphic to make the bottleneck aspect clearer:</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The promise </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Arvind is usually identified with the invention of <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191029.pdf">dataflow</a> computer architecture. The key idea of this architecture is to avoid the above bottleneck by eliminating the program counter. If there are no instructions to fetch, then it would seem that we can beat the bottleneck. Great idea.</p>
<p>
Dataflow architectures do not have a program counter, and so data is king. Roughly data objects move around in such a machine, and they eventually appear at computational units. Roughly these machines operate, at a high level, like a directed graph from complexity theory. Data moves along edges to nodes that compute values. Moreover, nodes compute as soon as all the input data is present. After the node computes the value, the new data is sent to the next node; and so on. </p>

<p>
The hope was that this would yield a way to increase the performance of computers. No program counter, no instruction fetching, could make dataflow machines faster. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The actual </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The dataflow idea is clever. The difficulty is while dataflow can work, classic von Neumann machines have been augmented in various ways. The competition rarely stays put. These updates did not eliminate the von Neumann bottleneck, but they reduce the cost of it, and let von Neumann machines continue to get faster. Caches are one example of how they avoid the bottleneck, thus making the dataflow machines less attractive. Thus, a cache for program instructions makes it likely that the program fetch step does not actually happen. This is an attack on the main advantage of dataflow machines. </p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/tve/papers-ucb/limits.pdf">paper</a> by David Culler, Klaus Schauser, and Thorsten von Eicken titled <i>Two Fundamental Limits on Dataflow Multiprocessing?</i> discusses these issues in detail. They start by saying: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The advantages of dataflow architectures were argued persuasively in a seminal 1983 paper by Arvind and Iannucci and in a 1987 revision entitled “Two Fundamental Issues in Multiprocessing”. However, reality has proved less favorable to this approach than their arguments would suggest. This motivates us to examine the line of reasoning that has driven dataflow architectures and fine-grain multithreading to understand where the argument went awry. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—Lessons </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are the lessons? Is there one? </p>
<p>
I claim there are lessons. The work of Arvind on dataflow was and is important. It did not lead to the demise of von Neumann machines. I am using one right now to write this.</p>
<p>
Dataflow did lead to insights on programming that have many applications. The dataflow idea may yet impact special computational situations: there is interest in using them for data intensive applications.</p>
<p>Ken adds that dataflow has been realized in other ways. Caches and pipes and subsequent architecture innovations profit from designs that enhance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference">locality</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a> programming model gives a general framework that fits this well. The paradigm of <a href="http://\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing">streaming</a> is even a better fit. Note that Wikipedia says both that it is “equivalent to dataflow programming” and “was explored within dataflow programming”—so perhaps the parent lost out to the wider adaptability of her children.</p>
<p>
I think there are lessons: Practical goals like making hardware go faster, are complex and many faceted. A pure theory approach such as systolic arrays or ultra computers or dataflow machines is unlikely to suffice. Also the existing technology like von Neumann machines will continue to evolve. </p>
<p>
A question is: Could quantum computers be subject to the same lesson? Will non-quantum machines continue to evolve in a way to make the quantum advantage less than we think? Or is this type of new architecture different? Could non-quantum machines incorporate tricks from quantum and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>

<p>We applaud them on receiving this award. Sadly the Paris award reminds us that Paris Kanellakis died in the terrible plane crash of American Airlines Flight 965 on December 20, 1995. Also on that flight were his wife, Maria Otoya, and their two children, Alexandra and Stephanos.</p>

<p>This semester, like many other universities, Harvard switched to a pass/fail grade model. (In typical Harvard style, we give them different names – “Emergency Satisfactory” and “Emergency Unsatisfactory” –  but that doesn’t matter much).</p>



<p>One unexpected but happy consequence of this policy is that even though I already submitted the grades for my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">crypto course</a>, I can now take the time and send students detailed feedback on their final projects. Typically,  both students and faculty tend to be focused on the “bottom line” of exams or papers – what is the final grade. The comments are viewed as of marginal importance and only serve to justify why points have been deducted.</p>



<p>Now that there is no grade, I am actually giving many more comments on the write ups, trying to focus on giving students feedback on writing and presentation that will be useful for them later on. I benefited immensely from the extensive comments on my writing that I received from my advisor Oded Goldreich. While I will never match Oded’s thoroughness and dedication, I try to at least provide some of this to my students (though unlike Oded, I use blue and not red ink, and also do not intersperse the comments with Hebrew curses for emphasis <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> )</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the task of ranking members of a population according to their qualifications based on a training set of binary outcome data. A natural approach for ranking is to reduce to prediction: first learn to predict individuals’ “probability” of success; then rank individuals in the order specified by the predictions. A concern with this approach is that such rankings may be vulnerable to manipulation. The rank of an individual depends not only on their own qualification but also on every other individuals’ qualifications, so small inaccuracies in prediction may result in a highly inaccurate and unfair induced ranking. We show how to obtain rankings that satisfy a number of desirable accuracy and fairness criteria, despite the coarseness of binary outcome data.<br />
We develop two parallel definitions of evidence-based rankings. First, we study a semantic notion of <em>domination-compatibility</em>: if the training data suggest that members of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> are on-average more qualified than the members of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />, then a ranking that favors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> (i.e., where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> dominates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />) is blatantly inconsistent with the data, and likely to be discriminatory. Our definition asks for domination-compatibility, not just for a pair of sets (e.g., majority and minority populations), but rather for every pair of sets from a rich collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> of subpopulations. The second notion—evidence-consistency—aims at precluding even more general forms of discrimination: the ranking must be justified on the basis of consistency with the expectations for every set in the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" />. Somewhat surprisingly, while evidence-consistency is a strictly stronger notion than domination-compatibility when the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> is predefined, the two notions are equivalent when the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> may depend on the ranking itself. Finally, we show a tight connection between evidence-based rankings and multi-calibrated predictors [HKRR’18]. This connection establishes a way to reduce the task of ranking to prediction that ensures strong guarantees of fairness in the resulting ranking.<br />

<p>I was seriously depressed for the last week, by noticeably more than my baseline amount for the new pandemic-ravaged world.  The depression seems to have been triggered by two pieces of news:</p>



<ol><li>The US Food and Drug Administration—yes, the same FDA whose failure to approve covid tests in February infamously set the stage for the deaths of 100,000 Americans—has now <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-testing-seattle-bill-gates.html">banned</a> the Gates Foundation’s program for at-home covid testing.  This, it seems to me, is not the sort of thing that could happen in a still-functioning society, one where people valued their own and their neighbors’ physical survival, and viewed rules and regulations as merely instruments to that end.  It’s the sort of thing that one imagines in the waning years of a doomed empire, when no one pretends anymore that they can fix or improve the Leviathan; they’re all just scurrying to flee the Leviathan as it collapses with a thud.  More broadly, I <em>still</em> don’t think that the depth of America’s humiliation and downfall has sunk in to most Americans.  For me, it starts and ends with a single observation: <strong>where fifty years ago we landed humans on the moon, today we can no longer make or distribute paper masks, even when hundreds of thousands of lives depend on it.</strong>  Look, there are many countries, like Taiwan and New Zealand, that managed to protect both their economies <em>and</em> their vulnerable citizens’ lives, by crushing the virus early.  Then there are countries that waited, until they faced an excruciating choice between the two.  But here in the US, we’ve somehow achieved the worst of both worlds—triggering a second Great Depression while <em>also</em> utterly failing to control the virus.  Can we abandon the charade of treating this as a legible “policy choice,” to be debated in earnest thinkpieces?  To me, it just feels like the death-spasm of a collapsing Leviathan.</li><li>Something that, at first glance, might seem trivial by comparison, but isn’t: the University of California system—ignoring the <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/kkb-jn-standardized-testing.pdf">advice</a> of its own Academic Senate, and at the apparent insistence of its chancellor Janet Napolitano—will now <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2020/05/24/the-story-behind-university-of-californias-landmark-decision-to-ditch-the-sat/">permanently end</a> the use of the SAT and ACT in undergraduate admissions.  This is widely expected, probably correctly, to trigger a chain reaction, whereby one US university after the next will abandon standardized tests.  As a result, admissions to the top US universities—and hence, most chances for social advancement in the US—will henceforth be based <em>entirely</em> on shifting and nebulous criteria that rich, well-connected kids and their parents spend most of their lives figuring out, rather than merely <em>mostly</em> based on such criteria.  The last side door for smart noncomformist kids is now being slammed shut.  From now on, in the US, the <em>only</em> paths to success that clearly delineate their rules will be sports, gambling, reality TV, and the like.  In case it matters to anyone reading this, I feel certain that a 15-year-old me wouldn’t stand a chance in the emerging regime—any more than nerdy Jewish kids did in the USSR of the 1970s, or the US of the 1920s.  (As I’ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">previously recounted</a> on this blog, the US’s “holistic” college admissions system, with its baffling-to-foreigners emphasis on “character,” “leadership,” “well-roundedness,” etc. rather than test scores, originated in a successful push a century ago by the presidents of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to keep Jewish enrollments down.  Today the system fulfills precisely the same function, except against Asian-Americans rather than Jews.)  Ironically but predictably, the death of the SAT—i.e., of one of the most fearsome weapons against entrenched wealth and power ever devised—is being <em>celebrated</em> by the self-described champions of the underdog.  I have one question for those champions: do you not understand what your system will <em>actually</em> do to society’s underdogs?  Or do you understand perfectly well, and approve?</li></ol>



<p>To put it bluntly—since events like these leave no room for euphemism—a hundred thousand Americans are now dead from covid, and hundreds of thousands more are poised to die, because smart people are no longer in charge.  And the death of the SAT will help ensure that smart people will never be <em>back</em> in charge.  Obama might be remembered by history as America’s last smart-person-in-charge, its last competent technocrat—but one man couldn’t stop a tidal wave of stupid.</p>



<p>I know from experience what many will readers will say to all this: “instead of wallowing in gloom, Scott, why don’t you just make falsifiable predictions about the bad outcomes you expect from these developments, and then score yourself later?”</p>



<p>So here’s the thing about that.</p>



<p>Shortly after Trump was elected, I changed this blog’s background to black, as a small way to mourn the United States that I’d grown up thinking that I lived in, the one that had at least some ideals.  Today, with four years of hindsight, my thinking then feels <em>overly optimistic</em>: why plain black?  Why not, like, images of rotting corpses in a pit?</p>



<p>And yet, were I foolish enough to register predictions in 2016, I would’ve said that within one year, Trump’s staggering incompetence would <em>surely</em> cause some catastrophe or other to grip the country—a really obvious one, with mass death and even Trump’s beloved stock market cratering.</p>



<p>And then after a year, commenters would ridicule me, because none of that had happened.  After two years, they’d ridicule me again because it <em>still</em> hadn’t happened, and after three years they’d ridicule me a third time.</p>



<p>Now it’s happened.</p>



<p>America, we now know, is like the cartoon character who runs off a cliff: it dangled in midair for three years, defying physics, before it finally looked down.</p>



<p>Look, I’m a theoretical computer scientist.  By training, I deal in asymptotics, not in constant factors.  I don’t often make predictions with deadlines; when I do, I often regret it.  It’s a good thing that I became an academic rather than an investor!  For I’ve learned that the only “oracular power” I have is to make statements like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My eyes, my brain, and the pit of my stomach are all blaring at me that the asymptotics of this situation just took a sharp turn for the worse.  Sure, for an unknown length of time, noise and constant factors could mask the effects.  But eventually, either (1) society will need to reverse what it just did, or else (2) terrible effects will spring from it, or else (3) the entire universe no longer makes sense.</p></blockquote>



<p>When I’ve felt this way in the past, option (3) rarely turned out to be the right answer.</p>



<p>So, what can anyone say that will make me less depressed?  Thanks in advance!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (May 30): </span></strong>Woohoo!!  Avoiding yet another tragedy, after years of setbacks and struggles, it looks like today the US has finally launched humans into orbit, thereby recapitulating a technological achievement from 1961 that the US had already vastly surpassed by 1969.  I hereby retract the pessimism of this post.</p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>From the Virtual Transition Team for EC 2020:</i> Due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the 2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020) will be held virtually.  This change of format offers exciting new opportunities. This guide can also be found on the </span><a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/participation/covid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC 2020 webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15 – 19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions.</span><br />
<b>June 22 – July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Live EC Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions.</span><br />
<b>July 13:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tutorial Watch Parties, Business Meeting and Poster Session</span><br />
<b>July 14 – 16:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> EC Conference (Paper Watch Parties, Paper Poster Sessions, and Plenaries).</span><br />
<b>July 17 – 22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Workshops.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee has been hard at work revisioning EC 2020 as a virtual event.  The event aims to emphasize opportunities afforded by the virtual format with activities that are intractable in the physical format, but not to recreate aspects of the physical conference experience that are difficult virtually.  Some aspects of the event will look similar to a physical conference, while some will be quite different.  The desiderata for the selected format are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize exposure for EC papers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize interaction between community members.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow broad global accessibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizational team studied the results of many virtual conferences that have already taken place (</span><a href="https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAMAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/243882-the-asplos-2020-online-conference-experience/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASPLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.eurosys2020.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EuroSys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://iccp2020.engr.wustl.edu/vsetup.html?fbclid=IwAR3ONLEftxPsTmW4b1oTyCjvAFWWOxWRWS4bV6kTox1yP8AUpgSAbkL76Qc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICCP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@iclr_conf/gone-virtual-lessons-from-iclr2020-1743ce6164a3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICLR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/4/20/wagon-lessons-learned"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WAGON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others, as well as the </span><a href="https://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/acm/VirtualConferences_GuideToBestPractices_CURRENT.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACM guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  Some general rules of thumb are (a) prerecording talks, (b) emphasizing posters, (c) expecting about four hours a day of participation, (d) prime time is 11am-3pm ET.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee adopted a strategy that allows the minimal commitment level for authors and attendees of presenting and viewing 18 minute talks and attending activities only during the main EC week of July 13-17.  However, official EC events will run June 15 to July 24 and the planning committee highly encourages members of the community to enjoy a more relaxed pace where all programming is plenary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration will be mandatory but complementary with ACM SIGecom membership ($10 Professional / $5 Student) which can easily be completed online.  Registration will open on June 1.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15-19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To give junior researchers plenty of time to prepare for the EC conference, the mentoring workshops and tutorial live pre-recording sessions will be held the week of June 15.  In addition to the usual activities, junior students will be paired with senior students who will share their EC itinerary and be available for discussions of papers and events in online chat throughout the duration of the EC events.  There will be three tutorials, each broken into four 45 minute segments and recorded over several days and with live audiences of EC participants.  Students will be able to work together on exercises in between sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 22 – July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  EC papers will keep the usual 18-minute format.  The planning committee highly encourages authors to choose to pre-record their EC talks in live pre-recording sessions.  Each session comprises three papers and is followed by a virtual coffee break for discussion between the speakers, coauthors, and attendees.  Speakers and attendees are recommended to schedule for 2 hours.  These sessions are all plenary and will be scheduled for synergies in topic and preferred timing of the speakers.  These sessions begin at regular times:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Eastern/China 9:00, 13:00, 17:00, 21:00, 1:00, 5:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Central/Israel  8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 24:00, 4:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mountain/Europe 7:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, 23:00, 3:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Pacific/London  6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00, 2:00.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect about three sessions a day over the ten weekdays between June 22 and July 3.  (Pre-recording sessions are optional but highly encouraged for authors of EC papers.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Conference</span></h2>
<p><b>July 13-16: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 13 is tutorial day.  It will include the EC business meeting and a contributed poster session for breaking results and results from other venues.  The main conference runs July 14-July 16 with programming from 9am-5pm Eastern.  This programming includes pre-recorded talk watch parties, poster discussion sessions for the papers, live plenary talks, and live highlights beyond EC.  The paper and poster discussion sessions will run in two-hour blocks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 1: 3-5 parallel tracks of watch parties (3 papers each), with realtime chat with the authors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 2: plenary 1-minute lightning talks for all papers, breakout room for discussion for each paper with poster (a poster is 1-4 slides in PDF). (The lightning talks and poster discussion rooms are optional but highly encouraged for authors of the session’s papers.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these watch parties will be in parallel sessions and some may be at times that are hard for some members of the community to attend, the planning committee highly encourages participation in the live pre-recording sessions (June 22-July 3) and all talks will be available for individual viewing in advance of the conference. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Workshops</span></h2>
