<p>The news: In 1981, Paul Erdős and András Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Hong Liu and Richard Montgomry <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15802">have just proved</a> that the answer is positive!  They also proved a variety of other old standing conjectures. This is remarkable. Congratulations!</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Before going on let me pose an even stronger conjecture</span></p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> The sum of the reciprocals of the odd<strong> induced</strong> cycle lengths in a <em>triangle-free</em> graph with no triangles and infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite.</p>
<p>The same conclusion should apply to graphs with bounded clique numbers; it is related to the general area of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cchi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\chi" class="latex" title="\chi" />-boundedness, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2014/12/19/when-a-few-colors-suffice/">this post</a> and this <a href="https://web.math.princeton.edu/~pds/papers/chibounded/paper.pdf">recent survey</a> by Alex Scott and Paul Seymour.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Returning to Liu and Montgomry’s breakthrough</span>, let me mention two other conjectures that Hong and Richard proved in the same paper:</p>
<p>A) (Conjecture by Erdős from 1984) There is a constant <em>d</em> such that any graph with average degree <em>d</em> has a cycle whose length is a power of 2.</p>
<p>B) (Conjecture by Carsten Thomassen from 1984) for every <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-11-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-84"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-85"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-86">k</span></span></span></span></em>, there is some <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-12-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-87"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-88"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-89">d</span></span></span></span></em> so that every graph with average degree at least <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-13-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-90"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-91"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-92">d</span></span></span></span></em> has a subdivision of the complete graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K_k" class="latex" title="K_k" /> in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times.</p>
<p>I am thankful to Benny Sudakov for telling me about the new result.</p>
<p>A key ingredient of the proof is the study of expanders that you can always find in graphs. Komlós and Szemerédi showed in 1996 that every graph <em>G</em> contains an expander with comparable average degree to <em>G </em>and since their work, with greater and greater sophistication, finding expanders in general graphs has become an important tool for a large number of extremal problems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>In 1981, Erdős and Hajnal asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the odd cycle lengths in a graph with infinite chromatic number is necessarily infinite. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}(G)" /> be the set of cycle lengths in a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)" /> be the set of odd numbers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathcal{C}(G)" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}(G)" />. We prove that, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> has chromatic number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum_%7B%5Cell%5Cin++%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D_%5Ctext%7Bodd%7D%28G%29%7D1%2F%5Cell%5Cgeq+%281%2F2-o_k%281%29%29%5Clog+k.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k." class="latex" title="\sum_{\ell\in  \mathcal{C}_\text{odd}(G)}1/\ell\geq (1/2-o_k(1))\log k." /> This solves Erdős and Hajnal’s odd cycle problem, and, furthermore, this bound is asymptotically optimal.<br />
In 1984, Erdős asked whether there is some d such that each graph with chromatic number at least d (or perhaps even only average degree at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" />) has a cycle whose length is a power of 2. We show that an average degree condition is sufficient for this problem, solving it with methods that apply to a wide range of sequences in addition to the powers of 2.<br />
Finally, we use our methods to show that, for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" />, there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="d" class="latex" title="d" /> so that every graph with average degree at least d has a subdivision of the complete graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="K_k" class="latex" title="K_k" /> in which each edge is subdivided the same number of times. This confirms a conjecture of Thomassen from 1984.</p></div>

from nature or engineering. These patterns can be represented by a class of
parametric-structure graphs, which are defined by templates that generate
structure by way of repeated instantiation. We propose a class of parametric
graph templates that can succinctly represent a wide variety of graphs. Using
parametric graph templates, we develop structurally-parametric algorithm
variants of maximum flow, minimum cut, and tree subgraph isomorphism. Our
algorithms are polynomial time for maximum flow and minimum cut and are
fixed-parameter tractable for tree subgraph isomorphism when parameterized by
the size of the tree subgraph. By reasoning about the structure of the
repeating subgraphs, we avoid explicit construction of the instantiation.
Furthermore, we show how parametric graph templates can be recovered from an
instantiated graph in quasi-polynomial time when certain parameters of the
graph are bounded. Parametric graph templates and the presented algorithmic
techniques thus create opportunities for reasoning about the generating
structure of a graph, rather than an instance of it.

kernel $K(x, y)$ and a dataset of $n$ points in high dimensional Euclidean
space, prepare a data structure that can quickly output, given a query $q$, a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\mu:=\frac1{|P|}\sum_{p\in P} K(p, q)$. First,
we give a single data structure based on classical near neighbor search
techniques that improves upon or essentially matches the query time and space
complexity for all radial kernels considered in the literature so far. We then
show how to improve both the query complexity and runtime by using recent
advances in data-dependent near neighbor search.
</p>
<p>We achieve our results by giving a new implementation of the natural
importance sampling scheme. Unlike previous approaches, our algorithm first
samples the dataset uniformly (considering a geometric sequence of sampling
rates), and then uses existing approximate near neighbor search techniques on
the resulting smaller dataset to retrieve the sampled points that lie at an
appropriate distance from the query. We show that the resulting sampled dataset
has strong geometric structure, making approximate near neighbor search return
the required samples much more efficiently than for worst case datasets of the
same size. As an example application, we show that this approach yields a data
structure that achieves query time $\mu^{-(1+o(1))/4}$ and space complexity
$\mu^{-(1+o(1))}$ for the Gaussian kernel. Our data dependent approach achieves
query time $\mu^{-0.173-o(1)}$ and space $\mu^{-(1+o(1))}$ for the Gaussian
kernel. The data dependent analysis relies on new techniques for tracking the
geometric structure of the input datasets in a recursive hashing process that
we hope will be of interest in other applications in near neighbor search.

sensor data. Mining patterns, e.g., outliers or clusters, from such data must
take place in real time. This is challenging because (1) streams often have
high dimensionality, and (2) the data characteristics may change over time.
Existing approaches tend to focus on only one aspect, either high
dimensionality or the specifics of the streaming setting. For static data, a
common approach to deal with high dimensionality -- known as subspace search --
extracts low-dimensional, `interesting' projections (subspaces), in which
patterns are easier to find. In this paper, we address both Challenge (1) and
(2) by generalising subspace search to data streams. Our approach, Streaming
Greedy Maximum Random Deviation (SGMRD), monitors interesting subspaces in
high-dimensional data streams. It leverages novel multivariate dependency
estimators and monitoring techniques based on bandit theory. We show that the
benefits of SGMRD are twofold: (i) It monitors subspaces efficiently, and (ii)
this improves the results of downstream data mining tasks, such as outlier
detection. Our experiments, performed against synthetic and real-world data,
demonstrate that SGMRD outperforms its competitors by a large margin.

Goemans, Harvey, Iwata, and Mirrokni (SODA'09) as an application of their
structural result. In the mentioned problem $n$ unsplittable resources have to
be assigned to $m$ players, each with a monotone submodular utility function
$f_i$. The goal is to maximize $\min_i f_i(S_i)$ where $S_1,\dotsc,S_m$ is a
partition of the resources. The result by Goemans et al. implies a polynomial
time $O(n^{1/2 +\varepsilon})$-approximation algorithm. Since then progress on
this problem was limited to the linear case, that is, all $f_i$ are linear
functions. In particular, a line of research has shown that there is a
polynomial time constant approximation algorithm for linear valuation functions
in the restricted assignment case. This is the special case where each player
is given a set of desired resources $\Gamma_i$ and the individual valuation
functions are defined as $f_i(S) = f(S \cap \Gamma_i)$ for a global linear
function $f$. This can also be interpreted as maximizing $\min_i f(S_i)$ with
additional assignment restrictions, i.e., resources can only be assigned to
certain players. In this paper we make comparable progress for the submodular
variant. Namely, if $f$ is a monotone submodular function, we can in polynomial
time compute an $O(\log\log(n))$-approximate solution.

constant approximate clustering by changing the cluster centers only a small
number of times during the entire execution of the algorithm? This question
received attention in recent years in the machine learning literature and,
before our work, the best known algorithm performs $\widetilde{O}(k^2)$ center
swaps (the $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ notation hides polylogarithmic factors in the
number of points $n$ and the aspect ratio $\Delta$ of the input instance). This
is a quadratic increase compared to the offline case -- the whole stream is
known in advance and one is interested in keeping a constant approximation at
any point in time -- for which $\widetilde{O}(k)$ swaps are known to be
sufficient and simple examples show that $\Omega(k \log(n \Delta))$ swaps are
necessary. We close this gap by developing an algorithm that, perhaps
surprisingly, matches the guarantees in the offline setting. Specifically, we
show how to maintain a constant-factor approximation for the $k$-median problem
by performing an optimal (up to polylogarithimic factors) number
$\widetilde{O}(k)$ of center swaps. To obtain our result we leverage new
structural properties of $k$-median clustering that may be of independent
interest.

particular importance in social, transportation and biological networks. While
developing optimal solutions for various matching problems is important, the
running times of the fastest available optimal matching algorithms are too
costly. However, when the vertices of the graphs are point-sets in $R^d$ and
edge weights correspond to the euclidean distances, the available optimal
matching algorithms are substantially faster. In this paper, we propose a novel
network embedding based heuristic algorithm to solve various matching problems
in dense graphs. In particular, using existing network embedding techniques, we
first find a low dimensional representation of the graph vertices in $R^d$ and
then run faster available matching algorithms on the embedded vertices. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies network embedding to
solve various matching problems. Experimental results validate the efficacy of
our proposed algorithm.

uncertainty. In this paper we ask which advice can we give the algorithm to
improve its success probability?
</p>
<p>We propose a general model that unifies a broad range of problems: from the
classic secretary problem with no advice, to the variant where the quality of a
secretary is drawn from a known distribution and the algorithm learns each
candidate's quality on arrival, to more modern versions of advice in the form
of samples, to an ML-inspired model where a classifier gives us noisy signal
about whether or not the current secretary is the best on the market.
</p>
<p>Our main technique is a factor revealing LP that captures all of the problems
above. We use this LP formulation to gain structural insight into the optimal
policy. Using tools from linear programming, we present a tight analysis of
optimal algorithms for secretaries with samples, optimal algorithms when
secretaries' qualities are drawn from a known distribution, and a new noisy
binary advice model.

<p> Alex Trebek, long time host of the TV show Jeopardy! (the exclamation point is part of the name, though I will omit it for the rest of the post), passed away in November of 2020 at the age of 80. He announced he had pancreatic cancer in March 2019.</p><p>0) <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/search?q=Jeopardy">Here</a> is a pointer to a page that has all of our posts with the word <i>Jeopardy </i>in them. Some are about the show and others mention the show in passing. All of the posts relate to the TV show. That is because Lance and I lead fairly safe lives.</p><p>1) On April Fools day of 1997 Pat Sajak hosted <i>Jeopardy</i> and Alex Trebek hosted <i>Wheel of Fortune</i>. Both are on You tube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtIT-jr1hmQ">Trebek hosts wheel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwVNmYjClXE">Pat hosts Jeopardy</a> Alex's hosting was more fun because- well, you can see for yourself. </p><p>2) Aside from that one day, Alex Trebek hosted <i>Jeopardy</i> every night since he began in 1984. </p><p>3) My favorite pangram (sentence that has all 26 letters) is</p><p>Watch <i>Jeopardy!</i>, Alex Trebek's fun TV quiz game show. </p><p>(See my post on natural pangrams <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/11/can-you-measure-which-panagrams-are.html">here</a> for... more natural pangrams and a discussion of what natural means.) </p><p>It's my favorite since I can really imagine someone saying it. The show should have used it for its tagline. And now they can't :-(</p><p>4) From Alex's comments he seems to like high scoring games that are not run-a-ways. He also likes when people bet big on the daily doubles and on<i> final Jeopardy</i>.  I think he liked having long win streaks like Ken Jenning's  and James Holzhauer, but see point 7 below.  I think he didn't like it when people go for the high scoring questions first (perhaps looking for the Daily Double) since sometimes the category name is not quite clear (e.g., <i>Country Groups</i> could be things like<i> NATO </i>or things like <i>The Charlie Daniels Band</i>) so you want to do a cheap question to get your feet wet, and also easier for the audience to see what the category means.  IMHO they should really make the Daily Double Uniformly distributed on all the squares instead of having it tend to be the bigger-money questions. </p><p>5) When the final <i>Jeopardy</i> category is  revealed he sometimes says <i>that's a  good category!</i> or <i>that sounds hard. </i> Makes me wonder that if he makes no comment he is thinking<i> that's a stupid categor</i>y  or <i>Gee that's easy.</i></p><p>6) Because of the pandemic they could not, for a while, make new shows. Hence  they aired old shows including the  first ever Alex-Trebek-<i>Jeopardy</i> (the show had been hosted by Art Fleming and the Trebek-version was really a reboot). From that show I found out WHY it's called<i> Jeopardy</i> (a question I had never thought about). It's because if you get an answer WRONG you can LOSE money- that's the Jeopardy. Not really a good name, but by now everyone knows the show by that name.</p><p>7) Art Fleming also died of pancreatic cancer, back in 1995 (he was 70). Coincidence? Well, yes, though two game show hosts of the same show dying of the same disease 25 years apart could be the premise of a really bad murder mystery. </p><p>8) Alex makes some small talk with the contestants  (though some is edited for time). Things like <i>I hear you have a book on muffins that is not a cookbook-- what's that all about?</i>' I wonder if during Ken Jenning's 74-long winning streak, towards the end,  Alex ran out of things to ask him. I can imagine <i>I hear you're pretty good at Jeopardy.</i></p><p>9) I wonder how good Alex would be playing <i>Jeopardy</i>. When he hosted <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> he said in passing that he would NEVER go on <i>Jeopardy</i> as a contestant, so he doesn't think he would do well. He could be wrong about that since over time they ask questions that are not quite repeats but draw on the same knowledge- and he's heard all of them. However, it could be that he is too busy concentrating on other things to really absorb all of this knowledge. </p><p>10) The <i>we give the answers you give the questions </i>is a bit odd. However, in my classes I  sometimes say  <i>We'll Trebek this - we know what the answer is, we have to find the question</i>.</p><p>11) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7UgxCayfV0">This</a> youtube video is of a contestant singing WORDS to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme song that he wrote.The contestant  refers to Jon Stewart as having also written words to the <i>Jeopardy</i> theme, but I can't find that anywhere- if you can, let me know. </p><p>12) Weird Al did a novelty song about <i>Jeopardy</i> using Art Fleming in the video (see  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvUZijEuNDQ">here</a>)  I always hoped he would update it and use Alex Trebek. He never did and now he can't :-( OR-with todays technology maybe he can. Here's hoping!</p><p>13) Alex Trebek was in a category by himself!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>The use of Nash’s Hex lemma in <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/11/10/hex-books-queues.html">my previous post</a>, according to which any 2-coloring of a triangular grid has a long monochromatic path, naturally raises the question: for which graphs other than the triangular grid is this true? In that post I mentioned that it is also true for certain outerplanar graphs, but false for bipartite graphs and for subcubic graphs. Here’s another class of graphs for which it is false: the graphs of bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathwidth">pathwidth</a>. These graphs can always be 2-colored in a way that breaks up all long paths, leaving the remaining monochromatic paths of bounded size.</p>

<p>Rather than dealing with pathwidth directly, I want to formulate it geometrically in terms of interval graphs. Every graph can be completed (by adding extra edges) to form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_graph">interval graph</a> of the same pathwidth; an interval graph has one-dimensional closed intervals as its vertices, connected by an edge whenever they intersect. The pathwidth of an interval graph is always one less than the maximum number of intervals that overlap at the same point (their ply). So rather than looking at graphs of bounded pathwidth I’ll be considering sets of intervals of bounded ply. For example in the illustration below which I drew a few years ago for Wikipedia, the intervals shown have ply 3, and their interval graph has pathwidth 2.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/interval-graph.svg" alt="A set of intervals and their associated interval graph" /></p>

<p>Intervals with low ply that are all either nested or disjoint can have no long paths in their intersection graph regardless of coloring. In any set of intervals forming a path, the path can pass through the outermost level of nesting at most once, subdividing it into two smaller paths with lower ply. It follows by induction the number of intervals in the path can be at most \(2^{\operatorname{ply}}-1\). (This is the standard argument behind an equivalence in graphs between longest path length and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-depth">tree-depth</a>.) So if we could partition an arbitrary set of intervals into two subsets within which all intervals are nested or disjoint, we’d be done. For instance, in the example above, the partition into \(\{A,B,F\}\) and \(\{C,D,E,G\}\) works. Not every set of intervals can be partitioned in this way, but I’ll show below that it’s always possible to lengthen some intervals, keeping the ply small, so that the lengthened intervals can be partitioned (colored) into two nested subsets.</p>

<p>As a subroutine in the construction, let’s find a set of points with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each interval lies strictly between the leftmost and rightmost selected points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No interval covers more than one selected point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The union of the intervals that cover selected points equals the union of all the intervals.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This can be done by a greedy algorithm that repeatedly selects an uncovered interval endpoint until the intervals that cover selected points also cover all other interval endpoints. Finish by selecting any two points to the left and right of all the intervals, and then number the selected points as \(x_0,x_1,\dots\) in left-to-right order. For example, one possible choice for our example would have \(x_0\) to the left of the intervals, \(x_1\) at the left endpoint of \(D\), \(x_2\) at the left endpoint of \(F\), and \(x_3\) to the right of the intervals. For this choice, \(B\) and \(E\) do not cover any selected points, but that’s not a problem. It’s not necessary to optimize how many points are selected.</p>

<p>Call an interval “odd” if it covers an odd-numbered point \(x_i\) and “even” if it covers an even-numbered point. In our example, \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\) are odd, and \(F\), and \(G\) are even, but \(B\) and \(E\) are neither odd nor even. We will color the odd intervals blue and the even intervals red. Because they are different colors, we don’t have to worry about nesting between odd and even intervals. However, the intervals that contain any single point \(x_i\) will have the same color and need to be lengthened to nesting intervals. To do so, we extend all these intervals to a single longer interval, from just after \(x_{i-1}\) to just before \(x_{i+1}\). Because of the way the points \(x_i\) were chosen, this does not create new intersections between intervals of the same color, and it makes all colored intervals nest with all uncolored ones (not just with each other). However, it can also increase the ply. If the ply was \(p\) previously, it can increase by as much as \(2p-1\), when a point that was previously covered by only one odd or even interval becomes covered by \(2p-1\) more of them.</p>

<p>Finally, we apply the same coloring and lengthening process recursively, to the remaining subsets of uncolored intervals between each pair of selected points.
To make sure the intervals stay nested after lengthening, we take care in each recursive subproblem to select its first and last points to be inside all intervals of the outer problem that contain the subproblem. Because every point in an interval of a recursive subproblem is also in at least one of the outer colored intervals, the recursive subproblem has smaller ply than the initial ply of the outer problem. The recursion stops at ply 2; for this ply the intersection graph is a tree (more precisely a caterpillar) and it is possible to 2-color the intervals without any lengthening so that no two intervals of the same color intersect, by 2-coloring the tree.</p>

<p>So if we start with intervals of ply 2, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply 2 again (no change to the ply). If we start with intervals of ply 3, we produce a lengthened, 2-colored, and monochromatically nested set of intervals of ply at most 8, because the ply-3 interval-lengthening process added at most 5 to the existing ply. More generally for any starting ply \(p\) the new ply will be at most \(p^2+p-4\). And since the interval graph for the lengthened intervals has no monochromatic path with more than \(2^{p^2+p-4}-1\) intervals in it, neither does the interval graph for the original intervals, with the same 2-coloring.</p>

<p>Today I want to talk about a new result in a newly arXived paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02703">A subexponential size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+RP%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb RP^n" class="latex" title="\mathbb RP^n" /> by Karim Adiprasito, Sergey Avvakumov, and Roman Karasev</a>. Sergey Avvakumov gave about it a <strong>great</strong> zoom seminar talk about the result in our combinatorics seminar. <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=602454e6-d104-42fe-849c-ac6000b7517b">Here is the link</a>.</p>
<p>The question is very simple: <strong>W<span style="color: #0000ff;">hat is the smallest number of vertices required to triangulate the <em>n</em>-dimensional real projective space?</span></strong></p>
<p>The short paper exhibits a triangulation with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp+%28%5Cfrac+%7B1%7D%7B2%7D+%5Csqrt+n+%5Clog+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)" class="latex" title="\exp (\frac {1}{2} \sqrt n \log n)" /> vertices.  This is the first construction that requires subexponential number of vertices in the dimension. The best lower bound by Pierre Arnoux and Alexis Marin (from 1999) are quadratic, so there is quite a way to go with the problem. I am thankful to Ryan Alweiss who was the first to tell me about the new result.</p>
<h2>Reasons to care</h2>
<p>Representing a topological space using simplicial complexes arose in the early days of algebraic topology, but there are certainly more “efficient” representations. What is the reason to to care specifically about representations via simplicial complexes? Here are my answers</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructions of triangulated manifolds with few vertices are occasionally amazing mathematical objects.</li>
<li>Simplicial complexes arise in many combinatorial and algebraic contexts,</li>
<li>The study of face numbers of simplicial complexes with various topological properties is often related to deep questions in algebra, geometry, and topology,</li>
<li>We care also about other types of representation.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kühnel and Lassmann’s complex projective plane with nine vertices and other miracles</h2>
<p>You may all be familiar with the 6-vertex triangulation of the projective space. It is obtained by identifying opposite faces of the icosahedron. It is 2-neighborly, namely every pair of vertices span an edge of the triangulation. (It also played a role in my high dimensional extension of Cayley’s counting trees formula.) The existence of 2-neighborly triangulations of other closed surfaces is essentially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heawood_conjecture">Heawood 1890 conjecture</a> solved by Ringel and Young in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1980 Wolfgang Kühnel set out to construct a 3-neighborly triangulation of the complex projective plane with 9 vertices. The construction, achieved in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316583900055?via%3Dihub">a paper by Kühnel and Lassmann</a> (who also proved uniqueness), and discussed in <a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/howison/newbanchoff/publications/pdfs/9Vertex.pdf">a paper of the same year by Kühnel and Banchof</a>, is, in my view, among the most beautiful constructions in mathematics with additional hidden structures and many connections. Some motivation to the work came from the study of tight embeddings of smooth manifolds and Morse theory.</p>
<p>Ulrich Brehm and Kühnel <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040938387900425?via%3Dihub">proved</a> that if a <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-3">d</span></span></span></span>-manifold has fewer than <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-4"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-5"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-6">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">⌈</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-9"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-10"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-11">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-12">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-13">⌉</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-14">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-15">3</span></span></span></span> vertices then it is homeomorphic to a sphere, and if it has exactly <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-3-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-16"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-17"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-18">3</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-19">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-20">d</span><span class="texatom" id="MathJax-Span-21"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-22"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-23">/</span></span></span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-24">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-25">)</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-26">+</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-27">3</span></span></span></span> vertices and is not a sphere, then <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-4-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-28"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-29"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-30">d</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-31">=</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-32">2</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-33">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-34">4</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-35">,</span><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-36">8</span></span></span></span> or <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-37"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-38"><span class="mn" id="MathJax-Span-39">16</span></span></span></span> and the manifold has a nondegenerate height function with exactly three critical points.

We can expect further such examples for projective planes over the quaternions and octonions. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01934320">Brehm and Kühnel</a> constructed three 8-dimensional 5-neighborly “manifolds” which are not combinatorially isomorphic.

<h2>Open problems and Low dimensions</h2>
<p>Of course a main question is what is the minimum number of vertices required for a triangulation of n dimensional real projective space. What about the n-dimensional complex projective space? What is the situation for low dimensions? See also the paper by Sonia Balagopalan, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6149">On a vertex-minimal triangulation of RP^4</a>.</p></div>

We construct two classes of algebraic code families which are efficiently list decodable with small output list size from a fraction $1-R-\epsilon$ of adversarial errors where $R$ is the rate of the code, for any desired positive constant $\epsilon$. The alphabet size depends only on $\epsilon$ and is nearly-optimal.

The first class of codes are obtained by folding algebraic-geometric codes using automorphisms of the underlying function field. The second class of codes are obtained by restricting evaluation points of an algebraic-geometric code to rational points from a subfield. In both cases, we develop a linear-algebraic approach to perform list decoding, which pins down the candidate messages to a subspace with a nice "periodic" structure.

To prune this subspace and obtain a good bound on the list-size, we pick subcodes of these codes by pre-coding into certain subspace-evasive sets which are guaranteed to have small intersection with the sort of periodic subspaces that arise in our list decoding. We develop two approaches for constructing such subspace-evasive sets. The first is a Monte Carlo construction of hierearchical subspace-evasive (h.s.e) sets which leads to excellent list-size but is not explicit. The second approach exploits a further ultra-periodicity of our subspaces and uses a novel construct called subspace designs, which were subsequently constructed explicitly and also found further applications in pseudorandomness.

To get a family of codes over a fixed alphabet size, we instantiate our approach with algebraic-geometric codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields. Combining this with pruning via h.s.e sets yields codes list-decodable up to a $1-R-\epsilon$ error fraction with list size bounded by $O(1/\epsilon)$, matching the existential bound for random codes up to constant factors. Further, the alphabet size can be made $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2))$ which is not much worse than the lower bound of $\exp(\Omega(1/\epsilon))$. The parameters we achieve are thus quite close to the  existential bounds in all three aspects---error-correction radius, alphabet size, and list-size---simultaneously. This construction is, however, Monte Carlo and the claimed list decoding property only holds with high probability. Once the code is (efficiently) sampled, the encoding/decoding algorithms are deterministic with a running time $O_\epsilon(N^c)$ for an absolute constant $c$, where $N$ is the code's block length.

Using subspace designs instead for the pruning, our approach yields a deterministic construction of an algebraic code family of rate $R$ with efficient list decoding from $1-R-\epsilon$ fraction of errors over an alphabet of constant size $\exp(\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2))$.  The list size bound is upper bounded by a very slowly growing function of the block length $N$; in particular, it is at most $O(\log^{(r)} N)$ (the $r$'th iterated logarithm) for any fixed integer $r$. The explicit construction avoids the shortcoming of the Monte Carlo sampling at the expense of a worse list size.</div>

<p>
Jemma Lorenat is an assistant professor at <a href="https://www.pitzer.edu">Pitzer College</a> in Los Angeles. She teaches and does research on the history of mathematics.<br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/11/12/the-art-of-math/jemma/" rel="attachment wp-att-17751"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/jemma.png?w=600" alt="" class="alignright size-full wp-image-17751" /></a></p>
<p>
Today I thought we’d look at some of her work. </p>
<p>
History of math is one topic that we have focused on many times before. More on that in a moment. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Her Art </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
But before we do that I wish to present Lorenat’s art work. My late father, Jack Lipton, was an artist and so perhaps I have a genetic interest in art. Lorenat is an artist besides being a mathematician. You can see some of her drawings of famous mathematicians <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/portrait-gallery">here</a>. Her elegant style I find appealing. See if you like it as much as I do. My dad taught me: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A clean drawing is more difficult to execute than a busy one. It is hard to hide flaws when your art is clean. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Her drawings are clean indeed. </p>
<p>
Here are three of Lorenat’s drawings of the following three famous mathematicians in some order: Which is which? Prizes will not be given to those with correct answers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Eric Temple Bell <p></p>
</li><li>
Jacques Hadamard <p></p>
</li><li>
Henri Lebesgue
</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Her Research </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lorenat’s research is on the history of mathematics. My first choice is to create math, but I am intrigued by the history of who did what, when, and why. We must understand history—at least in broad strokes—if we are to continue to make progress. History helps us understand how progress was made and how it was not. History teaches us much about our field, about mathematics. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/topics/history.html">Several</a> online <a href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/masters/hist_frame.htm">sources</a> show the field’s breadth and scope. Among issues and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematics_history_topics">topics</a>, we note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Who is a result named for? <p></p>
</li><li>
Who gets the credit for a result? <p></p>
</li><li>
What is the strongest result known? <p></p>
</li><li>
Is this result correct?
</li></ul>
<p>
It is fun to see the process in action. One example I have been involved in for a long time is the study of vector addition systems and reachability problems. There continues to be exciting news, for instance, a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.07115.pdf">paper</a> last year showing that a central reachability problem is vastly harder than had been conjectured. I will discuss, however, an issue from two centuries ago that Lorenat has illuminated.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Duality Controversy </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lorenat has a <a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/78167-culturalcontextconference2015.pdf">talk</a> on the geometric theory of duality. It was a prime example of a controversy in the discover of a basic math idea. Here duality means: Given a statement from projective geometry we can flip points and lines and still leave its correctness invariant. This is the duality: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++points+%5Ciff+lines.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  points \iff lines. " /></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<table style="margin: auto;">

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
In complexity theory we have our own duality. Instead of flipping points and lines we can exchange boolean operations 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++AND+%5Ciff+OR%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  AND \iff OR, " /></p>
<p>and also exchange 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0+%5Ciff+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  0 \iff 1. " /></p>
<p>	 Thus 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x+%5Cwedge+y%29+%5Cvee+%28x+%5Cwedge+z%29+%5Ciff+%28x+%5Cvee+y%29+%5Cwedge+%28x+%5Cvee+z%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x \wedge y) \vee (x \wedge z) \iff (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z). " /></p>
<p>		 Lorenat’s talk highlights a controversy between: Joseph Diaz Gergonne, Jean-Victor Poncelet, and Julius Plucker. Her work is <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/science-in-context/article/polemics-in-public-poncelet-gergonne-plucker-and-the-duality-controversy/C305E6B9326F2AC4C8AC31D4194FEDC6">here</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A plagiarism charge in 1827 sparked a public controversy centered between Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867) and Joseph-Diez Gergonne (1771-1859) over the origin and applications of the principle of duality in geometry. Over the next three years and through the pages of various journals, monographs, letters, reviews, reports, and footnotes, vitriol between the antagonists increased as their potential publicity grew. While the historical literature offers valuable resources toward understanding the development, content, and applications of geometric duality, the hostile nature of the exchange seems to have deterred an in-depth textual study of the explicitly polemical writings. We argue that the necessary collective endeavor of beginning and ending this controversy constitutes a case study in the circulation of geometry. In particular, we consider how the duality controversy functioned as a medium of communicating new fundamental principles to a wider audience of practitioners. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A further comment is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Of this feud, Pierre Samuel has quipped that since both men were in the French army and Poncelet was a general while Gergonne a mere captain, Poncelet’s view prevailed, at least among their French contemporaries. </em>
</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (Nov. 14):</span></strong> I now have a deluge of serious hosting offers—thank you so much, everyone!  No need for more.</p>



<p></p><hr /><p></p>



<p>Since I’m now feeling better that the first authoritarian coup attempt in US history will probably sort itself out OK, here’s a <em>real</em> problem:</p>



<p>Nearly a score years ago, I created the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a>, a procrastination project turned encyclopedia of complexity classes.  Nearly half a score years ago, the Zoo moved to my former employer, the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/">Institute for Quantum Computing</a> in Waterloo, Canada, which graciously hosted it ever since.  Alas, IQC has decided that it can no longer do so.  The reason is new regulations in Ontario about the accessibility of websites, which the Zoo might be out of compliance with.  My students and I were willing to look into what was needed—like, does the <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:P#ph">polynomial hierarchy</a> need ramps between its levels or something?  The best would be if we heard from actual blind or other disabled complexity enthusiasts about how we could improve their experience, rather than trying to parse bureaucratese from the Ontario government.  But IQC informed us that in any case, they can’t deal with the potential liability and their decision is final.  I thank them for hosting the Zoo for eight years.</p>



<p>Now I’m looking for a volunteer for a new host.  The Zoo runs on the <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> platform, which doesn’t work with my own hosting provider (Bluehost) but is apparently easy to set up if you, unlike me, are the kind of person who can do such things.  The IQC folks kindly offered to help with the transfer; I and my students can help as well.  It’s a small site with modest traffic.  The main things I need are just assurances that you can host the site for a long time (“forever” or thereabouts), and that you or someone else in your organization will be reachable if the site goes down or if there are other problems.  I own the complexityzoo.com domain and can redirect from there.</p>



<p>In return, you’ll get the immense prestige of hosting such a storied resource for theoretical computer science … plus free publicity for your cause or organization on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, and the eternal gratitude of thousands of my readers.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re <em>into</em> complexity theory, and you want to update or improve the Zoo while you’re at it, then so much the awesomer!  It could use some updates, badly.  But you don’t even <em>need</em> to know P from NP.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, leave a comment or shoot me an email.  Thanks!!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Announcement:</span></strong> I’ll once again be doing an Ask-Me-Anything session at the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B (“Quantum to Business”)</a> conference, December 8-10.  Other speakers include Umesh Vazirani, John Preskill, Jennifer Ouellette, Eric Schmidt, and many others.  Since the conference will of course be virtual this year, registration is a lot cheaper than in previous years.  Check it out!  (Full disclosure: Q2B is organized by <a href="https://qcware.com/">QC Ware, Inc.</a>, for which I’m a scientific advisor.)</p></div>

<p><br />(Guest post by Shir Cohen and Mouna Safir)</p>



<p><br />The 34th International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2020) was held on October 12-16, 2020, as a virtual conference. As such, the opportunity for community members to get to know each other in an informal environment was lacking. To address this need, we arranged two types of virtual networking events. We hope that these events planted the seeds for many future collaborations and that there will be an opportunity for those involved to meet in person next time.</p>



<p><strong>MoPS (Meet other Postdoc and Students) Sessions<br /></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020mops/home</a></p>



<p>To allow junior members of the community to get to know one another, we arranged MoPS sessions, which we have not seen done before. There were more than 50 participants who took part in the sessions, with representation from a host of countries throughout the world. Sessions were held in 10-time slots before, during, and after DISC. In each session, there would typically be 5 members representing a mixture of Bachelor’s students, Masters students, PhDs, postdocs, and others. Care was taken to include at least one postdoc or Ph.D. in each session so that Bachelors and Masters students might benefit from their experience. Groups were formed with the goal of allowing participants from different countries and institutions to share their experiences and research journeys with one another. Based on the feedback for this event, it would appear that that goal was met and the participants came away with more of a sense of community.</p>



<p><strong>Junior-Senior Meetings<br /></strong>Webpage: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020junior-seniormeeting/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://sites.google.com/view/disc2020junior-seniormeeting/home</a></p>



<p>The Junior-Senior meetings were organized to provide an opportunity for junior researchers to meet with senior researchers. Fourteen sessions were conducted, where each one brought together one senior and 3-5 juniors. In these sessions,  the juniors got a chance to interact with seniors in the field and profit from their experience. Discussions covered a variety of topics such as how to approach research, how to deal with the job market, or perhaps more personal concerns like work-life balance.

Computational pseudorandomness studies the extent to which a random variable $\bf{Z}$ looks like the uniform distribution according to a class of tests $\cal{F}$. Computational entropy generalizes computational pseudorandomness by studying the extent which a random variable looks like a \emph{high entropy} distribution. There are different formal definitions of computational entropy with different advantages for different applications. Because of this, it is of interest to understand when these definitions are equivalent.
  We consider three notions of computational entropy which are known to be equivalent when the test class $\cal{F}$ is closed under taking majorities. This equivalence constitutes (essentially) the so-called \emph{dense model theorem} of Green and Tao (and later made explicit by Tao-Zeigler, Reingold et al., and Gowers). The dense model theorem plays a key role in Green and Tao's proof that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions and has since been connected to a surprisingly wide range of topics in mathematics and computer science, including cryptography, computational complexity, combinatorics and machine learning. We show that, in different situations where $\cal{F}$ is \emph{not} closed under majority, this equivalence fails. This in turn provides examples where the dense model theorem is \emph{false}.</div>

<p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, Nov 20th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (13:00 Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC, 23:30 Indian Time).  <strong>Himanshu Tyagi </strong>from IISc will speak about “<strong>General lower bounds for estimation under information constraints</strong>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  We present very general lower bounds for parametric estimation when only limited information per sample is allowed. These limitations can arise, for example, in form of communication constraints, privacy constraints, or linear measurements. Our lower bounds hold for discrete distributions with large alphabet as well as continuous distributions with high-dimensional parameters, apply for any information constraint, and are valid for any $\ell_p$ loss function. Our bounds recover both strong data processing inequality based bounds and Cramér-Rao based bound as special cases.</p>

Higher order random walks (HD-walks) on high dimensional expanders have played a crucial role in a number of recent breakthroughs in theoretical computer science, perhaps most famously in the recent resolution of the Mihail-Vazirani conjecture (Anari et al. STOC 2019), which focuses on HD-walks on one-sided local-spectral expanders. In this work we study the spectral structure of walks on the stronger two-sided variant, which capture wide generalizations of important objects like the Johnson and Grassmann graphs. We prove that the spectra of these walks are tightly concentrated in a small number of strips, each of which corresponds combinatorially to a level in the underlying complex. Moreover, the eigenvalues corresponding to these strips decay exponentially with a measure we term the depth of the walk.
    
    Using this spectral machinery, we characterize the edge-expansion of small sets based upon the interplay of their local combinatorial structure and the global decay of the walk's eigenvalues across strips. Variants of this result for the special cases of the Johnson and Grassmann graphs were recently crucial both for the resolution of the 2-2 Games Conjecture (Khot et al. FOCS 2018), and for efficient algorithms for affine unique games over the Johnson graphs (Bafna et al. Arxiv 2020). For the complete complex, our characterization admits a low-degree Sum of Squares proof. Building on the work of Bafna et al., we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for affine unique games over the Johnson scheme. The soundness and runtime of our algorithm depend upon the number of strips with large eigenvalues, a measure we call High-Dimensional Threshold Rank that calls back to the seminal work of Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer (FOCS 2011) on unique games and threshold rank.</div>

We present an explicit and efficient algebraic construction of capacity-achieving list decodable codes with both constant alphabet and constant list sizes. More specifically, for any $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, we give an algebraic construction of an infinite family of error-correcting codes of rate $R$, over an alphabet of size $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon^2)}$, that can be list decoded from a $(1-R-\epsilon)$-fraction of errors with list size at most $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$. Moreover, the codes can be encoded in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, the output list is contained in a linear subspace of dimension at most $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$, and a basis for this subspace can be found in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$. Thus, both encoding and list decoding can be performed in \emph{fully polynomial-time} $\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon, n)$, except for pruning the subspace and outputting the final list which takes time $\exp(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(n)$. In contrast, prior explicit and efficient constructions of capacity-achieving list decodable codes either required a much higher complexity in terms of $1/\epsilon$ (and were additionally much less structured), or had super-constant alphabet or list sizes.

Our codes are quite natural and structured. Specifically, we use algebraic-geometric (AG) codes with evaluation points restricted to a subfield, and with the message space restricted to a (carefully chosen) linear subspace. Our main observation is that the output list of AG codes with subfield evaluation points is contained in an affine shift of the image of a \emph{block-triangular-Toeplitz (BTT) matrix}, and that the list size can potentially be reduced to a constant by restricting the message space to a \emph{BTT evasive subspace}, which is a large subspace that intersects the image of any BTT matrix in a constant number of points. We further show how to explicitly construct such BTT evasive subspaces, based on the explicit subspace designs of Guruswami and Kopparty (\emph{Combinatorica}, 2016), and composition.</div>

This paper shows that there exist Reed--Solomon (RS) codes, over large finite fields, that are combinatorially list-decodable well beyond the Johnson radius, in fact almost achieving list-decoding capacity. In particular, we show that for any $\epsilon\in (0,1]$ there exist RS codes with rate $\Omega(\frac{\epsilon}{\log(1/\epsilon)+1})$ that are list-decodable from radius of $1-\epsilon$. We generalize this result to obtain a similar result on list-recoverability of RS codes. Along the way we use our techniques to give a new proof of a result of Blackburn on optimal linear perfect hash matrices, and strengthen it to obtain a construction of strongly perfect hash matrices. 

To derive the results in this paper we show a surprising connection of the above problems to graph theory, and in particular to the tree packing theorem of Nash-Williams and Tutte. En route to our results on RS codes, we prove a generalization of the tree packing theorem to hypergraphs (and we conjecture that an even stronger generalization holds). We hope that this generalization to hypergraphs will be of independent interest.</div>

<p>As announced <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/announcing-a-short-course-in-paris/">earlier</a> I am currently teaching a course on “interactive proofs with quantum devices” in Paris. The course is proceeding apace, even though the recent lockdown order in France means that we had to abandon our beautiful auditorium at the Institut Henri Poincaré and retreat behind the fanciful Zoom backgrounds whose pretension is a sad reminder of what our summers used to be (Banff, anyone?). A possible upshot is that more may be able to attend the now-online course; if you are interested see the <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/">course page</a> for info. (Things are actually fairly good here–in spite of the apparently strict restrictions on daily outings (max 1h, 1km) you can count on the French to bend things their way; most shops are closed but the streets remain quite busy.)</p>



<p>We just finished a sequence of four lectures on the Mahadev “classical verification of quantum computation” protocol. In the process of preparing the lectures I arrived at a presentation of the protocol that is fairly self-contained, so I decided to compile the associated lecture notes as a stand-alone group of 4 lectures that is available <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp_verification.pdf">here</a>. The notes are aimed at beginning graduate students with a first course in quantum computing and in complexity desiring to gain a concrete understanding of the inner workings of the result; the notes are a bit lengthy but this in part because they take the time to introduce related concepts and slowly build up to the main result. Overall, my hope is that these should be relatively easily readable and provide a good technical introduction to the Mahadev result on classical verification, including an almost complete analysis of her protocol (there are a few explicitly declared shortcuts that help simplify the presentation without hiding any important aspects). For additional background you can also consult the full <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/teaching/fsmp/fsmp.pdf">10-week notes</a>. Comments on the notes are welcome; I’m afraid they most likely contain numerous typos so if you find any please feel free to correct them directly on the associated <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/9892211158zrwmqnxtvcxm">overleaf document</a>.</p>



<p>The last three lectures of the course will be devoted to the problem of testing under spatial assumptions, building up to an introduction to the proof of MIP* = RE. If all goes well I’ll aim to prepare some stand-alone notes for that part as well.</p></div>

<p>Today’s online world and the emerging internet of things is built around a Faustian bargain:  consumers (and their internet of things) hand over their data, and in return get customization of the world to their needs.  Is this exchange of privacy for convenience inherent? At first sight one sees no way around because, of course, to allow machine learning on our data we have to hand our data over to the training algorithm.</p>

<p>Similar issues arise in settings other than consumer devices. For instance, hospitals may wish to pool together their patient data to train a large deep model. But privacy laws such as HIPAA forbid them from sharing the data itself, so somehow they have to train a deep net on their data without revealing their data. Frameworks such as Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) have been proposed for this but it is known that sharing gradients in that environment leaks a lot of information about the data (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08935">Zhu et al., 2019</a>).</p>

<p>Methods to achieve some of the above  so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicit in today’s organization of the online world.</p>

<p>This blog post discusses the current set of solutions,  how they don’t quite suffice for above questions, and the story of a new solution, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02772">InstaHide</a>, that we proposed, and takeaways from a recent attack on it by Carlini et al.</p>

<h2 id="existing-solutions-in-cryptography">Existing solutions in Cryptography</h2>

<p>Classic solutions in cryptography do allow you to in principle outsource any computation to the cloud without revealing your data. (A modern method is Fully Homomorphic Encryption.) Adapting these ideas to machine learning  presents two major obstacles: (a) (serious issue) huge computational overhead, which essentially rules it out for today’s large scale deep models (b) (less serious issue) need for special setups —e.g., requiring every user to sign up for public-key encryption.</p>

<p>Significant research efforts are being made to try to overcome these obstacles and we won’t survey them here.</p>

<h2 id="differential-privacy-dp">Differential Privacy (DP)</h2>

<p>Differential privacy (<a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2006/40040493/40040493.pdf">Dwork et al., 2006</a>, <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf">Dwork&amp;Roth, 2014</a>) involves adding carefully calculated amounts of noise during training. This is a modern and rigorous version of classic    <em>data anonymization</em> techniques whose canonical application is release of noised census data to protect privacy of individuals.</p>

<p>This notion was adapted to machine learning by positing that “privacy” in machine learning refers to trained classifiers not being dependent on data of individuals. In other words, if the classifier is trained on data from N individuals, it’s behavior should be essentially unchanged (statistically speaking) if we omit data from any individual. Note that this is a weak notion of privacy: it does not in any way hide the data from the company.</p>

<p>Many tech companies have adopted differential privacy in deployed systems but the following two caveats are important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 1): In deep learning applications, DP’s provable guarantees are very weak.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Applying DP to deep learning involves noticing that the gradient computation amounts to adding gradients of the loss corresponding to individual data points, and that adding noise to those individual gradients in calculated doses can help make the overall classifier limit its dependence on the individual’s datapoint.</p>

<p>In practice provable bounds require adding so much gradient noise that accuracy of the trained classifier plummets. We do not know of any successful training that achieved accuracy &gt; 75 percent on CIFAR10 (or any that achieved accuracy even 10 percent on ImageNet). Furthermore, achieving this level of accuracy involves <strong>pretraining</strong> the classifier model on a large set of <strong>public</strong> images and then using the private/protected images  only to fine-tune the parameters.</p>

<p>Thus it is no surprise that firms today usually apply DP with very low noise level, which give essentially no guarantees. Which brings us to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Caveat 2): DP’s guarantees (and even weaker guarantees applying to deployment scenarios) possibly act as a fig leaf that allows firms to not address  the kinds of privacy violations that the person on the street actually worries about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DP’s provable guarantee (which as noted, does not hold in deployed systems due to the low noise level used) would only ensure that  a deployed ML software that was trained with data from tens of millions of users will not change its behavior depending upon private information of any single user.</p>

<p>But that threat model would seem remote to the person on the street. The privacy issue they worry about more is that copious amounts of our data are continuously collected/stored/mined/sold, often by entities we do not even know about. While  lax regulation is primarily to blame,  there is also the technical hurdle  that  there  is no <strong>practical way</strong> for consumers to hide their data while at the same time benefiting from customized ML solutions that improve their lives.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the question we started with: <em>Could consumers allow machine learning to be done on their data without revealing their data?</em></p>

<h2 id="a-proposed-solution-instahide">A proposed solution: InstaHide</h2>

<p>InstaHide is a new concept: it hides or “encrypts” images to protect them somewhat,  while still allowing standard deep learning pipelines to be applied on them. The deep model is trained entirely on encrypted images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The training speed and accuracy is only slightly worse than vanilla training: one can achieve a test accuracy of ~ 90 percent on CIFAR10 using encrypted images with a computation overhead $&lt; 5$ percent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When it comes to privacy, like every other form of cryptography, its security is based upon conjectured difficulty of the underlying computational problem.
(But we don’t expect breaking it to be as difficult as say breaking RSA.)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-instahide-encryption-works">How InstaHide encryption works</h3>

<p>Here are some details. InstaHide  belongs to the class of subset-sum type encryptions (<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/dwoodruf/www/biwx.pdf">Bhattacharyya et al., 2011</a>), and was inspired by a data augmentation technique called Mixup (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09412">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). It views images as vectors of pixel values. With vectors you can take linear combinations. The figure below shows the result of a typical MixUp: adding  0.6 times the bird image  with 0.4 times the airplane image. The image labels can also be treated as one-hot vectors, and they are mixed using the same coefficients in front of the image samples.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="60%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/mixup.png" />
</p>

<p>To encrypt the bird image, InstaHide does mixup (i.e., combination with nonnegative coefficients) with one other randomly chosen training image, and with two  other images chosen randomly from a large public dataset like imagenet.  The coefficients 0.6., 0.4 etc. in the figure  are also chosen at random. Then it takes this composite image and for every pixel value, it randomly flips the sign. With that, we get the encrypted images and labels. All random choices made in this encryption act as a one-time key that is never re-used to encrypt other images.</p>

<p>InstaHide has a parameter $k$ denoting how many images are mixed; in the picture, we have $k=4$. The figure below shows this encryption mechanism.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="80%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/instahide.png" />
</p>

<p>When plugged into the standard deep learning with a private dataset of $n$ images, in each epoch of training (say $T$ epochs in total), InstaHide will re-encrypt each image in the  dataset using a random one-time key. This will gives $n\times T$ encrypted images in total.</p>

<h3 id="the-security-argument">The security argument</h3>

<p>We conjectured, based upon intuitions from computational complexity of the k-vector-subset-sum problem (citations), that extracting information about the images could time $N^{k-2}$. Here $N$, the size of the public dataset, can be tens or hundreds of millions, so it might be infeasible for real-life attackers.</p>

<p>We also released a <a href="https://github.com/Hazelsuko07/InstaHide_Challenge">challenge dataset</a> with $k=6, n=100, T=50$ to enable further investigation of InstaHide’s security.</p>

<p>Recently, Carlini et al. have shared with us a manuscript with a two-step reconstruction attack (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05315.pdf">Carlini et al., 2020</a>)  against InstaHide.</p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR: They used 11 hours on Google’s best GPUs to get partial recovery of our 100 challenge encryptions and  120 CPU hours to break the encryption completely. Furthermore, the latter was possible entirely because we used an insecure random number generator, and they used exhaustive search over random seeds.</em></strong></p>

<p>Now the details.</p>

<p>The attack takes $n\times T$ InstaHide-encrypted images as the input, ($n$ is the size of the private dataset, $T$ is the number of training epochs), and returns a reconstruction of the private dataset. It goes as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Map $n \times T$ encryptions into $n$ private images, by clustering encryptions of a same private image as a group. This is achieved by firstly building a graph representing pairwise similarity between encrypted images, and then assign each encryption a private image. In their implementation, they train a neural network to annotate pairwise similarity between encryptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, given the encrypted images and the mapping, they solve a nonlinear optimization problem via gradient desent to recover an approximation of the original private dataset.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using Google’s powerful GPU, it took them 10 hours to train the neural network for similarity annotation, and about another hour to get an approximation of our challenge set of $100$ images with $k=6, n=100, T=50$. This gave them vaguely correct images, with significant unclear areas and color shift.</p>

<p>They also proposed a different strategy which abuses the vulnerability of NumPy and PyTorch’s random number generator (<em>Aargh; we didn’t use a secure random number generator.</em>) They did  brute force search of $2^{32}$ possible initial random seeds, which allows them to reproduce the randomness during encryption, and thus perform a pixel-perfect reconstruction. As they reported, this attack takes 120 CPU hours (they parallelize across 100 cores to obtain the solution in a little over an hour). We will have this implementation flaw fixed in an updated version.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts-on-this-attack">Thoughts on this attack</h3>

<p>Though the attack is clever and impressive, we feel that the long-term take-away is still unclear for several reasons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Variants of InstaHide seem to evade the attack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The challenge set contained 50 encryptions each of 100 images. This corresponds to using encrypted images for 50 epochs. But as done in existing settings that use DP, one can pretrain the deep model using non-private images and then fine-tune it with fewer epochs of the private images. Using a similar pipeline DPSGD (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133">Abadi et al., 2016</a>), by pretraining a ResNet-18 on CIFAR100 (the public dataset) and finetuning  for $10$ epochs on CIFAR10 (the private dataset)  gives accuracy of 83 percent, still far better than any provable guarantees using DP on this dataset. Carlini et al.\ team conceded that their attack probably would not work in this setting.</p>

<p>Similarly using InstaHide purely at inference time (i.e., using ML, instead of training ML) still should be completely secure since only one encryption of the image is released. The new attack can’t work here at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>InstaHide was never intended to be a mission-critical encryption like RSA (which by the way also has no provable guarantees).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>InstaHide is designed to give users and the internet of things a <em>light-weight</em> encryption method that allows them to use machine learning without giving eavesdroppers or servers access to their raw data. There is no other cost-effective alternative to InstaHide for this application. If it takes Google’s powerful computers a few hours  to break our challenge set of 100 images, this is not yet a cost-effective attack  in the intended settings.</p>

<p>More important, the challenge dataset corresponded to an ambitious form of security, where the encrypted images themselves are released to the world. The more typical application is a Federated Learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05492">Konečný et al., 2016</a>) scenario: the adversary observes shared gradients that are computed using encrypted images (he also has access to the trained model). The attacks in this paper do not currently apply to that scenario. This is also the idea in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06053"><strong>TextHide</strong></a>, an adaptation of InstaHide to text data.</p>

<h2 id="takeways">Takeways</h2>

<p>Users need lightweight encryptions that can be applied in real time to large amounts of data, and yet allow them to take benefit of Machine Learning on the cloud. Methods to do so could completely change the privacy/utility tradeoffs implicitly assumed in today’s tech world.</p>

<p>InstaHide is the only such tool right now, and we now know that it provides moderate security that may be enough for many applications.</p></div>

<p>My latest preprint is “Stack-number is not bounded by queue-number”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04195">arXiv:2011.04195</a>, with Vida Dujmović, Robert Hickingbotham, Pat Morin, and David R. Wood; Hickingbotham is an undergraduate student of Wood at Monash University. It solves a question implicit in the work of Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0405031">1992</a>) on whether graphs of bounded queue number have bounded stack number (they don’t), disproves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blankenship%E2%80%93Oporowski_conjecture">a conjecture of Blankenship and Oporowski</a> (1999) on whether subdividing a graph of unbounded stack number can reduce its stack number to bounded (it can), and answers a question of Bonnet, Geniet, Kim, Thomassé, and Watrigant (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09877">to appear at SODA 2021</a>) on whether graphs of unbounded stacknumber can have bounded sparse twin-width (they can). And it does so in part using an old trick from combinatorial game theory from a mathematician who won a Nobel prize for his work in game theory. But what are stack number and queue number? And what could combinatorial games possibly have to do with these sorts of questions in structural graph theory?</p>

<p>The game in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)">Hex</a>, in which two players take turns placing their stones on hexagonal cells connected into a triangular grid and arranged in a rhombus. Each player tries to form a path of stones connecting two sides of the rhombus while simultaneously trying to block the other player from making a path. The rendering below from <a href="https://www.hexwiki.net/">HexWiki</a> shows a Hex board with a game in progress:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/HexWiki.jpg" alt="CC-BY-SA POV-Ray image of a Hex game, by Twixter on HexWiki, from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hexposition02.jpg and https://www.hexwiki.net/index.php/File:Hexposition02.jpg" /></p>

<p>In tic-tac-toe, a similar game on a square grid, both players can end up blocking each other, producing a drawn game. But as John Nash famously proved in 1952, this can’t happen in Hex: every game ends with one or the other player forming a path. This inability to draw is usually explained as a topological property of disks in the plane, equivalent to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer_fixed-point_theorem">Brouwer fixed-point theorem</a>, although it also has a simple combinatorial proof involving walking along the boundary between the two colors of stones on a filled board, starting from a corner of the rhombus, and observing that the walk can only end at a non-opposite corner. But the lack of draws also implies the following statement about graphs: if you form a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_tiling">triangular grid</a> (the graph of positions and adjacencies of stones in Hex), and label its vertices with two colors (the colors of the stones of the two Hex players), then it must contain a long path: at least long enough to reach from one side of the Hex board to the other.</p>

<p>The same combinatorial proof for the Hex board works for any planar triangulation of a disk whose boundary can be divided into four paths with opposite pairs of paths far apart. Even some outerplanar graphs have the same long-path property. Suppose, for instance, that an outerplanar triangulated disk has a complete binary tree for its dual graph. Then we can form a long path by starting at a vertex of the root triangle and repeatedly walking down the tree, at each step moving to a neighbor of the same color whose triangle is closest in the dual tree. This walk takes a long step (such as the step on the top edge of the red path shown below) only when stepping from a vertex whose neighbors include a long path of the other color (the blue path shown below), and otherwise it takes many steps.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/outerplanar-path-property.svg" alt="An outerplanar graph in which every 2-coloring has a long monochromatic path" /></p>

<p>On the other hand, the square grid or other bipartite graphs don’t have the long path property, because if you color them bipartitely then there are no nontrivial monochromatic paths. Neither do subcubic graphs, because their maximum cuts always partition them into two subsets whose longest path has length at most one. The Hex board graph turns out to be the right choice for our purposes, because as well as the long path property it has bounded degree (unlike the outerplanar example) and a nice regular planar structure making stack and queue layouts easy.</p>

<p>So what are these layouts? Stack layout is another name for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_embedding">book embedding</a>, in which the vertices of a graph are arranged in a line and its edges are placed without crossings into “pages”, half-planes bounded by the line. If you traverse the vertices of the graph in the order of the line, add an edge to its page when you traverse its first endpoint, and remove an edge from the page when you traverse the second endpoint, then the order of additions and removals is last-in-first-out, the same as a stack. The stack number or book thickness is the smallest number of pages you need to construct a layout like this. Below is an <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2015/10/03/why-shallow-minors.html">example I’ve used before</a>, a 3-page book embedding of the complete graph \(K_5\), whose stack number is three:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2015/3page-K5.svg" alt="Book embedding" /></p>

<p>If you replace the last-in-first-out ordering of additions and removals in a stack by first-in-first-out ordering, you get a queue. So a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_number">queue layout</a> is just an ordering of the vertices into a line, and a partition of the edges into “pages”, so that the traversal of the vertices by their line order produces a queue ordering of additions and removals of edges within each page. As <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007%2F978-3-642-18469-7_7">Auer et al described at GD 2010</a>, these layouts can also be described topologically, by representing each page as a cylinder with the line going longitudinally along it, and requiring each edge to be placed in such a way that it loops all the way around the cylinder. The queue number is the minimum number of these queues, or cylindrical pages, that you need to organize the graph in this way. It’s also closely related to the compact layout of graphs in 3d.</p>

<p>Below is an example I recently drew for a new Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffle-exchange_network">shuffle-exchange networks</a>. These are very nonplanar graphs, but the layout shown can almost be drawn without crossings on two cylinders (one for the edges that bend around the left side of the vertices, another for the edges on the right) or on a single surface with a figure-eight cross-section, formed by gluing two cylinders together on a line. However, this only takes care of the curved edges. If you look closely, there are also short horizontal edges between consecutive vertices, which in a queue layout would need to wrap around another third cylinder. So these graphs have queue number at most three.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/Order-4_shuffle-exchange.svg" alt="Shuffle-exchange network" /></p>

<p>With all that as background, the central example in our new preprint is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product_of_graphs">Cartesian product</a> of a triangular grid with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_(graph_theory)">star</a>. It looks like this, but possibly with a bigger grid or star:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/star-times-hex.svg" alt="Cartesian product of a star with a triangular grid" /></p>

<p>The reason Cartesian products are useful in this context is that they behave nicely for queue layouts but not quite as nicely for stack layouts. If two graphs \(G\) and \(H\) both have queue layouts with a bounded number of queues, and in addition the layout of \(H\) is <em>strict</em>, meaning that within each page, each vertex has at most one earlier and one later neighbor, then we can lay out their product by grouping the vertices of the product into copies of \(G\) and placing each copy separately, with the order of the copies determined by the layout of \(H\). The resulting layout will still have a bounded queue number.  The star has bounded queue number, but its layouts are not strict, because it has high degree at the center of the star. As a planar graph the triangular grid has bounded queue number, and because it also has bounded degree its layouts can be made strict. Therefore, the product graph again has bounded queue number.</p>

<p>For stack layouts, a similar product layout works, but only when \(H\) is bipartite. We can reverse the ordering within the copies of \(G\) coming from one side of the bipartition, and the edges going from one copy to another will still be stack-ordered. But when \(H\) is not bipartite, there is no way to consistently choose which copies of \(G\) to reverse. The long path property of Hex boards, in some sense, provides a quantitative measure for the fact that their graphs are far from being bipartite.</p>

<p>Of course, this only shows that a certain stack layout doesn’t work, not that all layouts fail. Our proof that all stack layouts of our product graph fail proceeds in a sequence of reductions in which we assume we are given a layout, and successively reduce it to more-constrained layouts on smaller graphs until reaching a contradiction. The first reductions use the pigeonhole principle to find products of the grid with a smaller star, in which all leaf copies of the grid have the same layout. Next we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szekeres_theorem">Erdős–Szekeres theorem</a> to find a product with an even smaller star, in which each copy of the star is consistently ordered by the layout in one of two ways. Finally, we use the result about long paths in Hex to find a product of this small star with a path, in which all copies of the star are consistently ordered in the same way, and prove that this ordering of this graph cannot have a bounded stack number.</p>

<p>Heath, Leighton and Rosenberg introduced both stack number and queue number in their 1992 work, and provided an example for which the stack number is exponentially bigger than the queue number, naturally raising the question whether even bigger separations are possible. Our work settles this question by showing that there is no function (exponential or otherwise) that can be used to bound stack number as a function of queue number. In the opposite direction, Heath, Leighton &amp; Rosenberg conjectured that queue number cannot be made to grow significantly more quickly than stack number, but this remains open.</p>

<p>In 1999, Blankenship and Oporowski observed that subdividing the edges of a graph can lead to better stack layouts: for instance adding a single subdivision point to each edge of a complete graph reduces the stack number from linear to the square root of the number of vertices. They conjectured that this improvement cannot be too extreme: reducing the stack number from non-constant to constant should require a non-constant number of subdivision points. Our example disproves the Blankenship–Oporowski conjecture. The star-triangular grid product graph has non-constant stack number, but because it has bounded queue number its subdivisions with three subdivision points per edge have bounded stack number, according to a result of Dujmović and Wood (<a href="https://dmtcs.episciences.org/346">2005</a>). The same paper of Dujmović and Wood also stated the question of whether stack number can be bounded by a function of queue number more explicitly.</p>

<p>The definition of twin-width is too technical to summarize here; see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09877">forthcoming SODA paper by Bonnet et al.</a>, which shows among other results that it is bounded for graphs of bounded stack number. Our results show that this is not an equivalence: there exist graphs (including the star-triangular grid products) that have unbounded stack number, but still have bounded sparse twin-width.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity of voting schemes to mistakes and manipulations</h2>
<p>Do the results of the recent election accurately reflect public opinion?<br />
Or are they the result of some minor local manipulations, and a few random<br />
mistakes such as voters confusion, or counting errors.</p>
<p>There are many potential schemes for electing a president, each with its<br />
own features. One important feature of a scheme is the agreement of the<br />
actual outcome of the election with the outcome of the ideal<br />
implementation of the election which disregards potential mistakes and<br />
mischief. If it is probable that the ideal and the actual outcomes differ,<br />
then frequently the outcome of the election will be in doubt.</p>
<p>In recent years, some mathematical efforts have been devoted to trying to<br />
understand which procedures are “stable” to these potential perturbations<br />
and which are “sensitive”. While the motivation for these studies came<br />
from questions in probability and statistical physics, These mathematical<br />
studies can shed some light on the current presidential election. In<br />
particular, a recent paper by Professors Itai Benjamini and Oded Schramm<br />
from Microsoft research and the Weizmann Institute and Gil Kalai from the<br />
Hebrew University of Jerusalem, soon to be published in the prestigious<br />
French journal Publication I.H.E.S., suggests that the “popular vote”<br />
method is much more stable against mistakes than other voting method.</p>
<p>One example of a decision procedure that we encounter in nature is the<br />
neuron. The neuron has to make its decisions based on many inputs; each<br />
represents the strength of electrical currents at the synapses entering<br />
the neuron. Based on these inputs, the neuron should decide whether to<br />
fire its axon going out of the neuron. It is quite likely that some small<br />
perturbations occur at each of the input synapses. It is therefore<br />
expected that the decision procedure of the neuron will be “stable” to<br />
these perturbations.</p>
<p>Experimental evidence indicates that neurons may be modeled as the<br />
following simple procedure. The neuron looks at some weighted sum of its<br />
inputs and makes a decision according to how large this sum is . If the<br />
sum is large, then one decision is made , while if it is small another<br />
decision is made .</p>
<p>The counterpart of this procedure for elections would be counting the<br />
votes and deciding according to the majority of the votes. Mathematical<br />
proofs have been given to show that this decision procedure is the most<br />
stable among all decision procedures.</p>
<p>More complicated neural networks consist of a hierarchy of neurons where<br />
the outputs of neurons in lower levels of the hierarchy are the inputs to<br />
neurons in the higher levels. Some of these networks have been proven to<br />
be much more sensitive to noise than a single neuron.</p>
<p>The counterpart of neural network in the political system may sound<br />
familiar: The voters are divided into groups (states) and each group<br />
chooses its candidate based on the majority vote. Then some weighted<br />
majority of the votes of the states is taken to be the elected president.</p>
<p>The mathematical theorems imply that this system is much more sensitive to<br />
minor mistakes.</p>
<p>If the overwhelming majority of the population is voting for the same<br />
candidate then it doesn’t really matter which voting scheme we use. All of<br />
the natural schemes are “stable”. On the other hand, when the population<br />
is almost evenly split, different schemes behave differently.</p>
<p>The mathematical reasoning behind the stability of the majority vote goes<br />
back to Abraham DeMoivre and Pierre-Simon Laplace (18th century). This<br />
reasoning implies, for example, that in a population of 98,221,798 votes,<br />
if there is a bias of 222,880 for one candidate, then this candidate will<br />
be chosen, even if for each voter there is a small chance that his or her<br />
vote is not counted or counted wrongly (the results of the last election<br />
as of 11/13/00). As long as mistakes for both sides are equally likely,<br />
the result will correctly reflect the bias in the public opinion.</p>
<p>Thus, in this presidential election while the gap between the two<br />
candidates is only 0.2% of the votes it is still large enough so that the<br />
outcome is immune even if a fairly large percent (10% for example) of the<br />
votes were counted mistakenly (assuming the mistakes were random and<br />
independent.)</p>
<p>On the other hand the gap of a 388 votes among the 6,000,000 million votes<br />
in Florida (about 0.05% of the votes) may well be too small to overcome<br />
the effect of random mistakes in counting the votes, even if the chance<br />
for a mistake is fairly small (1%, say). It can well be argued that just<br />
because of the (unavoidable) mistakes in counting the votes in Florida<br />
(putting aside all other controversies surrounding the vote there) we will<br />
never be able to know who got the majority of votes among the voters of<br />
Florida. To understand why the picture is so different as far as the<br />
popular vote is concerns in the entire nation and the popular vote in the<br />
state of Florida we should note that the stability against mistakes<br />
increases dramatically as the number of voters rise. (And also, of course,<br />
as the gap between the candidates rise.)</p>
<p>The discrepancy between our ability to call the winner in the popular vote<br />
and disability to call the winner in the electoral college (which is the<br />
winner of the election according to the constitution) is not unexpected.</p>
<p>The new results by Benjamini, Schramm and Kalai show that for many models<br />
majority is the scheme which is least sensitive to noise. In these models<br />
it is assumed that voters make their decisions independently and the<br />
mistakes are symmetric and independent for different voters. It is shown<br />
then that for models resembling the current voting scheme in the U.S.A, if<br />
the population is almost evenly split, the scheme is much more sensitive<br />
to noise than the majority scheme. In particular a tiny fraction of<br />
mistakes is very likely to reverse the ideal outcome of the election.<br />
Moreover, if the elections are almost balanced, then the results are too<br />
close to call.</p>
<p>If the outcomes do not show significant bias towards one of the candidates<br />
then in the “popular-vote” method the probability of random independent<br />
mistakes which effect one in every A votes has a chance of one in the<br />
square-root of A to switch the outcome of the elections. In a method like<br />
the “electoral college” the chance is increased to something like one in<br />
the fourth root of A.</p>
<p>If the popular vote is significantly tilted towards one of the candidates<br />
than the effect of mistakes becomes smaller for all voting methods but<br />
much more so for the popular-vote method.</p>
<p>The study of the sensitivity of voting procedures to small errors for such<br />
models is based on mathematical tools from “harmonic analysis”, and<br />
provides a classification of the voting schemes which are very sensitive<br />
to small amounts of noise and those which are more stable. In particular<br />
among all symmetric voting procedures (i.e., all voters have the same<br />
power), the popular majority is the most robust.</p>
<p>For further technical reading and the precise formulation of the<br />
mathematical theorems see <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.PR/9811157" rel="nofollow">http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.PR/9811157</a></p>
<p>A word of warning is in place. The precise expected effect of mistakes<br />
will depend on the specific statistical model for the voting patterns and<br />
for the noise created by counting errors and biases. For example, more<br />
recent work by Claire Kanyon from Orsay university, Elchanan Mossel from<br />
Microsoft research and Yuval Peres from Berkeley and the Hebrew<br />
University, gives quite a different picture for different models based on<br />
the famous “Ising model” from Physics. We expect that the qualitative<br />
conclusion of the research by Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm applied to the<br />
case of U.S. presidential elections and that the popular vote method is<br />
much more stable to noise and biases than the electoral college method.<br />
For definite conclusions, however, some statistical work on actual voting<br />
data should be carried out. Choosing the most appropriate voting method<br />

A famous conjecture of Tuza states that the minimum number of edges needed to cover all the triangles in a graph is at most twice the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles.  This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by Aharoni and Zerbib who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture, and also studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional version of the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically, we give a factor $t/2+ O(\sqrt{t \log t})$ approximation based on LP rounding for an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problem (AHTP). The objective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of $(t-1)$-sized subsets of vertices of an input $t$-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge contains one of these subsets.

Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph versions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and matchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a ``tent" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We give a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free hypergraphs, and indeed $\mathcal{F}$-free hypergraphs for any finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include almost all the vertices.


The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as instances of vertex cover on \emph{simple} hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise share at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor $t$ approximation for vertex cover is hard to improve for simple $t$-uniform hypergraphs. However, for set cover on simple $n$-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm achieves a factor $(\ln n)/2$, better than the optimal $\ln n$ factor for general hypergraphs.</div>

<p>There are people who really, genuinely, believe, as far as you can dig down, that winning is everything—that however many lies they told, allies they betrayed, innocent lives they harmed, etc. etc., it was all justified by the fact that <strong>they won and their enemies lost</strong>.  Faced with such sociopaths, people like me typically feel an irresistible compulsion to <em>counterargue</em>: to make the sociopath realize that winning is <em>not</em> everything, that truth and honor are terminal values as well; to subject the sociopath to the standards by which the rest of us are judged; to find the conscience that the sociopath buried even from himself and drag it out into the light.  Let me know if you can think of any case in human history where such efforts succeeded, because I’m having difficulty doing so.</p>



<p>Clearly, in the vast majority of cases if not in all, the only counterargument that a sociopath will ever understand is <em>losing</em>.  And yet not just any kind of losing suffices.  For victims, there’s an <em>enormous</em> temptation to turn the sociopath’s underhanded tools against him, to win with the same deceit and naked power that the sociopath so gleefully inflicted on others.  And yet, if that’s what it takes to beat him, then you have to imagine the sociopath deriving a certain perverse satisfaction from it.</p>



<p>Think of the movie villain who, as the panting hero stands over him with his lightsaber, taunts “Yes … yes … destroy me!  Do it now!  Feel the hate and the rage flow through you!”  What happens next, of course, is that the hero angrily decides to give the villain one more chance, the ungrateful villain lunges to stab the hero in the back or something, and only then does the villain die—either by a self-inflicted accident, or else killed by the hero in immediate self-defense.  Either way, the hero walks away with victory <em>and</em> honor.</p>



<p>In practice, it’s a tall order to arrange all of that.  This explains why sociopaths are so hard to defeat, and why I feel so bleak and depressed whenever I see one flaunting his power.  But, you know, the great upside of pessimism is that it doesn’t take much to beat your expectations!  Whenever a single sociopath <em>is</em> cleanly and honorably defeated, or even just rendered irrelevant—no matter that the sociopath’s friends and allies are still in power, no matter that they’ll be back to fight another day, etc. etc.—it’s a genuine occasion for rejoicing.</p>



<p>Anyway, that pretty much sums up my thoughts regarding Arthur Chu.  In other news, hooray about the election!</p></div>
