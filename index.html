<p>There’s a lot of discussion and (possibly well-deserved) hype nowadays about quantum computation and its potential for computation at speeds we simply can’t reach with the classical computers we’re used to today. The excitement about this has been building for years, even decades, but it’s only very recently that we’ve really been approaching a solid proof that quantum computers do have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy">advantage</a> over classical computers. </p>



<p>What’s rather tricky about showing such a result is that, rather than a direct argument about the capability of quantum computers, what we really need to demonstrate is the incapability of classical computers to achieve tasks that can be done with quantum computers. </p>



<p>One of the major leaps forward in demonstrating quantum supremacy was taken by Terhal and DiVincenzo in their 2008 paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205133">Adaptive quantum computation, constant depth quantum circuits and arthur-merlin games</a>“. Their approach was to appeal to a complexity-theoretic argument: they gave evidence that there exists a certain class of quantum circuits that cannot be simulated classically by proving that if a classical simulation existed, certain complexity classes strongly believed to be distinct would collapse to the same class. While this doesn’t quite provide a proof of quantum supremacy – since the statement about the distinction between complexity classes upon which it hinges is not a proven fact – because the complexity statement appears overwhelmingly likely to be true, so too does the proposed existence of non-classically-simulatable quantum circuits. The Terhal and DiVincenzo paper is a complex and highly technical one, but in this post I hope to explain a little bit and give some intuition for the major points. </p>



<p>Now, let’s start at the beginning. What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit">quantum circuit</a>? I’m going to go ahead and assume you already know what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_(computer_science)">classical circuit</a> is – the extension to a quantum circuit is rather straightforward: it’s a circuit in which all gates are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate">quantum gates</a>, where a quantum gate can be thought of as a classical gate whose output is, rather than a deterministic function of the inputs, instead a probability distribution over all possible outputs given the size of the inputs. For example, given two single-bit inputs, a classical AND gate outputs 0 or 1 deterministically given the inputs. A quantum AND gate on the analogous single-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit">qubit</a> inputs would output 0 with some probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> and 1 with some probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1-p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1-p" class="latex" title="1-p" />. Similarly, a classical AND gate on two 4-bit inputs outputs the bitwise AND, while the quantum analog has associated with it a 4-qubit output: some probability distribution over all 4-bit binary strings. A priori there is no particular string that is the “output” of the computation by the quantum gate; it’s only after taking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics">quantum measurement</a> of the output that we get an actual string that we can think of as the outcome of the computation done by the gate. The actual string we “observe” upon taking the measurement follows the probability distribution computed by the gate on its inputs. In this way, a quantum circuit can then be thought of as producing, via a sequence of probabilistic classical gates (i.e., quantum gates) some probability distribution over possible outputs given the input lengths. It’s not hard to see that in this way, we can compose circuits: suppose we have a quantum circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_1" class="latex" title="c_1" /> and another quantum circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_2" class="latex" title="c_2" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_1" class="latex" title="c_1" /> have an input of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> qubits and an output of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> qubits; suppose we measure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> of the output qubits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_1" class="latex" title="c_1" /> – then we can feed the remaining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m-k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m-k" class="latex" title="m-k" /> unmeasured qubits as inputs into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_2" class="latex" title="c_2" />(assuming that those <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m-k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m-k" class="latex" title="m-k" /> qubits do indeed constitute a valid input to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c_2" class="latex" title="c_2" />). </p>



<p>Consider, then, the following sort of quantum circuit: it’s a composition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N" class="latex" title="N" /> quantum circuits, such that after each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />-th circuit we take a measurement some of its output qubits (so that the remaining unmeasured qubits become inputs to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2B1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(i+1)" class="latex" title="(i+1)" />-th circuit), and then the structure of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28i%2B1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(i+1)" class="latex" title="(i+1)" />-th circuit is dependent on this measurement. That is, it’s as though, given a quantum circuit, we’re checking every so often at intermediate layers over the course of the circuit’s computation what the value of some of the variables are (leaving the rest to keep going along through the circuit to undergo more computational processing), and based on what we measure is the current computed value, the remainder of the circuit “adapts” in a way determined by that measurement. Aptly enough, this is called an “adaptive circuit”. But since the “downstream” structure of the circuit depends on the outcomes of all the measurements made “upstream”, each adaptive circuit actually comprises a family of circuits, each of which is specified by the sequence of intermediate measurement outcomes. That is, we can alternatively characterize an adaptive circuit as a set of ordinary quantum circuits that is parameterized by a list of measurement outcomes. Terhal and DiVincenzo call this way of viewing an adaptive circuit, as a family of circuits parametrized by a sequence of measurement values, a “non-adaptive circuit” – since we replace the idea that the circuit “adapts” to intermediate measurements with the idea that there are just many regular circuits, one for each possible sequence of measurements. It’s this non-adaptive circuit concept that’ll be our main object of study going forward.</p>



<h2>Simulating quantum circuits</h2>



<p>Now, the result we wanted to demonstrate about quantum circuits had to do with their efficient simulatability by classical circuits – and so we should establish some notion of what we mean when we talk about an “efficient simulation”. </p>



<p>Terhal and DiVincenzo offer the following notion of a classical simulation – which in their paper they call an “efficient density computation”: consider a quantum circuit with some output of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> qubits. Recall that to actually obtain an output value, we need to take a measurement of the circuit output – imagine doing this in disjoint subsets of cubits at a time. That is, we can break up the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> qubits into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> disjoint subsets and consider the entire output measurement as a process of taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k" class="latex" title="k" /> measurements, subset by subset. An efficient density computation exists if there’s a classical procedure for computing, in time polynomial in the width and depth of the quantum circuit, the conditional probability distribution over the set of possible measurement outcomes of a particular subset of qubits, given any subset of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k-1" class="latex" title="k-1" /> other measurement outcomes. Intuitively, this is a good notion of what a classical simulation should consist of, or at least what data it should contain, since if you know the conditional probabilities given any (possibly empty) subset of the other measurements, you can just flip coins for the outputs according to the conditional probabilities as a way of actually exhibiting a “working” simulation.</p>



<p>It’s with this notion of simulation, along with our concept of an adaptive quantum circuit as a family of regular circuits parameterized by a sequence of intermediate measurement outcomes, we may now arrive at the main result of Terhal and DiVincenzo’s paper. Recall that what we wanted to show from the very beginning is that there exists some quantum circuit that can’t be simulated classically. The argument for this proceeds like a proof by contradiction: suppose the contrary, and that all quantum circuits can be simulated classically. We want to show that we can find, then, a quantum circuit which, if it were possible to be simulated classically (as per our assumption), we’d wind up with some strange consequences that we believe are false, leading us to conclude that those circuits probably can’t be simulated classically.</p>



<p>Thus, we shall now exhibit such a quantum circuit whose classical simulatability leads (as far as we believe) to a contradiction. Consider a special case of adaptive quantum circuits, considered as a parameterized family of regular circuits, in which the circuit’s output distribution is independent of the intermediate measurement outcomes; that is, the case in which the entire family of circuits corresponding to an adaptive circuit is logically the same – that is, is the same logical circuit on input qubits independent of intermediate measurements. I’d like to point out, just for clarification’s sake, the subtlety here, which makes this consideration non-redundant, and not simply a reduction of an adaptive quantum circuit (again, thought of as a family) to a single fixed circuit (i.e., a family of one): the situation in which the family is reduced to a single fixed circuit occurs when the<em> structure of the circuit</em> is independent of the intermediate measurement outcomes. If the structure were independent of the measurements, then no matter what we observed in the measurements, we’d get the same circuit – hence a trivial family of one. What we’re considering instead is the case in which the <em>structure</em> of the circuit is still dependent on the intermediate measurements (and so the circuit is still adaptive), but where the <em>distribution over the possible outputs of the circuit</em> is identical no matter what the intermediate measurements are. In this case, the circuit can still be considered as a parameterized and in general non-trivial family of circuits, but for which each member produces the same distribution over outputs – hence, a family of potentially <em>structurally</em> different circuits, but which are <em>logically</em> identical.</p>



<p>Suppose there’s some set of such circuits that’s universal – that is, that’s sufficient to implement all polynomial-time quantum computations. (This is a reasonable assumption to make, since there do in fact exist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate\#Universal_quantum_gates">universal quantum gate sets.</a> But now if a simulation of the kind we defined (an efficient density computation) existed for every circuit in this set, then we could calculate the outcome probability of any polynomial-depth quantum circuit, since any polynomial-depth quantum circuit could be realized as some composition of circuits in this universal set (and in particular as a composition of particular family members of each adaptive circuit in the universal set), and an efficient density computation, as we mentioned above, precisely gives us a way to compute the output distribution. </p>



<p>But now here is where our believed contradiction lies: </p>



<p><em>Theorem:</em> Suppose there exists a universal set of adaptive quantum circuits whose output distributions are independent of intermediate measurements. If there is an efficient density computation for each family member of each adaptive circuit in this universal set, then for the polynomial hierarchy PH we have PH = BPP = BQP. </p>



<p>The proof goes something like this: if we can do our desired efficient density computations (as we assumed, for the sake of contradiction, we could for all quantum circuits), this is equivalent to being able to determine the acceptance probability of a quantum computation, which was shown in the paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9812056">Determining Acceptance Possibility for a Quantum Computation is Hard for the Polynomial Hierarchy”</a> by Fenner, Green, Homer and Pruim to be equivalent to the class <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BcoC%3DP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\text{coC=P}" class="latex" title="\text{coC=P}" />. Thus, we have that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BcoC%3DP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\text{coC=P} \subseteq \text{BPP}" class="latex" title="\text{coC=P} \subseteq \text{BPP}" />. But it’s known that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BPH%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BcoC%3DP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\text{PH} \subseteq \text{BPP}^{\text{coC=P}}" class="latex" title="\text{PH} \subseteq \text{BPP}^{\text{coC=P}}" /> and so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BPH%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D%5E%7B%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D%7D+%3D+%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\text{PH} \subseteq \text{BPP}^{\text{BPP}} = \text{BPP}" class="latex" title="\text{PH} \subseteq \text{BPP}^{\text{BPP}} = \text{BPP}" />. That is, we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BPH%7D+%3D+%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D+%3D+%5Ctext%7BBQP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\text{PH} = \text{BPP} = \text{BQP}" class="latex" title="\text{PH} = \text{BPP} = \text{BQP}" />, and so the polynomial hierarchy would collapse to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CSigma%5EP_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\Sigma^P_2" class="latex" title="\Sigma^P_2" /> since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctext%7BBPP%7D+%5Csubseteq+%5CSigma%5EP_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\text{BPP} \subseteq \Sigma^P_2" class="latex" title="\text{BPP} \subseteq \Sigma^P_2" /> (for more on these more obscure complexity classes, see <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo">here</a>). Again, this is our “contradiction”: while it hasn’t been quite proven, it is widely believed, with strong supporting evidence, that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse as would be the case if all quantum circuits were classically simulatable. Thus this provides a strong argument that not all quantum circuits are classically simulatable, which was precisely what we were looking to demonstrate.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Terhal and DiVincenzo actually go even further and show that there is a certain class of constant-depth quantum circuits that are unlikely to be simulatable by classical circuits – this, indeed, seems to provide even stronger evidence for quantum supremacy. This argument, which is somewhat more complex, uses the idea of teleportation and focuses on a particular class of circuits implementable by a certain restricted set of quantum gates. If you’re interested, I highly recommend reading their paper, where this is explained. </p>

one ultimately periodic assembly path {\it para-periodic}. We observe that a
confluent 1-TAS has at most one maximal producible assembly, $\alpha_{max}$,
that can be considered a union of path assemblies, and we show that such a
system is always para-periodic. This result is obtained through a superposition
and a combination of two paths that produce a new path with desired properties,
a technique that we call \emph{co-grow} of two paths. Moreover we provide a
characterization of an $\alpha_{max}$ of a confluent 1-TAS as one of two
possible cases, so called, a grid or a disjoint union of combs. To a given
$\alpha_{max}$ we can associate a finite labeled graph, called \emph{quipu},
such that the union of all labels of paths in the quipu equals $\alpha_{max}$,
therefore giving a finite description for $\alpha_{max}$. This finite
description implies that $\alpha_{max}$ is a union of semi-affine subsets of
$\mathbb{Z}^2$ and since such a finite description can be algorithmicly
generated from any 1-TAS, 1-TAS cannot have universal computational power.

simple folds (folding along one line at a time) under the infinite all-layers
model introduced by [Akitaya et al., 2017], in which each simple fold is
defined by an infinite line and must fold all layers of paper that intersect
this line. This model is motivated by folding in manufacturing such as
sheet-metal bending. We improve on [Arkin et al., 2004] by giving a
deterministic $O(n)$-time algorithm to decide simple foldability of 1D crease
patterns in the all-layers model. Then we extend this 1D result to 2D, showing
that simple foldability in this model can be decided in linear time for
unassigned axis-aligned orthogonal crease patterns on axis-aligned 2D
orthogonal paper. On the other hand, we show that simple foldability is
strongly NP-complete if a subset of the creases have a mountain-valley
assignment, even for an axis-aligned rectangle of paper.

partitions of the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^d$. Inspired by recent theoretical
work on NNS for general metric spaces [Andoni, Naor, Nikolov, Razenshteyn,
Waingarten STOC 2018, FOCS 2018], we develop a new framework for constructing
such partitions that reduces the problem to balanced graph partitioning
followed by supervised classification. We instantiate this general approach
with the KaHIP graph partitioner [Sanders, Schulz SEA 2013] and neural
networks, respectively, to obtain a new partitioning procedure called Neural
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Neural LSH). On several standard benchmarks for
NNS, our experiments show that the partitions found by Neural LSH consistently
outperform partitions found by quantization- and tree-based methods.

metamer mismatch volumes. Unlike prior art techniques, our methods do not make
any assumptions on the shape of spectra on the boundary of the mismatch
volumes. Both methods utilize a spherical sampling approach, but they calculate
mismatch volumes in two different ways. The first method uses a linear
programming optimization, while the second is a computational geometry approach
based on half-space intersection. We show that under certain conditions the
theoretically maximal metamer mismatch volume is significantly larger than the
one approximated using a prior art method.

non-uniform cellular automata (CAs). The cells of non-uniform CAs, we have
considered here, can use different Wolfram's rules to generate their next
states. We report an algorithm which decides whether or not a configuration of
a given (non-uniform) cellular automaton is reachable from another
configuration. A characterization tool, named Reachability tree, is used to
develop theories and the decision algorithm for the CREP. Though the worst case
complexity of the algorithm is exponential in time and space, but the average
performance is very good.

retrieval in signal processing, we develop a simple yet efficient two-stage
algorithm that leverages the multi-frequency information. We demonstrate in
theory and practice that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art phase synchronization algorithms, at a mild computational
costs incurred by using the extra frequency channels. We also extend our
algorithmic framework to general synchronization problems over compact Lie

number of methods have been developed in the past decades, it is still quite
challenging to design quality guaranteed algorithms with low complexities for
the problems. Our idea is inspired by the greedy method, Gonzalez's algorithm,
for solving the problem of ordinary $k$-center clustering. Based on some novel
observations, we show that this greedy strategy actually can handle
$k$-center/median/means clustering with outliers efficiently, in terms of
qualities and complexities. We further show that the greedy approach yields
small coreset for the problem in doubling metrics, so as to reduce the time
complexity significantly. Moreover, a by-product is that the coreset
construction can be applied to speedup the popular density-based clustering
approach DBSCAN.

<br />
My daughter Molly spent six weeks on an environmental program in China last summer. When she got back she had to do a report on machine learning and wind turbines used for clean energy generation. What does machine learning have to do with wind turbines? Plenty it turns out and it tell us a lot about the future of programming.<br />
<br />
Sudden changes in wind can cause damage to the blades of the turbine. Maintenance is very expensive especially for turbines in the sea and a broken turbine generates no electricity. To catch these changes ahead of time you can mount a Lidar on top of the turbine.<br />
<br />
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator">
<a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9LFv8FGZNG8/XEYxYFyCYDI/AAAAAAABmPs/TLY7-bfPWhMWjRLl8Jn9ixXrTBa_sAk7ACLcBGAs/s1600/Turbine%2BLidar.jpg"><img width="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9LFv8FGZNG8/XEYxYFyCYDI/AAAAAAABmPs/TLY7-bfPWhMWjRLl8Jn9ixXrTBa_sAk7ACLcBGAs/s320/Turbine%2BLidar.jpg" border="0" height="180" /></a></div>
<br />
The Lidar can detect wind gusts from about 100 meters ahead, giving about 10 seconds to react. In that time you can rotate the blades, or the whole turbine itself to minimize any damage. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zLp6UuC70">video</a> describing the situation.<br />
<br />
<center>

</center>
<br />
How do you do the computations to convert the Lidar data into accurate representations of wind gusts and then how to best adjust for them? You could imagine some complex fluid dynamics computation, which gets even more complex when you several wind turbines in front of each other. Instead you can use the massive amount of data you have collected by sensors on the turbine and the Lidar information and train a neural network. Training takes a long time but a trained network can quickly determine a good course of action. Now neural networks can always make mistakes but unlike self-driving cars, a mistake won't kill anyone, just possibly cause more damage. Since on average you can save considerable maintenance costs, using ML here is a big win.<br />
<br />
I've obviously over simplified the above but I really like this example. This is not an ML solution to a standard AI question like image recognition or playing chess. Rather we are using ML to make a difficult computation tractable mostly by using ML on available data and that changes how we think about programming complex tasks.</div>

<p>Suppose you want to sell a car and there are 10 agents willing to buy it. You are not sure how much they could pay but for each of them you know a probability distribution of how high the offer will be. For example, a car salon would always pay 10K  but some person might offer 5K or 15K with equal probability. The best you could do is to first negotiate with all of them and then pick the highest bid. Unfortunately, you cannot do so - after seeing each offer you must irrevocably choose either to sell the car or to refuse the offer. What is the best strategy to maximize your revenue in this case?</p>
<p>In turns out that this is a well-studied optimization problem with a simple strategy that guarantees you can (on expectation) earn at least half as much as a hypothetical prophet, who knows all the bids in advance. This result is known as the prophet inequality. What is more surprising, this strategy would work even if you are a car retailer and want to sell five cars. Moreover, you might want to have some constraints, for example you do not want to sell two cars to buyers from the same city, or have multiple kinds of cars with different evaluations, and you can always guarantee an expected revenue comparable to the one of the prophets.</p>
<p>This problem not only exploits beautiful math but also has important applications in internet ad display. Actually, whenever you type a query into a web search engine, the ad system performs this kind of car-selling game with the ad suppliers, who offer different bids for their ad to be displayed to you.</p>

<p>A few years ago, while attending a Dagstuhl program on Equilibrium Computation, I embarked on one of the traditional long hikes through the beautiful woods surrounding Schloss Dagstuhl and happened to be walking next to a senior member of the Operations Research community. In no time we got immersed in a lively discussion on the style of research going on in Algorithmic Game Theory. We both agreed that the progress made in a matter of a few years was nothing short of phenomenal. At this point, my colleague remarked that AGT was no exception and that when TCS researchers enter a new area, they go in with such energies and enthusiasm that in no time not only is all low hanging fruit gone but in fact the entire area is devoid of any reasonable open problems! “They attack the area like swarms of locusts devouring foliage in biblical lands, consuming not only fruit and leaves but even shrubs and twigs,” he added. “Yes, and only sh*t is left behind!” I chimed in.</p>
<p>As AGT is reaching that stage, with researchers yearning for new issues/problems for their students and their own research and grant proposals, there is a reprieve emerging on the horizon: a program at Simons on “<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/market2019">Online and Matching-Based Market Design</a>” in Fall 2019.</p>
<p>This is by no means a new area. In fact, the first such market, for matching medical residents to hospitals, dates back to 1920s, well before the classic — and by now Nobel Prize winning — work of Gale and Shapley on the stable matching problem, which provided the canonical algorithm for this market. In recent years, the advent of the Internet and the relocation of our most important activities to online platforms have led to an explosion of such marketplaces (for examples, see the Simons web page) and they have been occupying an ever-increasing fraction of our economy.</p>
<p>AGT, CS and Economics have already had a massive impact via these markets. My own experience comes from Google’s multi-billion dollar Adwords market in which sophisticated algorithmic ideas have also played a central role, e.g., see the Simons talk “<a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/vijay-vazirani-4-30-18">Google’s AdWords Market: How Theory Influenced Practice</a>“.</p>
<p>Clearly, the stakes are high. There is a real opportunity of extending the already existing highly inter-disciplinary theory in substantial ways and making an even bigger impact. Considering this and the enthusiasm of the researchers who have agreed to be participants in this program, Federico Echenique, Nicole Immorlica and I have launched the project of publishing a comprehensive volume of contributed chapters on this topic. More information on this will be coming soon.</p></div>

Joseph Wedderburn and Leonard Dickson proved Wedderburn’s “Little” Theorem: that every finite ring with the zero-product property is a field. Which of them proved it first is hard to tell.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss the issue of finding simple proofs for simple facts—not just Wedderburn’s theorem but the zero-product property on which it leans.</p>
<p>
Dickson was a professor at the University of Chicago when Wedderburn visited on a Carnegie Fellowship in 1904–05. To <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn's_little_theorem#History">judge</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0CApaWJwry8C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;lpg=PA318&amp;dq=In+pursuit+of+the+finite+division+algebra+theorem+and+beyond&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=esoyfvVJAl&amp;sig=ACfU3U0N05-c467jVhDz1ElYLcsE4e_9Og&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRvPv41_3fAhVOnuAKHdy3DgcQ6AEwBXoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=In pursuit of the finite division algebra theorem and beyond&amp;f=false">from</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=O7R-DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=wedderburn+dickson+proofs&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VdkQrceyrN&amp;sig=ACfU3U3u7Qn3ibDSszBPg0AitsrXUNUZpA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixkqzl0f3fAhWMTt8KHVo9DVgQ6AEwBnoECAUQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wedderburn dickson proofs&amp;f=false">several</a> <a href="https://api.research-repository.uwa.edu.au/portalfiles/portal/9699048/BambergPenttilaRevised.pdf">sources</a>, what happened is that Wedderburn first claimed a proof. Dickson did not believe the <em>result</em> and tried to build a counterexample. Instead he found a lemma that convinced him it was true and used it to give a simpler proof. They gave back-to-back presentations on 20 January, 1905, Wedderburn wrote up his paper with his proof and two more based on the lemma, which Wedderburn ascribed to an earlier paper by George Birkhoff and Harry Vandiver. Dickson wrote a paper with his approach, saying in a footnote:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> First proved by Wedderburn … Following my simpler proof above, and using the same lemma, Wedderburn constructed two further simpler proofs. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
However, Wedderburn’s first proof was found to have a gap. As <a href="https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/lag/man/099.pdf">detailed</a> by Michael Adam and Birte Specht, the gap was a statement that was not false <em>per se</em> but whose vague argument used only properties from a class of weaker structures in which it can fail. So:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Who first proved the theorem? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Proofs, Other Properties </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our sources linked above differ on whether the gap was noticed at the time or anytime before Emil Artin remarked on it in 1927. Artin didn’t discuss the gap but gave his own proof instead. There <a>seems</a> <a href="https://www.theoremoftheday.org/Docs/WedderburnShamil.pdf">to</a> <a href="https://ysharifi.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/wedderburns-little-theorem-1/">be</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedderburn's_little_theorem#Proof">consensus</a> that the “proof from the Book” was <a href="http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~hfinkeln/seminarium/eindige_delingsring_is_lichaam.pdf">given</a> by Ernst Witt four years later in 1931. But two other proofs, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2311457?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">by</a> Israel Herstein and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/glasgow-mathematical-journal/article/grouptheoretic-proof-of-a-theorem-of-maclaganwedderburn/7BBA5D9EA9EDEE000BAE4859EDE64DA6">by</a> Hans Zassenhaus, receive prominent mention. </p>
<p>
As our sources attest, interest in finding other proofs continues. The surprise in the theorem, which is that finiteness and the zero-product property force the multiplication to be commutative, informs what happens in other mathematical structures. Proofs that draw on results about these structures create connections among many areas. The shortest proof drawing on deeper results was a two-page <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2312328">paper</a> in the summer 1964 <em>Monthly</em> by Theodore Kaczynski (of <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/unabomber">ill</a> <a href="https://www.biography.com/news/unabomber-ted-kaczynski-today">note</a>). We won’t try to compare all these proofs, but will try to flip the question by focusing on the other property involved—the zero-product property:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Ccdot+b+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a \cdot b = 0}" class="latex" title="{a \cdot b = 0}" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a = 0}" class="latex" title="{a = 0}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b = 0}" class="latex" title="{b = 0}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Given a ring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> with this property, how easy is it to prove? If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> has inverses then it is immediate, else multiplying both sides of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5Ccdot+b+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a\cdot b = 0}" class="latex" title="{a\cdot b = 0}" /> by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a^{-1}}" class="latex" title="{a^{-1}}" /> in front and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b^{-1}}" class="latex" title="{b^{-1}}" /> in back would yield the contradiction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1 = 0}" class="latex" title="{1 = 0}" />. And we know if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> is finite then this property makes it a field. So our quest for a different angle leads us to thinking about infinite rings. </p>
<p>
Incidentally, a ring with the zero-product property is called a <em>domain</em>. If the multiplication is commutative then it is an <em>integral domain</em>, though Serge Lang preferred the term <em>entire ring</em>. Our example goes beyond the integers though.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> No Zero-Divisors I </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A natural example that arises is the ring of integer polynomials over multiple variables. Thus for two variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%2Cy%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x,y}" class="latex" title="{x,y}" /> the elements of this ring are 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+c_%7Bij%7Dx%5E%7Bi%7Dy%5E%7Bj%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{i,j} c_{ij}x^{i}y^{j}. " /></p>
<p>It is easy to see that they form a ring with the usual high school rules for adding and multiplying polynomials. The ring is an integral domain in general.</p>
<p>
To show this, we claim that it has no zero-divisors. Suppose that it does: let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29+%5Ccdot+g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y) \cdot g(x,y) = 0}" />. Then let 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+f_%7Bk%7D%28x%29+y%5E%7Bk%7D%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = \sum_{k} f_{k}(x) y^{k}, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f(x,y) = \sum_{k} f_{k}(x) y^{k}, " /></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28x%2Cy%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%7D+g_%7Bk%7D%28x%29+y%5E%7Bk%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  g(x,y) = \sum_{k} g_{k}(x) y^{k}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  g(x,y) = \sum_{k} g_{k}(x) y^{k}. " /></p>
<p>Assume that the maximum degree in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{f(x,y)}" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{df}" class="latex" title="{df}" /> and is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bdg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{dg}" class="latex" title="{dg}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{g(x,y)}" />. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{df}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{df}(x)}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g_{df}(x)}" class="latex" title="{g_{df}(x)}" /> are both non-zero polynomials in one variable. It is clear by induction that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bdf%7D%28x%29+%5Ccdot+g_%7Bdg%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{df}(x) \cdot g_{dg}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{df}(x) \cdot g_{dg}(x)}" /> is not zero. This proves the claim.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> No Zero-Divisors II </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The trouble with the above property of polynomials is that it is only about formal objects. In many applications to computer science we want to view polynomials as objects that can be evaluated. So a natural issue is a slightly different property: Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(x,y,\dots)}" class="latex" title="{F(x,y,\dots)}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28x%2Cy%2C%5Cdots%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G(x,y,\dots)}" class="latex" title="{G(x,y,\dots)}" /> are two integral polynomials. Suppose further that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28a%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%29+%5Ccdot+G%28a%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(a,b,\dots) \cdot G(a,b,\dots) = 0, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(a,b,\dots) \cdot G(a,b,\dots) = 0, " /></p>
<p>for all integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%2Cb%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a,b,\dots}" class="latex" title="{a,b,\dots}" />. Then it clearly must be the case that either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F=0}" class="latex" title="{F=0}" /> identically or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G=0}" class="latex" title="{G=0}" /> identically. Right?</p>
<p>
The trouble is that this seems to be obvious but how do we prove that it is true? Note, it must be the case that some use of the fact that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> are polynomials. The fact is not true for more complex functions. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+x%29+%5Ccdot+%5Csin%28%5Cpi+x%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \cos(\pi x) \cdot \sin(\pi x) = 0, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \cos(\pi x) \cdot \sin(\pi x) = 0, " /></p>
<p>for all integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. But neither the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccos%28%5Cpi+x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cos(\pi x)}" class="latex" title="{\cos(\pi x)}" /> nor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csin%28%5Cpi+x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sin(\pi x)}" class="latex" title="{\sin(\pi x)}" /> is identically zero for all integers.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Proof </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is a relatively simple proof of the fact. It uses the famous Schwarz-Zippel (SZ) Theorem. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">here</a> for our discussion of the theorem. </p>

The S-Z lemma of course has manifest applications throughout complexity theory. Often it is used in design of randomized algorithms. What we found interesting is that here we use it for a different purpose: to prove a structural property of polynomials.</p>
<p>
Back to our fact. Assume that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28a%2Cb%29+%5Ccdot+G%28a%2Cb%29+%3D+0%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(a,b) \cdot G(a,b) = 0, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(a,b) \cdot G(a,b) = 0, " /></p>
<p>for all integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a \in S}" class="latex" title="{a \in S}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb+%5Cin+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b \in S}" class="latex" title="{b \in S}" /> for some finite set. Now either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28a%2C+b%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(a, b)=0}" class="latex" title="{F(a, b)=0}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%28a%2C+b%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G(a, b)=0}" class="latex" title="{G(a, b)=0}" /> must be true for at least one half of the values in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS+%5Ctimes+S%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S \times S}" class="latex" title="{S \times S}" />. Assume that it is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. Then by the S-Z theorem it must be that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F=0}" class="latex" title="{F=0}" /> always if the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> is large enough. Therefore, the fact is proved.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is there a simpler proof of this key fact? Is it possible to find an easier reference in the literature of this basic fact of polynomials? We have yet to discover one—any help would be appreciated.</p>

As Lance Tweeted, and I will re-iterate, nominations for the following prizes<br />
are due soon and you can nominate people <a href="https://sigact.org/articles/prizes.html">here</a><br />
<br />
Godel Prize for outstanding paper in TCS. (Godel mentioned P vs NP in a letter to Von Neumann. I've heard it said that its too bad they didn't work on it-- either it would be solved or we'd know its hard. Frankly, I think enough smart people have worked on it that we already know its hard.)<br />
<br />
Knuth Prize for outstanding contributions to foundations of Computer Science. (its a greater honor to have a prize  named after you in your lifetime then to win a prize!)<br />
<br />
Dijkstra Prize (I wonder if having `ijk' in his name inspired him to work in algorithms)<br />
<br />
Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award.<br />
<br />
Lawler Award for Humanitarian Contributions within CS and Informatics.<br />
<br />
ACM Distinguished Service Award<br />
<br />
Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award (best student paper at STOC)<br />
<br />
The Best Paper award (Best paper at STOC, Best paper at FOCS)<br />
<br />
(The last two I doubt you can nominate someone for.)<br />
<br />
A few thoughts on the Godel Prize:<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
1) You can win the Godel Prize twice and some people have: Goldwasser, Hastad, Arora, Szegedy, Spielman, Teng. Spielman-Teng have won it as a team twice.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
2) GLAD there is no limit to how many can win. If a paper has a lot of people on it (and this has happened) then FINE, they're all winners! According to The Big Bang Theory (the TV show, not the theory) in Physics at most 3 can win a Nobel Prize in Physics for the same breakthrough in a given year. The show itself shows how stupid the policy is.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
3) I either knew and forgot or never knew that DPDA Equiv is decidable! Glad to now it just in time for teaching Automata theory this spring.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
4) Looking over the list reminded me that there are some papers in the intersection of those I want to read and those I am able to read! Though not many. Most I want to read but they seem hard.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
5) The Kanellakis award is for theory that is PRACTICAL. Could someone win a Godel AND a Kannellakis award for the same paper (or set of papers). I found one sort-of case ( (a) below) and one definite case ( (b) below).</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
a) Moshe and Wolpert won the 2000 Godel Prize for Temporal Logic and Finite Automata (I should also read that before my class starts)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Holtzmann, Kurshan, Vardi, and Wolpert won the 2005 Kanellakis prize for Formal Verification Tools.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I assume the two works are related.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
b) Freund and Schapire won the 2003 Godel Prize and the 2004 Kanellakis Award, both for their work on boosting in Machine Learning.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
6) Why is it the  Godel <i>Prize </i>and the Kanellakis <i>Award? </i>What is the diff between a prize and an award? A quick Google Search says that an Award is a token of effort and merit, while a Prize is something you win in a competition. I doubt that applies. I suspect they are called Prize and Award from historical accident. Does anyone know?</div>
<div>
<br /></div>

<div class="content">
Polynomial factoring has famous practical algorithms over fields-- finite, rational \&amp; $p$-adic. However, modulo prime powers it gets hard as there is non-unique factorization and a combinatorial blowup ensues. For example, $x^2+p \bmod p^2$ is irreducible, but $x^2+px \bmod p^2$ has exponentially many factors! We present the first randomized poly($\deg f, \log p$) time algorithm to factor a given univariate integral $f(x)$ modulo $p^k$, for a prime $p$ and $k \leq 4$. Thus, we solve the open question of factoring modulo $p^3$ posed in (Sircana, ISSAC'17). 

Our method reduces the general problem of factoring $f(x) \bmod p^k$ to that of {\em root finding} in a related polynomial $E(y) \bmod\langle p^k, \varphi(x)^\ell \rangle$ for some irreducible $\varphi \bmod p$. We could efficiently solve the latter for $k\le4$, by incrementally transforming $E(y)$. Moreover, we discover an efficient and strong generalization of Hensel lifting to lift factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ to those  $\bmod\ p^4$ (if possible). This was previously unknown, as the case of repeated factors of $f(x) \bmod p$ forbids classical Hensel lifting.</div>

<p><em>[Guest post by </em><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/noahmiller"><em>Noah Miller</em></a><em> – a Harvard Physics Ph.D student that took our seminar. Noah’s webpage contains wonderful and extensive notes that can be of interest to computer scientists. –Boaz]</em></p>



<p></p>



<p>(The following blog post serves as an introduction to the following notes:)</p>



<p><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/noahmiller/files/firewall.pdf">Black Holes, Hawking Radiation, and the Firewall</a></p>



<p>There are many different types of “theoretical physicists.” There are theoretical astrophysicists, theoretical condensed matter physicists, and even theoretical biophysicists. However, the general public seems to be most interested in the exploits of what you might call “theoretical high energy theorists.” (Think Stephen Hawking.)</p>



<p>The holy grail for theoretical high energy physicists (who represent only a small fraction of all physicists) would be to find a theory of quantum gravity. As it stands now, physicists have two theories of nature: quantum field theory (or, more specifically, the “Standard Model”) and Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Quantum field theory describes elementary particles, like electrons, photons, quarks, gluons, etc. General relativity describes the force of gravity, which is really just a consequence of the curvature of spacetimes. </p>



<p>Sometimes people like to say that quantum field theory describes “small stuff” like particles, while general relativity describes “big stuff” like planets and stars. This is maybe not the best way to think about it, though, because planets and stars are ultimately just made out of a bunch of quantum particles.</p>



<p>Theoretical physicists are unhappy with having two theories of nature. In order to describe phenomena that depend on both quantum field theory and general relativity, the two theories must be combined in an “ad hoc” way. A so-called “theory of everything,” another name for the currently unknown theory of “quantum gravity,” would hypothetically be able to describe all the phenomena we know about. Just so we’re all on the same page, they don’t even have a fuly worked out hypothesis. (“String theory,” a popular candidate, is still not even a complete “theory” in the normal sense of the word, although it could become one eventually.)</p>



<p>So what should these high energy theoretical physicists do if they want to discover what this theory of quantum gravity is? For the time being, nobody can think up an experiment that would be sensitive to quantum gravitation effects which is feasible with current technology. We are limited to so-called “thought experiments.”</p>



<p>This brings us to Hawking radiation. In the 1970’s, Stephen Hawking considered what would happen to a black hole once quantum field theory was properly taken into account. (Of course, this involved a bit of “ad hoc” reasoning, as mentioned previously.) Hawking found that, much to everybody’s surprise, the black hole evaporated, realeasing energy in the form of “Hawking radiation” (mostly low energy photons). More strangely, this radiation comes out exactly in the spectrum you would expect from something “hot.” For example, imagine heating a piece of metal. At low temperatures, it emits low energy photons invisible to the human eye. Once it gets hotter, it glows red, then yellow, then perhaps eventually blue. The spectrum of light emitted follows a very specific pattern. Amazingly, Hawking found that the radiation which black holes emit follow the exact same pattern. By analogy, they have a temperature too!</p>



<p>This is more profound than you might realize. This is because things which have an temperature should also have an “entropy.” You see, there are two notions of “states” in physics: “microstates” and “macrostates.” A microstate gives you the complete physical information of what comprises a physical system. For example, imagine you have a box of gas, which contains many particles moving in a seemingly random manner. A “microstate” of this box would be a list of all the positions and momenta of every last particle in that box. This would be impossible to measure in pratice. A “macrostate,” on the other hand, is a set of microstates. You may not know what the exact microstate your box of gas is in, but you can measure macroscopic quantities (like the total internal energy, volume, particle number) and consider the set of all possible microstates with those measured quantities.</p>



<p>The “entropy” of a macrostate is the logarithm of the number of possible microstates. If black holes truly are thermodynamic systems with some entropy, that means there should be some “hidden variables” or microstates to the black hole that we currently don’t understand. Perhaps if we understood the microstates of the black hole, we would be much closer to understanding quantum gravity!</p>



<p>However, Hawking also discovered something else. Because the black hole is radiating out energy, its mass will actually decrease as time goes on. Eventually, it should disappear entirely. This means that the information of what went into the black hole will be lost forever.</p>



<p>Physicists did not like this, however, because it seemed to them that the information of what went into the black hole should never be lost. Many physicists believe that the information of what went into the black hole should somehow be contained in the outgoing Hawking radiation, although they do not currently understand how. According to Hawking’s original calculation, the Hawking radiation only depends on a parameters of the black hole (like its mass) and have nothing to do with the many finer details on what went in, the exact “microstate” of what went in.</p>



<p>However, physicists eventually realized a problem with the idea that the black hole releases its information in the form of outgoing Hawking radiation. The problem has to do with quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, it is impossible to clone a qubit. That means that if you threw a qubit in a black hole and then waited for it to eventually come out in the form of Hawking radiation, then the qubit could no longer be “inside” the black hole. However, if Einstein is to be believed, you should also be able to jump into the black hole and see the qubit on the inside. This seems to imply that the qubit is cloned, as it is present on both the inside and outside of the black hole.</p>



<p>Physicists eventually came up with a strange fix called “Black Hole Complementarity” (BHC). According to BHC, according to people outside the black hole, the interior does not exist. Also, according to people who have entered the black hole, the outside ceases to exist. Both descriptions of the world are “correct” because once someone has entered the black hole, they will be unable to escape and compare notes with the person on the outside.</p>



<p>Of course, it must be emphasized that BHC remains highly hypothetical. People have been trying to poke holes in it for a long time. The largest hole is the so called “Firewall Paradox,” first proposed in 2012. Essentially, the Firewall paradox tries to show that the paradigm of BHC is self-contradictory.  In fact, it was able to use basic quantum mechanics to show that, under some reasonable assumptions, the interior of the black hole <em>truly</em> doesn’t exist, and that anyone who tries to enter would be fried at an extremely hot “firewall!” Now, I don’t think most physicists actually believe that black holes really have a firewall (although this might depend on what day of the week you ask them). The interesting thing about the Firewall paradox is that it derives a seemingly crazy result from seemingly harmless starting suppositions. So these suppositions would have to be tweaked in the theory of quantum gravity order to get rid of the firewall.</p>



<p>This is all to say that all this thinking about black holes really might help physicists figure out something about quantum gravity. (Then again, who can really say for sure.)</p>



<p>If you would like to know more about the Firewall paradox, I suggest you read my notes, pasted at the top of this post!</p>



<p>The goal of the notes was to write an introduction to the Black Hole Information Paradox and Firewall Paradox that could be read by computer scientists with no physics background.</p>



<p>The structure of the notes goes as follows:</p>



<ol><li>Special relativity</li><li>General relativity</li><li>Quantum Field Theory (in which I ambitiously tell you what QFT actually is!)</li><li>Statistical Mechanics (this is the best part)</li><li>Hawking radiation</li><li>The information paradox</li></ol>



<p>Because the information paradox touches on all areas of physics, I thought it was necessary to take “zero background, infinite intelligence” approach, introducing the all the necessary branches of physics (GR, QFT, Stat Mech) in order to understand what the deal with Hawking radiation really is, and why physicists think it is so important. I think it is safe to say that if you read these notes, you’ll learn a non-trivial amount of physics.</p></div>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(graph_theory)">orientation</a> of an undirected graph is the directed graph that you get by assigning a direction to each edge. Several kinds of orientations have been studied. For instance, in a graph with even vertex degrees, an Eulerian orientation makes the numbers of incoming and outgoing degrees equal at each vertex. In a bridgeless graph, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_orientation">strong orientation</a> makes the resulting directed graph strongly connected. In finite connected graphs, every Eulerian orientation is strong, but that is untrue in infinite graphs. Consider, for instance, the graph of unit distances on the integers, which is Eulerian (every vertex has degree two) but has no strong orientation (every edge is a bridge). Even when a strong orientation exists, an Eulerian orientation might not be strong: the graph of distance-1 and distance-2 integers, with the orientation from smaller to larger numbers, is Eulerian but not strong. So when does an Eulerian strong orientation exist? The answer turns out to be: whenever the obvious obstacles are not present. Every bridgeless connected even-degree infinite graph has an Eulerian strong orientation.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/euler-not-strong.svg" alt="For infinite graphs, Eulerian orientations might not be strong" /></p>

<p>To prove this, we can use a convenient tool for dealing with infinite orientations by looking only at finite graphs, a result of Rado from 1949 that is simultaneously a predecessor and generalization of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(graph_theory)">De Bruijn–Erdős theorem on graph colorings</a>. Suppose each element in some infinite set  has a finite set of labels, and we choose an assignment of labels for each finite subset of . These choices may be inconsistent with each other, so there may be no way of labeling all of  consistently with all of the choices. But Rado proved (assuming the axiom of choice) that there exists a global labeling that, on every finite subset, is consistent with the assignment to one of its finite supersets. Another way of thinking about this is that if certain finite patterns must be avoided, and every finite subset has a labeling that avoids them, then some global labeling will also avoid them.<sup id="fnref:rado"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:rado" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The De Bruijn–Erdős theorem is the case where the elements are vertices, the labels are colors, and the patterns to be avoided are pairs of equal color on adjacent vertices. In our case the set elements will be edges, the labels will be which way to orient each edge, and the choice of assignment will be some way of defining a “good” orientation for finite subgraphs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/graph-labels.svg" alt="Graph vertices can be labeled by color; edges, by orientation" /></p>

<p>So suppose we’re given a finite subgraph  of an infinite 2-edge-connected even-degree graph. What kind of orientation on  should we look for? A complication is that  might have bridges or odd-degree vertices. So we’ll try to come as close as we can to what we want, an Eulerian strong orientation, while taking those deficiencies into account. Let’s define a good orientation of  to be an orientation that is almost Eulerian, in that at each vertex the in-degree and out-degree differ by at most one, and almost strong, in that each edge of  that belongs to an undirected cycle also belongs to a directed cycle. Another way of stating the almost strong condition is that the strongly connected components of the oriented graph should coincide with the 2-edge-connected components, or blocks, of the undirected graph.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/good-orientation.svg" alt="A good orientation of a graph" /></p>

<p>The existence of a good orientation of an arbitrary finite undirected graph (also having some other stronger properties) was proven in the 1960s by Nash-Williams.<sup id="fnref:nw"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:nw" class="footnote">2</a></sup> But now Rado’s method proves that every infinite graph also has a good orientation. If we find a global orientation that’s nearly-Eulerian on a supergraph of the star of neighbors of every vertex, then it must be nearly-Eulerian. And if it’s almost strong on a supergraph of every cycle, then it must be almost strong. This proves the theorem that a bridgeless connected even-degree infinite graph has an Eulerian strong orientation, because every good orientation in these graphs must be Eulerian and strong. Nash-Williams already considered the infinite case of his orientation theorem, but wrote that the details were too heavy to include. Perhaps he didn’t know about Rado’s theorem (despite it being published in the same journal), which makes the extension from finite to infinite easy.</p>

<p>The same method of extending finite to infinite orientations can also be used to study notions of graph sparseness including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboricity">arboricity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a>, and pseudoarboricity. Historically the pseudoarboricity of infinite graphs was first. A graph has pseudoarboricity at most  if it can be oriented so that each vertex has out-degree  (or equivalently if it can be partitioned into subgraphs each with out-degree one). In the 1950 paper in which he first announced the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem, Erdős used it to prove that, when such an orientation is given, the resulting graph can be -colored.<sup id="fnref:e"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/17/orientations-infinite-graphs.html#fn:e" class="footnote">3</a></sup> But he didn’t write about the conditions under which such an orientation exists. Rado’s theorem shows that they are the same as in the finite case: an outdegree- orientation exists if and only if every finite -vertex subgraph has at most  edges.</p>

<p>A graph has degeneracy at most  if it has an acyclic orientation so that each vertex has out-degree . Unlike in the finite case, infinite graphs with low degeneracy might have high minimum degree; for instance, there exist graphs with degeneracy one in which all vertices have infinite degree. A finite -degenerate graph can be -colored greedily, and the De Bruijn–Erdős theorem shows that even in the infinite case such a coloring exists. Rado’s theorem shows that infinite graphs with pseudoarboricity  are -degenerate, and that a graph is -degenerate if and only if every finite subgraph has a vertex with degree at most . As in the case of Eulerian strong orientations, this involves checking the orientation only on two kinds of finite subgraphs, stars and cycles.</p>

<p>Arboricity is based on forests and there are multiple incompatible definitions of infinite forests. But the one we want to use is that a forest is a 1-degenerate graph. A graph has arboricity  if its edges can be partitioned into  forests. This is clearly at least as large as the degeneracy (no Rado needed). Rado’s theorem shows that infinite graphs with arboricity  are -degenerate, and that a graph has arboricity at most  if and only if every finite -vertex subset has at most  edges.</p>

<br />Computer scientists tend to obsess about privacy and we've had a privacy/security debate for decades now. But now machine learning has really given us a whole new spin on what privacy protects and takes away.<br />
<div>
<br />
I take an open approach and basically allow Google to know everything about my life. Google knows where I've been--sometimes my Pixel asks me which store in a shopping center I visited and I give up that info. Google knows who I communicate with, what websites I visit, what music and movies I listen to and watch, all my photos, what temperature makes me comfortable and so on.<br />
<br />
What do I get? A Google ecosystem that knows me sometimes better than I know myself. Google works best when it learns and integrates. I get asked to download maps for trips Google knows I'm about to take. I have Google assistant throughout my house, in my phone, in my car and it tailor answers and sometimes even the questions that I need answers to. If anything I wish there was further integration, like Google Voice should ring my office phone only when I'm in the office.<br />
<br />
Georgia Tech now forces us to use Microsoft Exchange for email. Outlook is not a bad email program but its capabilities, especially for search, does not work as well and think of all that unused knowledge.<br />
<br />
I trust Google to keep my information safe, with a random password and 2-factor encryption and even if someone would manage to break in they would find I'm a pretty boring person with an unhealthy obsession of opera (the musical form not the browser).<br />
<br />
Doesn't work for everyone and companies should make it easy to keep your info secure. But I say go use your machine learning on me and find ways to make my life easier and more fun, and sure send me some targeted ads as payment. The Internets will find a way to discover you anyway, might as well take advantage. </div></div>

We demonstrate a lower bound technique for linear decision lists, which are decision lists where the queries are arbitrary linear threshold functions.
We use this technique to prove an explicit lower bound by showing that any linear decision list computing the function $MAJ \circ XOR$ requires size $2^{0.18 n}$.  This completely answers an open question of Tur{\'a}n and Vatan [FoCM'97]. We also show that the spectral classes $PL_1, PL_\infty$, and the polynomial threshold function classes $\widehat{PT}_1, PT_1$,  are incomparable to linear decision lists.</div>

An $(n,k,\ell)$-vector MDS code is a $\mathbb{F}$-linear subspace of $(\mathbb{F}^\ell)^n$ (for some field $\mathbb{F}$) of dimension $k\ell$, such that any $k$ (vector) symbols of the codeword suffice to determine the remaining $r=n-k$ (vector) symbols. The length $\ell$ of each codeword symbol is called the sub-packetization of the code. Such a code is called minimum storage regenerating (MSR), if any single symbol of a codeword can be recovered by downloading $\ell/r$ field elements (which is known to be the least possible) from each of the other symbols.

MSR codes are attractive for use in distributed storage systems, and by now a variety of ingenious constructions of MSR codes are available. However, they all suffer from exponentially large sub-packetization of at least $r^{k/r}$. Our main result is an almost tight lower bound showing that for an MSR code, one must have $\ell \ge \exp(\Omega(k/r))$. Previously, a lower bound of $\approx \exp(\sqrt{k/r})$, and a tight lower bound for a restricted class of optimal access MSR codes, were known. Our work settles a key question concerning MSR codes that has received much attention, with a short proof hinging on one key definition that is somewhat inspired by Galois theory.</div>

<p>For the new year, I’ve decided to try to get back into taking photos more frequently, and to make it lower-overhead I’m making individual Mastodon posts for some of them rather than writing a longer blog post for every batch of photos. So that’s why you see a couple of those images inline here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1579272">Fitting in</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@shonk/101320172170027222"></a>). Animated GIF of 124 disks packed (supposedly optimally) on a sphere and then steregraphically projected to the plane, by Clayton Shonkwiler.</p>

The fluids are modeled as power diagrams of systems of discrete points and simulated using methods from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00568">arXiv:1605.00568</a>.

In the area I moderate (cs.DS, algorithms and data structures) the number of preprints grew from 1597 in 2017 to 1767 in 2018, but this was a little below the 14% growth rate for arXiv overall, and was far outpaced by the rapid growth in cs.CV (computer vision), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.CL (natural language processing).</p>

  <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482"><em>Proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2019)</em></a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101373871420970067"></a>). My favorite talk from the first day of SODA was “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.27">Extremal and probabilistic results for order types</a>” (Jie Han, Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, Marcelo T. Sales, and Henrique Stagni).
Its main results are
    <ol>
      <li>the probability that a random point set has a specific order type is upper and lower bounded by functions of the smallest size of a grid containing the order type, and</li>
      <li>every nontrivial hereditary property of point sets has probability  of being true of random point sets.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-demographer-arrests-20190107-story.html">Iran arrests demographers, the latest target amid an escalating crackdown on academics and activists</a> (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101379517186873559"></a>). One of the two arrestees is an Iranian-Australian dual citizen; the other is director of the Iranian National Institute of Population Research. The apparent reason for the arrest is that their research contradicted a political narrative of Iranian hardliners according to which Iran is suffering a population crash and must increase fertility.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The first sighting of one of my Wikipedia illustrations in a SODA talk goes to Michał Włodarczyk’s “<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.104">Losing treewidth by separating subsets</a>” (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101389040748549759"></a>). It concerns removing few graph vertices to reach a subgraph with some desired property. If the optimal solution removes  vertices and graphs with the property have treewidth , then his solution removes  vertices and takes the same time as exactly solving  subproblems of size .</p>

Michael was PC co-chair of <a href="https://simplicityinalgorithms.com/">SOSA</a>, which I was skeptical about (shouldn’t all the best algorithms be simple?), but the session I attended favorably impressed me. Here’s an example, a simple algorithm for <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07460">2-approximating maximum genus oriented graph embedding</a>: greedily remove 2-edge paths while preserving connectivity. .</p>

At the talk, someone asked about finding a maximum set of laminar 3-separators. It’s NP-complete: use Uehara’s “<a href="https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~uehara/pdf/triangle.pdf">NP-complete problems on a 3-connected cubic graph and their applications</a>” to find cubic planar graphs whose -separators are vertex neighborhoods (so laminar separators = neighbors of independent vertices) in which maximum independent set is hard.</p>

    <p>Spotted on the Cambridge University Press display table at SODA (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101402305412043483"></a>):</p>

A game of guiding a marble across a dynamically changing fractal surface. The key is to use the recursive structure of the fractal to make a data structure that can handle the interactions between the marble and the fractal surface quickly enough to run in realtime.</p>
