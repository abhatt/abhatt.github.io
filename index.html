complexity of problems: instead of measuring the running time as a function of
only the input size, we analyze the running time with respect to additional
parameters. This approach has proven to be highly successful in delineating our
understanding of \NP-hard problems. Given this success with the TIME resource,
it seems but natural to use this approach for dealing with the SPACE resource.
First attempts in this direction have considered a few individual problems,
with some success: Fafianie and Kratsch [MFCS'14] and Chitnis et al. [SODA'15]
introduced the notions of streaming kernels and parameterized streaming
algorithms respectively. For example, the latter shows how to refine the
$\Omega(n^2)$ bit lower bound for finding a minimum Vertex Cover (VC) in the
streaming setting by designing an algorithm for the parameterized $k$-VC
problem which uses $O(k^{2}\log n)$ bits.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of graph problems from the
paradigm of parameterized streaming algorithms. We first define a natural
hierarchy of space complexity classes of FPS, SubPS, SemiPS, SupPS and BrutePS,
and then obtain tight classifications for several well-studied graph problems
such as Longest Path, Feedback Vertex Set, Dominating Set, Girth, Treewidth,
etc. into this hierarchy.

clustering, which requires only a single pass. It can process arbitrary amounts
of data in linear time and in constant memory, quickly identifying approximate
clusters. It also exhibits good scalability in the presence of multiple CPU
cores. Yet, RASTER is limited to batch processing. In contrast, S-RASTER is an
adaptation of RASTER to the stream processing paradigm that is able to identify
clusters in evolving data streams. This algorithm retains the main benefits of
its parent algorithm, i.e. single-pass linear time cost and constant memory
requirements for each discrete time step in the sliding window. The sliding
window is efficiently pruned, and clustering is still performed in linear time.
Like RASTER, S-RASTER trades off an often negligible amount of precision for
speed. It is therefore very well suited to real-world scenarios where
clustering does not happen continually but only periodically. We describe the
algorithm, including a discussion of implementation details.

of the NP-hard Stable Roommates with Ties and Incomplete Lists problem, thereby
strengthening earlier results both on the side of parameterized hardness as
well as on the side of fixed-parameter tractability. Other than for its famous
sister problem Stable Marriage which focuses on a bipartite scenario, Stable
Roommates with Incomplete Lists allows for arbitrary acceptability graphs whose
edges specify the possible matchings of each two agents (agents are represented
by graph vertices). Herein, incomplete lists and ties reflect the fact that in
realistic application scenarios the agents cannot bring all other agents into a
linear order. Among our main contributions is to show that it is W[1]-hard to
compute a maximum-cardinality stable matching for acceptability graphs of
bounded treedepth, bounded tree-cut width, and bounded feedback vertex number
(these are each time the respective parameters). However, if we `only' ask for
perfect stable matchings or the mere existence of a stable matching, then we
obtain fixed-parameter tractability with respect to tree-cut width but not with
respect to treedepth. On the positive side, we also provide fixed-parameter
tractability results for the parameter feedback edge set number.

the researchers focus only on the space/time trade-off, and little attention
has been paid to energy consumption. Moreover, most of the efforts in the field
of Green Computing have been devoted to hardware-related issues, being green
software in its infancy. Optimizing the usage of computing resources,
minimizing power consumption or increasing battery life are some of the goals
of this field of research.
</p>
<p>As an attempt to address the most recent sustainability challenges, we must
incorporate the energy consumption as a first-class constraint when designing
new compact data structures. Thus, as a preliminary work to reach that goal, we
first need to understand the factors that impact on the energy consumption and
their relation with compression. In this work, we study the energy consumption
required by several integer vector representations. We execute typical
operations over datasets of different nature. We can see that, as commonly
believed, energy consumption is highly related to the time required by the
process, but not always. We analyze other parameters, such as number of
instructions, number of CPU cycles, memory loads, among others.

minimizes the cost of the edges in the tree plus the penalties of vertices not

a common generalization of the prize-collecting Steiner tree and the
$k$-minimum spanning tree problems. Our main result is a 2-approximation
algorithm, which improves on the currently best known approximation factor of

the primal-dual framework of Goemans and Williamson, and reveals interesting
properties that can be applied to other similar problems.

to compute some auxiliary information of size $S$ that we can find pre-image of
any image with a few queries to the function given as a black box in time $T$.
It is a well-studied problem in the classical settings, however, it is not
clear how a quantum adversary can do better at this task besides invoking
Grover's algorithm. Nayebi et al. proved a lower bound for adversaries
inverting permutations leveraging only quantum queries to the black box. We
give a matching lower bound for functions and permutations where $M = O(N)$,
and allowing adversaries to be fully quantum, and thus resolving the open
question positively raised by Nayebi et al. of whether such lower bound is
achievable for inverters with quantum advice.
</p>
<p>In order to prove these bounds, we also proved a lower bound for a
generalized version of quantum random access code (originally introduced by
Ambainis et al.), i.e. under the setting where the encoding length is variable
and each element can be arbitrarily correlated, which may be of independent
interest.

the least-weight set of edges whose deletion breaks the graph into $k$
connected components. Algorithms due to Karger-Stein and Thorup showed how to
find such a minimum $k$-cut in time approximately $O(n^{2k-2})$. The best lower
bounds come from conjectures about the solvability of the $k$-clique problem
and a reduction from $k$-clique to $k$-cut, and show that solving $k$-cut is
likely to require time $\Omega(n^k)$. Our recent results have given
special-purpose algorithms that solve the problem in time $n^{1.98k + O(1)}$,
and ones that have better performance for special classes of graphs (e.g., for
small integer weights). In this work, we resolve the problem for general
graphs, by showing that for any fixed $k \geq 2$, the Karger-Stein algorithm
outputs any fixed minimum $k$-cut with probability at least $\hat{O}(n^{-k})$,
where $\hat{O}(\cdot)$ hides a $2^{O(\ln \ln n)^2}$ factor. This also gives an
extremal bound of $\hat{O}(n^k)$ on the number of minimum $k$-cuts in an
$n$-vertex graph and an algorithm to compute a minimum $k$-cut in similar
runtime. Both are tight up to $\hat{O}(1)$ factors. The first main ingredient
in our result is a fine-grained analysis of how the graph shrinks---and how the
average degree evolves---under the Karger-Stein process. The second ingredient
is an extremal result bounding the number of cuts of size at most $(2-\delta)
OPT/k$, using the Sunflower lemma.

directed graph G=(V, E) with edge (or vertex) costs, a root vertex r, a set of
q terminals T, and a connectivity requirement k&gt;0; the goal is to find a
minimum-cost subgraph H of G such that H has k internally disjoint paths from
the root r to each terminal t . The k-DST problem is a natural generalization
of the classical Directed Steiner Tree problem (DST) in the fault-tolerant
setting in which the solution subgraph is required to have an r,t-path, for
every terminal t, even after removing k-1 edges or vertices.
</p>
<p>Despite being a classical problem, there are not many positive results on the
problem, especially for the case k &gt;= 3. In this paper, we will present an
O(log k log q)-approximation algorithm for k-DST when an input graph is
quasi-bipartite, i.e., when there is no edge joining two non-terminal vertices.
To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the only known non-trivial
approximation algorithm for k-DST, for k &gt;= 3, that runs in polynomial-time
regardless of the structure of the optimal solution. In addition, our algorithm
is tight for every constant k, due to the hardness result inherited from the
Set Cover problem.

postset (consuming its tokens) and it is (extended) free-choice (EFC) if the
postsets of any two places are either equal or disjoint. Asymmetric choice (AC)
extends EFC such that two places may also have postsets where one is contained
in the other. In reduced AC nets this containment is limited: If the postsets
are neither disjoint nor equal, one is a singleton and the other has exactly
two transitions. The aim of Petri net synthesis is to find an unlabeled Petri
net in some target class with a reachability graph isomorphic to a given finite
labeled transition system (lts). Choice-free nets have strong properties,
allowing to often easily detect when synthesis will fail or at least to quicken
the synthesis. With EFC as the target class, only few properties can be checked
ahead and there seem to be no short cuts lowering the complexity of the
synthesis (compared to arbitrary Petri nets). For AC nets no synthesis
procedure is known at all. We show here how synthesis to a superclass of
reduced AC nets (not containing the full AC net class) can be done.

<div class="content">
We prove an easy-witness lemma ($\ewl$) for unambiguous non-deterministic verfiers. We show that if $\utime(t)\subset\mathcal{C}$, then for every $L\in\utime(t)$, for every $\utime(t)$ verifier $V$ for $L$, and for every $x\in L$, there is a certificate $y$ satisfing $V(x,y)=1$, that can be encoded as a truth-table of a $\mathcal{C}$ circuit. Our technique is simple compared to the $\ntime$ $\ewl$s \cite{IKW02,Wil-ES13,MW18}, and yields fine-grained results in terms of the time and size parameters. It also works for all {\it typical} non-uniform circuit classes without any additional machinery. Using this $\ewl$ we prove a Karp-Lipton \cite{KL80} style theorem ($\klt$) for $\uexp$. We show that $\uexp\subset\size(poly)\implies\uexp=\ma$. We also prove similar $\ewl$ and $\klt$ for $\uexp\cap\couexp$ and $\fewexp$.

Circuit lower bound techniques that entail natural properties of Razborov and Rudich \cite{RR97} are called natural, and are known to contradict widely believed cryptographic assumptions in the course of proving strong lower bounds. Thus attempts have been made to understand un-natural techniques. Natural properties satisfy three conditions: usefulness, constructiveness, and largeness. Usefulness is unavoidable in any lower-bound technique. In \cite{Wil-NP16,Ig13} it was shown that obtaining $\nexp$ lower bounds is equivalent to obtaining $\pt$-constructive (with $\log n$ advice) properties.

In this paper we consider properties that avoid largeness. We introduce a new notion called unique properties, which is opposite to natural properties in the sense of largeness. A unique property contains exactly one element of each input length (that is a power of 2). We show that $\pt$-constructivity and uniqueness (opposite of largeness) both are unavoidable for certain lower bounds. We prove, $\uexp\cap\couexp\not\subset\mathcal{C}$ if and only if there is a $\pt$-constructive unique property against $\mathcal{C}$. We also establish equivalences between lower bounds against $\uexp$ (with and without advice), and the existence of different restrictions of $\pt$-constructive unique properties that use advice. 

The ``derandomization (of $\bpp$) from uniform/non-uniform lower bounds for $\Gamma$'' type of results are known for $\Gamma=\expo,\nexp,\nexp\cap\conexp,\rexp$ \cite{NW94,BFNW93,IW01,IKW02,Wil-NP16}. Using the above equivalences we obtain a super-set of these results that also includes the classes $\uexp,\uexp\cap\couexp,\zpexp$.  

One important application of the $\nexp$ $\ewl$ and $\klt$ is the connection between fast ($\sat$ and learning) algorithms and $\nexp$ lower bounds \cite{Wil-ES13,FK09,Ig13}. Using our $\utime$ $\ewl$ and $\klt$ we derive connections between fast unambiguous algorithms and $\utime$ lower bounds. Finally we show results that generalize the lower bound frameworks -- that work only for unrestricted Boolean circuits -- such that they work for any restricted typical circuit class. This will help us to get lower bounds against any typical circuit class from fast algorithms that work for that particular class (and not for the super-class of unrestricted Boolean circuits).</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Consider the following heuristic for building a decision tree for a function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{\pm 1\}$.  Place the most influential variable $x_i$ of $f$ at the root, and recurse on the subfunctions $f_{x_i=0}$ and $f_{x_i=1}$ on the left and right subtrees respectively; terminate once the tree is an $\varepsilon$-approximation of $f$.   We analyze the quality of this heuristic, obtaining near-matching upper and lower bounds:  

$\circ$ Upper bound: For every $f$ with decision tree size $s$ and every $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$, this heuristic builds a decision tree of size at most $s^{O(\log(s/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))}$. 

$\circ$ Lower bound: For every $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$ and $s \le 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$, there is an $f$ with decision tree size $s$ such that this heuristic builds a decision tree of size $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log s)}$. 

We also obtain upper and lower bounds for monotone functions: $s^{O(\sqrt{\log s}/\varepsilon)}$ and $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt[4]{\log s }
)}$ respectively.  The lower bound disproves conjectures of Fiat and Pechyony (2004) and Lee (2009).

Our upper bounds yield new algorithms for properly learning decision trees under the uniform distribution.  We show that these algorithms---which are motivated by widely employed and empirically successful top-down decision tree learning heuristics such as ID3, C4.5, and CART---achieve provable guarantees that compare favorably with those of the current fastest algorithm (Ehrenfeucht and Haussler, 1989), and even have certain qualitative advantages. Our lower bounds shed new light on the limitations of these heuristics. 

Finally, we revisit the classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler.  We extend it to give the first uniform-distribution proper learning algorithm that achieves polynomial sample and memory complexity, while matching its state-of-the-art quasipolynomial runtime.</div>

Xuejun Yang is a Senior Staff Engineer at FutureWei Technologies. He is the DFA on the 2011 <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">paper</a>, “Finding and Understanding Bugs in C Compilers.”</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss a clever idea from that paper.</p>
<p>
The paper was brought to our attention just now in a meaty <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/21/a-polemical-overreach/#comment-106276">comment</a> by Paul D. We thank him for it—the topic interests both of us. We don’t think Paul D. means to be anonymous, but in keeping with that we’ll give just a cryptic hint to his identity: The saying “a man on the make” is widely known, but for more than the millennium he has been the unique person in the world to whom it applies literally.  <b>Update 11/20</b>: Turns out we (I, Ken) were wrong about the identity, see <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/19/a-clever-way-to-find-compiler-bugs/#comment-106348">this</a>.</p>
<p>
Yang was made unique by being listed out of alphabetical order on the paper. This is notable because the most common practice in our field is to list alphabetically irrespective of prominence. Hence we’ve invented the term ‘DFA’ for “Designated” or “Distinguished” First Author. The other authors are Yang Chen, Eric Eide, and John Regehr, all from the University of Utah. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Topic </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Paul D.’s comment notes that there was evidence that verification methods could improve compiler correctness. By <i>compiler</i> we mean the program that transforms high level code into machine code. These programs are used countless times every day and their correctness is clearly very important. </p>
<p>
Their correctness is tricky for several reasons. The main one is that almost all compilers try to optimize code. That is when they transform code into instructions they try to rewrite or rearrange the instructions to yield better performance. Compilers have been doing this forever. The trouble is that changing instructions to increase performance is dangerous. The changes must not affect the values that are computed. If they are not done carefully they can actually make the answers faster, but incorrect. This is the reason correctness is tricky.</p>
<p>
Formal verification requires a lot of effort. The highest effort should go into mission-critical software. But compilers are mission-critical <em>already</em>, unless we know mission-critical software won’t be compiled on a particular one. Hence it is notable when formal verification makes a compiler more reliable. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The idea in the paper Paul referenced is quite elegant. They built a program called Csmith. It operates as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> is a compiler they wish to test. Then generate various legal C programs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />. For each of these let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> be the answer that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" title="{X(P)}" /> yields. Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" title="{X(P)}" /> is the compiled program. Then check whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is correct. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
For example:  </p>
<pre>int foo (void) { 
    signed char x = 1; 
    unsigned char y = 255; 
    return x &gt; y; 
} 
</pre>
<p>
Some compilers returned <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, but the correct answer is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" />. There are further examples in a 2012 companion <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi12-preprint.pdf">paper</a> and these <a href="https://www.flux.utah.edu/download?uid=115&amp;slides=1&amp;type=pptx">slides</a> from an earlier version. The Csmith <a href="https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/">homepage</a> has long lists of compiler bugs they found. </p>
<p>
Of course if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" title="{X(P)}" /> crashes or refuse to compile <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> then the compiler is wrong. But what happens if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is computed. How does Csmith know if the answer is correct? This seems to be really hard. This correctness testing must be automated: the whole approach is based on allowing tons of random programs to be tested. They cannot assume that humans will be used to check the outputs.</p>
<p>
This is the clever idea of this paper. They assume that there are at least two compilers say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. Then let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> be the output of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X(P)}" class="latex" title="{X(P)}" /> and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> be the output of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%28P%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y(P)}" class="latex" title="{Y(P)}" />. The key insight is: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is not equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />, then one of the compilers is wrong</b>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A very neat and elegant idea. For software in general it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_testing">differential</a> <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.83.445">testing</a>. </p>
<p>
This at least alerts when there are problems with some compilers and some programs. One can use this trick to discover programs that cause at least some compilers to have problems. This is extremely valuable. It allowed Csmith to discover hundreds of errors in production compilers—errors that previously were missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Smart Fuzzing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">Fuzzing</a> is defined by Wikipedia as testing by “providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to a computer program.” An early historical example, Apple’s “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_testing">Monkey</a>” program, worked completely randomly. To ensure that the found bugs are <em>meaningful</em> and <em>analyzable</em>, Csmith needed a deeper, structured, “intelligent” design, not just the generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhem_(advertising_character)">Mayhem</a>.</p>
<p>
For one, Csmith needed to avoid programs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> than do not have deterministic behavior. The formal C standards itemize cases in which compilers are allowed to have arbitrary, even self-inconsistent, behavior. There are lots of them in C. A bug with dubious code could be dismissed out of hand.</p>
<p>
For another, the probability that a program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> built haphazardly by the original Csmith version would reveal bugs was observed to peak at about 80KB source-code size, about 1,000 lines across multiple pages. Those don’t make great examples. So Csmith has its own routines to compress bug instances it has found. Simple tricks are shortening numerical expressions to use only the bug-sensitive parts. Others are lifting local variables out of blocks and bypassing pointer jumps.</p>
<p>
A third goal is that the generator should branch out to all aspects of the language—in this case, C—not just the “grungy” parts that are ripe for finding compiler bugs. The paper talks about this at length. Regehr, who was Yang’s advisor, is also a blogger. His current <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1700">post</a>, dated November 4, is titled, “Helping Generative Fuzzers Avoid Looking Only Where the Light is Good, Part 1.” We guess that “Part 2” will go even more into details.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Formal Methods as Bugscreen </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Regarding the formally-verified CompCert compiler, Paul D. quoted from the <a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~regehr/papers/pldi11-preprint.pdf">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The striking thing about our CompCert results is that the middle-end bugs we found in all other compilers are absent. As of early 2011, the under-development version of CompCert is the only compiler we have tested for which Csmith cannot find wrong-code errors. This is not for lack of trying: we have devoted about six CPU-years to the task. The apparent unbreakability of CompCert supports a strong argument that developing compiler optimizations within a proof framework, where safety checks are explicit and machine-checked, has tangible benefits for compiler users. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This August 2019 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09334.pdf">paper</a> by Michaël Marcozzi, Qiyi Tang, Alastair Donaldson, and Cristian Cadar gives recent results involving Csmith and other tools. They have an interesting discussion on page 2, from which we excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In our experience working in the area […], we have found compiler fuzzing to be a contentious topic. Research talks on compiler fuzzing are often followed by questions about the importance of the discovered bugs, and whether compiler fuzzers might be improved by taking inspiration from bugs encountered by users of compilers “in the wild.” Some … argue that any miscompilation bug, whether fuzzer-found or not, is a ticking bomb that should be regarded as severe, or avoided completely via formal verification (in the spirit of CompCert). </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
They go on to say, however, that when a fully-developed compiler is used for non-critical software, the kinds of bugs typically found by fuzzing tend to have questionable importance. Their paper is titled, “A Systematic Impact Study for Fuzzer-Found Compiler Bugs.” </p>
<p>
So far they have found definite results that seem to have mixed implications. In their future-work section they note that they have evaluated the impact of bugs in compilers on the intended function of programs they compile, but not on possible security holes—which as we noted in our Cloudflare <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/03/08/is-computer-security-possible/">post</a> can come from (misuse of) simple code that is completely correct. This leads us further to wonder, coming full-circle, whether formal methods might help quantify the relative importance of aspects of a language and areas of a compiler to guide more-intelligent generation of test cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>
The above comment is interesting, but perhaps finding obscure bugs is important. Perhaps such bugs could be used to attack systems. That is perhaps some one could use them to break into a system. Security may be compromised by any error, even an unlikely one to occur in the wild. </p>
<p>
What do you think?</p>

<p><em>By David Eppstein &amp; Vijay Vazirani</em></p>
<p>No, not to make theoreticians rich! Besides, who will buy your papers anyway? (Quite the opposite, you will be lucky if you can convince someone to take them for free, just for sake of publicity!) What we are proposing is a market in which no money changes hands – a matching market – for matching papers to conferences.</p>
<p>First, a short preamble on how the idea emerged.</p>
<p><strong>Preamble</strong> (by Vijay):  Soon after my recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLr6Ud5qmt4&amp;t=74s"><u>Simons talk</u></a> on Matching Markets, I sent its url to Al Roth. Obviously, I wasn’t expecting a return email. However, the perfect gentleman and ultimate scholar that Al is, he did reply, and mentioned that he did not like my “definition” of matching markets and said, “I guess I would say matching markets are markets because they aggregate information that is held by the participants, which is what markets do (even if they don’t use prices to do it..).” This hit me like lightening from the sky – suddenly it crystallized the innate intuition about markets which I had formed through work on algorithmic aspects of markets! I thanked Al profusely and added, “This definitely helps in me get the right perspective on the notion!”</p>
<p>About a week ago, while updating my talk for a seminar at Columbia University, I included this beautiful insight in it and then a thought occurred: Each PC meeting involves aggregation of information from a large number of agents: PC members as well as external experts. Hence, isn’t a conference a matching market? Excitedly, I sent this question to Al. He replied, “… the conference process, matching papers to conferences, is a market and a particular conference might be a marketplace … ”</p>
<p>When I returned home, my esteemed colleague, David Eppstein, stunned me by declaring that he had thought of a market relevant to our field in which no money changes hands. I immediately knew he was thinking of the conference process. But he got to it out of the blue … and not the long process it took me!</p>
<p><strong>Back to the idea:  </strong>In the past, matching markets have brought immense efficiency and order in allocation problems in which use of money is considered repugnant, the prime examples being matching medical residents to hospitals, kidney exchange, and assignment of students of a large city to its schools.</p>
<p>At present we are faced with massive inefficiencies in the conference process – numerous researchers are trapped in unending cycles of submit … get reject … incorporate comments … resubmit — often to the next deadline which has been conveniently arranged a couple of days down the road so the unwitting participants are conditioned into mindlessly keep coming back for more, much like Pavlov’s dog.</p>
<p>We are proposing a matching market approach to finally obliterate this madness. We believe such a market is feasible using the following ideas. No doubt our scheme will have some drawbacks; however, as should be obvious, the advantages far outweigh them.</p>
<p>First, for co-located symposia within a larger umbrella conference, such as the<br />
conferences within ALGO or FCRC, the following process should be a no-brainer:</p>
<p>1). Ensure a common deadline for all symposia; denote the latter by <em>S.</em></p>
<p>2). Let <em>R</em> denote the set of researchers who wish to submit one paper to a symposium in this umbrella conference – assume that researchers submitting more than one paper will have multiple names, one for each submission. Each researcher will provide a strict preference order over the subset of symposia to which they wish to submit their paper. Let <em>G</em> denote the bipartite graph with vertex sets (<em>R, S</em>) and an edge (<em>r, s</em>) only if researcher <em>r</em> chose symposium <em>s.</em></p>
<p>3). The umbrella conference will have a large common PC with experts representing all of its symposia. The process of assigning papers to PC members will of course use <em>G</em> in a critical way.</p>
<p>Once papers are reviewed by PC members and external reviewers, each symposium will rank its submissions using its own criteria of acceptance. We believe the overhead of ranking each paper multiple times is minimal since that is just an issue of deciding how “on-topic” a paper is – an easy task once the reviews of the paper are available.</p>
<p>4). Finally, using all these preference lists, a researcher-proposing stable matching is computed using the Gale-Shapley algorithm. As is well-known, this mechanism will be dominant strategy incentive compatible for researchers.</p>
<p>With a little extra effort, a similar scheme can also be used for a group of conferences at diverse locations but similar times, such as some of the annual summer theory conferences, STOC, ICALP, ESA, STAC, WADS/SWAT, etc.</p>

There was a retired software Eng professor that I had heard two very non-controversial rumors about:<br />
<br />
1) He got his PhD in Numerical Analysis<br />
<br />
2) He got his PhD in Compiler Optimization.<br />
<br />
So I asked him which was true.<br />
<br />
The answer: Both! In those days you had to optimize your code to get your NA code to run fast enough.<br />
<br />
We cannot imagine that anymore. Or at least I cannot.<br />
<br />
Over time the fields of computer science advance more so its hard to be  master of more than one field.  But its not that simple: there has been work recently applying Machine Learning to... well<br />
everything really. Even so, I think the trend is more towards separation. Or perhaps it oscillates.<br />
<br />
I am NOT going to be the grumpy old man (Google once thought I was 70, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2018/10/google-added-years-to-my-life.html">here</a>) who says things were better in my day when the fields were closer together. But I will ask the question:<br />
<br />
1) Are people more specialized new? While I think yes since each field has gotten more complicated and harder to master. There are exceptions: Complexity theory uses much more sophisticated mathematics then when I was a grad student (1980-1985), and of course Quantum Computing has lead to more comp sci majors knowing physics.<br />
<br />
2) Is it good for the field that people are specialized? I am supposed to say that it is terrible and that great advances are made when people are interdiscplinary. But there are many more small advances that are made by someone who has a mastery of one (or two) fields.<br />
<br />
3) The PhD Process and the Tenure Process encourage specialization. This I think IS bad since there are different modes of research that should all be respected.'<br />

We give a nearly-optimal algorithm for testing uniformity of distributions supported on $\{-1,1\}^n$, which makes $\tilde O (\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to a subcube conditional sampling oracle (Bhattacharyya and Chakraborty (2018)). The key technical component is a natural notion of random restriction for distributions on $\{-1,1\}^n$, and a quantitative analysis of how such a restriction affects the mean vector of the distribution. Along the way, we consider the problem of mean testing with independent samples and provide a nearly-optimal algorithm.</div>

<p><em>(see new update at end of post)</em></p>



<p>Around 1999, one of the first things I ever did in quantum computing theory was to work on a problem that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9811023">Fortnow and Rogers</a> suggested in a paper: is it possible to separate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)">P</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a> relative to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_oracle">random oracle</a>?  (That is, without first needing to separate P from PSPACE or whatever in the real world?)  Or to the contrary: suppose that a quantum algorithm Q makes T queries to a Boolean input string X.  Is there then a classical simulation algorithm that makes poly(T) queries to X, and that approximates Q’s acceptance probability for <em>most</em> values of X?  Such a classical simulation, were it possible, would still be consistent with the existence of quantum algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon%27s_problem">Simon’s</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s</a>, which are able to achieve exponential (and even greater) speedups in the black-box setting.  It would simply demonstrate the importance, for Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, of global structure that makes the string X extremely <em>non</em>-random: for example, encoding a periodic function (in the case of Shor’s algorithm), or encoding a function that hides a secret string s (in the case of Simon’s).  It would underscore that superpolynomial quantum speedups depend on structure.</p>



<p>I never managed to solve this problem.  Around 2008, though, I noticed that a solution would follow from a perhaps-not-obviously-related conjecture, about <em>influences</em> in low-degree polynomials.  Namely, let p:R<sup>n</sup>→R be a degree-d real polynomial in n variables, and suppose p(x)∈[0,1] for all x∈{0,1}<sup>n</sup>.  Define the <i>variance</i> of p to be<br />   Var(p):=E<sub>x,y</sub>[|p(x)-p(y)|],<br />and define the <i>influence</i> of the i<sup>th</sup> variable to be<br />   Inf<sub>i</sub>(p):=E<sub>x</sub>[|p(x)-p(x<sup>i</sup>)|].<br />Here the expectations are over strings in {0,1}<sup>n</sup>, and x<sup>i</sup> means x with its i<sup>th</sup> bit flipped between 0 and 1.  Then the conjecture is this: there must be some variable i such that Inf<sub>i</sub>(p) ≥ poly(Var(p)/d) (in other words, that “explains” a non-negligible fraction of the variance of the entire polynomial).</p>



<p>Why would this conjecture imply the statement about quantum algorithms?  Basically, because of the seminal result of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9802049">Beals et al.</a> from 1998: that if a quantum algorithm makes T queries to a Boolean input X, then its acceptance probability can be written as a real polynomial over the bits of X, of degree at most 2T.  Given that result, if you wanted to classically simulate a quantum algorithm Q on most inputs—and if you only cared about query complexity, not computation time—you’d simply need to do the following:<br />(1) Find the polynomial p that represents Q’s acceptance probability.<br />(2) Find a variable i that explains at least a 1/poly(T) fraction of the total remaining variance in p, and query that i.<br />(3) Keep repeating step (2), until p has been restricted to a polynomial with not much variance left—i.e., to nearly a constant function p(X)=c.  Whenever that happens, halt and output the constant c.<br />The key is that by hypothesis, this algorithm will halt, with high probability over X, after only poly(T) steps.</p>



<p>Anyway, around the same time, Andris Ambainis had a major break on a different problem that I’d told him about: namely, whether randomized and quantum query complexities are polynomially related for all partial functions with permutation symmetry (like the collision and the element distinctness functions).  Andris and I decided to write up the two directions jointly.  The result was our 2011 paper entitled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0996">The Need for Structure in Quantum Speedups</a>.</p>



<p>Of the two contributions in the “Need for Structure” paper, the one about random oracles and influences in low-degree polynomials was clearly the weaker and less satisfying one.  As the reviewers pointed out, that part of the paper didn’t solve anything: it just reduced one unsolved problem to a new, slightly different problem that was <em>also</em> unsolved.  Nevertheless, that part of the paper acquired a life of its own over the ensuing decade, as the world’s experts in analysis of Boolean functions and polynomials began referring to the “Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture.”  Ryan O’Donnell, Guy Kindler, and many others had a stab.  I even got Terry Tao to spend an hour or two on the problem when I visited UCLA.</p>



<p>Now, at long last, Nathan Keller and Ohad Klein say they’ve proven the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture, in a preprint whose title is a riff on ours: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03748">“Quantum Speedups Need Structure.”</a></p>



<p>Their paper hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed, and I haven’t yet carefully studied it, but I <em>could</em> and <em>should</em>: at 19 pages, it looks very approachable and clear, if not as radically short as (say) <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4229">Huang’s proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture</a>.  Keller and Klein’s argument subsumes all the earlier results that I knew would need to be subsumed, and involves all the concepts (like a real analogue of block sensitivity) that I knew would need to be involved somehow.</p>



<p>My plan had been as follows:<br />(1) Read their paper in detail.  Understand every step of their proof.<br />(2) Write a blog post that reflects my detailed understanding.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this plan did not sufficiently grapple with the fact that I now have two kids.  It got snagged for a week at step (1).  So I’m now executing an alternative plan, which is to jump immediately to the blog post.</p>



<p>Assuming Keller and Klein’s result holds up—as I expect it will—by combining it with the observations in my and Andris’s paper, one immediately gets an explanation for why no one has managed to separate P from BQP relative to a <em>random</em> oracle, but only relative to non-random oracles.  This complements the work of <a href="https://www.uncg.edu/mat/faculty/cdsmyth/thesis.pdf">Kahn, Saks, and Smyth</a>, who around 2000 gave a precisely analogous explanation for the difficulty of separating P from NP∩coNP relative to a random oracle.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the polynomial blowup is quite enormous: from a quantum algorithm making T queries, Keller and Klein apparently get a classical algorithm making O(T<sup>18</sup>) queries.  But such things can almost always be massively improved.</p>



<p>Feel free to use the comments to ask any questions about this result or its broader context.  I’ll either do my best to answer from the limited amount I know, or else I’ll pass the questions along to Nathan and Ohad themselves.  Maybe, at some point, I’ll even be forced to understand the new proof.</p>



<p>Congratulations to Nathan and Ohad!</p>



<p><strong><font color="red">Update (Nov. 20):</font></strong> Tonight I finally did what I should’ve done two weeks ago, and worked through the paper from start to finish.  Modulo some facts about noise operators, hypercontractivity, etc. that I took on faith, I now have a reasonable (albeit imperfect) understanding of the proof.  It’s great!</p>



<p>In case it’s helpful to anybody, here’s my one-paragraph summary of how it works.  First, you hit your bounded degree-d function f with a random restriction to attenuate its higher-degree Fourier coefficients (reminiscent of <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~ehudf/courses/anal09/LMN.pdf">Linial-Mansour-Nisan</a>).  Next, in that attenuated function, you find a small “coalition” of influential variables—by which we mean, a set of variables for which there’s <em>some</em> assignment that substantially biases f.  You keep iterating—finding influential coalitions in subfunctions on n/4, n/8, etc. variables.  All the while, you keep track of <em>the norm of the vector of all the block-sensitivities of all the inputs</em> (the authors don’t clearly explain this in the intro, but they reveal it near the end).  Every time you find another influential coalition, that norm goes down by a little, but by approximation theory, it can only go down O(d<sup>2</sup>) times until it hits rock bottom and your function is nearly constant.  By the end, you’ll have approximated f itself by a decision tree of depth poly(d, 1/ε, log(n)).  Finally, you get rid of the log(n) term by using the fact that f essentially depended on at most exp(O(d)) variables anyway. </p>



<p>Anyway, I’m not sure how helpful it is to write more: the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03748.pdf">paper itself</a> is about 95% as clear as it could possibly be, and even where it isn’t, you’d probably need to read it first (and, uh, know something about influences, block sensitivity, random restrictions, etc.) before any further clarifying remarks would be of use.  But happy to discuss more in the comments, if anyone else is reading it.</p></div>

We present a randomized algorithm that takes as input an undirected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ and an integer $k &gt; 3\Delta$, and returns a random proper $k$-coloring of $G$. The 
 distribution of the coloring is perfectly uniform over the set of all proper $k$-colorings; the expected running time of the algorithm is $\mathrm{poly}(k,n)=\widetilde{O}(n\Delta^2\cdot \log(k))$. 
 This improves upon a result of Huber~(STOC 1998) who obtained polynomial time perfect sampling algorithm for $k&gt;\Delta^2+2\Delta$.
 Prior to our work, no algorithm with expected running time $\mathrm{poly}(k,n)$ was known to guarantee perfectly sampling for $\Delta = \omega(1)$ and for any $k \leq \Delta^2+2\Delta$. 
 
 Our algorithm (like several other perfect sampling algorithms including Huber's) is based on  the Coupling from the Past method. Inspired by the bounding chain approach pioneered independently by H\"aggstr\"om \&amp; Nelander~(Scand.{} J.{} Statist., 1999) and Huber~(STOC 1998), our algorithm is based on a novel bounding chain for the coloring problem.</div>

We design a nonadaptive algorithm that, given a Boolean function $f\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ which is $\alpha$-far from monotone, makes poly$(n, 1/\alpha)$ queries and returns an estimate that, with high probability, is an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$-approximation to the distance of $f$ to monotonicity. Furthermore, we show that for any constant $\kappa &gt; 0,$ approximating the distance to monotonicity up to $n^{1/2 - \kappa}$-factor requires $2^{n^\kappa}$ nonadaptive queries, thereby ruling out a poly$(n, 1/\alpha)$-query nonadaptive algorithm for such approximations. This answers a question of Seshadhri (Property Testing Review, 2014) for the case of nonadaptive algorithms. Approximating the distance to a property is closely related to tolerantly testing that property. Our lower bound stands in contrast to standard (non-tolerant) testing of monotonicity that can be done nonadaptively with $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n} / \varepsilon^2)$ queries.

We obtain our lower bound by proving an analogous bound for erasure-resilient testers. An $\alpha$-erasure-resilient tester for a desired property gets oracle access to a function that has at most an $\alpha$ fraction of values erased. The tester has to accept (with probability at least 2/3) if the erasures can be filled in to ensure that the resulting function has the property and to reject (with probability at least 2/3) if every completion of erasures results in a function that is $\varepsilon$-far from having the property. Our method yields the same lower bounds for unateness and being a $k$-junta. These lower bounds improve exponentially on the existing lower bounds for these properties.</div>

We study a new model of space-bounded computation, the {\it random-query} model. The model is based on a branching-program over input variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. In each time step, the branching program gets as an input a random index $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$, together with the input variable $x_i$ (rather than querying an input variable of its choice, as in the case of a standard (oblivious) branching program). We motivate the new model in various ways and study time-space tradeoff lower bounds in this model.

Our main technical result is a quadratic time-space lower bound for zero-error computations in the random-query model, for XOR, Majority and many other functions. More precisely, a zero-error computation is a computation that stops with high probability and such that conditioning on the event that the computation stopped, the output is correct with probability~1. We prove that for any Boolean function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, with sensitivity $k$, any zero-error computation with time $T$ and space $S$, satisfies 
$T\cdot (S+\log n) \geq \Omega(n \cdot k)$. We note that the best time-space lower bounds for standard oblivious branching programs are only slightly super linear and improving these bounds is an important long-standing open problem.

To prove our results, we study a memory-bounded variant of the coupon-collector problem that seems to us of independent interest and to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before. We consider a zero-error version of the coupon-collector problem. In this problem, the coupon-collector could explicitly choose to stop when he/she is sure with zero-error that
all coupons have already been collected. We prove that any zero-error coupon-collector that stops with high probability in time $T$, and uses space $S$, satisfies $T\cdot (S+\log n) \geq \Omega(n^2)$, where $n$ is the number of different coupons.</div>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown"><p>It is often said that "we don’t understand deep learning" but it is not as often clarified what is it exactly that we don’t understand. In this post I try to list some of the "puzzles" of modern machine learning, from a theoretical perspective. This list is neither comprehensive nor authoritative.  Indeed, I  only started looking at these issues last year, and am very much in the position of not yet fully understanding the questions, let alone potential answers.
On the other hand, at the rate ML research is going, a calendar year corresponds to about 10 "ML years"…</p>
<p>Machine learning  offers many opportunities for theorists; there are many more questions than answers, and it is clear that a better theoretical understanding of what makes certain training procedures work or fail is desperately needed. Moreover, recent advances in software frameworks made it much easier to test out intuitions and conjectures. While in the past running training procedures might have required a Ph.D in machine learning, recently the "barrier to entry" was reduced to first to undergraduates, then to high school students, and these days it’s so easy that even theoretical computer scientists can do it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>To set the context for this discussion, I focus on the task of supervised learning. In this setting we are given a <em>training set</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> examples of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x_i%2Cy_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(x_i,y_i)" class="latex" title="(x_i,y_i)" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d" class="latex" title="x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d" /> is some vector (think of it as the pixels of an image) and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i+%5Cin+%7B+%5Cpm+1+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="y_i \in { \pm 1 }" class="latex" title="y_i \in { \pm 1 }" /> is some label (think of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="y_i" class="latex" title="y_i" /> as equaling <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="+1" class="latex" title="+1" /> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" /> is the image of a dog and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="-1" class="latex" title="-1" /> if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_i" class="latex" title="x_i" /> is the image of a cat). The goal in supervised learning is to find a <em>classifier</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3Dy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f(x)=y" class="latex" title="f(x)=y" /> will hold for many future samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(x,y)" class="latex" title="(x,y)" />.</p>
<p>The standard approach is to consider some parameterized family of classifiers, where for every vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" class="latex" title="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" />  of parameters, we associate a classifier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta+%3A%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Ed+%5Crightarrow+%7B+%5Cpm+1+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta :\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow { \pm 1 }" class="latex" title="f_\theta :\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow { \pm 1 }" />. For example, we can fix a certain neural network architecture (depth, connections, activation functions, etc.) and let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" />  be the vector of weights that characterizes every network in this architecture. People then run some optimizing algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent with the objective function set as finding the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" class="latex" title="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" /> that minimizes a <em>loss function</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" title="L_S(\theta)" />. This loss function can be the fraction of labels that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta" class="latex" title="f_\theta" /> gets wrong on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> or a more continuous loss that takes into account the confidence level or other parameters of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta" class="latex" title="f_\theta" /> as well. By now this general approach has been successfully applied to a many classification tasks, in many cases achieving near-human to super-human performance.  In the rest of this post I want to discuss some of the questions that arise when trying to obtain a theoretical understanding of both the powers and the limitations of the above approach. I focus on deep learning, though there are still some open questions even for over-parameterized linear regression.</p>
<h2>The generalization puzzle</h2>
<p>The approach outlined above has been well known and  analyzed for many decades in the statistical learning literature. There are many cases where we can <em>prove</em> that a classifier obtained in this case has a small <em>generalization gap</em>, in the sense that if the training set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> was obtained by sampling <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> independent and identical samples from a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" />, then the performance of a classifier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta" class="latex" title="f_\theta" /> on new samples from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> will be close to its performance on the training set.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these results all boil down to the Chernoff bound. Think of the random variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_1%2C%5Cldots%2CX_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X_1,\ldots,X_n" class="latex" title="X_1,\ldots,X_n" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X_i%3D1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X_i=1" class="latex" title="X_i=1" /> if the classifier makes an error on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="i" class="latex" title="i" />-th training example. The Chernoff bound tells us that  probability that  that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csum+X_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\sum X_i" class="latex" title="\sum X_i" /> deviates by more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\epsilon n" class="latex" title="\epsilon n" /> from its expectation is something like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cexp%28-%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\exp(-\epsilon^2 n)" class="latex" title="\exp(-\epsilon^2 n)" /> and so as long as the total number of classifiers is less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2^k" class="latex" title="2^k" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%3C+%5Cepsilon%5E2+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="k &lt; \epsilon^2 n" class="latex" title="k &lt; \epsilon^2 n" />, we can use a union bound over all possible classifiers to argue that if we make a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> fraction of errors on the training set, the probability we make an error on a new example is at  most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%2B%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p+\epsilon" class="latex" title="p+\epsilon" />. We can of course "bunch together" classifiers that behave similarly on our distribution, and so it is enough if there are at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2^{\epsilon^2 n}" class="latex" title="2^{\epsilon^2 n}" /> of these equivalence classes. Another approach is to add a "regularizing term" <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R(\theta)" class="latex" title="R(\theta)" /> to the objective function, which amounts to restricting attention to the set of all classifiers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta" class="latex" title="f_\theta" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%28%5Ctheta%29+%5Cleq+%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R(\theta) \leq \mu" class="latex" title="R(\theta) \leq \mu" /> for some parameter <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmu&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mu" class="latex" title="\mu" />. Again, as long as the number of equivalence classes in this set is less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2^{\epsilon^2 n}" class="latex" title="2^{\epsilon^2 n}" />, we can use this bound.</p>
<p>To a first approximation, the number of classifiers (even after "bunching together") is roughly exponential in the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> of parameters, and so these results tell us that as long as the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> of parameters is smaller than the number of examples, we can expect to have a small <em>generalization gap</em> and can infer future performance (known as "test performance") from the performance on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> (known as "train performance").
Once the number of parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> becomes close to or even bigger than the number of samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, we are in danger of "overfitting" where we could have excellent train performance but terrible test performance. Thus according to the classical statistical learning theory, the ideal number of parameters would be some number between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="0" class="latex" title="0" /> and the number of samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" />, with the precise value governed by the so called "bias variance tradeoff".</p>
<p>This is a beautiful theory, but unfortunately the classical theorems yield vacous  results in the realm of modern machine learning, where we  often train networks with millions of parameters on a mere tens of thousands of examples. Moreover, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">Zhang et al</a> showed that this is not just a question of counting  parameters better. They showed that modern deep networks can in fact "overfit" and achieve 100% success on the training set even if you gave them random or arbitrary labels.</p>
<p>The results above in particular show that we can find classifiers that perform great on the training set but perform terribly on the future tests, as well as classifiers that perform terrible on the training set but pretty good on future test. Specifically, consider an architecture that has the capacity to fit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=20n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="20n" class="latex" title="20n" /> arbitrary labels, and suppose that we train it on a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> examples.  Then we can find a setting of parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" /> that both fits the training set exactly (i.e.,  satisfies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta%28x%29%3Dy&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta(x)=y" class="latex" title="f_\theta(x)=y" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29%5Cin+S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(x,y)\in S" class="latex" title="(x,y)\in S" />) but also satisfies that the additional constraint that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta%28x%29%3D+-y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta(x)= -y" class="latex" title="f_\theta(x)= -y" /> (i.e., the negation of the label <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="y" class="latex" title="y" />) for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(x,y)" class="latex" title="(x,y)" /> in some additional set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=19m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="19m" class="latex" title="19m" /> pairs.
(The set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> is not part of the actual training set, but rather an "auxiliary set" that we simply use for the sake of constructing this counterexample; note that we can use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> as means to generate the initial network which can then be fed into standard stochastic gradient descent on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />.) The network <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f_\theta" class="latex" title="f_\theta" /> fits its training set perfectly, but since it effectively corresponds to training with 95% label noise, it will  perform  worse than even a coin toss.</p>
<p>In an analogous way, we can find parameters <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" /> that completely fail on the training set, but fit correctly the additional "auxiliary set" <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />. This will correspond to the case of standard training with 5% label noise, which typically yields about 95% of the performance on the noiseless distribution.</p>
<p>The above insights  break the <strong>separation of concerns</strong> or separation of <strong>computational problems</strong> from <strong>algorithms</strong> which we theorists  like so much. Ideally, we would like to phrase the "machine learning problem" as a well defined optimization objective, such as finding, given a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />, the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5Em&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" class="latex" title="\theta \in \mathbb{R}^m" /> that mimimizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" title="L_S(\theta)" />. Once phrased in this way, we can try to find with an algorithm that achieves this goal as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern machine learning does not currently lend itself to such a clean partition. In particular, since not all optima are equally good, we  <em>don’t  actually want</em> to solve the task of minimizing the loss function in a "black box" way. In fact, many of the ideas that make optimization faster such as accelaration, lower learning rate, second order methods and others, yield <em>worse</em>  generalization performance. Thus, while the objective function is somewhat correlated with generalization performance, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for it. This is a clear sign that we don’t really understand what makes machine learning work, and there is still much left to discover. I don’t know what machine learning textbooks in the 2030’s will contain, but my guess is that they would <em>not</em> prescribe running stochastic gradient descent on one of these loss functions. (Moritz Hardt counters that what we teach in ML today is not that far from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Classification-Scene-Analysis-Richard/dp/0471223611">1973 book of Duda and Hart</a>, and that by some measures ML moved <em>slower</em> than other areas of CS.)</p>
<p>The <em>generalization puzzle</em> of machine learning can be phrased as the question of understanding what properties of procedures that map a training set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> into a classifier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" /> lead to good generalization performance with respect to certain distributions. In particular we would like to understand what are the properties of natural  natural distributions and stochastic gradient descent that make the latter into such a map.</p>
<h2>The computational puzzle</h2>
<p>Yet another puzzle in modern machine learning arises from the fact that we are able to find the minimum of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" title="L_S(\theta)" /> in the first place. A priori this is surprising since, apart from very special cases (e.g., linear regression with a square loss), the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta+%5Cmapsto+L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta \mapsto L_S(\theta)" class="latex" title="\theta \mapsto L_S(\theta)" /> is in general <em>non convex</em>. Indeed, for almost any natural loss function, the problem of finding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" /> that minimizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" title="L_S(\theta)" /> is NP hard.
However, if we look at the computational question in the context of the generalization puzzle above, it might not be as mysterious. As we have seen, the fact that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" /> we output is a global minimizer (or close to minimizer)  of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ccdot%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="L_S(\cdot)" class="latex" title="L_S(\cdot)" /> is in some sense accidental and by far not the  the most important property of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" />. There are many minima of the loss function that  generalize badly, and many non minima that  generalize well.</p>
<p>So perhaps the right way to phrase the computational puzzle is as</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"How come that we are able to use stochastic gradient descent to find the vector <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctheta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\theta" class="latex" title="\theta" /> that is output by stochastic gradient descent."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>which when phrased like that, doesn’t seem like much of a puzzle after all.</p>
<h2>The off-distribution performance puzzle</h2>
<p>In the supervised learning problem, the training samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> are drawn from the same distribution as the final test sample. But in any applications of machine learning, classifiers are expected to perform on samples that arise from very different settings. The image that the camera of a self-driving car observes is not drawn from ImageNet, and yet it still needs to (and often can) detect whether not it is seeing a dog or a cat (at which point it will break or accelerate, depending on whether the programmer was a dog or cat lover). Another insight to this question comes from a recent work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">Recht et al</a>. They generated a new set of images that is very similar to the original ImageNet test set, but not identical to it. One can think of it as generated from a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D'" class="latex" title="D'" /> that is close but not the same as the original distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> of ImageNet. They then checked how well do neural networks that were trained on the original ImageNet distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> perform on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D'" class="latex" title="D'" />. They saw that while these networks performed significantly worse on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D'" class="latex" title="D'" /> than they did on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" />, their performance on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D'" class="latex" title="D'" /> was <em>highly correlated</em> with their performance on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" />. Hence doing better on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D" class="latex" title="D" /> did correspond to being better in a way that carried over to the (very closely related) <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D'" class="latex" title="D'" />. (However, the networks did perform worse on $D’$ so off-distribution performance is by no means a full success story.)</p>
<p>Coming up with a theory that can supply some predictions for learning in a way that is not as tied to the particular distribution is still very much open. I see it as somewhat akin to finding a theory for the performance of algorithms that is somewhere between average-case complexity (which is highly dependant on the distribution) and worst-case complexity (which does not depend on the distribution at all, but is not always achievable).</p>
<h2>The robustness puzzle</h2>
<p>If the previous puzzles were about understanding why deep networks are surprisingly good, the next one is about understanding why they are surprisingly bad. Images of physical objects have the property that if we modify them in some ways,  such as perturbing them in  a small number of pixels or by few shades or rotating by an angle, they still correspond to the same object. Deep neural networks do not seem to "pick up" on this property.
Indeed, there are many examples of how tiny perturbations can cause a neural net to think that one image is another, and people have even <a href="https://youtu.be/piYnd_wYlT8">printed a 3D turtle</a> that most modern systems recognize as a rifle. (See this <a href="https://adversarial-ml-tutorial.org/">excellent tutorial</a>, though note an "ML decade" has already passed since it was published). This "brittleness" of neural networks can be a significant concern when we deploy them in the wild. (Though perhaps mixing up turtles and rifles is not so bad: I can imagine  some people that would normally resist regulations to protect the environment but would support them if they confused turtles with guns..)
Perhaps one reason for this brittleness is that neural networks can be thought of as a way of embedding a set of examples in dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> into dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell" class="latex" title="\ell" /> (where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\ell" class="latex" title="\ell" /> is the number of neurons in the penultimate layer) in a way that will make the positive examples be linearly separable from the negative examples. Amplifying small differences can help in achieving such a separation, even if it hurts robustness.</p>
<p>Recent works have attempted to rectify this, by using a variants of the loss function where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=L_S%28%5Ctheta%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="L_S(\theta)" class="latex" title="L_S(\theta)" /> corresponds to the maximum error under all possible such perturbations of the data. A priori you would think that while robust training might come at a computational cost, statistically it would be a "win win" with the resulting classifiers not only being more robust but also overall better at classifying. After all, we are providing the training procedure with the additional information (i.e., "updating its prior") that the label should be unchanged by certain transformations, which should be equivalent to supplying it with more data. Surprisingly, the robust classifiers currently perform <em>worse</em> than standard trained classifiers on unperturbed data. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02175">Ilyas et al</a> argued that this may be because even if humans ignore information encoded in, for example, whether the intensity level of a pixel is odd or even, it does not mean that this information is not predictive of the label. Suppose that (with no basis whatsoever – just as an example) cat owners are wealthier than dog owners and hence cat pictures tend to be taken with higher quality lenses. One could imagine that a neural network would pick up on that, and use some of the fine grained information in the pixels to help in classification. When we force such a network to be robust it would perform worse. Distill journal published <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/advex-bugs-discussion/">six discussion pieces</a> on the Ilyas et al paper. I like the idea of such "paper discussions" very much and hope it catches on in machine learning and beyond.</p>
<h2>The interpretability puzzle</h2>
<p>Deep neural networks are inspired by our brain, and it is tempting to try to understand their internal structure just like we try to understand the brain and see if it has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_cell">"grandmother neuron"</a>. For example, we could try to see if there is a certain neuron (i.e., gate) in a neural network that "fires" only when it is fed images with certain high level features (or more generally find vectors that have large correlation with the state at a certain layer only when the image has some features). This also of practical importance, as we increasingly use classifiers to make decisions such as whether to approve or deny bail, whether to prescribe to a patient treatment A or B, or whether a car should steer left or right, and would like to understand what is the basis for such decisions. There are beautiful visualizations of neural networks’ decisions and internal structures , but given the robustness puzzle above, it is unclear if these really capture the decision process. After all, if we could change the classification from a cat to a dog by perturbing a tiny number of pixels, in what sense can we explain <em>why</em> the network made this decision or the other.</p>
<h2>The natural distributions puzzle</h2>
<p>Yet another puzzle (pointed out to me by Ilya Sutskever) is to understand what is it about "natural" distributions such as images, texts, etc.. that makes them so amenable to learning via neural networks, even though such networks can have a very hard time with learning even simple concepts such as parities.
Perhaps this is related to the "noise robustness" of natural concepts which is related to being correlated with low degree polynomials.
Another suggestion could be that at least for text etc.., human languages are implicitly designed to fit neural network. Perhaps on some other planets there are languages where the meaning of a sentence completely changes depending on whether it has an odd or an even number of letters…</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The above are just a few puzzles that modern machine learning offers us. Not all of those might have answers in the form of mathematical theorems, or even well stated conjectures, but it is clear that there is still much to be discovered, and plenty of research opportunities for theoretical computer scientists. In this blog I focused on supervised learning, where at least the problem is well defined, but there are other areas of machine learning, such as transfer learning and generative modeling, where we don’t even yet know how to phrase the computational task, let alone prove that any particular procedure solves it. In several ways, the state of machine learning today seems to me as similar to the state of cryptography in the late 1970’s. After the discovery of public key cryptography, researchers has highly promising techniques and great intuitions, but still did not really understand even what security means, let alone how to achieve it. In the decades since, cryptography has turned from an art to a science, and I hope and believe the same will happen to machine learning.</p>

The problem of learning $t$-term DNF formulas (for $t = O(1)$) has been studied extensively in the PAC model since its introduction by Valiant (STOC 1984). A $t$-term DNF can be efficiently learnt using a $t$-term DNF only if $t = 1$ i.e., when it is an AND, while even weakly learning a $2$-term DNF using a constant term DNF was shown to be NP-hard by Khot and Saket (FOCS 2008). On the other hand, Feldman et al. (FOCS 2009) showed the hardness of weakly learning a noisy AND using a halfspace -- the latter being a generalization of an AND, while Khot and Saket (STOC 2008) showed that an intersection of two halfspaces is hard to weakly learn using any function of constantly many halfspaces. The question of whether a $2$-term DNF is efficiently learnable using $2$ or constantly many halfspaces remained open.
	In this work we answer this question in the negative by showing the hardness of weakly learning a $2$-term DNF as well as a noisy AND using any function of a constant number of halfspaces. In particular we prove the following. 
	For any constants $\nu, \zeta &gt; 0$ and $\ell \in \mathbb{N}$, given a distribution over point-value pairs $\{0,1\}^n \times \{0,1\}$, it is NP-hard to decide whether,
YES Case. There is a $2$-term DNF that classifies all the points of the distribution, and an AND that classifies at least $1-\zeta$ fraction of the points correctly.
NO Case. Any boolean function depending on at most $\ell$ halfspaces classifies at most $1/2 + \nu$ fraction of the points of the distribution correctly.
	Our result generalizes and strengthens the previous best results mentioned above on the hardness of learning a $2$-term DNF, learning an intersection of two halfspaces, and learning a noisy AND.</div>

(I was actually asked many of the questions below.) I also recommend <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/10/27/quantum-supremacy-at-last/">Lipton and Regan’s post on the Google paper.</a></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">While much of the post will be familiar let me mention right away a new critique of the Google supremacy claim: One of the central claims in the Google experiment – that the fidelity (quality) of a complex circuit is very close to the product of the fidelity of its basic components –  qubit and gates, seems very improbable and this may shed serious doubts on the validity of the experiment and on its conclusions.</span></p>
<p>Before we start, a few links: For the amazing news on the threshold of random discrete structures, see <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/30/amazing-keith-frankston-jeff-kahn-bhargav-narayanan-jinyoung-park-thresholds-versus-fractional-expectation-thresholds/">this post</a>.  Here is my <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">first post</a> on Google matter. Let me recommend the paper <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201910/rnoti-p1618.pdf">From Operator Algebras to Complexity Theory and Back</a> by Thomas Vidick. It is about a problem by Boris Tsirelson (related to various deep mathematics) and about connections to quantum computation. And just fresh on the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03748">Quantum speedups need structure</a> by Nathan Keller, Ohad Klein, resolving the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture. (Update: here is <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4414">a blog post</a> on the Shtetl-Optimized.) Congrats to Nathan and Ohad!</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">And now, lets start.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So what is quantum supremacy? And what other things do we need to know in order to understand the claims regarding quantum computers?</span></p>
<p><strong>Quantum supremacy</strong>  is the ability of quantum computers to demonstrate computations that classical computers cannot demonstrate. (Or that it is very very hard for classical computers  to demonstrate.)</p>
<p><strong>Quantum error correcting codes</strong> are certain quantum gadgets that a quantum computer needs to create that will be used as building blocks for larger quantum computers.</p>
<p><strong>A sampling task</strong> is  a task where the computer (quantum or classic) produces samples from a certain probability distribution <strong>D</strong>. Each sample is 0-1 vector of length n.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/john_martinis-300x256.jpg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/john_martinis-300x256.jpg?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18579" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>John Martinis</strong></span></p>
<h2>Google</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What did the Google team do?</span></p>
<p>The Google team produced a sample of a few millions 0-1 vectors of length 53 which is based on a certain “ideal” probability distribution <strong>D</strong>. They made two crucial claims regarding their sample</p>
<p>A) The statistical test for how close their sample is to the ideal distribution <strong>D</strong> will give a result above t=1/10,000</p>
<p>B) Producing a sample with similar statistical property will require 10,000 years on a supercomputer.</p>
<p>The probability distribution <strong>D</strong> depends on a quantum computation process (or by the technical jargon, a <strong>quantum circuit</strong>) denoted later by C.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the meaning of the statistical statement in part A)?</span></p>
<p>Google’s quantum computers (like any other current quantum computers) are very “noisy” so what the computer is producing are not samples from <strong>D</strong> but rather a noisy version which could roughly be described as follows: a fraction <em>t</em> of the samples are from <strong>D</strong> and a fraction <em>(1-t)</em> of the samples are from a uniform distribution. The statistical test allows to estimate the value of <em>t</em> which is referred to as the fidelity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Could they directly verify claims A) and B) ?</span></p>
<p>No, it was only possible to give indirect evidence for both these claims.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the logic of Google’s quantum supremacy argument?</span></p>
<p>For claim A) regarding the success of the statistical test on the sample they have two arguments:</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/gsformula.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/gsformula.png?w=300&amp;h=44" alt="" width="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18590" height="44" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Analysis based on the fidelity of the components of the quantum computer – qubits and gates (see formula (77) above),</li>
<li>Experiments that support the analysis in the regime where they can be tested by a classical computer.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the paper  the fidelity of entire circuits agrees perfectly with the prediction of the simple mathematical formula (77) with deviation under 10-20 percents. There are several reported experiments in the classically tractable regime including on simplified circuits (that are easier to simulate on classical computers) to support the assumption that the prediction given by formula (77) for the fidelity applies to the 53-qubit circuit in the supremacy regime.</p>
<p>For claim B) For the classical difficulty they rely on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Extrapolation from the running time of a specific algorithm that they use.</li>
<li>Computational complexity support for the assertion that the task they consider is asymptotically difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What are the weak points in this logic?</span></p>
<p>A main weakness (which is crucial in my mind) of the experiment is that the experimental support from the regime where the experiments can be tested by a classical computer is too sparse. Much more could have been done and should have been done.</p>
<h2><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/supremacy-figure.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/supremacy-figure.png?w=300&amp;h=277" alt="" width="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18586" height="277" /></a></h2>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In my opinion, a major weakness of the Google experiment is that the support from experiments in the classically tractable regime (blue in the picture) is much too sparse and is unconvincing.</span></p>
<p>Another weakness is that the arguments for classical difficulty were mainly based on the performance of a specific algorithm.</p>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is your assessment of the Google claims, Gil?</span></p>
<p>I think that the claims are incorrect. Specifically, I find the evidence for  the claim “the statistical test applied to the 53-qubit  sample will give a result above 1/10,000 too weak and I expect that this claim and other related claims in the paper will not stand after a closer scrutiny and further experiments in the classically tractable regime. I also doubt the perfect proximity between predictions based on the 1- and 2- qubit fidelity and the circuit fidelity.</p>
<p>The Google experiment represents a very large leap in several aspects of human ability to control noisy quantum systems and accepting their claims  requires very careful evaluation of the experiments and, of course, successful replications.</p>
<h2>The “most amazing thing” – is it real?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you want to tell us more about Formula (77)?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77.png?w=300&amp;h=222" alt="" width="300" class="size-medium wp-image-18615 aligncenter" height="222" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Formula (77)</span></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. Here again is Formula (77) and its explanation in the paper. The fact that the fidelity of entire circuits agrees with the prediction of the simple mathematical Formula (77) is “most amazing” <a href="https://youtu.be/FklMpRiTeTA?t=2455">according to John Martinis (videotaped lecture at Caltech).</a>  Indeed the deviation according to the paper is at most 10-20 percents.  This perfect agreement can be seen in various other parts of the paper. The authors’ interpretation of this finding is that it validates the digital error model and shows that there are no new mechanisms for errors.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77-explained.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/77-explained.png?w=640&amp;h=400" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-18641" height="400" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">John explains the significance of Formula (77) at Caltech. Amazing big surprises are often false.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And what do you think about it, Gil</span></p>
<p>I completely agree that this is most amazing and, as a matter of fact, there are reasons to consider the  predictions based on Formula (77) as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>too good to be true</strong></span> even if qubit and gates fidelity account for all the errors in the system. The issue is that Formula (77) itself is very sensitive to noise. The formula estimates the fidelity as the product of hundreds of contributions from individual qubits and gates. Fairly small errors in estimating the individual terms can have large accumulative effect, well beyond the 10%-20% margin.</p>
<p>Anyway, this matter deserves further study.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why?</span></p>
<p>Because this is considered by the authors as a major discovery and while looking skeptically at the Google papers this appears to be an orthogonal “miracle” to the main supremacy claim.</p>
<h2>How to proceed</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let’s go back to your overall assessment. What could change your mind, Gil?</span></p>
<p>Here goes:</p>
<h3>Verification</h3>
<p>A) An independent verification of the statistical tests outcomes for the experiments in the regime where the Google team classically computed the probabilities. This looks to me like a crucial step in a verification of such an important experiment.</p>
<p>A more difficult verification that I’d also regard as necessary at a later stage would be to independently check the probability distributions for the circuits given by the Google computation.</p>
<h3>Further analysis and crucial improvements</h3>
<p>B) Experiments with the quantum computers giving sufficiently many samples to understand the noisy probability distribution for circuits in the 10-25 qubit range.  See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">my first post</a>, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4372#comment-1822400" rel="nofollow ugc">this comment by Ryan O’Donnell</a>, and this <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317#comment-1819915">earlier one</a>.  We need to understand the noisy probability distribution produced by the Google quantum computer, the actual fidelity, and the quality of the statistical tests used by the Google team.</p>
<h3>Replications</h3>
<p>C) Experiments in the 10-30 qubit range on the IBM (and other) quantum computers.  It is quite possible that experimenting of this kind with random quantum circuits was already carried out.</p>
<p>D) Since improved classical algorithms were found by the IBM team (but analyzing the 53 qubits samples still seems practically beyond reach).   Google can produce samples for 41-49 qubits for which IBM (or others) can compute the probabilities quickly and test Google’s prediction for the fidelity.</p>
<h3>Follow-ups</h3>
<p>E) Success in demonstrating distance-3 and distance-5 surface codes and other quantum error-correcting codes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So what precisely will convince you and what is the time-schedule that you expect for matters to be clarified?</span></p>
<p>A successful and convincing combination of<strong> three or more</strong> from A), B), C), D) or E) will go a long way to convince me. The verification part A) is important, and I don’t expect problems there, I expect that the Google claims will be verified and I consider it as very important that the data will be public and that various groups will verify the claims. This may take several months and certainly it should take less than a year.</p>
<p>At present, I expect parts B)-D) will not support Google’s supremacy claims. So outcomes of experiments in the next couple of years both by the Google group and by other groups will be crucial. One direction that I <em>do not</em> regard, at present, as useful for strengthening the quantum supremacy claims is increasing the number of qubits of the quantum computer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is required for the (easy) verification stage?</span></p>
<p>(1) Right now the raw samples of Google’s sampling experiments are public. There are altogether 300 files with samples.</p>
<p>(2) For every circuit that they experiment, the Google team also plans to upload  the 2^n probabilities that they obtained by the Feynman-Schrodinger algorithm.  This will  allow verifying their statistical tests, making subsequent analysis, and for other researchers to test other algorithms for computing the same probabilities.</p>
<p>(3) A convenient form of the data from (2) is a file that will give for every experiment the probabilities that the Google team computed for the samples. (For a large <em>n</em> those are much smaller files.)</p>
<p>(4) For each of the 300 experiments the estimated fidelity that formula (77) gave and the contribution of each qubit and gate to the RHS of (77).</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Do you plan to take part yourself?</span></p>
<p>I plan to get involved myself with the “easy” verification and analysis of the “raw data” once it will become available. I do expect that the statistical tests will agree with the assertions in the Google paper, and at the same time, as I said,  I think it is important that this and other aspects of the experiments will be double checked and triple checked. This basic data already allows interesting analysis and indeed Google’s supplementary paper describes such analysis (that the Google people kindly pointed me to) on how the data fits the theory and on their statistical tests. See Figures S32-S36, table V and associated materials around pages 37-40.</p>
<h2>IBM</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What did the IBM rebuttal paper show?</span></p>
<p>Recall that the Google claim is based on two assertions:</p>
<p>A) The statistical test applied to the sample will give a result above 1/10,000</p>
<p>B) that producing a sample with similar statistical property will require 10,000 years on a supercomputer.</p>
<p>The IBM team described a different algorithm (on an even stronger current supercomputer) that would take only 2.5 days rather than 10,000 years.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Can the 2.5 days be further reduced?</span></p>
<p>As far as I can see the IBM claim is about a full computation of all the 2^53 probabilities. It is reasonable to think that producing a sample (or even a complete list of 2^53 probabilities) with fidelity t reduces the classical effort linearly with t. (This is the claim about the specific algorithm used by the Google team.) If this holds for the IBM algorithm then the 2.5 days will go down to less than a minute. (This will still be a notable “quantum speed up” in terms of the number of operations.) I don’t have an opinion as to whether  we should expect considerably better than IBM’s classical algorithms for computing the exact probabilities.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But lack of enthusiasm and skepticism of researchers from IBM about the Google paper appears to go beyond this particular point of the 2.5 computing days. Do you think that the objection by IBM people is motivated by fierce competition or envy?</span></p>
<p>No, I tend to think that there is a genuine interest by researchers who question the Google paper to understand the scientific matter, and carefully, critically and skeptically examine  Google’s claims. Maybe Google’s claims might seem to some other researchers who are working on quantum computers with superconducting qubits as remote from their own experimental experience, and this may give a strong reason for skepticism. It is also possible that in time people in IBM and elsewhere will change their mind and will become  more enthusiastic about the Google results.</p>
<p>IBM <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09534">paper</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy/">blog post</a> responding to Google’s announcement.</p>
<h2>Noise</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Tell us a little more about noise</span></p>
<p>Here is a nice toy model (which I think is quite realistic) to understand what the noise is.  Suppose that you ran a circuit C on your quantum computer with n qubits and the ideal probability distribution is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" />. The fidelity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t" class="latex" title="t" /> noisy version of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" /> will be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=N_C%28x%29%3Dt+D_C%28x%29+%2B+%281-t%29S_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="N_C(x)=t D_C(x) + (1-t)S_C" class="latex" title="N_C(x)=t D_C(x) + (1-t)S_C" />. And here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S_C" class="latex" title="S_C" /> is the average (or weighted average) of values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C%28y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C(y)" class="latex" title="D_C(y)" /> where y is a vector in the neighborhood of x.</p>
<p>Here is a concrete version: We look at the expected value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C%28y%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C(y)" class="latex" title="D_C(y)" /> where y is a new vector and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i%3Dx_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="y_i=x_i" class="latex" title="y_i=x_i" /> with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y_i%3D%281-x_i%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="y_i=(1-x_i)" class="latex" title="y_i=(1-x_i)" /> with probability <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281-p%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(1-p)" class="latex" title="(1-p)" /> <span style="color: #008000;"><strong>independently</strong></span>. We choose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%5En%3Dt&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p^n=t" class="latex" title="p^n=t" />. There are cases where positive correlation of errors for 2-qubit gates lead to correlated errors. (This is especially relevant in the context of quantum error correction.) To add this effect to the toy noise model replace the  word <span style="color: #008000;">independently</span> by “<span style="color: #008000;">positively correlated</span>“.</p>
<h2>Your argument, Gil</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Why do you think that quantum supremacy is not possible at all?</span></p>
<p>The gist of my argument against the possibility of achieving quantum supremacy by Noisy intermediate scale quantum computers is quite simple: “<em>NISQ</em> <em>devices can’t outperform classical computers, for the simple reason that they <span style="color: #ff0000;">are</span> primitive classical computers.” </em></p>
<p>(Note the similarity to Scott Aaronson’s <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">critique</a> on a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1557-9">paper</a> published by <em>Nature</em> claiming implementation of a Shor-like algorithm on a classical device called “p-bits”.  Scott offered a very quick debunking: “ ‘<em>p-bit’ devices can’t scalably outperform classical computers, for the simple reason that they <span style="color: #ff0000;">are</span> classical computers.)</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Google’s claim are correct – does it falsify your argument?</span></p>
<p>Yes! I predict that probability distributions described (robustly) by a noisy quantum circuit represent a polynomial time algorithm in terms of the description of the circuit. And by a polynomial time algorithm I assume small degree and modest constants. The Google claim, if true, appears to falsify this prediction. (And for this you do not need quantum supremacy in the strongest form of the term.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">But is there no way that Google’s huge (or at least large) computational advantage coexists with what you say?</span></p>
<p>There is an issue that I myself am not completely sure about regarding the possibility of chaotic behavior of quantum computers. Here is the classical analog: If you have <em>n</em> bits of memory inside a (classical) computer of <em>m</em> bits and ask about the complexity of the evolution on the <em>n</em> bits which may be chaotic. Of course, we cannot expect that this chaotic computer can lead to a computation that requires thousands of years in a super computer. But can it lead to a robust computation which is superpolynomial  in <em>n</em> (but polynomial in <em>m</em>)?</p>
<p>I don’t know the general answer but, in any case, I don’t think that it changes the situation here. If the Google claims  stand, I would regard it as a very strong argument against my theory. (Even if the noisy distributions themselves are not robust.) In any case, the question if the samples in the experiments represent robust distributions or are chaotic could and should be tested. (I discussed it in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/noisy-quantum-circuits-how-do-we-know-that-we-have-robust-experimental-outcomes-at-all-and-do-we-care/">this post</a>.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If Google’s claims do not stand, will it confirm or give a strong support to your position that quantum supremacy and quantum error correction are impossible?</span></p>
<p>Failure of the Google claim will mainly support the position that quantum supremacy and quantum error correction require substantial improvement of the quality of qubit and gates. It would give a noteworthy support to my position (and probably would draw some attention to it) but I would not regard it as a decisive support. Let me mention that various specific predictions that I made can be tested in the Google, IBM and other systems.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">OK, so why <em>do you think</em> that the quality of qubits and gates <em>cannot</em> be improved?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes, this is the crucial point. One argument (that I already mentioned) for thinking that there is a barrier for the quality of gates and qubits is computational theoretic. Computationally speaking NISQ devices are primitive classical computing devices and this gives a strong reason to think that it will not be possible to reduce the error rate to the level allowing computational supremacy. But there is an additional argument: for a wide range of lower levels of noise, reducing the noise will have the effect of making the system more chaotic. So the first argument tells us that there is a small range of error-rates that we can hope to  achieve and the second argument tells us that for a large range  of lower error-rates all we gain is chaos!</span></p>

<h2>Correlated errors and quantum error correction</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">People mainly refer to your conjectures about correlated errors.</span></p>
<p>Yes, this reflects my work between 2005-2013 (and was a central issue in <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/perpetual-motion-of-the-21st-century/">my debate</a> <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/10/03/quantum-supremacy-or-classical-control/">with Aram Harrow</a>) and I think it is an important part of the overall picture. But this issue is different than my argument against quantum computers which represents my work between 2014-2019.  I think that my earlier work on error correlation is a key (or a starting point) to the question: What do we learn from failure of quantum computers on general properties of quantum noise. Indeed there are various consequences; some of them are fairly intuitive; some of them are counter-intuitive, and some of them are both. The basic intuition is that once your computation really makes use of a large portion of the Hilbert space, so will the error!</p>
<p>The major challenge is to put this intuition into formal mathematical terms and to relate it to the mathematics and physics of quantum physics.</p>
<p>I made a similar idea in  a comment to Dave Bacon in 2006 when I wrote “I believe that you may be able to approximate a rank-one matrix up to a rank-one error. I do not believe that you will be able to approximate an arbitrary matrix up to a rank one matrix.” to which Dave replied “I will never look at rank one matrices the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" />”. Dave Bacon is among the authors of the new Google paper.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What is the connection between the ability to achieve quantum supremacy and the ability to achieve quantum error-correction?</span></p>
<p>One of the main claims in my recent works is that quantum supremacy is an easier task compared to creating good quality error-correcting codes. For the attempted experiments by Google, we see  a clear demonstration that achieving good quality quantum error correction is harder than demonstrating quantum supremacy. Low fidelity circuits that Google claims to achieve are far from sufficient for quantum error-correction. The other claim in my argument is that quantum supremacy cannot be achieved without quantum error correction (and, in particular, not at all in the NISQ regime) and this claim is, of course, challenged by the Google claims.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">You claim that without quantum error correction to start with we cannot reach quantum supremacy. But maybe John Martinis’ experimental methods have some seeds of quantum error correction inside them?</span></p>
<p>Maybe <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" />  See this 2017 cartoon from <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/10/16/if-quantum-computers-are-not-possible-why-are-classical-computers-possible/">this post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/sulam35c2.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/sulam35c2.png?w=300&amp;h=223" alt="" width="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-18525" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>(Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/h6p_ZeMqGIU">nice overview video from 2014 about my stance and earlier work</a>.)</p>
<h2>The Google experiment: concerns and attacks</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Beside the critique on experimental evidence that could be tested did you find some concrete issues with the Google experiment?</span></p>
<p>Perhaps even too many <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> . In the first post and comments I raised quite a few objections. Some of them are relevant and some of them turned out to be irrelevant or incorrect. Anyway, here, taken from my first post, are some of my concerns and attempted attacks on the Google experiment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not enough experiments with full histograms; not enough experiments in the regime where they can be directly tested</li>
<li>Classical supremacy argument is overstated and is based on the performance of a specific algorithm</li>
<li>Error correlation may falsify the Google noise model</li>
<li>Low degree Fourier coefficients may fool the statistical test</li>
<li>(Motivated by <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317#comment-1819915">a comment</a> by Ryan.) It is easier to optimize toward the new statistical test “linear cross-ratio entropy” compared to the old logarithmic one.</li>
<li>“System calibration” may reflect an optimization towards the specific required circuit.</li>
<li>The interpolation argument is unjustified (because of the calibration issue).</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">We talked about items 1 and 2 what about 3-5. In particular, are correlated errors relevant to the Google experiment?</span></p>
<p>No! (As far as I can see.) Correlated errors mean that in the smoothing the flipped coordinates are positively correlated.  But for the random circuit and the (Porter Thomas) distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" />  this makes no difference!</p>
<p>As for item 4., it turns out (and this was essentially known by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03176">work of Gao and Duan</a>) that in the case of random circuits (unlike the case of Boson Sampling) there is no low degree coefficients to fool the statistical test.</p>
<p>As for item 5., the answer is “nice observation, but so what?” (Let me note that the supplementary paper of the Google team compares and analyzes the linear and logarithmic statistical measures.)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about the calibration? You got a little overworked about it, no?</span></p>
<p>In almost every scientific experiment there could be concerns that there will be some sort of biased data selection toward the hoped-for result.</p>
<p>Based on the description of the calibration method I got the impression that part of the calibration/verification process (“system calibration”) was carried out towards the experimental outcome for a specific circuit, and that this does not improve the fidelity as the authors thought but rather mistakenly tweaked the experimental outcomes toward a specific probability distribution. This type of calibration would be a major (yet innocent) flaw in the experiment. However, this possibility was excluded by a clear assertion of the researchers regarding the nature of the calibration process, and also by a more careful reading of the paper itself by Peter Shor and Greg Kuperberg. I certainly was, for a short while, way overconfident about this theory.</p>
<p>One nice (and totally familiar) observation is that a blind experiment can largely eliminate the concern of biased data selection.</p>
<h2>So how do you feel, Gil?</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">When did you hear about the Google claim?</span></p>
<p>There were certainly some reasons to think that Google’s quantum supremacy was coming for example a quanta magazine article by Kevin Hartnett entitled <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-supremacy-is-coming-heres-what-you-should-know-20190718/">Quantum Supremacy Is Coming: Here’s What You Should Know</a> and another article about Neven’s double exponential law. Also Scott Aaronson gave some hints about it.</p>
<p>On September 18, I met Thomas Vidick in a very nice conference of the Israeli and US academies on the future of computer science (it was mentioned in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/04/computer-science-and-its-impact-on-our-future/">this post</a>, links to all videos will be added <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wxd78iIjvQ&amp;list=PLRXul2qylCIQCRnAxKfXPm5II3TTne3WV">here</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozo5avBdlLk">Naftali Tishby’s lecture</a> is especially recommended.) Thomas told me about the new expected Google paper. Later that day I got involved in an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/john.preskill/posts/897725643486?comment_id=897734281176">amusing Facebook discussion</a> about related matters. (See Barry Simon’s first comment to Preskill’s post and the subsequent 15 comments.)</p>
<p>When I introduced Thomas to <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/09/03/the-prisonner-dilemma-sympathy-and-yaaris-challenge/">Menachem Yaari</a> (who was the president of the Israeli Academy), describing the former as a young superstar in quantum computation, Menachem’s reaction was: “but you do not believe in quantum computers.” I replied that I believe it is a fascinating intellectual area, and that perhaps I am even wrong about them being infeasible. Thomas said: “our area needs more people like Gil.” (!)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What about Scott?</span></p>
<p>Scott and I have been on friendly terms for many years and share a lot of interests and values. We are deeply divided regarding quantum computers and, naturally, I think that I am right and that Scott is wrong. In the context of the Google paper Scott’s references to me and my stance were <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4312#comment-1819487">peculiar</a> and even a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4312#comment-1819821">little hostile</a> which was especially strange since at that time I did not have access to the paper and Scott was the referee of the paper.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Gil, how do you vision a situation where you are proven wrong?</span></p>
<p>If my theory of quantum computation being derailed by noise inherent in quantum gates is proven wrong, then physicists will say that I am a mathematician and mathematicians will say that I am a combinatorialist.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">and how do you vision  a situation where you are proven right?</span><span id="more-18435"></span></p>
<p>If my theory of quantum computation being derailed by noise inherent in quantum gates is  proven successful, then physicists will say that I am a mathematician and mathematicians will say that I am a combinatorialist. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And what would you say if your theory  prevails?</span></p>
<p>Where I <em>have seen further</em> than others, it is because I stood on Peter Shor’s shoulders and looked at the opposite direction. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<h2>Topological</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">One last thing, Gil. Nick Read just</span> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4400#comment-1823614">commented</a> <span style="color: #0000ff;">that experimental evidence is gradually pointing towards you being false on the matter of topological quantum qubits.</span></p>
<p>Nick is a great guy and topological quantum computing is a great topic. The general situation is quite simple and it applies to topological quantum computing like any other form of quantum computing. The way I see it,  gradual experimental progress will hit a barrier and non-gradual experimental progress will be falsified.</p>
<p>(See this 2014 <a href="https://youtu.be/L5gSZsezhoQ">videotaped lecture of mine on topological quantum computing,</a> and also Section 3.5 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02499">The argument against quantum computers.</a>)</p>
<h2>Appendix: The probability distribution and the statistical tests</h2>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Let’s have an Appendix question. Can you try to briefly describe the probability distribution and the statistical test used in the Google paper?</span></p>
<p>Let me try. We start with a probability distribution described by the density function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+e%5E%7B-z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="z e^{-z}" class="latex" title="z e^{-z}" /> supported on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R_%2B&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R_+" class="latex" title="\mathbb R_+" />. Now we consider our set <em>X</em> of <em>0-1</em> vectors of length <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>We draw a random probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p(x)" class="latex" title="p(x)" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" />. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28x%29%3Dq%28x%29%2F2%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="p(x)=q(x)/2^n" class="latex" title="p(x)=q(x)/2^n" /> and the value of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="q(x)" class="latex" title="q(x)" /> is drawn at random from the probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z+e%5E%7B-z%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="z e^{-z}" class="latex" title="z e^{-z}" />.  (A very slight normalization may still be needed.) A probability distribution of this kind on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="\{0,1\}^n" /> is called a Porter-Thomas distribution.</p>
<p>A random quantum circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" /> leads to a (deterministic) probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" /> of this kind. A classical computer can compute the probabilities based on the description of the quantum circuits but this becomes increasingly hard with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />. A quantum computer can easily sample  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cin+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x \in \{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="x \in \{0,1\}^n" /> according to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" />.</p>
<p>We are given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t" class="latex" title="t" /> samples <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2C%5Cdots%2C+x_t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,\dots, x_t" class="latex" title="x_1,\dots, x_t" /> that our noisy quantum computer drew.</p>
<p>Our research hypothesis is that the samples are drawn from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho+D_C+%2B%281-%5Crho%29U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\rho D_C +(1-\rho)U" class="latex" title="\rho D_C +(1-\rho)U" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=U&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="U" class="latex" title="U" /> is a uniform distribution. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\rho" class="latex" title="\rho" /> is called the fidelity. The null hypothesis is that the samples were drawn uniformly at random. (There is also a finer description of the noisy distribution with a Gaussian low order term depending on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" />. (This can be seen already from the noise toy model above but I will not discuss it here.)</p>
<p>The main test used in the Google paper is an estimator for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Crho&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\rho" class="latex" title="\rho" />:</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7B2%5En%7D%7Bt%7D+%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5Et+D_C%28x_i%29+-1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\frac {2^n}{t} \sum_{i=1}^t D_C(x_i) -1" class="latex" title="\frac {2^n}{t} \sum_{i=1}^t D_C(x_i) -1" />.</p>
<p>They also considered a logarithmic version.</p>
<p>The samples in the experiment (at least when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> is large) are too sparse to identify the probability distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5En&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{0,1\}^n" class="latex" title="\{0,1\}^n" />. (This was one of my concerns that was also endorsed by Ryan.) But once you compute the probability distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" /> you can study statistically the set of probabilities that you obtained for your sample. The Google paper offers some interesting statistical studies and in particular a statistical comparison between the set of values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7BD_C%28x_i%29%3Ai%3D1%2C%5Cdots%2Ct%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{D_C(x_i):i=1,\dots,t\}" class="latex" title="\{D_C(x_i):i=1,\dots,t\}" />.</p></div>

I have had (as is pretty usual for me) some number of lunches with students this semester, and many of them asked me about the Computer Science move to Allston.  A lot of times, these questions are concerns:  what food will we have there, how frequently will buses run, what sort of space will there be for students to hang out/study etc., what all will be over there?<br /><br />These are good questions.  I don't know the answers, I think a lot is still being worked out or decided.  I realize that's not a great response. <br /><br />I've started encouraging students to start asking these questions, more directly, to the powers that be.  Specifically, I've suggested to the small number of undergrads I've been lunching with that they should start sending e-mails to the powers that be, asking whatever questions they have, and expressing their concerns.  If you have questions, or wishes, regarding the food, safety, transportation, etc. at the new Allston building, you should ask or let your desires be known.  And, I'll be frank here, you should not (just) let the faculty know -- we're at best an indirect channel to the powers, and they may listen to all of you more than they listen to us.  Contact the powers directly.<br /><br />(Graduate students too.)<br /><br />It might be more impactful if students organize to make their questions and/or wishes known.  Or not.  That's up to you really.  But if you want Allston to be successful from where you stand, now is a pretty good time to get involved, before we all start over there next fall.  For Allston to be the academic home you want, you may have to speak up. <br /><br />I realize undergrads might not know who are the powers that be that they should contact.  So I'll provide a starting list:<br /><br />Frank Doyle, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences<br />Claudine Gay, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences<br />Alan Garber, Provost<br />Rakesh Khurana, Dean of Harvard College<br />Amanda Claybaugh, Dean of Undergraduate Education<br /><br />And finally, yes, of course it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_That_Be_(Angel)">Buffy (well, Angel) reference</a>. <br /><br /></div>
