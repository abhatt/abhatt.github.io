The goals are similar to the <a style="color: #3f9291;" href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/visioning-workshop/">workshop of the same name</a> in 2008: to package these themes in a way that can be consumed <span class="im">by the general public, which we would deliver primarily to the Computing Community Consortium and others (e.g. funding agencies) to help them advocate for TCS.</span></div><div>While participation in the workshop is primarily through invitation, we have a few slots available for the broader community. If you are interested in participating, please see details of the application process below. The workshop will be organized according to area-wise breakout groups. Each breakout group will have 1-2 leads. Breakout groups will meet for 4-5 hours spread across several days and will be tasked with brainstorming ideas and preparing materials related to their topic. Leads are further expected to participate in plenary sessions held on Monday July 20 and Friday July 24 (4-5 hrs of additional time) where these materials will be discussed.</div><div>If you are interested in participating in the workshop, please fill out <a style="color: #3f9291;" href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">this Google form</a> by <strong>Monday June 15</strong>. On this form, applicants are asked to contribute one or two <span class="im">major results in the last 10 years whose significance can be explained in layperson terms, and one or two major challenges for theory whose significance can be explained in layperson terms. These descriptions </span>can be very brief. We will just use them to select participants and create breakout groups.</div></div>

<p>Today I woke up to the sad and shocking news that Jon Dowling (<a href="http://phys.lsu.edu/~jdowling/">homepage</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/jpdowling?lang=en">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Dowling">Wikipedia</a>)—physics professor at Louisiana State, guy who got the US government to invest in quantum computing back in the 90s, author of the popular book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schr%C3%B6dingers-Killer-App-Jonathan-Dowling/dp/1439896739">Schrödinger’s Killer App: Race to Build the World’s First Quantum Computer</a>, investigator of BosonSampling among many other topics, owner of a “QUBIT” license plate, and one of my main competitors in the field of quantum computing humor—has passed away at age 65, apparently due to complications from surgery.</p>



<p>Three months ago, right before covid shut down the world, the <em>last</em> travel I did was a seven-hour road trip from Austin to Baton Rouge, together with my postdoc <a href="https://twitter.com/a_rocchetto?lang=en">Andrea Rocchetto</a>, to deliver something called the <a href="https://calendar.lsu.edu/event/the_hearne_eminent_lecture_with_scott_aaronson#.Xtv1HDpKg2w">Hearne Lecture</a> at the Louisiana State physics department.  My topic (unsurprisingly) was Google’s quantum supremacy experiment.</p>



<p>I’d debated whether to cancel the trip, as flying already seemed too dangerous.  Dowling was the one who said “why not just drive here with one of your postdocs?”—which turned into a memorable experience for me and Andrea, complete with a personal tour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO">LIGO</a> and a visit to a baby alligator hatchery.  I had no inkling that it was the last time I’d ever see Jon Dowling, but am now super-glad that we made the visit.</p>



<p>At the dinner after my talk, Dowling was exactly the same as every other time I’d seen him: loud, piss-drunk, obnoxious, and hilarious.  He dominated the conversation with stories and jokes, referring in every other sentence either to his Irishness or my Jewishness.  His efforts to banter with the waitress, to elicit her deepest opinions about each appetizer and bottle of wine, were so over-the-top that I, sitting next to him, blushed, as if to say, “hey, I’m just the visitor here!  I don’t necessarily <em>endorse</em> this routine!”</p>



<p>But Dowling got away with it because, no matter how many taboos he violated per sentence, there was never any hint of malice in it.  He was an equal-opportunity offender, with his favorite target being himself.  He loved to talk, for example, about my pathological obsession with airy-fairy abstractions, like some kind of “polynomial hierarchy” that hopefully wouldn’t “collapse”—with the punchline being that he, the hardheaded laser physicist, then needed to learn what that meant for his own research.</p>



<p>The quantum computing community of the southern US, not to mention of Twitter and Facebook, and indeed of the entire world, will be poorer without this inimitable, louder-than-life presence.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>The next TCS+ talk<em> (and the last of the season!)</em> will take place this coming Wednesday, June 10th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC). <strong>Cliff Stein</strong> from Columbia University will speak about “<em>Parallel Approximate Undirected Shortest Paths Via Low Hop Emulators</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. Due to security concerns, <em>registration is required</em> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">on our<br />
website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to watch the talk live.) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see &gt;the website.</p>
<blockquote><p>Abstract: Although sequential algorithms with (nearly) optimal running time for finding shortest paths in undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights have been known for several decades, near-optimal parallel algorithms have turned out to be a much tougher challenge. In this talk, we present a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="(1+\varepsilon)" class="latex" title="(1+\varepsilon)" />-approximate parallel algorithm for computing shortest paths in undirected graphs, achieving polylog depth and near-linear work. All prior <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281%2B%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="(1+\varepsilon)" class="latex" title="(1+\varepsilon)" />-algorithms with polylog depth perform at least superlinear work. Improving this long-standing upper bound obtained by Cohen (STOC’94) has been open for 25 years.</p>
<p>Our algorithm uses several new tools. Prior work uses hopsets to introduce shortcuts in the graph. We introduce a new notion that we call low hop emulators. We also introduce compressible preconditioners, which we use in conjunction with Serman’s framework (SODA ’17) for the uncapacitated minimum cost flow problem.</p>

<p><em>[From Jelani Nelson and David Woodruff. This workshop can be very important to ensure TCS is represented in what is likely to be a difficult funding environment in coming years. –Boaz ]</em> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/catcs/">CATCS</a> will be hosting a virtual <strong>“Visioning Workshop”</strong> the <strong>week of </strong><strong>July 20</strong> in order to identify broad research themes within theoretical computer science (TCS) that have potential for a major impact in the future. The goals are similar to the <a href="https://thmatters.wordpress.com/visioning-workshop/">workshop of the same name</a> in 2008: to package these themes in a way that can be consumed by the general public, which we would deliver primarily to the Computing Community Consortium and others (e.g. funding agencies) to help them advocate for TCS.</p>



<p>While participation in the workshop is primarily through invitation, we have a few slots available for the broader community. If you are interested in participating, please see details of the application process below. The workshop will be organized according to area-wise breakout groups. Each breakout group will have 1-2 leads. Breakout groups will meet for 4-5 hours spread across several days and will be tasked with brainstorming ideas and preparing materials related to their topic. Leads are further expected to participate in plenary sessions held on Monday July 20 and Friday July 24 (4-5 hrs of additional time) where these materials will be discussed.</p>



<p>If you are interested in participating in the workshop, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">this Google form</a> by <strong>Monday June 15</strong> ( <a href="https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9">https://forms.gle/cdCTsLfUs56CDhKS9</a> ). On this form, applicants are asked to contribute one or two major results in the last 10 years whose significance can be explained in layperson terms, and one or two major challenges for theory whose significance can be explained in layperson terms. <em>[The results need not and generally will not be your own. They just should be easy-to-explain major results in your research area–Boaz] </em>These descriptions can be very brief. We will just use them to select participants and create breakout groups.</p></div>

In studying the expressiveness of neural networks, an important question is whether there are functions which can only be approximated by sufficiently deep networks, assuming their size is bounded. However, for constant depths, existing results are limited to depths $2$ and $3$, and achieving results for higher depths has been an important open question. In this paper, we focus on feedforward ReLU networks, and prove fundamental barriers to proving such results beyond depth $4$, by reduction to open problems and natural-proof barriers in circuit complexity. To show this, we study a seemingly unrelated problem of independent interest: Namely, whether there are polynomially-bounded functions which require super-polynomial weights in order to approximate with constant-depth neural networks. We provide a negative and constructive answer to that question, by showing that if a function can be approximated by a polynomially-sized, constant depth $k$ network with arbitrarily large weights, it can also be approximated by a polynomially-sized, depth $3k+3$ network, whose weights are polynomially bounded.</div>

Alfred Whitehead was a logician and philosopher, who had a student of some note. The student was Bertrand Russell and together they wrote the famous three-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Principia Mathematica</a>. It took several hundred pages to get to the result that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1+1=2}" class="latex" title="{1+1=2}" />.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/04/the-truth/pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-17124"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/pm.png?w=300&amp;h=125" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17124" height="125" /></a></p>
<p>
Amazing. </p>
<p>
Today I thought that discussing truth might be an interesting topic.</p>
<p>
Whitehead said: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I like this quote. Whitehead was not the best lecturer, however. He gave the prestigious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gifford_lectures">Gifford lectures</a> a year after the astronomer Arthur Eddington. As Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead">relates</a> quoting Victor Lowe: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course. The same audience turned up to Whitehead’s first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect. My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along … The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Between the pandemic and the unrest in our cities there is debate about what is the “truth”. On cable news—CNN, MSNBC, FOX—one hears statements about the truth. You can also hear statements like “the experts know” or the “model” shows that this is true. Can math shed light on these discussions? What would Whitehead say?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> What is the Truth? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Mathematical truth is the one absolute we can count on—right? Math is precise in its own way, but does it yield truth? Not so clear.</p>
<p>
Whitehead’s proof that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1+1=2}" class="latex" title="{1+1=2}" /> takes 100’s of pages; it may or may not increase your confidence. Here is a short “proof” that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2=1}" class="latex" title="{2=1}" />:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<table style="margin: auto;">
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/04/the-truth/proof-5/" rel="attachment wp-att-17125"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/proof.png?w=300&amp;h=195" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17125" height="195" /></a>

<p>
Math proofs are only as safe as two elements that are unavoidably social: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The care we use in applying our reasoning; and <p></p>
</li><li>
The care we use in choosing our assumptions.
</li></ol>
<p>
In the above proof snippet, one step divided by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> which is the source of the error that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2=1}" class="latex" title="{2=1}" />. A more worrisome issue is reasoning from assumptions. Wrong assumptions are a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Who are the Experts? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert">expert</a> is: An expert is somebody who has a broad and deep competence in terms of knowledge, skill and experience through practice and education in a particular field. </p>
<p>
More amusing definitions are: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Mark Twain defined an expert as “an ordinary fellow from another town.” Will Rogers described an expert as “A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase.” Danish scientist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr defined an expert as “A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I find the use of the term <i>expert</i> in regard to the pandemic at best puzzling. How can anyone be an expert when the current situation is unique? The last pandemic happened over a hundred years ago. Unfortunately Twain, Rogers, and Bohr are closer to being correct. The situation we find ourselves in today does not lend itself to being an expert. At least in my non-expert opinion.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/06/04/the-truth/not/" rel="attachment wp-att-17131"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/not.jpg?w=300&amp;h=102" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17131" height="102" /></a></p>
<p></p><p>
Yes there are people, for example, who are experts on various viral agents. But there is more we do not know about this agent that we do know. </p>
<ul>
<li>
Can you get the virus twice? <p></p>
</li><li>
Can children get the virus? <p></p>
</li><li>
Will a vaccine be possible? <p></p>
</li><li>
Are there long-term affects even for those who survive? <p></p>
</li><li>
And so on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Where are the Models? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Models are created by experts, so you probably guess that I am not bullish on models. There are lots of models, for example, on the projection of how many will be infected, and how many will get seriously sick, and sadly how many will succumb. These models are based on various assumptions about how the virus works. Most of these assumptions are not proved in any sense. </p>
<p>

<p>The<a href="https://itcrypto.github.io/2020main.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ITC 2020 program</a> is out, and this newborn looks healthy and strong! The program contains exciting new works in the area of Information-Theoretic Cryptography, confirming the importance of this new venue. </p>



<p>The PC, chaired by Daniel Wichs, also chose an amazing sequence of invited talks by Dachman-Soled, Natarajan, Jafar, Kol, Raz, and Vaikuntanathan, so this can also be a good opportunity to hear about the big recent developments in the area.</p>



<p><br />The conference will be virtual this year. Participation is free but requires registration. We hope to see many of you there</p>

<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Scott’s foreword:</span></strong> <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~landau/">Zeph Landau</a>, a noted quantum computing theorist at UC Berkeley who’s worked closely with my adviser Umesh Vazirani, recently asked me if he could write a guest post about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">pooled testing</a> for covid—an old idea that, Zeph argues, could play a crucial role in letting universities safely reopen this fall.  Seeing a small chance to do a great good, I readily agreed.</p>



<p>I should confess that I’m more … fatalistic than Zeph.  Not that I’m proud of it: I think that Zeph’s attitude is superior to mine.  But, like, I’m a theoretical computer scientist with zero expertise in medical testing or statistics, and <em>I</em> knew about pooled testing and its WWII origins—so imagine how thoroughly the actual experts must know the idea.  Just like they know all about variolation, and challenge trials, and copper fixtures, and UV light, and vitamin D supplements, and a dozen other possible tools against covid that future historians might ask why we didn’t try more.</p>



<p>As I’ve written before, I think our fundamental problem is not a lack of good ideas.  It’s that, outside of some isolated pockets of progress, our entire civilization no longer has the will (or ability? is there a difference?) to <em>implement</em> good ideas, or even really to try them.  For anything new that requires coordination, today there are just too many stakeholders who need to be brought on board, too many risks that need further study.  So I see Zeph, and anyone like him, as occupying a tragic position, a bit like that of an Aztec advocating the use of the wheel.  “Sure,” the Aztec elders might calmly reply, “wheeled transport is obvious enough that we’ve <em>all</em> considered it, but a moment’s thought reveals why, in our actually existing empire, it would be reckless, costly, and of at most marginal benefit…”</p>



<p>But I hope I’m wrong!  Better, I hope this post is the one that <em>proves</em> me wrong!  So without further ado, here’s…</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Zeph Landau’s Guest Post</span></strong></p>



<p>This post describes how every university could efficiently use modest testing resources to sensibly and extensively reduce the number of COVID-19 cases on their campus this fall.  It is meant as a call to action to the reader—because without a concerted effort to get the right people the necessary information and take immediate consequential action, a far worse alternative will be implemented almost everywhere. It is my sincere hope, that immediately after reading this post, you will take the following steps:</p>



<p>1) Figure out who is part of the reopening committee at your institution.</p>



<p>2) Find the right people and engage with them either as a fellow faculty member or, better yet, through a connection to get them good information about the information posted here.</p>



<p>3) Then stay engaged and keep pushing.  (See below for links to sample documents.)</p>



<p>OK, here we go.</p>



<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>



<p>How can we safely open a university or college campus such that we ensure that the number of cases does not drastically increase through the newfound interactions between the population?</p>



<p>One obvious, albeit impractical, solution to opening universities is to test everyone, everyday and isolate those that test positive quickly.  Unfortunately, we can’t do that due to costs ($100 per student per day) and availability of tests (on the order of 1000 tests per day at university testing labs).</p>



<p><em>Turns out there is a solution that uses drastically fewer tests and is commensurate in detecting an outbreak. It is called pooled screening which is a variant of pooled testing.</em></p>



<p><strong>The missing piece: early detection surveillance</strong></p>



<p>So how do we detect most contagious people quickly if we don’t have the resources to test everyone regularly?  The answer is by pooled testing—or to be more accurate (I’ll be clear about why this distinction is important later) <strong>pooled screening. </strong>The idea of pooling is old (attributed to Dorfman in the 40’s), simple, and has been used over and over in all kinds of scenarios. Pooled testing works by mixing samples together from a group and then administering a single test to the mixture. The test is designed to be sensitive enough to come up positive whenever <em>at least one</em> underlying sample is positive. Instead of testing each sample individually, you test the mixture, and then only those groups that test positive undergo a second round of testing of each individual sample. The individuals do not need to deliver a second sample; there is more than enough biological material for multiple tests per sample. When prevalence of a disease is low, most pools come up negative and you save a large amount of testing resources and time.  (For those more visually inclined, here is a one minute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdC6irz_vys&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> on pooled testing.)</p>



<p>So what would a good early detection surveillance system look like?  Here is a reasonable and doable framework:</p>



<ul><li>Divide the campus population into three groups (call them A, B, and C).</li><li>Collect samples from each group twice a week, (e.g. Group A: M/Th, Group B: Tu/Fri, Group C Wed/Sat).</li><li>Pool test the samples in groups of 16.</li></ul>



<p>What kinds of resources would this use?</p>



<ul><li>For a 10,000 person campus, you’d need about 200 tests per day, 6 days a week.  The universities that have implemented testing labs typically have the capacity to do on the order of 1000 tests a day.</li><li>Assuming a rough cost of $100 a test (which should be an overestimate if they are using their own lab), it would amount to a $12 a student/ per week.  </li></ul>



<p>What would it accomplish?  It would quickly find outbreaks and new cases.  Under a few different assumptions of the time-course of the viral load in a person, <em>the expected time for detecting an infectious person in this scheme is under 3 days. </em>Those cases would then need to be fed into an existing contact tracing and quarantine protocol.  The result: an outbreak suppressed before it had a chance to get going.</p>



<p>So why aren’t we already doing this?  Read on…</p>



<p><strong>The fear of false negatives in pooling</strong></p>



<p>The general concern to implementing pooling  for Covid-19 in the US is two-fold. </p>



<ol><li>Without the creation of a better test the dilution effect will make the test less sensitive and in turn produce more false negatives.  </li><li>Even if you could solve the scientific sensitivity issue, navigating the process of getting government approval is a big barrier.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s take each of these concerns in turn.  The first is definitely a concern if the goal is 1:1 medical testing.  If a sample can be barely seen as positive in an individual test, then the risk is that the dilution effect when pooled with others will cause the group test to come out negative—giving a wrong result to the positive individual.  The word for this is “sensitivity”, i.e. if a test has 95% sensitivity it means that it’ll be accurate 95% of the time and produce a false negative 5% of the time.  So how sensitive would a pooled test be where you combined 16 individual samples into 1 and just ran it through an existing 1:1 test?  Lab data suggests it would have at least 70% sensitivity.  For 1:1 testing this is a non-starter, however, <strong>the goal is early detection </strong>of an outbreak, which is different and as we shall see, a 70% sensitivity does fine for this purpose.</p>



<p>Suppose you are doing early detection surveillance and imagine that an outbreak starts.  Imagine 3 people are infected.  Because you are sampling every 3 days, you’ll be getting at least 6 positive samples, and the chances that your 70% screen misses all 6 is tiny.  As soon as it catches one, a contact tracing protocol is initiated and the others will be found.</p>



<p>Another way to formulate what is going on is that you are trading sensitivity for speed (in the form of capacity and cost)—and that is a huge win.  The pooling and more frequent testing gives you that speed versus sensitivity tradeoff.  Sure, Lebron James (a 70% free-throw shooter) won’t make every free throw, but the chance that he misses 6 in a row is tiny.</p>



<p>For some, the above thinking is straightforward.  However, for the medical testing paradigm—where the goal is the most accurate test for an individual using the one sample you have—this point of view is foreign and in many ways almost out of reach.   </p>



<p>OK.  So with the concern of sensitivity laid to rest, what about the second concern?  That the regulations will get in the way.  It turns out that this isn’t an issue though again, it is slightly counterintuitive for those who work in medical testing.  The task is surveillance, and therefore the pooling test is being used as a screen (not a medical test): negative group tests are not reported to the individual as a negative test result.   Positive groups are deconvoluted for individual testing and results returned to the person who is positive individually.  HHS/CLIA has indicated there aren’t regulatory restrictions as long as you don’t return test results due to the pooled test.</p>



<p>It is important to re-emphasize that the above is for pooled screening (where negative results are not returned), which is in contrast to pooled testing (where negative pools are reported as negative test results for each individual).  For pooled testing, which has received a jump of coverage due to its use recently in Wuhan, there are large regulatory hurdles—the CDC is just formulating criteria for clearing those hurdles and the science looks like, for now, that most labs wouldn’t be able to get above pools of size 5 or so.</p>



<p><strong>How do you safely collect so many samples?</strong></p>



<p>A different direction of concern for early detection surveillance is the logistics and feasibility around collecting samples.  To date, the gold standard for sampling is a deep nasal swab that requires a professional to do it, requires PPE equipment, and is not a pleasant experience.  Using this method wouldn’t work logistically on campus.</p>



<p>However, there are other sampling techniques that allow people to self-sample, both in the form of a shallow nasal swab and saliva based techniques.  The stated concern is obvious: there is a worry that these sampling techniques are less sensitive.  There is some evidence that this is not the case (and even the opposite) but regardless, as has been discussed— in early detection surveillance it is OK to take a hit on sensitivity.  The system remains robust because of the frequent testing and the goal of detecting an outbreak, not every individual.</p>



<p>Being able to self-sample removes a huge bottleneck.  The picture is very much simplified.  Students/faculty/staff self-sample on their prescribed days (either in the presence of a medical professional or not depending on the approved protocol) and then drop off their sample at any of various drop-off stations on campus.  Those stations deliver the samples to the testing facility for pooling and testing.</p>



<p><strong>You can help to get this done</strong></p>



<p>Is what I’m describing a new idea?  As far as I can tell, the answer is both no and yes.  Pooled testing is in the news both as a theoretical idea and now as being implemented at some scale—in Israel, in a lab in Nebraska, and most recently in Wuhan.   But using pooling as a screen (not a medical test) within an early detection surveillance system that repeatedly screens everyone is, as far as I know, not in the discussion.</p>



<p>What seems clear is that right now—reopening committees and labs are perhaps aware of the idea of pooling but only as a theoretical idea of a technology that might be coming at some vague time in the future.  They are unaware that in the form of early detection surveillance, it is right in front of them ready to go.  They’d need a matter of weeks to convert a 1:1 lab into a lab that could handle both pooled screening and 1:1 testing (this <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069062v2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lab</a> did it, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FVp55JAs2heqV5ktyGVVdoE-W_XTKmZgCWBy1SEoo-o/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> is a brief outline of the steps).  In the same timeline, they could develop a system for handling the logistics of sampling large numbers of people.</p>



<p><strong>And that is where each of you come in… </strong>  you can help get these ideas to the right people.  It needs to be done quickly because decisions are being made now as to what to do.  The right people are your colleagues—you just have to find out who they are and reach out to them personally.  You can find out who is on the reopening committee, you can track down faculty members in public health and microbiology.  They are often busy and might be skeptical of what an outsider can offer, but keep trying because my experience has been that if you keep at it and follow up, they will listen and be grateful for the information.</p>

<div class="content">
In a seminal work, Kopparty et al. (J. ACM 2017) constructed asymptotically good $n$-bit locally decodable codes (LDC) with $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\log{n}})}$ queries. A key ingredient in their construction is a distance amplification procedure by Alon et al. (FOCS 1995) which amplifies the distance $\delta$ of a code to a constant at a  $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ multiplicative cost in query complexity. Given the pivotal role of the AEL distance amplification procedure in the state-of-the-art constructions of LDC as well as LCC and LTC, one is prompt to ask whether the $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ factor in query complexity can be reduced.

Our first contribution is a significantly improved distance amplification procedure for LDC. The cost is reduced from $\mathrm{poly}(1/\delta)$ to, roughly, the query complexity of a length $1/\delta$ asymptotically good LDC. We derive several applications, one of which allows us to convert a $q$-query LDC with extremely poor distance $\delta = n^{-(1-o(1))}$ to a constant distance LDC with $q^{\mathrm{poly}(\log\log{n})}$ queries. As another example, amplifying distance $\delta = 2^{-(\log{n})^\alpha}$, for any constant $\alpha &lt; 1$, will require $q^{O(\log\log\log{n})}$ queries using our procedure.

Motivated by the fruitfulness of distance amplification,  we investigate the natural question of rate amplification. Our second contribution is identifying a rich and natural class of LDC and devise two (incomparable) rate amplification procedures for it. These, however, deteriorate the distance, at which point a distance amplification procedure is invoked. Combined, the procedures convert any $q$-query LDC in our class, having rate $\rho$ and, say, constant distance, to an asymptotically good LDC with $q^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\rho)}$ queries.</div>

<div class="content">
In March many Colleges sent students home and the rest of the semester was online. This was quite disruptive for the students. Schools, quite reasonably, wanted to make it less traumatic for students.<br />
<br />
So what to do about grades? There are two issues. I state the options I have heard.<br />
<br />
<br />
ISSUE ONE  If P/F How to Got About it?<br />
<br />
1) Grade as usual.<br />
<br />
2) Make all classes P/F.<br />
<br />
PRO: Much less pressure on students.<br />
<br />
CON: Might be demoralizing for the good students.<br />
<br />
3) Make all classes P/F but allow students to opt for letter grades BUT they must decide before the last day of class. Hence teachers must post cutoffs before the final is graded<br />
<br />
CON: Complicated and puts (a) teachers in an awkward position of having to post cutoffs before the final, and (b) puts students in an awkward position of having to predict how well they would do.<br />
<br />
CON: A student can blow off a final knowing they will still get a D (passing) in the course.<br />
<br />
PRO: Good students can still get their A's<br />
<br />
CAVEAT: A transcript might look very strange. Say I was looking at a graduate school applicant and I see<br />
<br />
Operating Systems: A<br />
<br />
Theory of Computation: P<br />
<br />
I would likely assume that the Theory course the student got a C. And that might be unfair.<br />
<br />
3) Make all classes P/F but allow students to opt for letter grades AFTER seeing their letter grades. <br />
<br />
PRO: Less complicated an awkard<br />
<br />
PRO: A students blah blah<br />
<br />
CAVEAT above still applies.<br />
<br />
ISSUE TWO If P/F what about a D in the major<br />
<br />
At UMCP COMP SCI (and I expect other depts)<br />
<br />
a D is a passing grade for the University<br />
<br />
but<br />
<br />
a D is not a passing grade for the Major.<br />
<br />
So if a s CS Major gets a D in Discrete Math that does not count for the major--- they have to take it over again.<br />
<br />
But if classes are P/F what do do about that.<br />
<br />
Options<br />
<br />
1) Students have to take classes in their major for a letter grade.<br />
<br />
CON: The whole point of the P/F is to relieve pressure on the students in these hard times.<br />
<br />
PRO: None.<br />
<br />
2) Students taking a course in their major who get a D will still get a P on the transcript but will be told that they have to take the class over again.<br />
<br />
3) Do nothing, but tell the students<br />
<br />
IF you got a D in a course in your major and you are taking a sequel, STUDY HARD OVER THE SUMMER!<br />
<br />
4) Do nothing, but tell the teachers<br />
<br />
Students in the Fall may have a weak background. Just teach the bare minimum of what they need for the major.<br />
<br />
(Could do both 3 and 4)<br />
<br />
SO- what is your school doing and how is it working?</div>

<p>Today, I interrupt the news of the rapid disintegration of the United States of America, on every possible front at once (medical, economic, social…), to bring you something far more important: a long-planned <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2020/06/01/99-scott-aaronson-on-complexity-computation-and-quantum-gravity/">two-hour podcast</a>, where theoretical physicist and longtime friend-of-the-blog <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/">Sean Carroll</a> interviews yours truly about complexity theory!  Here’s Sean’s description of this historic event:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There are some problems for which it’s very hard to find the answer, but very easy to check the answer if someone gives it to you. At least, we think there are such problems; whether or not they really exist is the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">P vs NP problem</a>, and actually proving it will win you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems">a million dollars</a>. This kind of question falls under the rubric of “computational complexity theory,” which formalizes how hard it is to computationally attack a well-posed problem. Scott Aaronson is one of the world’s leading thinkers in computational complexity, especially the wrinkles that enter once we consider quantum computers as well as classical ones. We talk about how we quantify complexity, and how that relates to ideas as disparate as creativity, knowledge vs. proof, and what all this has to do with black holes and quantum gravity.</p></blockquote>



<p>So, OK, I guess I should also comment on the national disintegration thing.  As someone who was once himself the victim of a crazy police overreaction (albeit, trivial compared to what African-Americans regularly deal with), I was moved by the scenes of police chiefs in several American towns taking off their helmets and joining protesters to cheers.  Not only is that a deeply moral thing to do, but it serves a practical purpose of quickly defusing the protests.  Right now, of course, is an <em>even worse time than usual</em> for chaos in the streets, with a lethal virus still spreading that doesn’t care whether people are congregating for good or for ill.  If rational discussion of policy still matters, I support the current push to end the “qualified immunity” doctrine, end the provision of military training and equipment to police, and generally spur the nation’s police to rein in their psychopath minority.</p></div>

<p><em>[Note: While I and many others are fortunate to be able to go on with our work, deadlines, and (as mentioned in this post) seminars, this is not the case for many in the U.S. following yet another demonstration that black lives don’t matter as much as they should in this country. I would like to relay <a href="https://twitter.com/red_abebe/status/1267145593991946245">Rediet Abebe’s call</a> to support local organizations. As Rediet says “These problems have been and will be here for a very long time. We’re not solving racism this month.”. –Boaz]</em></p>



<p>For the last year, I have been co organizing a <a href="https://mltheory.org/#talks">theory of machine learning seminar</a> at Harvard. Following the format of our prior Harvard/MSR/MIT theory reading group, these have been extended blackboard talks with plenty of audience interaction.</p>



<p>Following COVID-19, the last three talks in the semester (by Moritz Hardt,  Zico Kolter, and Anima Anandkumar)  were given virtually. Frankly, I was at first unsure whether these seminars can work in the virtual format but was pleasantly surprised. Talks have been very interactive, with plenty of audience participation in the chat channel. In fact, the virtual format has some <em>advantages </em>over physical talks. Sometimes a question will be asked and answered by a co-author over chat, without the speaker needing to interrupt the talk.</p>



<p>Since the seminars were so successful, we decided to continue holding them over the summer. We have an exciting line up of confirmed speakers, and more will come soon. See <a href="https://mltheory.org/#talks">our webpage</a> for more details, which also contains a google calendar and a mailing list you can sign up for to get the Zoom link.</p>



<p>Confirmed speakers so far include:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://www.sohldickstein.com/">Jascha Sohl-Dickstein</a> – June 11</li><li><a href="https://www.neyshabur.net/">Behnam Neyshabur</a> – June 18</li><li><a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a> – July 9</li><li><a href="https://www.cohennadav.com/">Nadav Cohen</a> – August 6</li><li><a href="https://maithraraghu.com/">Maithra Raghu</a> – date tbd</li><li><a href="https://research.google/people/HanieSedghi/">Hanie Sedghi</a> – date tbd</li></ul>

<p class="justify-text">Supervised learning methods come in a variety of flavors. While local averaging techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">nearest-neighbors</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning">decision trees</a> are often used with low-dimensional inputs where they can adapt to any potentially non-linear relationship between inputs and outputs, methods based on empirical risk minimization are the most commonly used in high-dimensional settings. Their principle is simple: optimize the (potentially regularized) risk on training data over prediction functions in a pre-defined set of functions.</p>



<p class="justify-text">When the set of a functions is a convex subset of a vector space with a finite-dimensional representation, with standard assumptions, the corresponding optimization problem is convex. This has the benefits of allowing a thorough theoretical understanding of the computational and statistical properties of learning methods, which often come with strong theoretical guarantees, in terms of running time [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4980">1</a>, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1080173">2</a>, <a href="http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/bach_jenatton_mairal_obozinski_FOT.pdf">3</a>] or prediction performance on unseen data [<a href="https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms.pdf">4</a>, <a href="http://static.stevereads.com/papers_to_read/all_of_statistics.pdf">5</a>]. In particular, the linear parameterization can be done either explicitly by building a typically large finite set of features, or implicitly through the use of kernel methods and then a series of dedicated algorithms and theories can be leveraged for efficient non-linear predictions [6, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3182-random-features-for-large-scale-kernel-machines.pdf">7</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6978-falkon-an-optimal-large-scale-kernel-method.pdf">8</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, linearly-parameterized sets of functions do not include neural networks, which lead to state-of-the-art performance in most learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, speech processing, in particular through the use of deep and convolutional neural networks [<a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">9</a>].</p>



<h2>Two-layer neural networks with “relu” activations</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The goal of this blog post is to provide some understanding of why supervised machine learning work for the simplest form of such models: $$ h(x) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i ( b_i^\top x)_+ = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m a_i \max\{ b_i^\top x,0\},$$ where the input \(x\) is a vector in \(\mathbb{R}^d\), and \(m\) is the number of hidden neurons. The weights \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>output weights</em>, while the weights \(b_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\), \(i=1,\dots,n\), are the <em>input weights</em>. The rectified linear unit (“relu”) [<a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v15/glorot11a/glorot11a.pdf">10</a>] activation is used, and our results will depend heavily on its positive homogeneity (that is, for \(\lambda &gt; 0\), \((\lambda u)_+ = \lambda u_+\)).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="407" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/nn_single_blog.png" class="wp-image-3829" height="292" />Two-layer neural network in dimension \(d = 6\) with \(m=4\) hidden neurons, and a single output.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Note that this is an idealized and much simplified set-up for deep learning, as there is a single hidden-layer, no convolutions, no pooling, etc. As I will show below, this simple set-up is already complex to understand, and I believe it captures some of the core difficulties associated with non-convexity.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The first question that one may come to after decades of research in learning theory is: <em>why is it so hard to analyze?</em>  </p>



<p class="justify-text">There are at least two major difficulties:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Non-linearity</strong>: the dependence on the input weights \(b_i\)’s is non-linear because of the activation function, typically leading to non-convex optimization problems.</li><li><strong>Overparameterization</strong>: The number \(m\) of hidden neurons is very large (often so large that the number of parameters \(m(d+1)\) exceeds the number of observations), which is hard in terms of optimization and potentially generalization to unseen data. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we will leverage the overparameterization and take \(m\) tending to infinity (without any dependence on the number of observations), which will allow us to derive theoretical results. We will leverage two key properties of the problem:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Separability</strong> of the model in \(w_i = (a_i,b_i)\), that is, the prediction function \(h(x)\) is the sum of terms which are independently parameterized, as \(h = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i)\), where \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\), with \(\mathcal{F}\) a space of functions. In our situation, \(p = d+1\) and: $$ \Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+. $$ In other words,  there is no parameter sharing among hidden neurons. Unfortunately, this does not generalize to more than a single hidden layer.</li><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong>: the relu activation is positively homogeneous so that as as function of \(w = (a,b) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^d\), \(\Phi(w)(x) = a (b^\top x)_+\) is positively 2-homogeneous, that is, \(\Phi(\lambda w) = \lambda^2 \Phi(w)\) for \(\lambda &gt; 0\).</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In this sequence of two blog posts, following a recent trend in optimization and machine learning theory [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4900-non-strongly-convex-smooth-stochastic-approximation-with-convergence-rate-o1n.pdf">11</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/32/15849.full.pdf">12</a>], optimization and statistics cannot be separated and need to be tackled together. I will focus on gradient flows on empirical or expected risks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I will cover optimization and how over-parameterization leads to global convergence for 2-homogeneous models, a recent result obtained two years ago with <a href="https://lchizat.github.io/">Lénaïc Chizat</a> [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]. This requires tools from optimal transport which I will briefly describe (for more details, see, e.g., [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00567">14</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Next month, I will focus on generalization capabilities and the several implicit biases associated with gradient descent in this context [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8559-on-lazy-training-in-differentiable-programming.pdf">15</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>



<h2>Infinitely wide limit and probability measures</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Following the standard learning set-up, our goal will be to minimize with respect to the prediction function \(h\) the functional \(R\) defined as $$ R(h) = \mathbb{E}_{p(x,y)} \big[ \ell( y, h(x) ) \big],$$ where \(\ell(y,h(x))\) is the loss incurred by outputting \(h(x)\) when \(y\) is the true label. Even within deep learning, this loss is most often convex in its second argument, such as for least-squares or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification">logistic</a> losses. Thus, I will assume that \(R\) is convex.</p>



<p>The expectation can be considered in two scenarios:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Empirical risk</strong>: this corresponds to the situation where we have observations \((x_j,y_j)\), \(j=1,\dots,n\), coming from some joint distribution on \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\). Minimizing \(R\) then may not lead to any guarantee on unseen data unless some explicit or implicit regularization is used. In next blog post, I will consider the implicit regularization effect of gradient-based algorithms.</li><li><strong>Expected risk (or generalization performance)</strong>: The expectation is taken with respect to unseen data, and thus its value (or a gradient) cannot be computed. However, any training observation \((x_j,y_j)\) can lead to an unbiased estimate, and if single pass stochastic gradient is used, our guarantees will be on the expected risk.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The main and very classical idea is to consider the minimization of $$ G(W) = G(w_1,\dots,w_m) = R \Big( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \Phi(w_i) \Big),$$ and see it as the minimization of $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ with respect to a probability measure \(\mu\), with the equivalence for $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ where \(\delta(w_i)\) is the Dirac measure at \(w_i\). See an illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="615" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/diracs_measures-1-1024x156.png" class="wp-image-3852" height="93" />Left: discrete probability measure. Right: measure with density.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) is large, we can represent any measure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_measures#Weak_convergence_of_measures">weak sense</a> (that is, expectations of any continuous and bounded functions can be approximated). The benefits of considering the space of all measures instead of discrete measures have been used already in variety of contexts in machine learning, statistics and signal processing [<a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/~arb4/publications_files/UniversalApproximationBoundsForSuperpositionsOfASigmoidalFunction.pdf">17</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2800-convex-neural-networks.pdf">18</a>, <a href="http://jmlr.org/papers/volume18/14-546/14-546.pdf">19</a>]. In this blog post, the key benefit is that the set of measures in convex and \(h = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \) is linear in the measure \(\mu\), so that our optimization problem has become convex.</p>



<p class="justify-text">However, (1) It does not buy much in practice, as the set of probability measures is infinite-dimensional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank–Wolfe_algorithm">Frank-Wolfe algorithms</a> can be used, but the choice of new neurons is a difficult optimization problem, NP-hard for the threshold activation function [<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/070685798">20</a>], with polynomial potentially high complexity for the relu activation [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v65/goel17a/goel17a.pdf">21</a>], and (2) this is not what is used in practice, which is (stochastic) gradient descent.</p>



<h2>Finite-dimensional gradient flow</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I will consider the gradient flow $$\dot{W} = \ – m \nabla G(W),$$ (where \(m\) is added as a normalization factor to allow a well-defined limit when \(m\) tends to infinity). This is still not exactly what is used in practice, but, as explained in <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month post</a>, this is a good approximation of gradient descent (if using the empirical risk, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on the empirical risk only), or stochastic gradient descent (if doing a single pass on the data, then leading to guarantees of global convergence on unseen data). This is a non-convex dynamics, with stationary points and local minima, even when \(m\) is large (see, e.g., [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/safran18a/safran18a.pdf">27</a>]).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Two main questions arise: (1) what does the gradient flow dynamics converge to when the number of neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, and (2) can we get any global convergence guarantees for the limiting dynamics?</p>



<h2>Mean-field limit and Wasserstein gradient flows</h2>



<p class="justify-text">When \(m\) tends to infinity, since we want to use the measure representation, we need to understand the effect of performing the gradient flow jointly on \(w_1,\dots,w_m\) on the measure $$ \mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i),$$ and see if we can take a limit when \(m\) tends to infinity. This process of taking limits is common in physics and often referred to as the “mean-field” limit, and has been considered in a series of recent works [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05438">22</a>, <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/115/33/E7665.full.pdf">23</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.00915">24</a>]. To avoid too much technicality, I will assume that the map \(\Phi\) is sufficiently differentiable, which unfortunately exclude the relu activation; for dedicated results, see [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Gradient flows on metric spaces.</strong> In order to understand the dynamics in the space of probability measures, we need to take a step backward and realize that gradient flows can be defined for many functions \(f\) on any metric space \(\mathcal{X}\). Indeed, it can be seen as the limit of taking infinitesimal steps of length \(\gamma\), where each new iterate \(x_{k+1}\) (corresponding to the value at time \(k\gamma\)) is defined recursively from \(x_k\) as $$x_{k+1} \in \arg\min_{x \in \mathcal{X}}\  f(x) + \frac{1}{2\gamma} d(x,x_k)^2.$$ As shown in [<a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~sayan/ambrosio.pdf">25</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13373-017-0101-1.pdf">26</a>], with some form of interpolation, this defines a curve with prescribed values \(x_k\) at each \(\gamma k\), and when the step-size \(\gamma\) goes to zero, this curves “converges” to the gradient flow.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="419" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/euler-1024x520.png" class="wp-image-3960" height="212" />Gradient flow in bold black, with interpolating curve in red from 14 points \(x_0,\dots,x_{13}\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">For the space \(\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d\) with the Euclidean distance and a continuously differentiable function \(f\), we obtain that $$x_{k+1} = x_k – \gamma f'(x_k) + o(\gamma),$$ and we get the usual gradient flow associated to \(f\), and the scheme above is nothing less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler discretization</a> that was described <a href="https://francisbach.com/gradient-flows/">last month</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Vector space gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> Probability measures are a convex subset of measures with finite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation#Total_variation_of_probability_measures">total variation</a>, which is equal to the \(\ell_1\)-norm between densities when the two probability measures have densities with respect to the same base measure. It is a normed vector space for which we could derive our first type of gradient flow, which can be seen as a continuous version of Frank-Wolfe algorithm, where atoms are added one by one, until convergence.  </p>



<p class="justify-text">As mentioned above, the fact that atoms are created sequentially seems attractive computationally. However, (1) deciding which one to add is a computationally hard problem, and (2) the flow on measures cannot be approximated by a finite evolving set of “particles” (here hidden neurons each defined by a vector \(w \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}\)).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Wasserstein gradient flows on probability measures.</strong> There is another natural distance here, namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric">Wasserstein distance</a> (sometimes called the Kantorovich–Rubinstein distance). In order to remain short, I will only define it between empirical measures $$\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i) \mbox{ and } \nu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(v_i)$$ with the same number of points. The squared 2-Wasserstein distance is obtained by minimizing $$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \| w_j – v_{\sigma(j)} \|_2^2$$ over all permutations \(\sigma: \{1,\dots,m\} \to \{1,\dots,m\}\). See illustration below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="573" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein-2-1024x307.png" class="wp-image-3886" height="171" />Wasserstein distance between two empirical measures: (left) original observations of two empirical measures with \(m = 11\) points, (right) assigning all black points to red points by minimizing the sum of squared distances between assigned points.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">This can be extended to any pair of probability measures, and used within gradient flows, it has a very natural decoupling property: if \(\mu\) is fixed, and \(\nu\) is within a small distance of \(\mu\) in Wasserstein distance, then the optimal permutation above will always be the same, that is, locally, the Wasserstein distance is a sum of squared Euclidean distances. Then, the Wasserstein gradient flow will lead to \(m\) independent local regular Euclidean gradient flows, which interact through the gradient term as: $$ \dot{w}_i = \ –  \nabla \Phi(w_i)  \nabla R\Big(\int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi d\mu \Big),$$ where the Jacobian \(\nabla \Phi(w_i)\) is a linear operator from \(\mathcal{F}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^p\), and \( \nabla R: \mathbb{R}^p \to \mathcal{F}\) the gradient operator of \(R\). Since \(\mu = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \delta(w_i)\), the dynamics of each particle interacts through the gradient of \(R\). </p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="456" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wasserstein_flows-1024x508.png" class="wp-image-3890" height="225" />Gradient flow for \(m=7\) interacting particles.</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">The intuitive reasoning above is behind the formal result for the function $$ F(\mu) = R \Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \Phi(w) d\mu(w) \Big),$$ that the limit of the Euclidean gradient flow on each particle when \(m\) tends to infinity, is exactly the Wasserstein gradient flow of \(F\). While I have proposed an intuitive explanation, this can be made more formal in particular through the use of partial differential equations on the density of the measure [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>] (see also nice <a href="http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~kcraig/math/curriculum_vitae_files/NIPS_120917.pdf">slides</a> from Katy Craig on Wasserstein gradient flows).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Stationary points.</strong> Since \(R\) is assumed convex over the convex set of probability measures, all local minima of \(R\) are global, and we should expect the gradient flow to converge to global optimum from any initial measure. This is true for the gradient flow associated with the total variation metric. However this is not true for the Wasserstein gradient flow, for which stationary points which are not global minimizers exist (given that for discrete measures this corresponds to classical backpropagation, this is well known to anybody who has ever trained a neural network). Note that there exists a notion of convexity for Wasserstein gradient flows, namely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_convexity">geodesic convexity</a>, but the function \(F\) is not geodesically convex in general.</p>



<h2>Global convergence</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We can now describe the main result from our recent work with Lénaïc [<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7567-on-the-global-convergence-of-gradient-descent-for-over-parameterized-models-using-optimal-transport.pdf">13</a>]: under assumptions described below, for the function \(F\) defined above, if the Wasserstein gradient flow converges to a measure, this measure has to be a global minimum of \(F\) (note that we cannot prove it is always convergent).</p>



<p class="justify-text">On top of technical regularity assumptions that I will not describe here, we need two crucial broad assumptions:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><strong>Homogeneity</strong> of the function \(\Phi: \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \to \mathcal{F}\). We need a condition of this form, since if \(R\) is a linear function, then \(F(\mu)\) is of the form \(F(\mu) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^p} \psi(w)d\mu(w)\) with \(\psi(w) = R(\Phi(w))\), and the Wasserstein gradient flow will converge to a weighted some of Diracs at all local minimizers of \(\psi\), which is typically not a global minimizer.</li><li><strong>Initialization with positive mass in all directions</strong>. That is, \(w_i\)’s are uniformly distributed on the sphere or Gaussian, which is the de facto choice in practice. </li></ul>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Illustration</strong>. We illustrate the result above by considering \(R\) as the square loss and \(y\) being generated from \(x\) through a neural network with \(m_0=5\) neurons. When running the gradient flow above, as soon as \(m \geqslant 5\), the model is sufficiently flexible to attain zero loss, which is thus the global optimum of the cost function. However, the gradient flow may not reach it, as it gets trapped in a local optimum. Our theoretical result suggests that when \(m\) is large, we should converge to the original neurons, which we see below. The surprising (and still unexplained) phenomenon is that \(m\) does not need to be much larger than \(m_0\) to see practical global convergence.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="389" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ReLU_m5-1024x683.png" class="wp-image-3942" height="259" />Position of \(m = 5\) neurons, plotted as \(|a_i| b_i \in \mathbb{R}^2\) for a two-dimensional problem. The five dotted lines are the directions of the generating neurons. Although \(m\) is large enough to lead to the global optimum, the flow gets stuck in a local optimum.</figure></div>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img width="365" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ReLU_m10-1024x683.png" class="wp-image-3943" height="243" />Position of \(m = 10\) neurons; same setting as above.

<h2>Discussion and open problems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, I described theoretical results showing the benefits of overparameterization: when the number of hidden neurons \(m\) tends to infinity, then the corresponding gradient flow converges to the global optimum of the cost function. The proof relies notably on homogeneity properties of the relu activation. </p>



<p class="justify-text">The main weakness of  this result is that is only <em>qualitative</em>: we cannot quantify how big \(m\) need to be to be close to the infinite width limit, or how fast the gradient flow converges to the global optimum. These are still open problems. Additional interesting areas of research are to extend these results to convolutional and/or deep networks.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know that we can obtain global convergence, I will describe next month the generalization properties when interpolating the training data with an overparameterized relu network [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04486">16</a>].</p>

There are any number of these lists but for me they should include at least <em>12 Monkeys</em>, <em>Primer</em>, <em>Safety Not Guaranteed</em>, <em>Donnie Darko</em>, and <em>Time Bandits</em>. This one adds <em>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</em>, also good. I’d have thrown in <em>The Infinite Man</em> but it’s obscure enough that I’m not offended by its absence. The relevant one for my class, <em>Retroactive</em>, can stay off.</p>

A collection of sets displays a proximity gap with respect to some property if for every set in the collection, either (i) all members are $\delta$-close to the property in relative Hamming distance or (ii) only a tiny fraction of members are $\delta$-close to the property. In particular, no set in the collection has roughly half of its members $\delta$-close to the property and the others $\delta$-far from it.

We show that the collection of affine spaces displays a proximity gap with respect to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, even over small fields, of size polynomial in the dimension of the code, and the gap applies to any $\delta$ smaller than the Johnson/Guruswami-Sudan list-decoding bound of the RS code. We also show near-optimal gap results, over fields of (at least) linear size in the RS code dimension, for $\delta$ smaller than the unique decoding radius. Finally, we discuss several applications of our proximity gap results to distributed storage, multi-party cryptographic protocols, and concretely efficient proof systems.

We prove the proximity gap results by analyzing the execution of classical algebraic decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes (due to Berlekamp-Welch and Guruswami-Sudan) on a formal element of an affine space. This involves working with Reed-Solomon codes whose base field is an (infinite) rational function field. Our proofs are obtained by developing an extension (to function fields) of a strategy of Arora and Sudan for analyzing low-degree tests.</div>

Arvind Mithal—almost always referred to as Arvind—is now the head of the faculty of computer science at a Boston trade school. The school, also known as MIT, is of course one of the top places for all things computer science. From education to service to startups to research, MIT is perhaps the best in the world.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might discuss one of Arvind’s main research themes.</p>
<p>
Although this work started in the 1980’s I believe that it underscores an important point. This insight might apply to current research topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_quantum_computing">quantum computers</a>.</p>
<p>
But first I cannot resist saying something personal about him. Arvind is a long time friend of mine, and someone who gets the <i>stuck in elevator measure</i> of many hours. This measure is one I made up, but I hope you get the idea.</p>
<p>
Arvind is the only name I have ever known for Arvind. I was a bit surprised to see that the Wikipedia reference for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_(computer_scientist)">him</a> states his “full” name. He told me that he found having one name—not two—was a challenge. For example, he sometimes had to explain when arriving at a check-in desk at a conference that he only had one name. His name tag often became: </p>

<p>because the conference software could not handle people with one name. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The prehistory </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
About forty years ago one of the major open problem in CS was how to make computers go faster. It is still an issue, but in the 1980’s this problem was one of all-hands-on-deck. It was worked on by software engineers, by electrical engineers, by researchers of all kinds including complexity theorists. Conferences like FOCS and STOC—hardcore theory conferences—often contained papers on how to speed up computations. </p>
<p>
Two examples come to mind:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systolic_array">systolic</a> arrays led by Hsiang-Tsung Kung then at CMU. Also his students, especially Charles Leiserson, made important contributions. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultracomputer">Ultracomputer</a> led by Jacob Schwartz at NYU. An ultracomputer has N processors, N memories and an N log N message-passing switch connecting them. Note, the use of “N” so you can <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/">tell</a> that it came from a theorist. </p>
<p>
Arvind tried to make computers faster by inventing a new type of computer architecture. Computers then were based on the classic von Neumann architecture or control flow architecture. He and his colleagues worked for many years trying to replace this architecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow#Hardware_architecture">dataflow</a>. </p>
<p>
A bottleneck in von Neumann style machines is caused by the program counter fetch cycle. Each cycle the program counter decides which instruction to get, and thus which data to get. These use the same hardware channel, which causes the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">von Neumann bottleneck</a>. We have modified Wikipedia’s graphic to make the bottleneck aspect clearer:</p>

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The promise </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Arvind is usually identified with the invention of <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a191029.pdf">dataflow</a> computer architecture. The key idea of this architecture is to avoid the above bottleneck by eliminating the program counter. If there are no instructions to fetch, then it would seem that we can beat the bottleneck. Great idea.</p>
<p>
Dataflow architectures do not have a program counter, and so data is king. Roughly data objects move around in such a machine, and they eventually appear at computational units. Roughly these machines operate, at a high level, like a directed graph from complexity theory. Data moves along edges to nodes that compute values. Moreover, nodes compute as soon as all the input data is present. After the node computes the value, the new data is sent to the next node; and so on. </p>

<p>
The hope was that this would yield a way to increase the performance of computers. No program counter, no instruction fetching, could make dataflow machines faster. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—The actual </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The dataflow idea is clever. The difficulty is while dataflow can work, classic von Neumann machines have been augmented in various ways. The competition rarely stays put. These updates did not eliminate the von Neumann bottleneck, but they reduce the cost of it, and let von Neumann machines continue to get faster. Caches are one example of how they avoid the bottleneck, thus making the dataflow machines less attractive. Thus, a cache for program instructions makes it likely that the program fetch step does not actually happen. This is an attack on the main advantage of dataflow machines. </p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/tve/papers-ucb/limits.pdf">paper</a> by David Culler, Klaus Schauser, and Thorsten von Eicken titled <i>Two Fundamental Limits on Dataflow Multiprocessing?</i> discusses these issues in detail. They start by saying: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The advantages of dataflow architectures were argued persuasively in a seminal 1983 paper by Arvind and Iannucci and in a 1987 revision entitled “Two Fundamental Issues in Multiprocessing”. However, reality has proved less favorable to this approach than their arguments would suggest. This motivates us to examine the line of reasoning that has driven dataflow architectures and fine-grain multithreading to understand where the argument went awry. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Dataflow—Lessons </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are the lessons? Is there one? </p>
<p>
I claim there are lessons. The work of Arvind on dataflow was and is important. It did not lead to the demise of von Neumann machines. I am using one right now to write this.</p>
<p>
Dataflow did lead to insights on programming that have many applications. The dataflow idea may yet impact special computational situations: there is interest in using them for data intensive applications.</p>
<p>Ken adds that dataflow has been realized in other ways. Caches and pipes and subsequent architecture innovations profit from designs that enhance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference">locality</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a> programming model gives a general framework that fits this well. The paradigm of <a href="http://\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_processing">streaming</a> is even a better fit. Note that Wikipedia says both that it is “equivalent to dataflow programming” and “was explored within dataflow programming”—so perhaps the parent lost out to the wider adaptability of her children.</p>
<p>
I think there are lessons: Practical goals like making hardware go faster, are complex and many faceted. A pure theory approach such as systolic arrays or ultra computers or dataflow machines is unlikely to suffice. Also the existing technology like von Neumann machines will continue to evolve. </p>
<p>
A question is: Could quantum computers be subject to the same lesson? Will non-quantum machines continue to evolve in a way to make the quantum advantage less than we think? Or is this type of new architecture different? Could non-quantum machines incorporate tricks from quantum and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>

<p>We applaud them on receiving this award. Sadly the Paris award reminds us that Paris Kanellakis died in the terrible plane crash of American Airlines Flight 965 on December 20, 1995. Also on that flight were his wife, Maria Otoya, and their two children, Alexandra and Stephanos.</p>

<p>This semester, like many other universities, Harvard switched to a pass/fail grade model. (In typical Harvard style, we give them different names – “Emergency Satisfactory” and “Emergency Unsatisfactory” –  but that doesn’t matter much).</p>



<p>One unexpected but happy consequence of this policy is that even though I already submitted the grades for my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">crypto course</a>, I can now take the time and send students detailed feedback on their final projects. Typically,  both students and faculty tend to be focused on the “bottom line” of exams or papers – what is the final grade. The comments are viewed as of marginal importance and only serve to justify why points have been deducted.</p>



<p>Now that there is no grade, I am actually giving many more comments on the write ups, trying to focus on giving students feedback on writing and presentation that will be useful for them later on. I benefited immensely from the extensive comments on my writing that I received from my advisor Oded Goldreich. While I will never match Oded’s thoroughness and dedication, I try to at least provide some of this to my students (though unlike Oded, I use blue and not red ink, and also do not intersperse the comments with Hebrew curses for emphasis <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> )</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In this work, we address the task of ranking members of a population according to their qualifications based on a training set of binary outcome data. A natural approach for ranking is to reduce to prediction: first learn to predict individuals’ “probability” of success; then rank individuals in the order specified by the predictions. A concern with this approach is that such rankings may be vulnerable to manipulation. The rank of an individual depends not only on their own qualification but also on every other individuals’ qualifications, so small inaccuracies in prediction may result in a highly inaccurate and unfair induced ranking. We show how to obtain rankings that satisfy a number of desirable accuracy and fairness criteria, despite the coarseness of binary outcome data.<br />
We develop two parallel definitions of evidence-based rankings. First, we study a semantic notion of <em>domination-compatibility</em>: if the training data suggest that members of a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> are on-average more qualified than the members of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />, then a ranking that favors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> (i.e., where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> dominates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" />) is blatantly inconsistent with the data, and likely to be discriminatory. Our definition asks for domination-compatibility, not just for a pair of sets (e.g., majority and minority populations), but rather for every pair of sets from a rich collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> of subpopulations. The second notion—evidence-consistency—aims at precluding even more general forms of discrimination: the ranking must be justified on the basis of consistency with the expectations for every set in the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" />. Somewhat surprisingly, while evidence-consistency is a strictly stronger notion than domination-compatibility when the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> is predefined, the two notions are equivalent when the collection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathcal%7BC%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\mathcal{C}" class="latex" title="\mathcal{C}" /> may depend on the ranking itself. Finally, we show a tight connection between evidence-based rankings and multi-calibrated predictors [HKRR’18]. This connection establishes a way to reduce the task of ranking to prediction that ensures strong guarantees of fairness in the resulting ranking.<br />

<p>I was seriously depressed for the last week, by noticeably more than my baseline amount for the new pandemic-ravaged world.  The depression seems to have been triggered by two pieces of news:</p>



<ol><li>The US Food and Drug Administration—yes, the same FDA whose failure to approve covid tests in February infamously set the stage for the deaths of 100,000 Americans—has now <em>also</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/us/coronavirus-testing-seattle-bill-gates.html">banned</a> the Gates Foundation’s program for at-home covid testing.  This, it seems to me, is not the sort of thing that could happen in a still-functioning society, one where people valued their own and their neighbors’ physical survival, and viewed rules and regulations as merely instruments to that end.  It’s the sort of thing that one imagines in the waning years of a doomed empire, when no one pretends anymore that they can fix or improve the Leviathan; they’re all just scurrying to flee the Leviathan as it collapses with a thud.  More broadly, I <em>still</em> don’t think that the depth of America’s humiliation and downfall has sunk in to most Americans.  For me, it starts and ends with a single observation: <strong>where fifty years ago we landed humans on the moon, today we can no longer make or distribute paper masks, even when hundreds of thousands of lives depend on it.</strong>  Look, there are many countries, like Taiwan and New Zealand, that managed to protect both their economies <em>and</em> their vulnerable citizens’ lives, by crushing the virus early.  Then there are countries that waited, until they faced an excruciating choice between the two.  But here in the US, we’ve somehow achieved the worst of both worlds—triggering a second Great Depression while <em>also</em> utterly failing to control the virus.  Can we abandon the charade of treating this as a legible “policy choice,” to be debated in earnest thinkpieces?  To me, it just feels like the death-spasm of a collapsing Leviathan.</li><li>Something that, at first glance, might seem trivial by comparison, but isn’t: the University of California system—ignoring the <a href="https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/reports/kkb-jn-standardized-testing.pdf">advice</a> of its own Academic Senate, and at the apparent insistence of its chancellor Janet Napolitano—will now <a href="https://timesofsandiego.com/education/2020/05/24/the-story-behind-university-of-californias-landmark-decision-to-ditch-the-sat/">permanently end</a> the use of the SAT and ACT in undergraduate admissions.  This is widely expected, probably correctly, to trigger a chain reaction, whereby one US university after the next will abandon standardized tests.  As a result, admissions to the top US universities—and hence, most chances for social advancement in the US—will henceforth be based <em>entirely</em> on shifting and nebulous criteria that rich, well-connected kids and their parents spend most of their lives figuring out, rather than merely <em>mostly</em> based on such criteria.  The last side door for smart noncomformist kids is now being slammed shut.  From now on, in the US, the <em>only</em> paths to success that clearly delineate their rules will be sports, gambling, reality TV, and the like.  In case it matters to anyone reading this, I feel certain that a 15-year-old me wouldn’t stand a chance in the emerging regime—any more than nerdy Jewish kids did in the USSR of the 1970s, or the US of the 1920s.  (As I’ve <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2003">previously recounted</a> on this blog, the US’s “holistic” college admissions system, with its baffling-to-foreigners emphasis on “character,” “leadership,” “well-roundedness,” etc. rather than test scores, originated in a successful push a century ago by the presidents of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to keep Jewish enrollments down.  Today the system fulfills precisely the same function, except against Asian-Americans rather than Jews.)  Ironically but predictably, the death of the SAT—i.e., of one of the most fearsome weapons against entrenched wealth and power ever devised—is being <em>celebrated</em> by the self-described champions of the underdog.  I have one question for those champions: do you not understand what your system will <em>actually</em> do to society’s underdogs?  Or do you understand perfectly well, and approve?</li></ol>



<p>To put it bluntly—since events like these leave no room for euphemism—a hundred thousand Americans are now dead from covid, and hundreds of thousands more are poised to die, because smart people are no longer in charge.  And the death of the SAT will help ensure that smart people will never be <em>back</em> in charge.  Obama might be remembered by history as America’s last smart-person-in-charge, its last competent technocrat—but one man couldn’t stop a tidal wave of stupid.</p>



<p>I know from experience what many will readers will say to all this: “instead of wallowing in gloom, Scott, why don’t you just make falsifiable predictions about the bad outcomes you expect from these developments, and then score yourself later?”</p>



<p>So here’s the thing about that.</p>



<p>Shortly after Trump was elected, I changed this blog’s background to black, as a small way to mourn the United States that I’d grown up thinking that I lived in, the one that had at least some ideals.  Today, with four years of hindsight, my thinking then feels <em>overly optimistic</em>: why plain black?  Why not, like, images of rotting corpses in a pit?</p>



<p>And yet, were I foolish enough to register predictions in 2016, I would’ve said that within one year, Trump’s staggering incompetence would <em>surely</em> cause some catastrophe or other to grip the country—a really obvious one, with mass death and even Trump’s beloved stock market cratering.</p>



<p>And then after a year, commenters would ridicule me, because none of that had happened.  After two years, they’d ridicule me again because it <em>still</em> hadn’t happened, and after three years they’d ridicule me a third time.</p>



<p>Now it’s happened.</p>



<p>America, we now know, is like the cartoon character who runs off a cliff: it dangled in midair for three years, defying physics, before it finally looked down.</p>



<p>Look, I’m a theoretical computer scientist.  By training, I deal in asymptotics, not in constant factors.  I don’t often make predictions with deadlines; when I do, I often regret it.  It’s a good thing that I became an academic rather than an investor!  For I’ve learned that the only “oracular power” I have is to make statements like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>My eyes, my brain, and the pit of my stomach are all blaring at me that the asymptotics of this situation just took a sharp turn for the worse.  Sure, for an unknown length of time, noise and constant factors could mask the effects.  But eventually, either (1) society will need to reverse what it just did, or else (2) terrible effects will spring from it, or else (3) the entire universe no longer makes sense.</p></blockquote>



<p>When I’ve felt this way in the past, option (3) rarely turned out to be the right answer.</p>



<p>So, what can anyone say that will make me less depressed?  Thanks in advance!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (May 30): </span></strong>Woohoo!!  Avoiding yet another tragedy, after years of setbacks and struggles, it looks like today the US has finally launched humans into orbit, thereby recapitulating a technological achievement from 1961 that the US had already vastly surpassed by 1969.  I hereby retract the pessimism of this post.</p></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><i>From the Virtual Transition Team for EC 2020:</i> Due to concerns regarding the novel coronavirus COVID-19, the 2020 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC 2020) will be held virtually.  This change of format offers exciting new opportunities. This guide can also be found on the </span><a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/participation/covid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC 2020 webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overview</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15 – 19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions.</span><br />
<b>June 22 – July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Live EC Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions.</span><br />
<b>July 13:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tutorial Watch Parties, Business Meeting and Poster Session</span><br />
<b>July 14 – 16:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> EC Conference (Paper Watch Parties, Paper Poster Sessions, and Plenaries).</span><br />
<b>July 17 – 22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Workshops.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee has been hard at work revisioning EC 2020 as a virtual event.  The event aims to emphasize opportunities afforded by the virtual format with activities that are intractable in the physical format, but not to recreate aspects of the physical conference experience that are difficult virtually.  Some aspects of the event will look similar to a physical conference, while some will be quite different.  The desiderata for the selected format are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize exposure for EC papers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maximize interaction between community members.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow broad global accessibility.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organizational team studied the results of many virtual conferences that have already taken place (</span><a href="https://aamas2020.conference.auckland.ac.nz/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AAMAS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/243882-the-asplos-2020-online-conference-experience/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASPLOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.eurosys2020.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EuroSys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://iccp2020.engr.wustl.edu/vsetup.html?fbclid=IwAR3ONLEftxPsTmW4b1oTyCjvAFWWOxWRWS4bV6kTox1yP8AUpgSAbkL76Qc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICCP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://medium.com/@iclr_conf/gone-virtual-lessons-from-iclr2020-1743ce6164a3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ICLR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.daniellitt.com/blog/2020/4/20/wagon-lessons-learned"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WAGON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others, as well as the </span><a href="https://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/acm/VirtualConferences_GuideToBestPractices_CURRENT.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACM guidelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).  Some general rules of thumb are (a) prerecording talks, (b) emphasizing posters, (c) expecting about four hours a day of participation, (d) prime time is 11am-3pm ET.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planning committee adopted a strategy that allows the minimal commitment level for authors and attendees of presenting and viewing 18 minute talks and attending activities only during the main EC week of July 13-17.  However, official EC events will run June 15 to July 24 and the planning committee highly encourages members of the community to enjoy a more relaxed pace where all programming is plenary.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registration will be mandatory but complementary with ACM SIGecom membership ($10 Professional / $5 Student) which can easily be completed online.  Registration will open on June 1.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentoring Workshop and Live Tutorial Pre-recording Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 15-19:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To give junior researchers plenty of time to prepare for the EC conference, the mentoring workshops and tutorial live pre-recording sessions will be held the week of June 15.  In addition to the usual activities, junior students will be paired with senior students who will share their EC itinerary and be available for discussions of papers and events in online chat throughout the duration of the EC events.  There will be three tutorials, each broken into four 45 minute segments and recorded over several days and with live audiences of EC participants.  Students will be able to work together on exercises in between sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Live Paper Pre-recording Plenary Sessions</span></h2>
<p><b>June 22 – July 3:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  EC papers will keep the usual 18-minute format.  The planning committee highly encourages authors to choose to pre-record their EC talks in live pre-recording sessions.  Each session comprises three papers and is followed by a virtual coffee break for discussion between the speakers, coauthors, and attendees.  Speakers and attendees are recommended to schedule for 2 hours.  These sessions are all plenary and will be scheduled for synergies in topic and preferred timing of the speakers.  These sessions begin at regular times:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Eastern/China 9:00, 13:00, 17:00, 21:00, 1:00, 5:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Central/Israel  8:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 24:00, 4:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Mountain/Europe 7:00, 11:00, 15:00, 19:00, 23:00, 3:00.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US Pacific/London  6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00, 2:00.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We expect about three sessions a day over the ten weekdays between June 22 and July 3.  (Pre-recording sessions are optional but highly encouraged for authors of EC papers.)</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Conference</span></h2>
<p><b>July 13-16: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 13 is tutorial day.  It will include the EC business meeting and a contributed poster session for breaking results and results from other venues.  The main conference runs July 14-July 16 with programming from 9am-5pm Eastern.  This programming includes pre-recorded talk watch parties, poster discussion sessions for the papers, live plenary talks, and live highlights beyond EC.  The paper and poster discussion sessions will run in two-hour blocks as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 1: 3-5 parallel tracks of watch parties (3 papers each), with realtime chat with the authors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hour 2: plenary 1-minute lightning talks for all papers, breakout room for discussion for each paper with poster (a poster is 1-4 slides in PDF). (The lightning talks and poster discussion rooms are optional but highly encouraged for authors of the session’s papers.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As these watch parties will be in parallel sessions and some may be at times that are hard for some members of the community to attend, the planning committee highly encourages participation in the live pre-recording sessions (June 22-July 3) and all talks will be available for individual viewing in advance of the conference. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC Workshops</span></h2>
<p><b>July 17-22:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Three workshops will take place on the Friday of EC and the following week.  Details for these events are still being worked out by the organizers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Presentation by Student or Postdoctoral Research Award.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="http://www.sigecom.org/award-presentation.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Best Presentation by a Student or Postdoctoral Researcher Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is designed to encourage and acknowledge excellence in oral presentations by students and recent graduates. In addition to an honorarium, this year’s winner will be invited to present in a special session at WINE 2020 with expenses covered by SIGecom. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be considered for the award, the presenter must participate in a live pre-recording session. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This year will feature several “fun” categories for video presentations. Audience nominations are requested for creative and fun videos in the categories of: Best Video, Best Cameo by a Child or Pet, Best Special Effects, Best Soundtrack, or Best [Insert Your Nomination Here]. Submit nominations </span><a href="https://forms.gle/bfWEqDwseGHnciUP6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Transition Team</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual aspects of the conference are being coordinated by a Virtual Transition Team appointed by the SIGecom Executive Committee, that in addition to the </span><a href="http://sigecom.org/officers.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="http://ec20.sigecom.org/committees-acm/organizing-committee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EC 2020 organizing committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes the following officers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual General Chair: Jason Hartline</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Local Chair: Yannai Gonczarowski</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Global Outreach Chairs: Rediet Abebe and Eric Sodomka</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team is looking forward to interacting with everyone in the community at an outstanding conference!</span></p></div>

This post is going to ask a question that you could look up on the web. But what fun with that be?<br />
<br />
The following statements are true<br />
<br />
1) Don Larsen, a professional baseball player who played from 1953 to 1967, is still alive. He is 90 years old (or perhaps 90 years young---I don't know the state of his health).  He was born Aug 7, 1929. He is best know for pitching a perfect game in the World Series in 1956, pitching for the Yankees. He played for several other teams as well, via trades (this was before free agency).<br />
(CORRECTION- I wrote this post a while back, and Don Larsen has died since then.)<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Whitey Ford, a professional baseball player who played from 1950 to 1967, is still alive. He is 91 years old (or perhaps 91 years young---I don't know the state of his health).  He was born Oct 21,  1928. He had many great seasons and is in the hall of fame. He played for the New York Yankees and no other team.<br />
<br />
3) From 1900 (or so) until 1962 there were 16 professional baseball teams which had 25 people each. From 1962 until 1969 there were 20 teams which had 25 people each. There were also many minor league teams.<br />
<br />
4) The youngest ballplayers are usually around 20. The oldest around 35. These are not exact numbers<br />
<br />
SO here is my question: Try to estimate<br />
<br />
1) How many LIVING  retired major league baseball players are there now who are older than Don Larsen?<br />
<br />
2) How many LIVING retired major league baseball players are of an age between Don and Whitey?<br />
<br />
3) How  many LIVING retired major league baseball players are older than Whitey Ford?<br />
<br />
Give your REASONING for your answer.<br />

Saeed Salehi is a logician at the University of Tabriz in Iran. Three years ago he gave a <a href="http://wrm17.mi.ras.ru/slides/Salehi.pdf">presentation</a> at a Moscow workshop on proofs of the diagonal lemma.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would discuss the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_lemma">diagonal lemma</a>. </p>
<p>
The lemma is related to Georg Cantor’s famous diagonal argument yet is different. The logical version imposes requirements on when the argument applies, and requires that it be expressible within a formal system. </p>
<p>
The lemma underpins Kurt Gödel’s famous 1931 <a href="http://www.w-k-essler.de/pdfs/goedel.pdf">proof</a> that arithmetic is incomplete. However, Gödel did not state it as a lemma or proposition or theorem or anything else. Instead, he focused his attention on what we now call Gödel numbering. We consider this today as “obvious” but his paper’s title ended with “Part I”. And he had readied a “Part II” with over 100 pages of calculations should people question that his numbering scheme was expressible within the logic. </p>
<p>
Only after his proof was understood did people realize that one part, perhaps the trickiest part, could be abstracted into a powerful lemma. The tricky part is <em>not</em> the Gödel numbering. People granted that it can be brought within the logic once they saw enough of Gödel’s evidence, and so we may write <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" class="latex" title="{\ulcorner \phi \urcorner}" /> for the function giving the Gödel number of any formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> and use that in other formulas. The hard part is what one <em>does</em> with such expressions. </p>
<p>
This is what we will try to motivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Tracing the Lemma </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Rudolf Carnap is often credited with the first formal statement, in 1934, for instance by Eliott Mendelson in his famous <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250868.Introduction_to_Mathematical_Logic">textbook</a> on logic. Carnap was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap">member</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Circle">Vienna Circle</a>, which Gödel frequented, and Carnap is <a href="http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb6h4nb3q7&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00004&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=">considered</a> a giant among twentieth-century philosophers. He worked on sweeping grand problems of philosophy, including logical positivism and analysis of human language via syntax before semantics. Yet it strikes us with irony that his work on the lemma may be the best remembered.</p>
<p>
Who did the lemma first? Let’s leave that for others and move on to the mystery of how to prove the lemma once it is stated. I must say the lemma is easy to state, easy to remember, and has a short proof. But I believe that the proof is not easy to remember or even follow. </p>
<p>
Salehi’s <a href="http://wrm17.mi.ras.ru/slides/Salehi.pdf">presentation</a> quotes others’ opinions about the proof:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Sam Buss: “Its proof [is] quite simple but rather tricky and difficult to conceptualize.”</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> György Serény (we jump to Serény’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0606425.pdf">paper</a>): “The proof of the lemma as it is presented in textbooks on logic is not self-evident to say the least.”</p>
<p>

<p>
So I am not alone, and I thought it might be useful to try and unravel its proof. This exercise helped me and maybe it will help you.</p>
<p>
Here goes. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Stating the Lemma </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28w%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(w)}" class="latex" title="{S(w)}" /> be a formula in Peano Arithmetic (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" />). We claim that there is some sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++PA+%5Cvdash+%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
<p>Formally, </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(x)}" class="latex" title="{S(x)}" /> is some formula in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" />. Then there is a sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> so that 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++PA+%5Cvdash+%5Cphi+%5Ciff+S%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  PA \vdash \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The beauty of this lemma is that it was used by Gödel and others to prove various powerful theorems. For example, the lemma quickly proves this result of Alfred Tarski:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" /> is consistent. Then <i>truth</i> cannot be defined in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" />. That is there is <b>no</b> formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BTr%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Tr(x)}" class="latex" title="{Tr(x)}" /> so that for all sentences <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" /> proves 	</em></p><em>

" class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The proof is this. Assume there is such a formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BTr%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Tr(x)}" class="latex" title="{Tr(x)}" />. Then use the diagonal lemma and get 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%5Ciff+%5Cneg+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)." class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner)." /></p>
<p>This shows that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cphi+%5Ciff+%5Cneg+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29+%5Ciff+Tr%28%5Culcorner+%5Cphi+%5Curcorner%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff \neg Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner) \iff Tr(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
<p>This is a contradiction. A short proof. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Proof </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The key is to define the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(n)}" class="latex" title="{F(n)}" /> as follows: Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is the Gödel number of a formula of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A(x)}" class="latex" title="{A(x)}" /> for some variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28n%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+A%28%5Culcorner+A%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(n) = \ulcorner A(\ulcorner A(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(n) = \ulcorner A(\ulcorner A(x) \urcorner) \urcorner. " /></p>
<p>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is not of this form then define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28n%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(n)=0}" class="latex" title="{F(n)=0}" />. This is a strange function, a clever function, but a perfectly fine function, It certainly maps numbers to numbers. It is certainly recursive, actually it is clearly computable in polynomial time for any reasonable Gödel numbering. Note: the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> does depend on the choice of the variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. Thus, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+y%3D0+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+%28%5Culcorner+y%3D0+%5Curcorner%29%3D0+%5Curcorner%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner y=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner, " /></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++F%28%5Culcorner+x%3D0+%5Curcorner%29+%3D+%5Culcorner+%28%5Culcorner+x%3D0+%5Curcorner%29%3D0+%5Curcorner.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  F(\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner) = \ulcorner (\ulcorner x=0 \urcorner)=0 \urcorner. " /></p>
<p>	          Now we make two definitions:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Barray%7D%7Brcl%7D++++++++g%28w%29+%26%5Cequiv%26+S%28F%28w%29%29+%5C%5C++++++++%5Cphi+%26%5Cequiv%26+g%28%5Culcorner+g%28x%29+%5Curcorner%29.+%5Cend%7Barray%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{array}{rcl}        g(w) &amp;\equiv&amp; S(F(w)) \\        \phi &amp;\equiv&amp; g(\ulcorner g(x) \urcorner). \end{array} " /></p>
<p>
Now we compute just using the definitions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%2C+g%2C+%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F, g, \phi}" class="latex" title="{F, g, \phi}" />:</p>

<p>We are done.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But … </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Where did this proof come from? Suppose that you forgot the proof but remember the statement of the lemma. I claim that we can then reconstruct the proof. </p>
<p>

<p>This essentially gives the definition of the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. Pretty neat.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But but … </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Okay where did the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> come from? It is reasonable to define 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28w%29+%5Cequiv+S%28F%28w%29%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  g(w) \equiv S(F(w)), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  g(w) \equiv S(F(w)), " /></p>

We cannot change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> but we can control the input to the formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />, so let’s put a function there. Hence the definition for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> is not unreasonable. </p>
<p>
Okay how about the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" />? Well we could argue that this is the magic step. If we are given this definition then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> follows, by the above. I would argue that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> is not completely surprising. The name of the lemma is after all the “diagonal” lemma. So defining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> as the application of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g}" class="latex" title="{g}" /> to itself is plausible.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Taking an Exam </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Another way to think about the diagonal lemma is imagine you are taking an exam in logic. The first question is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Prove in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BPA%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{PA}" class="latex" title="{PA}" /> that for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(x)}" class="latex" title="{S(x)}" /> there is a sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> so that 	</em></p><em>

" class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \phi \iff S(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner). " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>You read the question again and think: “I wish I had studied harder, I should have not have checked Facebook last night. And then went out and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />” But you think let’s not panic, let’s think.</p>
<p>
Here is what you do. You say let me define 	</p>

You recall there was a function that depends on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" />, and changing the input from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F(x)}" class="latex" title="{F(x)}" /> seems to be safe. Okay you say, now what? I need the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" />. Hmmm let me wait on that. I recall vaguely that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> had a strange definition. I cannot recall it, so let me leave it for now.</p>
<p>
But you think: I need a sentence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" />. A sentence cannot have an unbound variable. So <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" title="{\phi}" /> cannot be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(x)}" class="latex" title="{g(x)}" />. It could be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28m%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(m)}" class="latex" title="{g(m)}" /> for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" />.

<p>It is after all the diagonal lemma. Hmmm does this work. Let’s see if this works. Wait as above I get that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BF%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{F}" class="latex" title="{F}" /> is now forced to satisfy 	</p>

<p><i>In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">new paper</a>, we explore how closely
the ImageNet benchmark aligns with the object recognition task it serves as a
proxy for. We find pervasive and systematic deviations of ImageNet annotations
from the ground truth, which can often be attributed to specific design choices
in the data collection pipeline. These issues indicate that ImageNet accuracy
alone might be insufficient to effectively gauge real model performance.  </i></p>

<h2 id="contextualizing-progress-on-benchmarks">Contextualizing Progress on Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Large-scale benchmarks are central to machine learning—they serve both
as concrete targets for model development, and as proxies for assessing model
performance on real-world tasks we actually care about. However, few benchmarks
are perfect, and so as our models get increasingly better at them, we must also
ask ourselves: <i>to what extent is performance on existing benchmarks
indicative of progress on the real-world tasks that motivate them?</i></p>

<p>In this post, we will explore this question of <i>benchmark-task alignment</i>
in the context of the popular
<a href="http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/">ImageNet object recognition dataset</a>.
Specifically, our goal is to understand how well the underlying ground truth is
captured by the dataset itself—this dataset is, after all, what we consider
to be the gold standard during model training and evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="a-sneak-peak-into-imagenet">A sneak peak into ImageNet</h3>
<p>The ImageNet dataset contains over a million images of objects from a thousand,
quite diverse classes. Like many other benchmarks of that scale, ImageNet was
not carefully curated by experts, but instead created via crowd-sourcing,
without perfect quality control. So what does ImageNet data look like? Here are
a few image-label pairs from the dataset:</p>

<div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/0.jpg" />
      <div class="fake_label">missile</div>
      <div class="true_label">projectile</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/1.jpg" />
      <div class="fake_label">stage</div>
      <div class="true_label">acoustic guitar</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/2.jpg" />
      <div class="fake_label">monastery</div>
      <div class="true_label">church</div>
    </div>
    <div class="fake_img"> 
      <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/anec/3.jpg" />
      <div class="fake_label">Norwich terrier</div>
      <div class="true_label">Norfolk terrier</div>
    </div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>These samples appear pretty reasonable…but are they? Actually, while these
are indeed <i>images</i> from the dataset, the labels shown above are
<i>not</i> their actual ImageNet labels!
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/" id="reveal">[Click to see the actual ImageNet labels]</a>
Still, even though not “correct” from the point of view of the ImageNet
dataset, these labels <i>do</i> correspond to actual ImageNet classes, and
appear plausible when you see them in isolation. This shows that for ImageNet
images, which capture objects in diverse real-world conditions, the ImageNet
label may not properly reflect the ground truth.</p>

<p>In our work, we dive into examining how this label misalignment actually
impacts ImageNet: how often do ImageNet labels deviate from the ground truth?
And how do shortcomings in these labels impact ImageNet-trained models?</p>

<h3 id="revisiting-the-imagenet-collection-pipeline">Revisiting the ImageNet collection pipeline</h3>
<p>Before going further, let’s take a look at how ImageNet was created. To build
such a large dataset, the creators of ImageNet had to leverage scalable methods
like automated data collection and crowd-sourcing. That is, they first selected
a set of object classes (using the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu">WordNet</a>
hierarchy), and queried various search engines to obtain a pool of candidate
images. These candidate images were then verified by annotators on <a href="https://www.mturk.com/">Mechanical
Turk (MTurk)</a> using (what we will refer to as) the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task: annotators were shown images retrieved
for a specific class
label, and were subsequently asked to select the ones that actually contain an
object of this class. Only images that multiple annotators validated ended up
in the final dataset.</p>

  <div class="stages block">

  </div>
  <img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/pipeline/selection.jpg" id="stage_img" />
</div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Imagenet collection pipeline:</strong> Click on a
stage at the top for an illustration. </div>

<p>While this is a natural approach to scalably annotate data (and, in fact, is
commonly used to create large-scale benchmarks—e.g.,
<a href="http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/">PASCAL VOC</a>,
<a href="http://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a>, <a href="http://places.csail.mit.edu/">places</a>),
it has an important caveat. Namely, this process has an inherent bias: the
annotation task itself is phrased as a leading question. ImageNet annotators
were not asked to provide an image label, but instead only to verify if a
<i>specific</i> label (predetermined by the image retrieval process) was
<i>contained</i> in an image. Annotators had no knowledge of what the other
classes in the dataset even were, or the granularity at which they were
required to make distinctions. In fact, they were explicitly instructed to
ignore clutter and obstructions.</p>

<p>Looking back at the ImageNet samples shown above, one can see how this setup
could lead to imperfect annotations. For instance, it is unclear if the average
annotator knows the differences between a “Norwich terrier” and a “Norfolk
terrier”, especially if they don’t even know that both of these (as well as 22
other terrier breeds) are valid ImageNet classes. Also, the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task itself might be ill-suited for annotating
multi-object images—the answer to the <span class="sc">Contains</span> question would be yes for any
object in the image that corresponds to an ImageNet class. It is not unthinkable
that the same images could have made it into ImageNet under the labels “stage”
and “Norwich terrier” had they come up in the search results for those classes
instead.</p>

<p>Overall, this suggests that the labeling issues in ImageNet may go beyond just
occasional annotator mistakes—the <i>design</i> of the data collection
pipeline itself could have caused these labels to systematically deviate from
the ground truth.</p>

<h3 id="diagnosing-benchmark-task-misalignment">Diagnosing benchmark-task misalignment</h3>

<p>To characterize how wide-spread these deviations are, we first need to get a
better grasp of the ground truth for ImageNet data. In order to do this at
scale, we still need to rely on crowd-sourcing. However, in contrast to the
original label validation setup, we design a new annotation task based directly
on <i>image classification</i>. Namely, we present annotators with a set of
possible labels for a single image <i>simultaneously</i>. We then ask them to
assign one label to every object in the image, and identify what they believe
to be the main object. (Note that we intentionally ask for such fine-grained
image annotations since, as we saw before, a single label might be inherently
insufficient to capture the ground truth.)</p>

<p>Of course, we need to ensure that annotators can meaningfully perform this
task. To this end we  devise a way to narrow down the label choices they are
presented with (all thousand ImageNet classes would be nearly impossible for a
worker to choose between!). Specifically, for each image, we identify the most
relevant labels by pooling together the top-5 predictions of a diverse set of
ImageNet models and filtering them via the <span class="sc">Contains</span>
task. Note that, by doing so, we are effectively bootstrapping the existing
ImageNet labels by first using them to train models and then using model
predictions to get better annotation candidates.</p>

<p>This is what our resulting annotation task looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/multilabel/main_task.jpg" /></p>

<p>We aggregate the responses from multiple annotators to get per-image estimates
of the number of objects in the image (along with their corresponding labels),
as well as which object humans tend to view as the main one.</p>

<p>We collect such <a href="https://github.com/MadryLab/ImageNetMultiLabel">annotations for 10k images from the ImageNet validation
set</a>. With these more
fine-grained and accurate annotations in hand, we now examine where the
original ImageNet labels may fall short.</p>

<h3 id="multi-object-images">Multi-object images</h3>
<p>The simplest way in which ImageNet labels could deviate from the ground truth
is if the image contains multiple objects. So, the first thing we want to
understand is: how many ImageNet images contain objects from more than one
valid class?</p>

<p>It turns out: quite a few! Indeed, more than <b>20%</b> of the images contain
more than one ImageNet object. Examples:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <div class="choices_one">
    <span class="widgetheading">Inspect Image</span>
  </div>
  <div class="choices_img">
    <span class="widgetheading">Image</span>

  </div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<div class="footnote"> <strong>Multi-object images:</strong> Choose an image on
the left to see the annotations we obtain for it.  </div>

<p>Looking at some of these images, it is clear that the problem is not just
natural image clutter but also the fact that certain objects are quite likely
to co-occur in the real-world—e.g., “table lamp” and “lamp shade”. This means
that choosing classes which in principle correspond to distinct objects (e.g.,
using WordNet) is not enough to guarantee that the corresponding images have
unambiguous labels. For example, see if you can guess the ImageNet label for
the samples below:</p>

<div class="widget">
  <span class="widgetheading" id="coclass">Chosen class pair</span>

<div class="footnote">
<strong>Co-occurring objects:</strong> Select a class pair on the top and see if
you can identify which images correspond to each class (click on "Show Labels"

</div>

<h4 id="model-performance-on-multi-object-images">Model performance on multi-object images</h4>

<p>So, how do models deal with images that contain multiple objects? To understand
this, we evaluate a number of models (from AlexNet to EfficientNet-B7), and
measure their accuracy (w.r.t. the ImageNet labels) on such images. We plot
these accuracies below (as a function of their full test accuracy):</p>

<canvas width="400" id="multi_drop" height="200"></canvas>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Performance on multi-object images:</strong>
Model accuracy variation as a function of the number of objects in the image.
Hover over each data point to see the corresponding model name.
</div>

<p>Across the board, in comparison to their performance on single-object images,
models suffer around a 10% accuracy drop on multi-object ones. At the same
time, this drop more-or-less disappears if we consider a model prediction to be
correct if it matches the label of <i>any</i> valid object in the image (see
the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">paper</a> for specifics).</p>

<div class="footnote">
    <strong>Aside:</strong> The original motivation of top-5 accuracy was
    exactly to accommodate such multi-label images. However, we find that, while
    it does largely account for these multi-object confusions, it also seems to
    overestimate accuracy on single-object images.
</div>

<p>Still, even though models seem to struggle with multi-object images, they
perform much better than chance (i.e., better than what one would get if they
were picking the label of an object in the image at random). This makes sense
when the image has a single prominent object that also matches the ImageNet
label. However, for a third of all multi-object images the ImageNet label does
not even match what annotators deem to be the main object in the image. Yet,
even in these cases, models still successfully predict the ImageNet label
(instead of what humans consider to be the right label for the image)!</p>

<canvas width="400" id="overfitting" height="200"></canvas>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Performance on images with annotator-label disagreement:</strong>
Model accuracy on images where annotators do not consider the ImageNet label to
be the main object. Baseline: accuracy of picking the label of a random
prominent object in the image.
</div>

<p>Here, models seem to base their predictions on biases in the dataset which
humans do not find salient. For instance, models get high accuracy on the class
“pickelhaube”, even though, pickelhaubes are usually present in images with
other, more salient objects, such as “military uniforms”, suggesting that
ImageNet models may be overly sensitive to the presence of distinctive objects
in the image. While exploiting such biases would improve ImageNet accuracy,
this strategy might not translate to improved performance on object recognition
in the wild. Here are a few examples that seem to exhibit a similar mismatch:</p>

<h3 id="biases-in-label-validation">Biases in label validation</h3>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the ImageNet data filtering process. Recall
that each class in ImageNet was constructed by automatically retrieving many
images and filtering them (via the <span class="sc">Contains</span> task described above). How likely
were annotators to filter out mislabeled images under this setup?</p>

<p>To understand this, we replicate the original filtering process on the existing
ImageNet images. But this time, instead of only asking annotators to check if
the image is valid with respect to its ImageNet label (i.e., the search query),
we also try several other labels (each in isolation, with different sets of
annotators).</p>

<p>We find that annotators frequently deem an image to be valid for <i>many</i>
different labels—even when only one object is present. Typically, this occurs
when the image is ambiguous and lacks enough context (e.g. “seashore” or
“lakeshore”), or annotators are likely confused between different semantically
similar labels (e.g., “assault rifle” vs. “rifle”, dog breeds). It turns out
that this confusion, at least partly, stems from the one-sidedness of the
<span class="sc">Contains</span> task—i.e., asking annotators to ascertain the validity of a specific
label without them knowing about any other options. If instead we present
annotators with all the relevant labels simultaneously and ask them to choose
one (as we did in our annotation setup), this kind of label confusion is
alleviated: annotators select significantly fewer labels in total (see our
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">paper</a> for details). So, even putting
annotator’s expertise aside, the specific annotation task setup itself
drastically affects the quality of the resulting dataset labels.</p>

</div>

<p>Going back to ImageNet, our findings give us reason to believe that annotators
may have had a rather limited ability to correct errors in labeling. Thus, in
certain cases, ImageNet labels were largely determined by the automated image
retrieval process—propagating any biases or mixups this process might
introduce to the final dataset.</p>

<p>In fact, we can actually see direct evidence of that in the ImageNet
dataset—there are pairs of classes that appear to be <i>inherently
ambiguous</i> (e.g., “laptop computer” and “notebook computer”) and neither
human annotators, nor models, can tell the corresponding images apart (see
below). If such class pairs actually overlap in terms of their ImageNet images,
it is unclear how models can learn to separate them without memorizing specific
validation examples.</p>

<h3 id="beyond-test-accuracy-human-centric-model-evaluation">Beyond test accuracy: human-centric model evaluation</h3>

<p>Performance of ImageNet-trained models is typically judged based on their
ability to predict the dataset labels—yet, as we saw above, these labels may
not fully capture the ground truth. Hence, ImageNet accuracy may not reflect
properly model performance—for instance, measuring accuracy alone could
unfairly penalize models for certain correct predictions on  multi-object
images. So, how can we better assess model performance?</p>

<p>One approach is to measure model-human alignment directly—we present model
predictions to annotators and ask them to gauge their validity:</p>

<canvas width="400" id="limit" height="200"></canvas>
<div class="footnote">
<strong>Human-based model evaluation:</strong> Fraction of annotators that
select a label as valid in the <span class="sc">Contains</span> task (i.e.,
selection frequency) for ImageNet labels and model predictions. Baseline:
(number of correct predictions) × (average selection frequency of the
ImageNet label).
</div>

<p>Surprisingly, we find that for state-of-the-art models, annotators actually
deem the prediction that models make to be valid about as often as the ImageNet
label (even when the two <i> do not</i> match). Thus, recent models may be
better at predicting the ground truth than their top-1 accuracy (w.r.t. the
ImageNet label) would indicate.</p>

<p>However, this does not imply that improving ImageNet accuracy is meaningless.
For instance, non-expert annotators may not be able to tell apart certain
fine-grained class differences (e.g., dog breeds) and for some of these images
the ImageNet label may actually match the ground truth. What it does indicate,
though, is that we are at a point where it may be hard to gauge if better
performance on ImageNet corresponds to actual progress or merely to exploiting
idiosyncrasies of the dataset.</p>

<p>For further experimental details and additional results (e.g., human confusion
matrices), take a look at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11295">our paper</a>!</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>We took a closer look at how well ImageNet aligns with the real-world object
recognition task—even though ImageNet is used extensively, we rarely question
whether its labels actually reflect the ground truth. We saw that oftentimes
ImageNet labels do not fully capture image content—e.g., many images have
multiple (ImageNet) objects and there are classes that are inherently
ambiguous. As a result, models trained using these labels as ground truth end
up learning unintended biases and confusions.</p>

<p>Our analysis indicates that when creating datasets we must be aware of (and try
to mitigate) ways in which scalable data collection practices can skew the
corresponding annotations (see our
<a href="https://gradientscience.org/data_rep_bias">previous post</a> for another
example of such a skew). Finally, given that such imperfections in our datasets
could be inevitable, we also need to think about how to reliably assess model
performance in their presence.</p>

We study the MaxRes rule in the context of certifying unsatisfiability. We show that it can be exponentially more powerful than tree-like resolution, and when augmented with weakening (the system MaxResW), p-simulates tree-like resolution. In devising a lower bound technique specific to MaxRes (and not merely inheriting lower bounds from Res), we define a new semialgebraic proof system called the SubCubeSums proof system. This system, which p-simulates MaxResW, is a special case of the Sherali-Adams proof system. In expressivity, it is the integral restriction of conical juntas studied in the contexts of communication complexity and extension complexity. We show that it is not simulated by Res. Using a proof technique qualitatively different from the lower bounds that MaxResW inherits from Res, we show that Tseitin contradictions on expander graphs are hard to refute in SubCubeSums. We also establish a lower bound technique via lifting: for formulas requiring large degree in SubCubeSums, their XOR-ification requires large size in SubCubeSums.</div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: The Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) roughly asks what the “complexity” of a given string is. Informally, one can think of this as determining the degree of “computational order” a string has.</p>
<p>In the past several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in MCSP. A series of exciting results have begun unraveling what looks to be a fascinating story. This story already reveals deep connections between MCSP and a growing list of fields, including cryptography, learning theory, structural complexity theory, average-case complexity, and circuit complexity. As an example, Santhanam recently proved a conditional equivalence between the complexity of MCSP and the existence of one-way functions.</p>
<p>This talk is split into two parts. The first part is a broad introduction to MCSP, answering the following questions: What is this problem? Why is it interesting? What do we know so far, and where might the story go next? The second part discusses recent joint work with Bruno Loff and Igor Oliveira showing that the “multi-output version” of MCSP is NP-hard.</p></blockquote>

Gerolamo Cardano is often credited with introducing the notion of complex numbers. In 1545, he wrote a book titled <i>Ars Magna</i>. He introduced us to numbers like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B-5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{-5}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{-5}}" /> in his quest to understand solutions to equations. Cardano was often short of money and gambled and played a certain board game to make money—see the second paragraph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerolamo_Cardano#Mathematics">here</a>. </p>
<p>
Today, for amusement, Ken and I thought we’d talk about tells.</p>
<p>
What are tells? Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_(poker)">says</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A tell in poker is a change in a player’s behavior or demeanor that is claimed by some to give clues to that player’s assessment of their hand. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/05/22/math-tells/tell/" rel="attachment wp-att-17068"><img width="201" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/tell.jpg?w=201&amp;h=300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17068" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Tells </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken and I have been thinking of tells in a wider sense—when and whether one can declare inferences amid uncertain information. Historians face this all the time. So do biographers, at least when their subjects are no longer living. We would also like to make inferences in our current world, such as about the pandemic. The stakes can be higher than in poker. In poker, if your “tell” inference is wrong and you lose, you can play another hand—unless you went all in. With science and other academic areas the attitude must be that you’re all-in all the time.</p>
<p>
Cardano furnishes several instances. Wikipedia—which we regard as an equilibrium of opinions—says that Cardano </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> acknowledged the existence of imaginary numbers … [but] did not understand their properties, [which were] described for the first time by his Italian contemporary Rafael Bombelli. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This is a negative inference from how one of Cardano’s books stops short of treating imaginary numbers as objects that follow rules. </p>
<p>
There are also questions about whether Cardano can be considered “the father of probability” ahead of Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat. Part of the problem is that Cardano’s own writings late in life recounted his first erroneous reasonings as well as final understanding in a Hamlet-like fashion. Wikipedia doubts whether he really knew the rule of multiplying probabilities of independent events, whereas the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2113/index_files/Gorroochurn-Some Laws.pdf">essay</a> by Prakash Gorroochurn cited there convinces us that he did. Similar doubt extends to how much Cardano knew about the natural sciences, as correct inferences (such as mountains with seashell fossils having once been underwater) are mixed in with what we today regard as howlers.</p>
<p>
Every staging of Shakespeare’s <i>Hamlet</i> shows a book by Cardano—or does it? In Act II, scene 2, Polonius asks, “What do you read, my lord?”; to which Hamlet first replies “Words words words.” Pressed on the book’s topic, Hamlet perhaps references the section “Misery of Old Age” in Cardano’s 1543 book <i>De Consolatione</i> but what he <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/hamlet/page_102/">says</a> is so elliptical it is hard to tell. The book also includes particular allusions between sleep and death that go into Hamlet’s soliloquy opening Act III. The book had been published in England in 1573 as <i>Cardan’s Comfort</i> under the aegis of the Earl of Oxford so it was well-known. Yet the writer Italo Calvino <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pQabBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=Hamlet+words+words+words+Cardano&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mu1gcM6b8E&amp;sig=ACfU3U3W7te91qlDaIIC8EeHLM1GxpR2Dw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikkNjX1MfpAhWChHIEHQaWDZsQ6AEwCXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Hamlet words words words Cardano&amp;f=false">held back</a> from the inference:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> To conclude from this that the book read by Hamlet is definitely Cardano, as is held by some scholars of Shakespeare’s sources, is perhaps unjustified. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
To be sure, there are some who believe Shakespeare’s main source was Oxford, in manuscripts if not flesh and blood. One reason we do not go there is that we do not see the wider community as having been able to establish reliable principles for judging what kinds of inferences are probably valid. We wonder if one could do an experiment of taking resolved cases, removing most of the information to take them down to the level of unresolved cases, and seeing what kinds of inferences from partial information would have worked.  That’s not our expertise, but within our expertise in math and CS, we wonder if a little experiment will be helpful.</p>
<p>
To set the idea, note that imaginary numbers are also called complex numbers. Yet the term complex numbers can mean other things. Besides numbers like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2+%2B+3i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2 + 3i}" class="latex" title="{2 + 3i}" /> it also can mean how hard it is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_complexity">construct</a> a number. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In number theory, the integer complexity of an integer is the smallest number of ones that can be used to represent it using ones and any number of additions, multiplications, and parentheses. It is always within a constant factor of the logarithm of the given integer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
How easy is it to tell what kind of “complex” is meant if you only have partial information?  We don’t only mean scope-of-terminology issues; often a well-defined math object is used in multiple areas.  Let’s try an experiment.</p>

We show that lower bounds for explicit constant-variate polynomials over fields of characteristic $p &gt; 0$ are sufficient to derandomize polynomial identity testing over fields of characteristic $p$. In this setting, existing work on hardness-randomness tradeoffs for polynomial identity testing requires either the characteristic to be sufficiently large or the notion of hardness to be stronger than the standard syntactic notion of hardness used in algebraic complexity. Our results make no restriction on the characteristic of the field and use standard notions of hardness.

We do this by combining the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with a white-box procedure to take $p$-th roots of circuits computing a $p$-th power over fields of characteristic $p$. When the number of variables appearing in the circuit is bounded by some constant, this procedure turns out to be efficient, which allows us to bypass difficulties related to factoring circuits in characteristic $p$.

We also combine the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with recent ``bootstrapping'' results in polynomial identity testing to show that a sufficiently-hard family of explicit constant-variate polynomials yields a near-complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing. This result holds over fields of both zero and positive characteristic and complements a recent work of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon, who obtained a slightly stronger statement over fields of characteristic zero.</div>

We introduce a continuous analogue of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, which we name CLWE. We give a polynomial-time quantum reduction from worst-case lattice problems to CLWE, showing that CLWE enjoys similar hardness guarantees to those of LWE. Alternatively, our result can also be seen as opening new avenues of (quantum) attacks on lattice problems. Our work resolves an open problem regarding the computational complexity of learning mixtures of Gaussians without separability assumptions (Diakonikolas 2016, Moitra 2018). As an additional motivation, (a slight variant of) CLWE was considered in the context of robust machine learning (Diakonikolas et al.~FOCS 2017), where hardness in the statistical query (SQ) model was shown; our work addresses the open question regarding its computational hardness (Bubeck et al.~ICML 2019).</div>

Finite languages lie at the heart of literally every regular expression. Therefore, we investigate the approximation complexity of minimizing regular expressions without Kleene star, or, equivalently, regular expressions describing finite languages. On the side of approximation hardness, given such an expression of size~$s$, we prove that it is impossible to approximate the minimum size required by an equivalent regular expression within a factor of  $O\left(\frac{s}{(\log s)^{2+\delta}}\right)$ if the running time is bounded by a quasipolynomial function depending on~$\delta$, for every $\delta&gt;0$, unless the exponential time hypothesis (ETH) fails. For approximation ratio~$O(s^{1-\delta})$, we prove an exponential time lower bound depending on~$\delta$, assuming ETH. The lower bounds apply for alphabets of constant size. On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem can be approximated in polynomial time within~$O(\frac{s\log\log s}{\log s})$, with~$s$ being the size of the given regular expression. For constant alphabet size, the bound improves to~$O(\frac{s}{\log s})$. Finally, we devise a familiy of superpolynomial approximation algorithms that attain the performance ratios of the lower bounds, while their running times are only slightly above those excluded by the ETH.</div>
