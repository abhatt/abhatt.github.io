sequence of $N$ convex sets $K_1,\dots, K_N$ contained in a normed space
$\mathbb R^d$. The player starts at $x_0\in \mathbb R^d$, and after observing
each $K_n$ picks a new point $x_n\in K_n$. At each step the player pays a
movement cost of $||x_n-x_{n-1}||$. The player aims to maintain a constant
competitive ratio against the minimum cost possible in hindsight, i.e. knowing
all requests in advance. The existence of a finite competitive ratio for convex
body chasing was first conjectured in 1991 by Friedman and Linial. This
conjecture was recently resolved with an exponential $2^{O(d)}$ upper bound on
the competitive ratio.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we drastically improve the exponential upper bound. We give an
algorithm achieving competitive ratio $d$ for arbitrary normed spaces, which is
exactly tight for $\ell^{\infty}$. In Euclidean space, our algorithm achieves
nearly optimal competitive ratio $O(\sqrt{d\log N})$, compared to a lower bound
of $\sqrt{d}$. Our approach extends another recent work which chases nested
convex bodies using the classical Steiner point of a convex body. We define the
functional Steiner point of a convex function and apply it to the work function
to obtain our algorithm.

(goodness-of-fit) testers for natural and widely studied classes of
multivariate product distributions: Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with known
covariance and product distributions over $\{\pm 1\}^{d}$. Our testers have
improved sample complexity compared to those derived from previous techniques,
and are the first testers whose sample complexity matches the order-optimal
minimax sample complexity of $O(d^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$ in many parameter regimes.
We construct two types of testers, exhibiting tradeoffs between sample
complexity and computational complexity. Finally, we provide a two-way
reduction between testing a subclass of multivariate product distributions and
testing univariate distributions, and thereby obtain upper and lower bounds for
testing this subclass of product distributions.

review process for venues receiving thousands of submissions. Unfortunately,
common paper matching algorithms often construct matchings suffering from two
critical problems: (1) the group of reviewers assigned to a paper do not
collectively possess sufficient expertise, and (2) reviewer workloads are
highly skewed. In this paper, we propose a novel local fairness formulation of
paper matching that directly addresses both of these issues. Since optimizing
our formulation is not always tractable, we introduce two new algorithms,
FairIR and FairFlow, for computing fair matchings that approximately optimize
the new formulation. FairIR solves a relaxation of the local fairness
formulation and then employs a rounding technique to construct a valid matching
that provably maximizes the objective and only compromises on fairness with
respect to reviewer loads and papers by a small constant. In contrast, FairFlow
is not provably guaranteed to produce fair matchings, however it can be 2x as
efficient as FairIR and an order of magnitude faster than matching algorithms
that directly optimize for fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that both
FairIR and FairFlow improve fairness over standard matching algorithms on real
conference data. Moreover, in comparison to state-of-the-art matching
algorithms that optimize for fairness only, FairIR achieves higher objective
scores, FairFlow achieves competitive fairness, and both are capable of more
evenly allocating reviewers.

sub-optimal for the other. We propose a sample-optimal $\varepsilon$-locally
differentially private (LDP) scheme for distribution estimation, where each
user communicates only one bit, and requires no public randomness. We show that
Hadamard Response, a recently proposed scheme for $\varepsilon$-LDP
distribution estimation is also utility-optimal for heavy hitter estimation.
Finally, we show that unlike distribution estimation, without public randomness
where only one bit suffices, any heavy hitter estimation algorithm that
communicates $o(\min \{\log n, \log k\})$ bits from each user cannot be
optimal.

computational number theory and in computer science, especially in
cryptography. The celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\'asz reduction algorithm
(so-called LLL) has been improved in many ways through the past decades and
remains one of the central methods used for reducing integral lattice basis. In
particular, its floating-point variants-where the rational arithmetic required
by Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is replaced by floating-point arithmetic-are
now the fastest known. However, the systematic study of the reduction theory of
real quadratic forms or, more generally, of real lattices is not widely
represented in the literature. When the problem arises, the lattice is usually
replaced by an integral approximation of (a multiple of) the original lattice,
which is then reduced. While practically useful and proven in some special
cases, this method doesn't offer any guarantee of success in general. In this
work, we present an adaptive-precision version of a generalized LLL algorithm
that covers this case in all generality. In particular, we replace
floating-point arithmetic by Interval Arithmetic to certify the behavior of the
algorithm. We conclude by giving a typical application of the result in
algebraic number theory for the reduction of ideal lattices in number fields.

two-player non-local game. It is well-known that it is $\mathrm{NP}$-complete
to decide whether the classical value of a non-local game is 1 or $1-
\epsilon$. Furthermore, as long as $\epsilon$ is small enough, this result does
not depend on the gap $\epsilon$. In contrast, a recent result of Fitzsimons,
Ji, Vidick, and Yuen shows that the complexity of computing the quantum value
grows without bound as the gap $\epsilon$ decreases. In this paper, we show
that this also holds for the commuting-operator value of a game. Specifically,
in the language of multi-prover interactive proofs, we show that the power of
$\mathrm{MIP}^{co}(2,1,1,s)$ (proofs with two provers, one round, completeness
probability $1$, soundness probability $s$, and commuting-operator strategies)
can increase without bound as the gap $1-s$ gets arbitrarily small.
</p>
<p>Our results also extend naturally in two ways, to perfect zero-knowledge
protocols, and to lower bounds on the complexity of computing the
approximately-commuting value of a game. Thus we get lower bounds on the
complexity class $\mathrm{PZK}$-$\mathrm{MIP}^{co}_{\delta}(2,1,1,s)$ of
perfect zero-knowledge multi-prover proofs with approximately-commuting
operator strategies, as the gap $1-s$ gets arbitrarily small. While we do not
know any computable time upper bound on the class $\mathrm{MIP}^{co}$, a result
of the first author and Vidick shows that for $s = 1-1/\text{poly}(f(n))$ and
$\delta = 1/\text{poly}(f(n))$, the class $\mathrm{MIP}^{co}_\delta(2,1,1,s)$,
with constant communication from the provers, is contained in
$\mathrm{TIME}(\exp(\text{poly}(f(n))))$. We give a lower bound of
$\mathrm{coNTIME}(f(n))$ (ignoring constants inside the function) for this
class, which is tight up to polynomial factors assuming the exponential time
hypothesis.

call the average bias. Given a distribution $Z$ over $\{0,1\}^n$, its average
bias is: $b_{\text{av}}(Z) =2^{-n} \sum_{c \in \{0,1\}^n} |\mathbb{E}_{z \sim
Z}(-1)^{\langle c, z\rangle}|$. A source with average bias at most $2^{-k}$ has
min-entropy at least $k$, and so low average bias is a stronger condition than
high min-entropy. We observe that the inner product function is an extractor
for any source with average bias less than $2^{-n/2}$.
</p>
<p>The notion of average bias especially makes sense for polynomial sources,
i.e., distributions sampled by low-degree $n$-variate polynomials over
$\mathbb{F}_2$. For the well-studied case of affine sources, it is easy to see
that min-entropy $k$ is exactly equivalent to average bias of $2^{-k}$. We show
that for quadratic sources, min-entropy $k$ implies that the average bias is at
most $2^{-\Omega(\sqrt{k})}$. We use this relation to design dispersers for
separable quadratic sources with a min-entropy guarantee.

algorithms is the question of whether randomization is needed for efficient
symmetry breaking. While there are fast, $\text{poly}\log n$-time randomized
distributed algorithms for all of the classic symmetry breaking problems, for
many of them, the best deterministic algorithms are almost exponentially
slower. The following basic local splitting problem, which is known as the
\emph{weak splitting} problem takes a central role in this context: Each node
of a graph $G=(V,E)$ has to be colored red or blue such that each node of
sufficiently large degree has at least one node of each color among its
neighbors. Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Maus [STOC '17] showed that this seemingly
simple problem is complete w.r.t. the above fundamental open question in the
following sense: If there is an efficient $\text{poly}\log n$-time determinstic
distributed algorithm for weak splitting, then there is such an algorithm for
all locally checkable graph problems for which an efficient randomized
algorithm exists. In this paper, we investigate the distributed complexity of
weak splitting and some closely related problems. E.g., we obtain efficient
algorithms for special cases of weak splitting, where the graph is nearly
regular. In particular, we show that if $\delta$ and $\Delta$ are the minimum
and maximum degrees of $G$ and if $\delta=\Omega(\log n)$, weak splitting can
be solved deterministically in time
$O\big(\frac{\Delta}{\delta}\cdot\text{poly}(\log n)\big)$. Further, if $\delta
= \Omega(\log\log n)$ and $\Delta\leq 2^{\varepsilon\delta}$, there is a
randomized algorithm with time complexity
$O\big(\frac{\Delta}{\delta}\cdot\text{poly}(\log\log n)\big)$.

problems. However, in settings with a low signal-to-noise ratio, it is known to
suffer from severe overfitting. This paper studies the reduced rank regression
problem and presents algorithms with provable generalization guarantees. We use
adaptive hard rank-thresholding in two different parts of the data analysis
pipeline. First, we consider a low rank projection of the data to eliminate the
components that are most likely to be noisy. Second, we perform a standard
multivariate linear regression estimator on the data obtained in the first
step, and subsequently consider a low-rank projection of the obtained
regression matrix. Both thresholding is performed in a data-driven manner and
is required to prevent severe overfitting as our lower bounds show.
Experimental results show that our approach either outperforms or is
competitive with existing baselines.

adversarial perturbations has emerged as a challenging problem. In particular,
deep neural nets (DNNs) seem to be susceptible to small imperceptible changes
over test instances. In this work, we study whether there is any learning task
for which it is possible to design classifiers that are only robust against
polynomial-time adversaries. Indeed, numerous cryptographic tasks (e.g.
encryption of long messages) are only be secure against computationally bounded
adversaries, and are indeed mpossible for computationally unbounded attackers.
Thus, it is natural to ask if the same strategy could help robust learning.
</p>
<p>We show that computational limitation of attackers can indeed be useful in
robust learning by demonstrating a classifier for a learning task in which
computational and information theoretic adversaries of bounded perturbations
have very different power. Namely, while computationally unbounded adversaries
can attack successfully and find adversarial examples with small perturbation,
polynomial time adversaries are unable to do so unless they can break standard
cryptographic hardness assumptions. Our results, therefore, indicate that
perhaps a similar approach to cryptography (relying on computational hardness)
holds promise for achieving computationally robust machine learning. We also
show that the existence of such learning task in which computational robustness
beats information theoretic robustness implies (average case) hard problems in
$\mathbf{NP}$.

given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with lengths $\ell(e)\geq 1$ on its edges
and a source vertex $s$, we need to support (approximate) shortest-path queries
in $G$, as $G$ undergoes vertex deletions. In a shortest-path query, given a
vertex $v$, we need to return a path connecting $s$ to $v$, whose length is at
most $(1+\epsilon)$ times the length of the shortest such path, where
$\epsilon$ is a given accuracy parameter. The problem has many applications,
for example to flow and cut problems in vertex-capacitated graphs.
</p>
<p>Our main result is a randomized algorithm for vertex-decremental SSSP with
total expected update time $O(n^{2+o(1)}\log L)$, that responds to each
shortest-path query in $O(n\log L)$ time in expectation, returning a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest path. The algorithm works against an
adaptive adversary. The main technical ingredient of our algorithm is an
$\tilde O(|E(G)|+ n^{1+o(1)})$-time algorithm to compute a \emph{core
decomposition} of a given dense graph $G$, which allows us to compute short
paths between pairs of query vertices in $G$ efficiently. We believe that this
core decomposition algorithm may be of independent interest. We use our result
for vertex-decremental SSSP to obtain $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms
for maximum $s$-$t$ flow and minimum $s$-$t$ cut in vertex-capacitated graphs,
in expected time $n^{2+o(1)}$, and an $O(\log^4n)$-approximation algorithm for
the vertex version of the sparsest cut problem with expected running time
$n^{2+o(1)}$. These results improve upon the previous best known results for
these problems in the regime where $m= \omega(n^{1.5 + o(1)})$.

computational advantage of quantum devices over digital computers in some
specific tasks. One of the proposals is Boson Sampling of Aaronson &amp; Arkhipov,
where the specific classically hard task is sampling from the many-body quantum

accounting for the many-body interference only up to a fixed order. It is shown
that one can distinguish the output distribution of noisy Boson Sampling from
that of classical simulation with a number of samples that depends solely on
the highest order of quantum interference accounted for by the classical

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: x-large;"><u>Individual Notions of Fairness You Can Use</u></span></div><br />Our group at Penn has been thinking about when <i>individual </i>notions of fairness might be practically achievable for awhile, and we have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660">two</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607">new</a> approaches.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><u>Background</u>:</span><br /><u>Statistical Fairness</u><br />I've written about this before, <a href="http://aaronsadventures.blogspot.com/2017/11/between-statistical-and-individual.html">here</a>. But briefly: there are two families of definitions in the fairness in machine learning literature. The first group of definitions, which I call <i>statistical</i> fairness notions, is far and away the most popular. If you want to come up with your own statistical fairness notion, you can follow this recipe:<br /><ol><li>Partition the world into a small number of "protected sub-groups". You will probably be thinking along the lines of race or gender or something similar when you do this.</li><li>Pick your favorite error/accuracy metric for a classifier. This might literally be classification error, or false positive or false negative rate, or positive predictive value, or something else. Lots of options here. </li><li>Ask that this metric be approximately equalized across your protected groups.</li><li>Finally, enjoy your new statistical fairness measure! Congratulations!</li></ol><div>These definitions are far and away the most popular in this literature, in large part (I think) because they are so immediately actionable. Because they are defined as conditions on a small number of expectations, you can easily check whether your classifier is "fair" according to these metrics, and (although there are some interesting computational challenges) go and try and learn classifiers subject to these constraints. </div><div><br /></div><div>Their major problem is related to the reason for their success: they are defined as conditions on a small number of expectations or <i>averages</i> over people, and so they don't promise much to particular individuals. I'll borrow an example from our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05144">fairness gerrymandering</a> paper from a few years ago to put this in sharp relief. Imagine that we are building a system to decide who to incarcerate, and we want to be "fair" with respect to both gender (men and women) and race (green and blue people). We decide that in our scenario, it is the false positives who are harmed (innocent people sent to jail), and so to be fair, we decide should equalize the false positive rate: across men and women, and across greens and blues. But one way to do this is to jail all green men and blue women. This does indeed equalize the false positive rate (at 50%) across all four of the groups we specified, but is cold comfort if you happen to be a green man --- since then you will be jailed with certainty. The problem was our fairness constraint was never a promise to an individual to begin with, just a promise about the average behavior of our classifier over a large group. And although this is a toy example constructed to make a point, things like this happen in real data too. </div><br /><u>Individual Fairness</u><br />Individual notions of fairness, on the other hand, really do correspond to promises made to individuals. There are at least two kinds of individual fairness definitions that have been proposed: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2090255">metric fairness</a>, and <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6355-fairness-in-learning-classic-and-contextual-bandits">weakly meritocratic fairness</a>. Metric fairness proposes that the learner will be handed a <i>task specific similarity metric</i>, and requires that individuals who are close together in the metric should have a similar probability of being classified as positive. Weakly meritocratic fairness, on the other hand, takes the (unknown) labels of an individual as a measure of merit, and requires that individuals who have a higher probability of really having a positive label should have only a higher probability of being classified as positive. This in particular implies that false positive and false negative rates should be equalized <i>across individuals</i>, where now the word <i>rate</i> is averaging over only the randomness of the classifier, not over people. What makes both of these <i>individual</i> notions of fairness is that they impose constraints that bind on all pairs of individuals and not just over averages of people.<br /><br />Definitions like this have the advantage of strong individual-level semantics, which the statistical definitions don't have. But they also have big problems: for metric fairness, the obvious question is: <i>where does the metric come from</i>? Even granting that fairness should be some Lipschitz condition on a metric, it seems hard to pin down what the metric is, and different people will disagree: coming up with the metric seems to encapsulate a large part of the original problem of defining fairness. For weakly meritocratic fairness, the obvious problem is that we don't know what the labels are. Its possible to do non-trivial things if you make assumptions about the label generating process, but its not at all clear you can do any non-trivial learning subject to this constraint if you don't make strong assumptions.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><u>Two New Approaches:</u></span><br />We have two new approaches, building off of metric fairness and weakly meritocratic fairness respectively. Both have the advantages of statistical notions of fairness in that they can be put into practice without making unrealistic assumptions about the data, and without needing to wait on someone to hand us a metric. But they continue to make meaningful promises to individuals.<br /><br /><u>Subjective Individual Fairness</u><br />Lets start with our variant of metric fairness, which we call subjective individual fairness. (This is joint work with Michael Kearns, our PhD students Chris Jung and Seth Neel, our former PhD student Steven Wu, and Steven's student (our grand student!) Logan Stapleton). The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10660</a>. We stick with the premise that "similar people should be treated similarly", and that whether or not it is correct/just/etc., it is at least fair to treat two people the same way, in the sense that we classify them as positive with the same probability. But we don't want to assume anything else.<br /><br />Suppose I were to create a machine learning fairness panel: I could recruit "AI Ethics" experts, moral philosophers, hyped up consultants, people off the street, toddlers, etc. I would expect that there would be as many different conceptions of fairness as there were people on the panel, and that none of them could precisely quantify what they meant by fairness --- certainly not in the form of a "fairness metric". But I could still ask these people, in particular cases, if they thought it was fair that two particular individuals be treated differently or not.<br /><br />Of course, I would have no reason to expect that the responses that I got from the different panelists would be consistent with one another --- or possibly even internally consistent (we won't assume, e.g. that the responses satisfy any kind of triangle inequality). Nevertheless, once we fix a data distribution and a group of people who have opinions about fairness, we have a well defined tradeoff we can hope to manage: any classifier we could choose will have both:<br /><ol><li>Some error rate, and</li><li>Some frequency with which it makes a pair of decisions that someone in the group finds unfair. </li></ol><div>We can hope to find classifiers that optimally trade off 1 and 2: note this is a coherent tradeoff even though we haven't forced the people to try and express their conceptions of fairness into some consistent metric. What we show is that you can do this. </div><div><br /></div><div>Specifically, given a set of pairs that we have determined should be treated similarly, there is an <i>oracle efficient </i>algorithm that can find the optimal classifier subject to the constraint that no pair of individuals that has been specified as a constraint should have a substantially different probability of positive classification. Oracle efficiency means that what we can do is reduce the "fair learning" problem to a regular old learning problem, without fairness constraints. If we can solve the regular learning problem, we can also solve the fair learning problem. This kind of fairness constraint also generalizes in the standard way: if you ask your fairness panel about a reasonably small number of pairs, and then solve the in-sample problem subject to these constraints, the classifier you learn will also satisfy the fairness constraints out of sample. And it works: we implement the algorithm and try it out on the COMPAS data set, with fairness constraints that we elicited from 43 human (undergrad) subjects. The interesting thing is that once you have an algorithm like this, it isn't only a tool to create "fair" machine learning models: its also a new instrument to investigate human conceptions of fairness. We already see quite a bit of variation among our 43 subjects in our preliminary experiments. We plan to pursue this direction more going forward.</div><div><br /></div><div><u>Average Individual Fairness</u></div><div>Next, our variant of weakly meritocratic fairness. This is joint work with Michael Kearns and our student Saeed Sharifi. The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607">https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10607</a>. In certain scenarios, it really does seem tempting to think about fairness in terms of false positive rates. Criminal justice is a great example, in the sense that it is clear that everyone agrees on which outcome they <i>want</i> (they would like to be released from jail), and so the people we are being unfair to really do seem to be the false positives: the people who should have been released from jail, but who were mistakenly incarcerated for longer. So in our "fairness gerrymandering" example above, maybe the problem with thinking about false positive rates wasn't a problem with <i>false positives</i>, but with <i>rates</i>: i.e. the problem was that the word rate averaged over many people, and so it didn't promise <i>you</i> anything. Our idea is to redefine the word rate. </div><div><br /></div><div>In some (but certainly not all) settings, people are subject to not just one, but many classification tasks. For example, consider online advertising: you might be shown thousands of targeted ads each month. Or applying for schools (a process that is centralized in cities like New York): you apply not just to one school, but to many. In situations like this, we can model the fact that we have not just a distribution over people, but also a distribution over (or collection of) problems. </div><div><br /></div><div>Once we have a distribution over problems, we can define the error rate, or false positive rate, or any other rate you like <i>for individuals. </i>It is now sensible to talk about Alice's false positive rate, or Bob's error rate, because rate has been redefined as an average over problems, for a particular individual. So we can now ask for individual fairness notions in the spirit of the statistical notions of fairness we discussed above! We no longer need to define protected groups: we can now ask that the false positive rates, or error rates, be equalized across all pairs of people. </div><div><br /></div><div>It turns out that given a reasonably sized sample of people, and a reasonably sized sample of problems, it is tractable to find the optimal classifier subject to constraints like this in sample, and that these guarantees generalize out of sample. The in-sample algorithm is again an oracle-efficient algorithm, or in other words, a reduction to standard, unconstrained learning. The generalization guarantee here is a little interesting, because now we are talking about simultaneous generalization in two different directions: to people we haven't seen before, and also to problems we haven't seen before. This requires thinking a little bit about what kind of object we are even trying to output: a mapping from new problems to classifiers. The details are in the paper (spoiler --- the mapping is defined by the optimal dual variables for the empirical risk minimization problem): here, I'll just point out that again, the algorithm is practical to implement, and we perform some simple experiments with it. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br /><br /><br /></div>

to capture the properties of transportation networks. As many important
optimization problems like Travelling Salesperson, Steiner Tree or $k$-Center
arise in such networks, it is worthwhile to study them on graphs of bounded
highway or skeleton dimension.
</p>
<p>We investigate the relationships between mentioned parameters and how they
are related to other important graph parameters that have been applied
successfully to various optimization problems. We show that the skeleton
dimension is incomparable to any of the parameters distance to linear forest,
bandwidth, treewidth and highway dimension and hence, it is worthwhile to study
mentioned problems also on graphs of bounded skeleton dimension. Moreover, we
prove that the skeleton dimension is upper bounded by the max leaf number and
that for any graph on at least three vertices there are edge weights such that
both parameters are equal.
</p>
<p>Then we show that computing the highway dimension according to most recent
definition is NP-hard, which answers an open question stated by Feldmann et al.
Finally we prove that on graphs $G=(V,E)$ of skeleton dimension
$\mathcal{O}(\log^2 \vert V \vert)$ it is NP-hard to approximate the $k$-Center
problem within a factor less than $2$.

an explicit optimisation problem in a rate-distortion framework. A set of input
features is deemed relevant for a classification decision if the expected
classifier score remains nearly constant when randomising the remaining
features. We discuss the computational complexity of finding small sets of
relevant features and show that the problem is complete for
$\mathsf{NP}^\mathsf{PP}$, an important class of computational problems
frequently arising in AI tasks. Furthermore, we show that it even remains
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard to only approximate the optimal solution to within any
non-trivial approximation factor. Finally, we consider a continuous problem
relaxation and develop a heuristic solution strategy based on assumed density
filtering for deep ReLU neural networks. We present numerical experiments for
two image classification data sets where we outperform established methods in
particular for sparse explanations of neural network decisions.

of NP-hard problems into (generally smaller) instances with bounded size, via
the repeated application of data reduction rules. For the fundamental Max Cut
problem, kernelization algorithms are theoretically highly efficient for
various parameterizations. However, the efficacy of these reduction rules in
practice---to aid solving highly challenging benchmark instances to
optimality---remains entirely unexplored.
</p>
<p>We engineer a new suite of efficient data reduction rules that subsume most
of the previously published rules, and demonstrate their significant impact on
benchmark data sets, including synthetic instances, and data sets from the VLSI
and image segmentation application domains. Our experiments reveal that current
state-of-the-art solvers can be sped up by up to multiple orders of magnitude
when combined with our data reduction rules. On social and biological networks
in particular, kernelization enables us to solve four instances that were
previously unsolved in a ten-hour time limit with state-of-the-art solvers;
three of these instances are now solved in less than two seconds.

natural generalization of the well-studied minimum-weight spanning tree (MST)
problem, and it has received considerable attention in the area of network
design. The latter problem asks for a minimum-weight subgraph with an edge
connectivity of $1$ between each pair of vertices while the former strengthens
this edge-connectivity requirement to $2$. Despite this resemblance, the 2-ECSS
problem is considerably more complex than MST. While MST admits a linear-time
centralized exact algorithm, 2-ECSS is NP-hard and the best known centralized
approximation algorithm for it (that runs in polynomial time) gives a
$2$-approximation.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a deterministic distributed algorithm with round
complexity of $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ that computes a
$(5+\epsilon)$-approximation of 2-ECSS, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. Up to
logarithmic factors, this complexity matches the
$\widetilde{\Omega}(D+\sqrt{n})$ lower bound that can be derived from Das Sarma
et al. [STOC'11], as shown by Censor-Hillel and Dory [OPODIS'17]. Our result is
the first distributed constant approximation for 2-ECSS in the nearly optimal
time and it improves on a recent randomized algorithm of Dory [PODC'18], which
achieved an $O(\log n)$-approximation in $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds.
</p>
<p>We also present an alternative algorithm for $O(\log n)$-approximation, whose
round complexity is linear in the low-congestion shortcut parameter of the
network, following a framework introduced by Ghaffari and Haeupler [SODA'16].
This algorithm has round complexity $\widetilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ in worst-case
networks but it provably runs much faster in many well-behaved graph families
of interest. For instance, it runs in $\widetilde{O}(D)$ time in planar
networks and those with bounded genus, bounded path-width or bounded
tree-width.

constraint on the total cost incurred by switching between actions. We prove
matching upper and lower bounds on regret and provide near-optimal algorithms
for this problem. Surprisingly, we discover phase transitions and cyclic
phenomena of the optimal regret. That is, we show that associated with the
multi-armed bandit problem, there are phases defined by the number of arms and
switching costs, where the regret upper and lower bounds in each phase remain
the same and drop significantly between phases. The results enable us to fully
characterize the trade-off between regret and incurred switching cost in the
stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, contributing new insights to this
fundamental problem. Under the general switching cost structure, the results
reveal a deep connection between bandit problems and graph traversal problems,
such as the shortest Hamiltonian path problem.

bottleneck distance, the space of persistence diagrams admits geodesics.
Typically these existence results produce geodesics that have the form of a
convex combination. More specifically, given two persistence diagrams and a
choice of metric, one obtains a bijection realizing the distance between the
diagrams, and uses this bijection to linearly interpolate from one diagram to
another. We prove that for several families of metrics, every geodesic in
persistence diagram space arises as such a convex combination. For certain
other choices of metrics, we explicitly construct infinite families of
geodesics that cannot have this form.

data analysis. If one attempts to generalize the rank tests to a multivariate
case, the problem of defining a multivariate order will occur. It is not clear
how to define a multivariate order or statistical rank in a meaningful way. One
approach to overcome this problem is to use the notion of data depth which
measures the centrality of a point with respect to a given data set. In other
words, a data depth can be applied to indicate how deep a point is located with
respect to a given data set. Using data depth, a multivariate order can be
defined by ordering the data points according to their depth values. Various
notions of data depth have been introduced over the last decades. In this
thesis, we discuss three depth functions: two well-known depth functions
halfspace depth and simplicial depth, and one recently defined depth function
named as $\beta$-skeleton depth, $\beta\geq 1$. The $\beta$-skeleton depth is
equivalent to the previously defined spherical depth and lens depth when
$\beta=1$ and $\beta=2$, respectively. Our main focus in this thesis is to
explore the geometric and algorithmic aspects of $\beta$-skeleton depth.

have numerous applications in combinatorics, computer science, statistical
physics, and elsewhere. One of the most well studied problems in this area is
#GraphHom(H) --- the problem of finding the number of homomorphisms from a
given graph G to the graph H. Not only the complexity of this basic problem is
known, but also of its many variants for digraphs, more general relational
structures, graphs with weights, and others.
</p>
<p>In this paper we consider a modification of #GraphHom(H), the #_p GraphHom(H)
problem, p a prime number: Given a graph G, find the number of homomorphisms
from G to H modulo p. In a series of papers Faben and Jerrum, and Goebel et al.
determined the complexity of #_2 GraphHom(H) in the case H (or, in fact, a
certain graph derived from H) is square-free, that is, does not contain a
4-cycle. Also, Goebel et al. found the complexity of #_p GraphHom(H) for an
arbitrary prime p when H is a tree. Here we extend the above result to show
that the #_p GraphHom(H) problem is #_p P-hard whenever the derived graph
associated with H is square-free and is not a star, which completely classifies
the complexity of #_p GraphHom(H) for square-free graphs H.

graph. Although there are several ways for forbidding a graph, we observe that
it is reasonable to focus on the minor relation since other well-known
relations lead to either trivial or equivalent problems. When the forbidden
minor is connected, we present a near dichotomy of the complexity of Subgraph
Isomorphism with respect to the forbidden minor, where the only unsettled case
is $P_{5}$, the path of five vertices. We then also consider the general case
of possibly disconnected forbidden minors. We show fixed-parameter tractable
cases and randomized XP-time solvable cases parameterized by the size of the
forbidden minor $H$. We also show that by slightly generalizing the tractable
cases, the problem becomes NP-complete. All unsettle cases are equivalent to
$P_{5}$ or the disjoint union of two $P_{5}$'s. As a byproduct, we show that
Subgraph Isomorphism is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by vertex
integrity. Using similar techniques, we also observe that Subgraph Isomorphism
is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by neighborhood diversity.

activation functions (such as ReLU), we advocate the use of
$k$-Winners-Take-All ($k$-WTA) activation, a $C^0$ discontinuous function that
purposely invalidates the neural network model's gradient at densely
distributed input data points. Our proposal is theoretically rationalized. We
show why the discontinuities in $k$-WTA networks can largely prevent
gradient-based search of adversarial examples and why they at the same time
remain innocuous to the network training. This understanding is also
empirically backed. Even without notoriously expensive adversarial training,
the robustness performance of our networks is comparable to conventional ReLU
networks optimized by adversarial training. Furthermore, after also optimized
through adversarial training, our networks outperform the state-of-the-art
methods under white-box attacks on various datasets that we experimented with.

This raised the question of whether these methods were actually useful in

computational bottlenecks, then implement and benchmark the algorithms on a
variety of problems, including applications to portfolio optimization and movie

these algorithms is better than the theoretical complexity bounds would
suggest. On the other hand, their performance degrades noticeably as the rank
and condition number of the input matrix are increased. Overall, our results
indicate that quantum-inspired algorithms can perform well in practice but only
provided that stringent conditions are met: low rank, low condition number, and
very large dimension of the input matrix. By contrast, practical datasets are
often sparse and high-rank, precisely the type that can be handled by quantum
algorithms.

<p>An inadequately-explained phenomenon in computational complexity theory is that there are so few natural candidates for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">-intermediate problems</a>, problems in  but neither in  nor -complete. Of course, if  there are none, and the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/Schaefer's dichotomy theorem">dichotomy theorem</a> implies that there are no intermediate Boolean constraint satisfaction problems. But there are a lot of other types of problems in , and a theorem of Ladner<sup id="fnref:l"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:l" class="footnote">1</a></sup> shows that there should be an infinite hierarchy of degrees of hardness within . So where are all the members of this hierarchy, and why are they so shy?</p>

<p>The same thing happens not just for  but for other related complexity classes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%AFP"></a>. There should be many -intermediate classes but we know even fewer than for . <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102118180704402052">I recently posted</a> about a discussion I had with Igor Pak on this issue, in which we suggested to each other two number-theoretic candidates for being -intermediate, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function">Euler totient function</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function">prime-counting function</a> (see also <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/43954/95">Igor’s StackExchange question on this</a>). But although they’re in , neither of these functions is very combinatorial.</p>

<p>So anyway, the point of all this is to discuss more candidates for being -intermediate that are, I think, natural and combinatorial. They’re part of a family of problems that include a couple of related candidates for being -intermediate, and even a candidate for being -intermediate. These problems come from computational learning theory, or alternatively they can be seen as coming from mathematical logic, hereditary graph theory, and the theory of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph">Rado graph</a>. And they’re all at what is in some sense the shallow end of the intermediate problems: they’re solvable in quasi-polynomial time, meaning , but not known to be solvable in polynomial time. So this is pretty strong evidence that they’re not complete for their respective complexity classes, but weaker evidence than usual that they’re not polynomial.</p>

<p>In learning theory, a family of sets  is said to <em>shatter</em> another set  (not necessarily belonging to ) if every subset of , including the empty set and  itself, can be obtained by intersecting  with some member of . The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapnik%E2%80%93Chervonenkis_dimension">Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension</a> of  is just the size of the largest set that is shattered by  . If we let  (the number of sets in the family) and  (the number of distinct elements in those sets), then the dimension is clearly at most , because sets of size larger than  have too many subsets for them all to be formed by intersection with a member of . Therefore, the following problem can be solved in quasipolynomial time, by a brute-force search of the  small-enough subsets of :<sup id="fnref:lmr"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:lmr" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<dl>
  <dt>VC-dimension (largest shattered set)</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets , number 

    <p>Output: true if  shatters a set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The same quasipolynomial time bound applies to the following related problems,
the first of which is also in  and the second of which is in :</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Smallest non-shattered set</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets , number 

    <p>Output: True if there exists a subset  of 
of size  that is not shattered by , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of shattered sets</dt>
  <dd>Input: family of sets 

    <p>Output: the number of sets shattered by .</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>For the first two problems, being non--complete hinges on the assumption that , but for the number of shattered sets, being non--complete (under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_counting_reduction">counting reductions</a>) is unconditional: the output doesn’t provide enough bits of information to encode the answers to all other  problems.
The VC-dimension is hard to approximate under a form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>, strongly suggesting that it cannot be computed exactly in polynomial time.<sup id="fnref:mr"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:mr" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>To see that the two existence problems can sometimes both have answers that are logarithmic, it’s helpful to turn to the theory of random graphs, and of <em>the</em> random graph, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph">Rado graph</a>. This graph obeys a collection of <em>extension axioms</em> according to which, for every two disjoint finite subsets of vertices, there exists another vertex adjacent to everything in the first subset and to nothing in the second subset. Using these axioms, we can build up induced copies of any finite or countable subgraph, one vertex at a time, using a greedy algorithm. Based on this property, let’s define a subset  of the vertices in an undirected graph to be <em>extensible</em> if, for every partition of  into two disjoint subsets, there exists another vertex outside  that is adjacent to everything in the first subset and to nothing in the second subset. This is nothing more than being shattered by the neighborhoods of the vertices outside . So we have the following corresponding problems.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Largest extensible set</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if  has an extensible set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Smallest non-extensible set</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if  has a non-extensible set of size , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Smallest missing induced subgraph</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph , number 

    <p>Output: true if there is a graph  on at most  vertices that
is not an induced subgraph of , false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Number of extensible sets</dt>
  <dd>Input: Undirected graph 

    <p>Output: The number of extensible sets of vertices of .</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The smallest missing induced subgraph size naturally falls into the complexity class  of problems for which you can guess a solution (the missing subgraph) but then verifying it involves solving a co- problem (is this subgraph missing).
It is greater than the size of the smallest non-extensible set, because if you try to build up a given induced subgraph by adding one vertex at a time greedily you can only get stuck at a non-extensible set. There must be a missing induced subgraph of size at most , because there are  isomorphism classes of -vertex labeled graphs and fewer than  ways of choosing which of the  labeled vertices correspond to vertices of , so for larger values of  than this bound there are more labeled graphs than placements of them as induced subgraphs. Another way of thinking about the smallest missing induced subgraph problem is that we are asking for the largest  for which  is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_graph">-universal</a>: it contains all graphs on at most  vertices as induced subgraphs.</p>

<p>The smallest non-extensible set and the smallest missing subgraph are both easy on any hereditary class of graphs, because these classes always have a missing subgraph of size . On the other hand, if  is chosen uniformly at random among the -vertex graphs, then any small subset of its vertices is extensible with high probability, so the smallest non-extensible set has expected size .</p>

<p>If these problems are not - and -complete, what are they? Papadimitriou and Yannakakis<sup id="fnref:py"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/05/27/shattering-quasipolynomiality.html#fn:py" class="footnote">4</a></sup> define a complexity class , and show that VC-dimension is -complete. Presumably, because it’s so similar, the same is true for the largest extensible set. Maybe it’s possible to prove completeness for the smallest missing induced subgraph in an analogue of  at the level of , and to prove completeness for the number of shattered sets and number of extensible sets in an analogue of  at this level.</p>

On the excellent TV show Veep there was a subplot about a political candidate (who himself had failed algebra in HS) objecting to Algebra since it was invented by the Muslims. I don't recall the exact line, but he said something like `Math teachers are terrorists'<br />
This was, of course, fiction.<br />
<br />
The same week I read that 56% of survey respondents say `<u><i>Arabic Numerals' shouldn't be taught in</i></u> <i><u>schools'</u></i> Obviously also a fiction. Perhaps a headline from <i>The Onion</i>.<br />
<br />
No. The story is true.<br />
<br />
See snopes entry on this: <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/teaching-arabic-numerals/">here</a><br />
<br />
but also see many FALSE but FUNNY websites:<br />
<br />
Sarah Palin wants Arabic Numerals out of the schools: <a href="http://nationalreport.net/sarah-palin-wants-arabic-numerals-banned-americas-schools/">here</a> Funny but false.<br />
<br />
Jerry Brown is forcing students in California to learn Arabic Numerals as part of multi-culturism False by funny:  <a href="https://me.me/i/sharia-law-must-be-stopped-under-gov-brown-students-in-20990368">here</a><br />
<br />
A website urging us to use Roman Numerals (which Jesus used!) False but funny:  <a href="http://freedomnumerals.com/">here</a><br />
<br />
OKAY, what to make of the truth that really, really, 56% of Americans are against Arab Numerals<br />
<br />
1) Bigotry combined with ignorance.<br />
<br />
2) Some of the articles I read about this say its a problem with polls and people. There may be some of that, but still worries me.<br />
<br />
3) In Nazi Germany (WOW- Goodwin's law popped up rather early!) they stopped teaching relativity because Albert Einstein was Jewish (the story is more complicated than that, see <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/">her</a>e). That could of course never happen in America now (or could it, see <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/50097/time-warp">here</a> and <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Counterexamples_to_Relativity">here</a>).<br />
<br />
4) There is no danger that we will dump Arabic Numerals. I wonder if we will change there name to Freedom Numerals.<br />
<br />
5) Ignorance of science is a more immediate problem with the anti-vax people. See <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-outbreak-grows-with-60-new-cases-across-26-states?ref=home">here</a><br />

Pitts, Information and Computation 186(2):165–193, 2003.</li></ul>For the conference version of the first article, Andy and Jamie will also be receiving the Test-of-Time Award from LICS 1999.<br /><br />The award recipients kindly agreed to answer some questions of mine via email. You can find the transcript of the interview below. My questions are labelled with <b>LA</b>, Andy's answers with <b>AP</b> and Jamie's with <b>JG</b>. I hope that you'll enjoy reading their insights and the story of their award-receiving work as much as I did myself. <br /><br /><div dir="ltr"><b>LA: </b>You are receiving the 2019 Alonzo Church Award  for  Outstanding Contributions to Logic and Computation as well as the  Test-of-Time Award from LICS 1999 for your invention of nominal  techniques to provide a semantic understanding of abstract syntax with  binding.   Could you briefly describe the history of the ideas that led  you to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_model">permutation model of set theory with atoms</a> due to  Fraenkel and Mostowski to represent name abstraction and fresh name  generation? What were the  main inspirations and motivations for your work? In your opinion, how  did nominal techniques advance the state of the art at that time?</div><div dir="ltr"></div><br /><div dir="ltr"><b>AP: </b>I have had a long-standing interest in the mathematical semantics of programming language features that restrict resources to a specific scope, or hide information from a program's environment; think local mutable state in languages like <a href="http://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>, or channel-name restriction in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A0-calculus">pi-calculus</a>. When <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/stark/">Ian Stark</a> was doing his PhD with me in the 90s we tried to understand a simple instance: the observable properties of higher-order functions combined with dynamically generated atomic names that can be tested for equality, but don't have any other attribute -- we called this the "nu-calculus". Ian gave a denotational semantics for the nu-calculus using Moggi's monad for modelling dynamic allocation. That monad is defined on the category of pullback-preserving functors from the category of injective functions between finite ordinals to the category of sets. This functor category was well-known to me from topos theory, where it is called <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Schanuel+topos">Schanuel's topos </a>and hosts the generic model of a geometric theory of an infinite decidable set.  A few years later, when Jamie joined me as a PhD student in 1998, I suggested we look at the Schanuel topos as a setting for initial algebra semantics of syntax involving binding operations, modulo alpha-equivalence. I think Jamie prefers set theory over category theory, so he pushed us to use another known equivalent presentation of the Schanuel topos, in terms of continuous actions of the group of permutations of the set N of natural numbers (topologized as a subspace of the product of countably many copies of N). In this form there is an obvious connection with the cumulative hierarchy of sets (with atoms) that are hereditarily finitely supported with respect to the action of permuting atoms. This universe of sets was devised by Fraenkel and Mostowski in the first part of the twentieth century to model ZFA set theory without axioms of choice.  Whether one emphasises set theory or category theory, the move to making permutations of names, rather than injections between sets of names, the primary concept was very fruitful. For example, it certainly makes higher-order constructions (functions and powersets) in the topos/set-theory easier to describe and use. We ended up with a generic construction for name-abstraction modulo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#Alpha_equivalence">alpha-equivalence</a> compatible with classical higher-order logic or set theory, so long as one abstains from unrestricted use of choice. </div><div dir="ltr"></div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>JG:</b> At the time it wasn't an idea to consider names as elements of a distinctive datatype of names, with properties just like other datatypes such as the natural numbers Nat. If we want to add 1 to 1, we take 1:Nat and invoke the "plus" function, which is a specific thing associated to Nat; so why not abstract a in x by assuming a:Atm (where Atm is a distinct thing in our mathematical universe) and x:X and invoking a function "abstract", which is a thing associated to Atm?  We unfolded the implications of this idea in set theory and rediscovered FM sets.  I was inspired by the way I saw mathematics built up in ZF set theory as an undergraduate, starting from a simple basis and building up the cumulative hierarchy.  When I saw the chance to do this for a universe with names, I jumped at the chance.  It turns out FM sets are not required.  Nominal techniques can be built in ZFA set theory, which contains more functions and permits unrestricted choice. </div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>LA: </b>Over  the last fifteen years, nominal techniques have become a fundamental  tool for modelling locality in computation, underlying research  presented in over a hundred papers, new programming languages and models  of computation. They have applications to the syntax and semantics of  programming languages, to logics for machine-assisted reasoning about  programming-language semantics and to the automatic verification of  specifications in process calculi. Variations on nominal sets are used  in automata theory over infinite alphabets, with applications to  querying XML and databases, and also feature in work on models of  Homotopy Type Theory. When did it dawn on you that you had succeeded in  finding a very good model for name abstraction and fresh name  generation, and one that would have a  lot of impact? Did you imagine that your model would generate such a  large amount of follow-up work, leading to a whole body of work on  nominal computation theory? <br /><br /><b>AP: </b>No, to begin with I was very focussed on getting better techniques for computing and reasoning about syntax with bound names. But that only represents a part of the current broad landscape of nominal techniques, the part that mainly depends on the mathematical notion of "finite support" (a way of expressing, via name-permutation, that an object only involves finitely many names). Independently of us, some people realised that a related notion of finiteness, "orbit-finiteness" (which expresses that an object is finite modulo symmetries) is crucial for many applications of nominal techniques. I am referring to the work of Montanari and Pistore on pi-calculus and <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82414059.pdf">HD automata </a>using named sets (yet another equivalent of the Schanuel topos) and the work on automata theory over infinite alphabets (and much else besides) using "sets with atoms" by the Warsaw group (Bojanczyk, Klin, Lasota, Torunczyk,...). The latter is particularly significant because it considers groups of symmetry for atoms other than the full permutation group (in which the only property of an atom preserved under symmetry is its identity). <br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Yes, I did.  Nobody could anticipate the specific applications but I knew we were on to something, which is why I stayed on to build the field after the PhD.  The amount of structure was just too striking.  This showed early: e.g. in the equivariance properties, and the commutation of nominal atoms-abstraction with function-spaces.  When I sent the proof of this property to Andrew, at first he didn't believe it!  I had a sense that there was something deep going on and I still do. <br /><br /><b>LA: </b>What is the result of  yours on nominal techniques you are most proud of? And what are your  favourite results amongst those achieved by others on nominal computation?<b></b><br /><b><br /></b><b>AP:</b> Not so much a specific result, but rather a logical concept, the freshness quantifier (which we wrote using an upside down "N" -- N stands for "New"). In informal practice when reasoning about syntax involving binders, one often chooses <i>some</i> fresh name for the bound variable, but then has to revise that choice in view of later ones; but fortunately <i>any </i>fresh name does as well as some particular one. This distinctive "some/any" property occurs all over the place when computing and reasoning about languages with binders and the freshness quantifier formalises it, in terms of the freshness ("not in the support of") relation and conventional quantifiers.  For the second part of your question I would choose two things. One is the work by Jamie with Fernandez and Mackie on <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890540106001635">nominalrewriting systems</a>, which won the PPDP Most Influential Paper 10-year Award in 2014. The second is the characterisation of orbit-finite sets with atoms in terms of "set-builder expressions"---see Klin et al, "<a href="https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~szymtor/papers/locfin.pdf">Locally Finite Constraint Satisfaction Problems</a>", Proc. LICS 2015); it's a nice application of the classical model theory of homogeneous structures with interesting applications for languages that compute with finite structures. <br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Thanks for asking.  Aside from the initial papers, my work on nominal rewriting with Fernandez has probably had most impact.  However, I am rather fond of the thread of research going from Nominal Algebra, through the axiomatisation of substitution and first-order logic and the characterisation of quantification as a limit in nominal sets, and on to Stone duality.  It's a mathematical foundation built from a nominal perspective of naming and quantification and I hope that as the state of the art in nominal techniques advances and broadens, it might prove useful.  Andrew's book has been helpful in marking out nominal techniques as a field.  I also agree with Andrew that orbit-finiteness and the applications of this idea to transition systems and automata, is important.  I like the automata work for another concrete reason: nominal techniques were discovered in the context of names and binding in syntax, which has bequeathed a misconception that nominal techniques are <i>only</i> about this.  The Warsaw school of nominal techniques gives an independent illustration of the other applications of these ideas. <br /><b><br /></b><b><b>LA: </b></b>Twenty years have passed since your LICS 1999 paper and the  literature on variations on nominal techniques now contains over a hundred papers. Do you expect any further  development related to the theory and application of nominal techniques in the  coming years? What advice would you give to a PhD student who is  interested in working on topics related to nominal computation today?</div><div dir="ltr"><br /><b>AP: </b> For the purpose of answering your question, let's agree to divide LICS topics into Programming Languages and Semantics (PLS) versus Logic and Algorithms (LAS). (So long as we don't think of it as a dichotomy!) Then it seems to me that applications of nominal techniques to LAS are currently in the ascendant and show no sign of slowing down. My own interests are with PLS and there is still work to be done there. In particular, I would like better support for using nominal techniques within the mainstream interactive theorem proving systems: we have the Nominal Package of Urban and Berghofer for classical higher-order logic within Isabelle (which lead to Urban and Tasson winning the CADE Skolem Award in 2015), but nothing analogous for systems based on dependent type theory, such as Agda, Coq and Lean. Recent work of Swan (arXiv:1702.01556) gives us a better understanding of how to develop nominal sets within constructive logic; but I have yet to see a dependent type theory that both corresponds to some form of constructive nominal logic under Curry-Howard and is sufficiently simple that it appeals to users of systems lke Coq who want to mechanise programming language meta-theory in a nameful style. Really, I would like the utility of the FreshML programming language that Jamie, Mark Shinwell and I proposed in 2003 (and which Mark implemented as a patch of OCaml) restricted to total functional programming in the style of Agda; but I don't quite know how to achieve that. <br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Yes.  We are far from understanding nominal techniques and the field has a lot of life and will continue to surprise.  I've always believed that.  A key sticking-point right now is implementations.  I wrote a paper about this recently, on equivariance and the foundations of nominal techniques.  One point in the paper is a sketch for a next-generation nominal theorem-prover (based on ZFA + equivariance).  I'd like to see this carried out, so if anybody reading this is interested then please be in touch.  I'd also like to see nominal techniques implemented as a package in a language like Haskell, ML, or even Python!  If we can get this stuff into the working programmer's toolbox, in a way that just works and does not require special configuration, then that would be helpful.  I suspect that nominal techniques as currently presented in the maths papers, might not fit into a programming language at the moment.  The theory is too strong and may need weakened first.  We need a subset of nominal techniques weak enough to squeeze into an existing language, yet expressive enough for interesting applications.  Some general advice, specifically for the PhD student.  If you have an idea which most people around you don't understand, consider this may be a gap in the collective imagination.  There can be peer pressure when faced by incomprehension to blame yourself, back down, and think about something else.  By all means do this, but only if you yourself judge it right to do so. <br /><br /></div><b>LA: </b>Is there any general research-related lesson you have learnt in the process of working on nominal techniques?<br /><br /><b>AP: </b>On the one hand, don't lose sight of what application your theory is supposed to be good for; but on the other hand, let beauty and simplicity be your guide.<br /><br /><b>JG:</b> Yes:<br /><ul><li>Proving stuff is 30% of the work; convincing people is 70%. </li><li>It's the basic ideas that are hard, not the complicated theorems.</li><li>Competence and imagination are orthogonal. </li><li>It's doesn't have to be complex to be clever. </li><li>Elegant + applicable is a potent combination. </li><li>Seek out good listeners.  Give up quickly on bad ones.  Try to be a good listener. </li><li>Other people have a lot to teach you, but it might not be the things you expected. </li><li>Writing papers is fun.   </li></ul><b>LA: </b>Thanks to both of you for your willingness to answer my questions and congratulations for the awards you will be receiving this summer!</div>
