two-tier generalization of classic switch scheduling problems. We present a
stable-matching algorithm which is $2\cdot (2/\varepsilon+1)$-competitive

interest, notably convex optimization and convex-concave saddle point problems.
Classical methods based on the MirrorProx algorithm require two operator
evaluations per iteration, which is the dominant factor in the running time in
many settings. Additionally, the algorithms typically require careful settings
of the step sizes based on the parameters of the problems such as smoothness.
In this work, we develop new algorithms addressing both of these shortcomings
simultaneously. Our algorithms use a single operator evaluation per iteration
and automatically adapt to problem parameters such as smoothness. We show that
our algorithms are universal and simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence
rates in the non-smooth, smooth, and stochastic settings.

the graph follows a power law degree distribution, in the regime when $m=O(n.

uniformly sample the edges with a Reservoir of size $k=O(\sqrt{n}.\log n)$. Our
detection algorithm checks whether the Reservoir has a giant component. We show
that if the graph contains a very dense subgraph of size $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$,
then the detection algorithm is almost surely correct. On the other hand, a
random graph that follows a power law degree distribution almost surely has no
large very dense subgraph, and the detection algorithm is almost surely
correct. We define a new model of random graphs which follow a power law degree
distribution and have large very dense subgraphs. We then show that on this
class of random graphs we can reconstruct a good approximation of the very
dense subgraph with high probability. We generalize these results to dynamic
graphs defined by sliding windows in a stream of edges.

pack items into a knapsack whose capacity expands over a finite planning
horizon, with the objective of maximizing time-averaged profits. While various
approximation algorithms were developed under mitigating structural
assumptions, obtaining non-trivial performance guarantees for this problem in
its utmost generality has remained an open question thus far. In this paper, we
devise a polynomial-time approximation scheme for general instances of the
incremental knapsack problem, which is the strongest guarantee possible given
existing hardness results. In contrast to earlier work, our algorithmic
approach exploits an approximate dynamic programming formulation. Starting with
a simple exponentially sized dynamic program, we prove that an appropriate
composition of state pruning ideas yields a polynomially sized state space with
negligible loss of optimality. The analysis of this formulation synthesizes
various techniques, including new problem decompositions, parsimonious counting
arguments, and efficient rounding methods, that may be of broader interest.

the task of selecting representative and diverse summaries of data. However, if
datapoints have sensitive attributes such as gender or age, such machine
learning algorithms, left unchecked, are known to exhibit bias: under- or
over-representation of particular groups. This has made the design of fair
machine learning algorithms increasingly important. In this work we address the
question: Is it possible to create fair summaries for massive datasets? To this
end, we develop the first streaming approximation algorithms for submodular
maximization under fairness constraints, for both monotone and non-monotone
functions. We validate our findings empirically on exemplar-based clustering,
movie recommendation, DPP-based summarization, and maximum coverage in social
networks, showing that fairness constraints do not significantly impact
utility.

step $t \in \{1,\ldots, T\}$, we need to play an action $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$
that incurs an unknown vector cost in $[0,1]^{d}$. The goal of the online
algorithm is to minimize the $\ell_p$ norm of the sum of its cost vectors. This
captures the classical online learning setting for $d=1$, and is interesting
for general $d$ because of applications like online scheduling where we want to
balance the load between different machines (dimensions).
</p>
<p>We study \OLVCp in both stochastic and adversarial arrival settings, and give
a general procedure to reduce the problem from $d$ dimensions to a single
dimension. This allows us to use classical online learning algorithms in both
full and bandit feedback models to obtain (near) optimal results. In
particular, we obtain a single algorithm (up to the choice of learning rate)
that gives sublinear regret for stochastic arrivals and a tight $O(\min\{p,
\log d\})$ competitive ratio for adversarial arrivals.
</p>
<p>The \OLVCp problem also occurs as a natural subproblem when trying to solve
the popular Bandits with Knapsacks (\BwK) problem. This connection allows us to
use our \OLVCp techniques to obtain (near) optimal results for \BwK in both
stochastic and adversarial settings. In particular, we obtain a tight $O(\log d
\cdot \log T)$ competitive ratio algorithm for adversarial \BwK, which improves
over the $O(d \cdot \log T)$ competitive ratio algorithm of Immorlica et al.
[FOCS'19].

<p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) launched fifty years ago this month in the United States.

I'll throw in my thoughts.</p><p>I was just slightly too old for shows like Sesame Street, Electric Company, Mr. Rogers and Zoom, not that that stopped me from watching them. My kids grew up on Barney and Friends. My daughter even had a toy Barney that interacted with the show, which went <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/02/barney-evil-dinosaur.html">as well as you'd expect</a>. </p><p>PBS introduced me to those great British TV shows for young nerds like me including Monty Python and Doctor Who. I wasn't into Nova but did watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos religiously in high school.</p><p>My favorite PBS show was the American Experience, short documentaries about US culture. I remember learning about this history of Coney Island and the quiz show scandals before Robert Redford made a movie about it.</p><p>Siskel and Ebert got their start on PBS and became my go to source for movie reviews.</p><p>In 1987 PBS broadcasted Ivy League football games.

weight sequence representation. We then use this to construct new
representations for both rooted trees and free trees, namely the canonical
weight sequence representation. We construct algorithms for generating the
weight sequence representations for all rooted and free trees of order n, and
then add a number of modifications to improve the efficiency of the algorithms.
Python implementations of the algorithms incorporate further improvements by
using generators to avoid having to store the long lists of trees returned by
the recursive calls, as well as caching the lists for rooted trees of small
order, thereby eliminating many of the recursive calls. We further show how the
algorithm can be modifed to generate adjacency list and adjacency matrix
representations for free trees. We compared the run-times of our Python
implementation for generating free trees with the Python implementation of the
well-known WROM algorithm taken from NetworkX. The implementation of our
algorithm is over four times as fast as the implementation of the WROM
algorithm. The run-times for generating adjacency lists and matrices are
somewhat longer than those for weight sequences, but are still over three times
as fast as the corresponding implementations of the WROM algorithm.

Items of sizes in
$(0,1]$ are presented one by one, to be assigned to bins in this order. An item
can be assigned to any bin for which the current total size strictly below $1$.
This means also that the bin can be overloaded by its last packed item. We
improve lower and upper bounds on the asymptotic competitive ratio in the
online case. Specifically, we design the first algorithm whose asymptotic
competitive ratio is strictly below $2$ and it is close to the lower bound.
This is in contrast to the best possible absolute approximation ratio, which is
equal to $2$. We also study the offline problem where the sequence of items is
known in advance, while items are still assigned to bins based on their order
in the sequence. For this scenario we design an asymptotic polynomial time
approximation scheme.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/n/Navarro:Gonzalo.html">Gonzalo Navarro</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07076">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>The research on indexing repetitive string collections has focused on the
same search problems used for regular string collections, though they can make
little sense in this scenario. For example, the basic pattern matching query
"list all the positions where pattern $P$ appears" can produce huge outputs
when $P$ appears in an area shared by many documents. All those occurrences are
essentially the same.
</p>
<p>In this paper we propose a new query that can be more appropriate in these
collections, which we call {\em contextual pattern matching}. The basic query
of this type gives, in addition to $P$, a context length $\ell$, and asks to
report the occurrences of all {\em distinct} strings $XPY$, with
$|X|=|Y|=\ell$.
</p>
<p>While this query is easily solved in optimal time and linear space, we focus
on using space related to the repetitiveness of the text collection and present
the first solution of this kind. Letting $\ovr$ be the maximum of the number of
runs in the BWT of the text $T[1..n]$ and of its reverse, our structure uses
$O(\ovr\log(n/\ovr))$ space and finds the $c$ contextual occurrences $XPY$ of
$(P,\ell)$ in time $O(|P| + c \log n)$. We give other space/time tradeoffs as
well, for compressed and uncompressed indexes.

online marketplaces, news, and social media, output ranked lists of content,
products, and sometimes, people. Credit ratings, standardized tests, risk
assessments output only a score, but are also used implicitly for ranking. Bias
in such ranking systems, especially among the top ranks, can worsen social and
economic inequalities, polarize opinions, and reinforce stereotypes. On the
other hand, a bias correction for minority groups can cause more harm if
perceived as favoring group-fair outcomes over meritocracy. In this paper, we
study a trade-off between individual fairness and group fairness in ranking. We
define individual fairness based on how close the predicted rank of each item
is to its true rank, and prove a lower bound on the trade-off achievable for
simultaneous individual and group fairness in ranking. We give a fair ranking
algorithm that takes any given ranking and outputs another ranking with
simultaneous individual and group fairness guarantees comparable to the lower
bound we prove. Our algorithm can be used to both pre-process training data as
well as post-process the output of existing ranking algorithms. Our
experimental results show that our algorithm performs better than the
state-of-the-art fair learning to rank and fair post-processing baselines.

Since the beginning of the pandemic I have been recording home videos of what would have been typically blog posts, with currently 5 such videos:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/uRarIjJGmhs" class="liinternal">A law of robustness for neural networks</a> : I explain the conjecture we recently made that, for random data, any interpolating two-layers neural network must have its Lipschitz constant larger than the squareroot of the ratio between the size of the data set and the number of neurons in the network. This would prove that overparametrization is *necessary* for robustness.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/U-XsUB69mvc" class="liinternal">Provable limitations of kernel methods</a> : I give the proof by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Yuanzhi Li that there are simple noisy learning tasks where *no kernel* can perform well while simple two-steps procedures can learn.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/6-GBDpe2kuI" class="liinternal">Memorization with small neural networks</a> : I explain old (classical combinatorial) and new (NTK style) construction of optimally-sized interpolating two-layers neural networks.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/HIwZH2C--nA" class="liinternal">Coordination without communication</a> : This video is the only one in the current series where I don’t talk at all about neural networks. Specifically it is about the cooperative multiplayer multiarmed bandit problem. I explain the strategy we devised with Thomas Budzinski to solve this problem (for the stochastic version) without *any* collision at all between the players.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/O84mcq7P_es" class="liinternal">Randomized smoothing for certified robustness</a> : Finally, in the first video chronologically, I explain the only known technique for provable robustness guarantees in neural networks that can scale up to large models.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next video will be about basic properties of tensors, and how it can be used for smooth interpolation (in particular in the context of our law of robustness conjecture). After that, we will see, maybe more neural networks, maybe more bandits, maybe some non-convex optimization ….</p>
<p>Stay safe out there!</p><p></p></div>

<p><em>[If you’re not American, or you’re American but a masochist who enjoys the current nightmare, this post won’t be relevant to you—sorry!]</em></p>



<p>Until recently, this blog had a tagline that included “HOLD THE NOVEMBER US ELECTION BY MAIL.”  So I thought I should warn readers that circumstances have changed in ways that have important practical implications over the next few weeks.  It’s no longer that we <em>don’t know</em> whether Trump and Pence will acknowledge a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">likely loss</a>—rather, it’s that <em>we know they won’t</em>.  They were repeatedly asked; we all heard their answers.</p>



<p>That means that the <em>best</em> case, the ideal scenario, is already without precedent in the country’s 240-year history.  It’s a president who never congratulates the winner, who refuses to meet him or coordinate a transfer of power, who skips the inauguration, and who’s basically dragged from the White House on January 20, screaming to his supporters (and continuing to scream until his dying breath) that the election was faked.</p>



<p>As I said, that banana-republic outcome is now the <em>best</em> case.  But it’s also plausible that Trump simply declares himself the winner on election night, because the mail-in votes, urban votes, yet-to-be-counted votes, or any other votes that trend the wrong way are fake; social media and the Murdoch press amplify this fantasy; Trump calls on Republican-controlled state legislatures to set aside the “rigged” results and appoint their own slates of electors; the legislatures dutifully comply; and the Supreme Court A-OKs it all.  If you think none of that could happen, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR28w8ZJIZSlvqoOT-To3UWgMj4wVc9PkDA7Vbs60S_J7T0kOo1_RyVGe98">read this <em>Atlantic</em> article</a> from a few weeks ago, carefully to the end, and be more terrified than you’ve ever been in your life.  And don’t pretend that you know what would happen next.</p>



<p>I know, I know, I’m mentally ill, it’s Trump Derangement Syndrome, I see Nazis behind every corner just because they killed most of my relatives, a little global pandemic here and economic collapse there and riots and apocalyptic fires and resurgent fascism and I act as though it’s the whole world coming to an end.  A few months from now, after everything has gone swimmingly, this post will still be here and you can come back and tell me how crazy I was.  I accept that risk.</p>



<p>For now, though, the best chance to avert a catastrophe is for Trump not merely to lose, but <strong>lose in a landslide that’s already clear by election night</strong>.  Which means: as Michelle Obama <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21373177/michelle-obama-dnc-2020-speech-voting-post-office">advised</a> already in August, put on your mask, brave the virus, and vote in person if you can—<em>especially</em> if you live in a state that’s in play, and that won’t start tallying mail-in ballots till after election day.  If your state allows it, and if early votes will be counted by election night (check this!), vote early, when the lines are shorter.  That’s what Dana and I did this morning; Texas <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/04/joe-biden-win-texas/">going blue</a> on election night would be one dramatic way to foreclose shenanigans.  If you can’t vote in person, or if your state counts mail-in ballots earlier, then vote by mail or drop-box, but <em>do it now</em>, so you have a chance to fix any problems well before Election Day.  (Note that, even in normal circumstances—which these aren’t—a substantial fraction of all mail-in ballots get rejected because of trivial errors.)  I welcome other tips in the comments, from the many readers more immersed in this stuff than I am.</p>



<p>And if this post helped spur you in any way, please say so in the comments.  It will improve my mood, thereby helping me finish my next post, which will be on the Continuum Hypothesis.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> It’s always fascinating to check my comments and see the missives from parallel universes, where Trump is a normal candidate who one might decide to vote for based on normal criteria, rather than what he himself has announced he is: a knife to the entire system that underlies such decisions.  For a view from <em>this</em> universe, see (e.g.) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02852-x?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=organic&amp;utm_campaign=NGMT_USG_JC01_GL_Nature&amp;fbclid=IwAR1tLfLbZwXPd6U3a8BnqxvvMxo3SUDPWxhQccXYz9BU9_dL8x8deY3_dRc">today’s <em>Nature</em> editorial</a>.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Another Update:</span></strong> If it allays anyone’s fears, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of pandemic preparedness when Dana and I went to vote.  It was in a huge, cavernous gym on the UT campus, the lines were very short, masks and 6ft distancing were strictly enforced, and finger-coverings and hand sanitizer were offered to everyone.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Update (10/16):</span></strong> For those who are interested, here’s a <a href="https://mattasher.com/2020/10/16/scott-aaronson-on-the-hunt-for-real-randomness/">new podcast with me and Matt Asher</a>, where we talk about the use of quantum mechanics (especially Bell inequality violations) to generate certified random numbers.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p> MATH:</p><p>My last <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/10/revisiting-continuum-hypothesis.html">post</a> on CH mentioned that Hugh Woodin used to think NOT(CH) but now thinks CH. In both cases his reasons have some math content to them. Also, note that Hugh Woodin seems to believe that CH somehow HAS an answer. Kurt Godel also thought CH HAS an answer. It has been said that he could have announced  his result that CH is consistent by saying  L is THE model, and the problem is now solved. </p><p>Should we care what Hugh Woodin and Kurt Godel think about CH?</p><p>YES- they have both studied the issue A LOT. If you think CH should have an answer, then surely you would care what they think. </p><p>NO-  CH has no answer so there opinions are no better than mine. If you think CH does not have an answer then you might think this; however, I think you should still be at least INTERESTED in what people who have thought about the problem A LOT have to say, even if you will disagree with them.</p><p>But with MATH there are people who clearly know more than you on topics you care about, so it is worth hearing what they have to say. </p><p>POLITICS:</p><p>Recently Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson (by Wikipedia: actor, producer, businessman, and former professional wrestler) ENDORSED Joe Biden. Should we care about his opinion? Maybe, if wrestling fans and former pro wrestler tend to be Republicans, so this may indicate a shift. I do not know if this is the case. </p><p>Robert De Niro was in favor of impeaching Donald Trump. He also said that Trump was like a Gangster. He would know because he was in the movie GOODFELLOWS and later THE IRISHMAN (about Jimmy Hoffa). To be fair I do not think he said that is how he would know. Even so, I don't think I care what he thinks, unless he has some specialized knowledge I do not know about. </p><p>David Frum is a republican who had a break with the party NOT over Donald Trump, but over Obamacare- which you may recall was originally a CONSERVATIVE response to Hillarycare by the Heritage Foundation.  He has a good article on this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-republican-waterloo/520833/">here</a>. Because he is an intelligent  republican in favor of Obamacare (or some version of it) he is worth listening to.</p><p>In POLITICS its trickier- who is worth listening to and why. For all I know, THE ROCK has made a detailed study of the Republican and Democratic platforms (actually this cannot be true since the Republicans did not have a platform this time). </p><p>COMMERCIALS:</p><p>Tom Selleck (Actor-Magnum PI a while back, Blue Bloods now)  does commercials for reverse mortgages. A while back I asked a group of people WHY he is doing them. Here were some answers and reactions</p><p>a) He needs the money. Not likely, he seems to have done well and does not seem to have the kind of bad habits (e.g., drugs) that need money. Maybe he has expensive tastes (my only expensive tastes is in fine European Kit Kat bars--- which actually are not that expensive). </p><p>b) He likes doing commercials. Maybe.</p><p>c) He believes in the product. At this, everyone cracked up in laughter.</p><p>This raises a more general point: Why does ANYONE believe ANY commercial since we KNOW the actor is being PAID to say it. I ask non rhetorically as always. </p></div>

<p>
Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez have won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics. The prize is divided half to Penrose for theoretical work and half to Genzel and Ghez for finding a convincing and appreciably large practical example.

</p><p>
Today we congratulate the winners and give further musings on the nature of knowledge and the role of theory.

</p><p>
The physics Nobel has always had the rule that it cannot be for a theory alone, no matter how beautiful and how many mathematical discoveries follow from its development. Stephen Hawking’s theory of black-hole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">radiation</a> is almost universally accepted, despite its association with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox">paradox</a>, yet it was said that only an empirical confirmation such as mini-black holes being discovered to explode in an accelerator core would have brought it a Nobel. The official citation to Sir Roger says that his prize is:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity.” </em>
</blockquote>




<p>
What is a “robust” prediction? The word strikes us as having overtones of <em>necessity</em>. Necessary knowledge is the kind we deal with in mathematics. The citation to Genzel and Ghez stays on empirical grounds:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.” </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
The “object” <em>must</em> be a black hole—given relativity and its observed gravitational effects, it cannot be otherwise. Among many possible witnesses for the reality of black holes—one being the evident origin of the gravitational waves whose <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/waves-hazards-and-guesses/">detection</a> brought the 2017 Nobel—the centers of galaxies are hefty examples. The combination of these citations opens several threads we’d like to discuss.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> The Proof Horizon of a Black Hole </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Dick and I are old enough to remember when black holes had the status of conjecture. One of my childhood astronomy books stated that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1">Cygnus X-1</a> X-ray source was the best known candidate for a black hole. In 1974, Hawking bet Kip Thorne that it was not a black hole. The bet lasted until 1990, when Hawking conceded. He wrote the following in his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">book</a>, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> This was a form of insurance policy for me. I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. But in that case, I would have the consolation of winning my bet. … When we made the bet in 1975, we were 80% certain that Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. By now [1988], I would say that we are about 95% certain, but the bet has yet to be settled. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
In the 1980s, I was a student and then postdoc in Penrose’s department, so I was imbued with the ambience of black holes and never had a thought about doubting their existence. I even once spent an hour with John Wheeler, who coined the term “black hole,” when Penrose delegated me to accompany Wheeler to Oxford’s train station for his return to London. But it seems from the record that the progression to regarding black holes as proven entities was as gradual as many argue the act of crossing a large black hole’s event horizon to be. Although the existence of a central black hole from data emanating from Sagittarius had been proposed at least as far back as 1971, the work by Ghez and then Genzel cited for their prize began in 1995. The official <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/press-release/">announcement</a> for Riccardo Giacconi’s share of the 2002 physics Nobel stated:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “He also detected sources of X-rays that most astronomers now consider to contain black holes.” </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This speaks lingering doubt at least about <em>where</em> black holes might be judged to exist, if not their existence at all.

</p><p>
However their time of confirmation might be pinpointed, it is the past five years that have given by far the greatest flood of evidence, including the first visual <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2019/4/19/how-scientists-captured-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole/">image</a> of a black hole last year. The fact of their presence in our universe is undeniable. But <em>necessity</em> is a separate matter, and with Penrose this goes back to 1964.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Relativity and Necessity </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/an-interview-with-kurt-gdel/">mentioned</a> Kurt Gödel’s solution to the equations of general relativity (GR) in which time travel is possible. This does not mean that time travel must be possible, or that it is possible in our universe. A “solution” to GR is more like a <em>model</em> in logic: it may satisfy a theory’s axioms but have other properties that are contingent (unless the theory is <em>categorical</em>, meaning that all of its models are isomorphic). Gödel’s model has a negative value for Einstein’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant">cosmological constant</a>; the 2011 physics Nobel went to the discovery that in our universe the constant has a tiny <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/empirical-humility/">positive</a> value. GR also allows solutions in which some particles (called <em>tachyons</em>) travel faster than light.

</p><p>
That GR has solutions allowing black holes had been known from its infancy in work by Karl Schwarzschild and Johannes Droste. There are also solutions without black holes; a universe with no mass is legal in GR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_solution_(general_relativity)">many ways</a> besides the case of special relativity. Penrose took the opposite tack, of giving minimal conditions under which black holes are <em>necessary</em>. Following this <a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-how-penrose-genzel-and-ghez-helped-put-black-holes-at-the-centre-of-modern-astrophysics-147613">article</a>, we list them informally as follows:

</p><p>


</p><ol> 
<li>
Sufficiently large concentrations of mass exerting gravity exist. 
</li><li>
Gravity always attracts, never repels. 
</li><li>
No physical effect can travel faster than light. 
</li><li>
Gravity determines how light bends and moves. 
</li><li>
The space-time manifold is metrically complete. 
</li></ol>



<p>
Penrose showed that any system obeying these properties and evolving in accordance with GR must develop black holes. He showed this without any symmetry assumptions on the system. Thus he derived black holes as a prediction with the force of a theorem derived from minimal axioms.

</p><p>
His 1965 <a href="http://quantum-gravitation.de/media/2d2cde3ec9c38fffffff80d0fffffff1.pdf">paper</a> actually used a proof by contradiction. He derived five properties needed in order for the system to avoid forming a singularity. Then he showed they are mutually inconsistent—a proof by contradiction. Here is the crux of his paper:

</p><p>




</p><p>

</tbody></table>



<p>
In the diagram, time flows up. The point in a nutshell—a very tight nutshell—is that once a surface flows inside the cylinder at the Schwarzschild radius then light and any other motion from it can go only inward toward a singularity. The analysis is possible without the kind of symmetry assumption that had been used to tame the algebraic complexity of the equations of GR. The metric completeness mandates a singularity apart from any symmetries; a periodic equilibrium is ruled out by analysis of Cauchy surfaces.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Necessary For Us? </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Like Richard Feynman’s famous diagrams for quantum field theory, Penrose developed his diagrams as tools for shortcutting the vicissitudes of GR. We could devote entire other posts to his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">tiles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">triangle</a> and other combinatorial inventions. His tools enable quantifying black-hole formation from observations in our universe.

</p><p>
The question of <em>necessity</em>, however, pertains to other possible universes. Let us take for granted that GR and quantum theory are facets of a physical theory that governs the entire cosmos—the long-sought “theory of everything”—and let us also admit the contention of inflationary theorists that multiple universes are a necessary consequence of any inflation theory. The question remains, <em>are black holes necessary in those universes?</em>

</p><p>
It is possible that those universes might not satisfy axiom 1 above, or might have enough complexity for existence of black holes but not large-scale formation of them. The question then becomes whether black holes must exist in any universe rich enough for sentient life forms such as ourselves to develop. This is a branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">anthropic principle</a>.

</p><p>
Lee Smolin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_natural_selection">proposed</a> a mechanism via which black holes engender new universes and so propagate the complexity needed for their large-scale formation. Since complexity also attends the development of sentient life forms, this would place our human existence in the wake of consequence, as opposed to the direction of logic when reasoning by the anthropic principle.

</p><h2> A Little More About Science </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded this week to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for their lead roles in developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a> gene-editing technology, specifically around the protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9">Cas9</a>. 

</p><p>
We argue that two more different types of results cannot be found: 

</p><p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Penrose shows that black holes and general relativity are connected, which is a math result. We still cannot create black holes in a lab to experiment with—or maybe we could but should be very afraid of going anywhere near doing so. It was not clear that there could ever be a real application of this result.

</p><p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Charpentier and Doudna discover that an existing genetic mechanism could be used to edit genetic material. Clearly this can and was experimented on in labs. Also clear that there are applications of this result. Actually it is now a standard tool used in countless labs. There even are patent battles over the method.

</p><p>
We like the fact that Nobels are given for such diverse type of research. It is not just that one is for astrophysics and one for chemistry. It is that Nobels can be given for very different types of research. We think this is important.

</p><p>
But wait. These results do have something in common, something that sets them apart from any research we can do in complexity theory. Both operate like this:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> 	Observe something important from nature. Something that is there independent of us. Then in Penrose’s case explain why it is true. Then in Charpentier and Doudna’s case, use it to solve some important problems. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
We wonder if anything like this could be done in our research world—say in complexity theory?

<div class="content">
We prove a general structural theorem for a wide family of local algorithms, which includes property testers, local decoders, and PCPs of proximity. Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes $q$ adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with $n^{1- 1/O(q^2 \log^2 q)}$ sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron (TOCT 2016). We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. 

Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following.


- We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish (SODA 2020).
- We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev (FOCS 2015) by extending their main result to adaptive testers.
- We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum (ECCC 2013, Computational Complexity 2018) regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation.

Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.</div>

We identify several genres of search problems beyond NP for which existence of solutions is guaranteed.  One class that seems especially rich in such problems is PEPP (for "polynomial empty pigeonhole principle"), which includes problems related to existence theorems proved through the union bound, such as finding a bit string that is far from all codewords, finding an explicit rigid matrix, as well as a problem we call Complexity, capturing Complexity Theory's quest.  When the union bound is generous, in that solutions constitute at least a polynomial fraction of the domain, we have a family of seemingly weaker classes $\alpha$-PEPP, which are inside FP}$^{\text{NP}}|$poly.  Higher in the hierarchy, we identify the constructive version of the Sauer-Shelah lemma and the appropriate generalization of PPP that contains it.  The resulting total function hierarchy turns out to be more stable than the polynomial hierarchy: it is known that, under oracles, total functions within FNP may be easy, but total functions a level higher may still be harder than FP$^{\text{NP}}$.</div>

The determinant is a canonical VBP-complete polynomial in the algebraic complexity setting. In this work, we introduce two variants of the determinant polynomial which we call $StackDet_n(X)$ and $CountDet_n(X)$ and show that they are VP and VNP complete respectively under $p$-projections. The definitions of the polynomials are inspired by a combinatorial characterisation of the determinant developed by Mahajan and Vinay (SODA 1997). We extend the combinatorial object in their work, namely clow sequences, by introducing additional edge labels on the edges of the underlying graph. The idea of using edge labels is inspired by the work of Mengel (MFCS 2013).</div>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://francisbach.com" title="Machine Learning Research Blog">Francis Bach</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p class="justify-text">After two blog posts earlier this year on <a href="https://francisbach.com/chebyshev-polynomials/">Chebyshev</a> and <a href="https://francisbach.com/jacobi-polynomials/">Jacobi</a> polynomials, I am coming back to orthogonal polynomials, with Hermite polynomials. </p>



<p class="justify-text">This time, in terms of applications to machine learning, no acceleration, but some interesting closed-form expansions in positive-definite kernel methods. </p>



<h2>Definition and first properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are many equivalent ways to define Hermite polynomials. A natural one is through the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_formula">Rodrigues’ formula</a>: $$H_k(x) = (-1)^k e^{x^2} \frac{d^k}{d x^k}\big[ e^{-x^2} \big],$$ from which we can deduce \(H_0(x) = 1\), \(H_1(x) =\   – e^{x^2} \big[ -2x e^{-x^2} \big] = 2x\), \(H_2(x) = e^{x^2} \big[ (-2x)^2e^{-x^2} -2 e^{-x^2}  \big] =  4x^2 – 2\), etc.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Other simple properties which are consequences of the definition (and can be shown by recursion) are that \(H_k\) is a polynomial of degree \(k\), with the same parity as \(k\), and with a leading coefficient equal to \(2^k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality for Gaussian distribution.</strong> Using integration by parts, one can show (see end of the post) that for \(k \neq \ell\), we have $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}  \!\!\!H_k(x) H_\ell(x) e^{-x^2} dx =0, $$ and that for \(k=\ell\), we have $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \!\!\! H_k(x)^2 e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In other words, the Hermite polynomials are orthogonal for the Gaussian distribution with mean \(0\) and variance \(\frac{1}{2}\). Yet in other words, defining the <em>Hermite functions</em> as \( \displaystyle \psi_k(x) = (\sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!)^{-1/2} H_k(x) e^{-x^2/2}\), we obtain an orthonormal basis of \(L_2(dx)\). As illustrated below, the Hermite functions, as the index \(k\) increases, have an increasing “support” (the support is always the entire real line, but most of the mass is concentrated in centered balls of increasing sizes, essentially at \(\sqrt{k}\)) and, like cosines and sines, an increasingly oscillatory behavior.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image justify-text"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img width="349" alt="" src="https://francisbach.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/hermite.gif" class="wp-image-4579" height="305" />Plot of Hermite functions \(\psi_k(x) = (\sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!)^{-1/2} H_k(x) e^{-x^2/2}\), from \(k=0\) to \(k=20\).</figure></div>



<p class="justify-text">Among such orthonormal bases, the Hermite functions happen to be diagonalizing the Fourier tranform operator.  In other words, the Fourier transform of \(\psi_k\) (for the definition making it an isometry of \(L_2(dx)\)) is equal to $$ \mathcal{F}(\psi_k)(\omega)  =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \psi_k(x) e^{- i \omega x} dx = (-i)^k \psi_k(\omega).$$ (note that the eigenvalues are all of unit modulus as we have an isometry). See a proof at the end of the post. I am not aware of any applications of this property in machine learning or statistics (but there are probably some).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence.</strong> In order to compute Hermite polynomials, the following recurrence relation is the most useful $$ H_{k+1}(x) = 2x H_k(x) \ – 2k H_{k-1}(x). \tag{1}$$  Such recursions are always available for orthogonal polynomials (see [4]), but it takes here a particularly simple form (see a proof at the end of the post).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Generating function.</strong> The following property is central in many proofs of properties of Hermite polynomials: for all \(t \in \mathbb{R}\), we have $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k(x) =e^{ 2xt \ – \ t^2}, \tag{2}$$ with a proof at the end of the post based on the residue theorem.</p>



<h2>Further (less standard) properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For the later developments, we need other properties which are less standard (there are many other interesting properties, which are not useful for this post, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Mehler formula. </strong>For \(|\rho| &lt; 1\), it states: $$ \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1- \rho^2} (x-y)^2\Big) = \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\rho^k}{2^k k!} H_k(x) H_k(y) \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1+\rho} (x^2 + y^2) \Big).$$ The proof is significantly more involved; see [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jlms/article-pdf/s1-8/3/194/2363185/s1-8-3-194.pdf">1</a>] for details (with a great last sentence: “Prof. Hardy tells me that he has not seen his proof in print, though the inevitability of the successive steps makes him think that it is unlikely to be new”). Note that we will in fact obtain a new proof from the relationship with kernel methods (see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation for Gaussian distributions. </strong>We will need this property for \(|\rho|&lt;1\) (see proof at the end of the post), which corresponds to the expectation of \(H_k(x)\) for \(x\) distributed as a non-centered Gaussian distribution: $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty H_k(x) \exp\Big( – \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} \Big)dx= \sqrt{\pi} \rho^k \sqrt{1-\rho^2} H_k (y). \tag{3}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given the relationship with the Gaussian distribution, it is no surprise that Hermite polynomials pop up whenever Gaussians are used, as distributions or kernels. Before looking into it, let’s first give a brief review of kernel methods.</p>



<h2>From positive-definite kernel to Hilbert spaces</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a prediction problem with inputs in a set \(\mathcal{X}\), a traditional way of parameterizing real-valued functions on \(\mathcal{X}\) is to use <em>positive-definite kernels</em>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A positive-definite kernel is a function \(K: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that for all sets \(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) of \(n\) elements of \(\mathcal{X}\), the “kernel matrix” in \(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) composed of pairwise evaluations is symmetric positive semi-definite. This property happens to be equivalent to the existence of a Hilbert feature space \(\mathcal{H}\) and a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}\) such that $$K(x,x’) = \langle \varphi(x), \varphi(x’) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}},$$ with an elegant constructive proof [<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1950-068-03/S0002-9947-1950-0051437-7/S0002-9947-1950-0051437-7.pdf">15</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">This allows to define the space of linear functions on the features, that is, functions of the form $$f(x) = \langle f, \varphi(x) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}},$$ for \(f \in \mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This space is often called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space" class="">reproducing kernel Hilbert space</a> (RKHS) associated to the kernel \(K\) (we can prove that it is indeed uniquely defined). In such a space, we can also define the squared norm of the function \(f\), namely \(\| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2\), which can be seen as a specific regularization term in kernel methods.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The space satisfies the so-called reproducing property (hence its name): \(f(x) = \langle f, K(\cdot,x) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\). In other words, the feature \(\varphi(x)\) is the kernel function evaluated at \(x\), that is,  \(\varphi(x) = K(\cdot,x)\). These spaces have been a source of many developments in statistics [5] and machine learning [6, 7].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthonormal basis.</strong> A difficulty in working with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of functions is that it is sometimes hard to understand what functions are actually considered. One simple way to enhance understanding of the regularization property is to have an orthonormal basis (in very much the same way as the Fourier basis), as we can then identify \(\mathcal{H}\) to the space of squared-integrable sequences.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For kernel-based Hilbert spaces, if we have an orthonormal basis \((g_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\) of the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), then, by decomposing \(\varphi(x)\) in the basis, we have $$\varphi(x) = \sum_{k =0}^\infty \langle \varphi(x), g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} g_k,$$ we get $$K(x,y) = \langle \varphi(y), \varphi(x) \rangle = \sum_{k =0}^\infty \langle \varphi(x), g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} \langle  \varphi(y), g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} =\sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k(x) g_k(y), \tag{4}$$ that is, we have an expansion of the kernel as an infinite sum (note here, that we ignore summability issues).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Among orthonormal bases, some are more interesting than others. The ones composed of eigenfunctions for particular operators are really more interesting, in particular for the covariance operator that we now present, and their use in statistical learning theory.</p>



<h2>Analyzing ridge regression through covariance operators</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical problem where regularization by RKHS norms occurs is <em>ridge regression</em>, where, given some observations \((x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathbb{R}\), one minimizes with respect to \(f \in \mathcal{H}\): $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big( y_i \ – \langle f, \varphi(x_i) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} \big)^2 +  \lambda \| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">In finite dimensions, the convergence properties are characterized by the (non-centered) covariance matrix \(\Sigma = \mathbb{E} \big[ \varphi(x) \otimes \varphi(x) \big]\), where the expectation is taken with respect to the underlying distribution of the observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) (which are assumed independently and identically distributed for simplicity). If \(\mathcal{H} = \mathbb{R}^d\), then \(\Sigma\) is a \(d \times d\) matrix. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For infinite-dimensional \(\mathcal{H}\), the same expression \(\Sigma = \mathbb{E} \big[ \varphi(x) \otimes \varphi(x) \big]\) defines a linear <em>operator</em> from \(\mathcal{H}\) to  \(\mathcal{H}\), so that for \(f,g \in \mathcal{H}\), we have $$\langle f, \Sigma g \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \mathbb{E} \big[ \langle f, \varphi(x)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\langle g, \varphi(x)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\big] = \mathbb{E} \big[ f(x) g(x) \big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The generalization property of ridge regression has been thoroughly studied (see, e.g., [8, 9]), and if there exists \(f_\ast \in \mathcal{H}\) such that \(y_i = \langle f_\ast, \varphi(x_i) \rangle + \varepsilon_i\) for a noise \(\varepsilon_i\) which is independent of \(x_i\), with zero mean and variance equal to \(\sigma^2\), then the expected error on unseen data is asymptotically upper-bounded by $$\sigma^2 + \lambda \| f_\ast\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{n} {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big].$$ The first term \(\sigma^2\) is the best possible expected performance, the term \(\lambda \| f_\ast\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2\) is usually referred to as the <em>bias</em> term and characterizes the bias introduced by regularizing towards zero, while the third term \(\frac{\sigma^2}{n} {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big]\) is the <em>variance</em> term, which characterizes the loss in performance due to the observation of only \(n\) observations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The quantity \({\rm df}(\lambda) = {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big]\) is often referred to as the degrees of freedom [10]. When \(\lambda\) tends to infinity, then \({\rm df}(\lambda)\) tends to zero; when \(\lambda\) tends to zero, then \({\rm df}(\lambda)\) tends to the number of non-zero eigenvalues of \(\Sigma\). Thus, in finite dimension, this typically leads to the underlying dimension. Given the usual variance term in \(\sigma^2 \frac{d}{n}\) for ordinary least-squares with \(d\)-dimensional features, \({\rm df}(\lambda)\) is often seen as an implicit number of parameters for kernel ridge regression.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In infinite dimensions, under mild assumptions, there are infinitely many eigenvalues for \(\Sigma\), which form a decreasing sequence \((\lambda_i)_{i \geqslant 0}\) that tends to zero (and is summable, with a sum equal to the trace of \(\Sigma\)). The rate of such a decay is key to understanding the generalization capabilities of kernel methods. With the following classical types of decays:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Polynomial decays</em>: If \(\lambda_i \leqslant \frac{C}{(i+1)^{\alpha}}\) for \(\alpha &gt; 1\), then one can upper bound the sum by an integral as $$ {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big] = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \lambda} \leqslant \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1  + \lambda i^\alpha / C} \leqslant \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+\lambda t^\alpha / C} dt.$$ With the change of variable \(u = \lambda t^\alpha / C\), we get that \({\rm df}(\lambda) = O(\lambda^{-\alpha})\). We can then balance bias and variance with \(\lambda \sim n^{-\alpha/(\alpha+1)}\) and an excess risk proportional to \(n^{-\alpha/(\alpha+1)}\). This type of decay is typical of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev spaces</a>.</li><li><em>Exponential decays</em>: If \(\lambda_i \leqslant {C}e^{-\alpha i}\), for some \(\alpha &gt;0\), we have $$ {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big]  \leqslant \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{{C}e^{-\alpha i}}{  \lambda + {C}e^{-\alpha i}} \leqslant \int_{0}^\infty \frac{{C}e^{-\alpha t}}{ \lambda + {C}e^{-\alpha t}}dt.$$ With the change of variable \(u = e^{-\alpha t}\), we get an upper bound $$\int_{0}^1 \frac{C}{\alpha}\frac{1}{ \lambda + {C}u}du = \frac{1}{\alpha}\big[ \log(\lambda + C) \ – \log (\lambda) \big] = \frac{1}{\alpha} \log \big( 1+\frac{C}{\lambda} \big).$$ We can then balance bias and variance with \(\lambda \sim 1/n \) and an excess risk proportional to \((\log n) / n \), which is very close to the usual parametric (finite-dimensional) rate in \(O(1/n)\). We will see an example of this phenomenon for the Gaussian kernel.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In order to analyze the generalization capabilities, we consider a measure \(d \mu\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), and the following (non-centered) <em>covariance operator</em> defined above as $$\mathbb{E} \big[ \varphi(x) \otimes \varphi(x) \big],$$ which is now an self-adjoint operator from \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\mathcal{H}\) with a finite trace. The traditional empirical estimator \(\hat\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(x_i) \otimes \varphi(x_i)\), whose eigenvalues are the same as the eigenvalues of \(1/n\) times the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations (see simulation below).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Characterizing eigenfunctions.</strong> If \((g_k)\) is the eigenbasis associated to the eigenfunctions of \(\Sigma\), then it has to be an orthogonal family that span the entire space \(\mathcal{H}\) and such that \(\Sigma g_k = \lambda_k g_k\). Applying it to \(\varphi(y) = K(\cdot,y)\), we get $$ \langle K(\cdot,y), \Sigma g_k \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \mathbb{E} \big[ K(x,y) g_k(x) \big] = \lambda_k \langle g_k, \varphi(y)\rangle_\mathcal{H} =  \lambda_k g_k(y),$$ which implies that the functions also have to be eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint so-called <em>integral operator</em> \(T\) defined on \(L_2(d\mu)\) as \(T f(y) = \int_{\mathcal{X}} K(x,y) f(y) d\mu(y)\). Below, we will check this property. Note that this other notion of integral operator (defined on \(L_2(d\mu)\) and not in \(\mathcal{H}\)), which has the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is important to deal with mis-specified models (see [9]). Note that the eigenfunctions \(g_k\) are orthogonal for both dot-products in \(L_2(d\mu)\) and \(\mathcal{H}\), but that the normalization to unit norm differs. If \(\| g_k \|_{L_2(d\mu)}=1\) for all \(k \geqslant 0\), then we have \( \| g_k \|^2_\mathcal{H}=  \lambda_k^{-1} \langle g_k, \Sigma g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} = \lambda_k^{-1}\mathbb{E} [ g_k(x)^2] =\lambda_k^{-1}\) , and thus, \(\| \lambda_k^{1/2} g_k \|_{\mathcal{H}}=1\), and we have the kernel expansion from an orthonormal basis of \(\mathcal{H}\): $$K(x,y) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\lambda_k g_k(x) g_k(y),$$ which will lead to a new proof for Mehler formula.</p>



<h2>Orthonormal basis for the Gaussian kernel</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Hermite polynomials naturally lead to orthonormal basis of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). For simplicity, I will focus on one-dimensional problems, but this extends to higher dimension. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Translation-invariant kernels.</strong> We consider a function \(q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) which is integrable, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> (note the different normalization than before) which is defined for all \(\omega \in \mathbb{R}\) because of the integrability: $$\hat{q}(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} q(x) e^{-i \omega x} dx.$$ We consider the kernel $$K(x,y) = q(x-y).$$ It can be check that as soon as  \(\hat{q}(\omega) \in \mathbb{R}_+\)  for all \(\omega \in \mathbb{R}\), then the kernel \(K\) is positive-definite.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For a translation-invariant kernel, we can write using the inverse Fourier transform formula: $$K(x,y) = q(x-y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{q}(\omega) e^{i \omega ( x- y)} d \omega = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \varphi_\omega(x)^* \varphi_\omega(y) d \omega,$$ with \(\varphi_\omega(x) = \sqrt{\hat{q}(\omega) / (2\pi) } e^{i\omega x}\). Intuitively, for a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), with \(\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{f}(\omega)e^{i\omega x} d\omega = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}}\varphi_\omega(x) d\omega\), which is a “dot-product” between the family \((\varphi_\omega(x))_\omega\) and \(\Big( \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}} \Big)_\omega\), the squared norm \(\| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2\) is equal to the corresponding “squared norm” of \(\Big( \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}}\Big)_\omega\), and we thus have $$ \| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \Big| \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}} \Big|^2 d\omega =  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{ | \hat{f}(\omega) |^2}{\hat{q}(\omega)} d\omega,$$ where \(\hat{f}\) is the Fourier transform of \(f\). While the derivation above is not rigorous, the last expression is.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this section, I will focus on the Gaussian kernel defined as \(K(x,y) = q(x-y) =  \exp \big( – \alpha ( x- y )^2 \big)\), for which \(\displaystyle \hat{q}(\omega)= \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{\hat{q}(\omega)} = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \exp\big(  \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)= \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \sum_{k=0}^\infty  \frac{\omega^{2k}}{(4 \alpha)^k k!} \), the penalty \(\|f\|_\mathcal{H}^2\) is a linear combination of squared \(L_2\)-norm of \(\omega^k \hat{f}(\omega)\), which is the squared \(L_2\)-norm of the \(k\)-th derivative of \(f\). Thus, functions in the RKHS are infinitely differentiable, and thus very smooth (this implies that to have the fast rate \((\log n) / n \) above, the optimal regression function has to be very smooth).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthonormal basis of the RKHS</strong>. As seen in Eq. (4), an expansion in an infinite sum is necessary to obtain an orthonormal basis. We have: $$K(x,y) = e^{-\alpha x^2} e^{-\alpha y^2} e^{2 \alpha x y} = e^{-\alpha x^2} e^{-\alpha y^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{ (2\alpha)^k}{k!} x^k y^k.$$ Because of Eq. (4), with \(g_k(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{(2\alpha)^k}{k!}} x^k \exp \big( – \alpha x^2 \big)\), we have a good candidate for an orthonornal basis. Let us check that this is the case. Note that the expansion above alone cannot be used as a proof that \((g_k)\) is an orthonormal basis of \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given the function \(f_k(x) = x^k \exp \big( – \alpha x^2 \big)\), we can compute its Fourier transform as $$ \hat{f}_k(\omega) = i^{-k} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k/2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} H_k \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big) .$$ Indeed, we have, from Rodrigues’ formula, $$H_k \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big) =(-1)^k (4 \alpha)^{k/2} \frac{d^k}{d \omega^k}\big[ \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big) \big],$$ and thus its inverse Fourier transform is equal to \((ix)^k\) times the one of \((-1)^k (4 \alpha)^{k/2} \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)\), which is thus equal to \((-i)^k (4 \alpha)^{k/2} \sqrt{ \alpha / \pi }e^{-\alpha x^2} \), which leads to the Fourier transform formula above.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now compute the RKHS dot products, to show how to obtain the orthonormal basis described in [11]. This leads to $$ \langle f_k, f_\ell \rangle = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k/2}( 4 \alpha)^{-\ell/2}  \int_{\mathbb{R}} H_k \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) H_\ell \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)  d\omega,$$ which leads to, with a change of variable $$ \langle f_k, f_\ell \rangle = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k/2}( 4 \alpha)^{-\ell/2} \sqrt{4 \alpha} \int_{\mathbb{R}} H_k (u) H_\ell (u)  \exp(-u^2) du,$$ which is equal to zero if \(k \neq \ell\), and equal to \(\frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k} \sqrt{4 \alpha} \sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!   = ( 2 \alpha)^{-k} k!\) if \(k = \ell\). Thus the sequence \((f_k)\) is an orthogonal basis of the RKHS, and the sequence \((g_k)\) defined as \(g_k(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{(2\alpha)^k}{k!}} f_k(x)\) is an orthonormal basis of the RKHS, from which, using the expansion as in Eq. (4), we recover the expansion: $$K(x,y) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k(x) g_k(y) = e^{-\alpha x^2} e^{-\alpha y^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{ (2\alpha)^k}{k!} x^k y^k.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This expansion can be used to approximate the Gaussian kernel by finite-dimensional explicit feature spaces, by just keeping the first basis elements (see an application to optimal transport in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10046">12</a>], with an improved behavior using an adaptive low-rank approximation through the Nyström method in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8693-massively-scalable-sinkhorn-distances-via-the-nystrom-method.pdf">13</a>]).</p>



<h2>Eigenfunctions for the Gaussian kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain explicit formulas for the eigenvalues of the covariance operator, we need more than a mere orthonormal basis, namely an eigenbasis.</p>



<p class="justify-text">An orthogonal basis will now be constructed with arguably better properties as it is also an orthonormal basis for both the RKHS and \(L_2(d\mu)\) for a Gaussian measure, that diagonalizes the integral operator associated to this probability measure, as well as the covariance operator.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As seen above, we simply need an orthogonal family \((f_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\), such that given a distribution \(d\mu\),  \((f_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\) is a family in \(L_2(d\mu)\) such that $$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_k(x) K(x,y) d\mu(x) = \lambda_k f_k(y), \tag{5}$$ for eigenvalues \((\lambda_k)\). In the next paragraph, we will do exactly this for the Gaussian kernel \(K(x,y) = e^{-\alpha (x-y)^2}\) for \(\alpha = \frac{\rho}{1- \rho^2}\) for some \(\rho \in (0,1)\); this particular parameterization in \(\rho\) is to make the formulas below not (too) complicated.</p>



<p class="justify-text">With \(f_k(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_k}} H_k(x) \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1+\rho} x^2 \Big)\), where \(N_k = {2^k k!} \sqrt{ \frac{1-\rho}{1+\rho}}\), then \((f_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\) is an <em>orthonormal</em> basis for \(L_2(d\mu)\) for \(d\mu\) the Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance \(\frac{1}{2} \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}\) (this is a direct consequence of the orthogonality property of Hermite polynomials).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, the moment of the Hermite polynomial in Eq. (3) exactly leads to Eq. (5) for the chosen kernel and \(\lambda_k = (1-\rho) \rho^k\). Since the eigenvalues sum to one, and the trace of \(\Sigma\) is equal to one (as a consequence of \(K(x,x)=1\)), the family \((f_k)\) has to be a basis of \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p>From properties of the eigenbasis, since \((f_k)\) is an orthonormal eigenbasis of \(L_2(d\mu)\) and the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_k = (1-\rho)\rho^k\),  we get: $$ K(x,y) = \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1- \rho^2} (x-y)^2\Big) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (1-\rho)\rho^k f_k(x) f_k(y),$$ which is exactly the Mehler formula, and thus we obtain an alternative proof.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We then get an explicit basis and the exponential decay of eigenvalues, which was first outlined by [2]. See an application to the estimation of the Poincaré constant in [<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02327453v1/document">14</a>] (probably a topic for another post in a few months).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Experiments.</strong> In order to showcase the exact eigenvalues of the expectation \(\Sigma\) (for the correct combination of Gaussian kernel and Gaussian distribution), we compare the eigenvalues with the ones of the empirical covariance operator \(\hat\Sigma\), for various values of the number of observations. We see that as \(n\) increases, the empirical eigenvalues match the exact ones for higher \(k\).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I only presented applications of Hermite polynomials to the Gaussian kernel, but these polynomials appear in many other areas of applied mathematics, for other types of kernels within machine learning such as dot-product kernels [3], in random matrix theory (see <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/topics-in-random-matrix-theory/">here</a>), in statistics for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgeworth_series">Edgeworth expansions</a>, and of course for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Hermite_quadrature">Gauss-Hermite quadrature</a>.</p>

<h2>Proof of properties of Hermite polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this small appendix, I give “simple” proofs (that sometimes require knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis">complex analysis</a>) to the properties presented above.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Generating function.</strong> We have, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_theorem">residue theory</a>, $$H_k(x)=(-1)^k e^{x^2} \frac{d^k}{d x^k}\big[ e^{-x^2} \big] = (-1)^k \frac{k!}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}}{(z-x)^{k+1}}dz, $$ where \(\gamma\) is a contour in the complex plane around \(x\). This leads to, for any \(t\) (here, we ignore on purpose the summability issues, for more details, see [4, Section 5.5]): $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k(x) =  \frac{1}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}}{z-x} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k} {(x-z)^{k}}dz, $$ which can be simplified using the sum of the geometric series, leading to $$\frac{1}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}}{z-x} \frac{z-x}{z-x- t} dz =  \frac{1}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}} {z-x- t} dz.$$ Using the first-order residue at \(x+t\). This is thus equal to \(e^{x^2-(t+x)^2} = e^{-t^2 + 2tx}\), which is exactly the generating function statement from Eq. (2).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality for Gaussian distribution.</strong> We can prove through integration by parts, but there is a nicer proof through the generating function. Indeed, with $$ a_{k \ell} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2} H_k(x) H_\ell(x) dx, $$ for \(k, \ell \geqslant 0\), we get $$\sum_{k,\ell = 0}^\infty a_{k \ell} \frac{t^k u^\ell}{k! \ell!} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}\Big(  \sum_{k,\ell = 0}^\infty a_{k \ell} \frac{t^k u^\ell}{k! \ell!}  H_k(x) H_\ell(x) \Big) dx.$$ Using the generating function, this leads to $$\sum_{k,\ell = 0}^\infty a_{k \ell} \frac{t^k u^\ell}{k! \ell!} =  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2 + 2xu-u^2 + 2xt – t^2} dx= e^{2uv} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-(x-u-v)^2}dx, $$ which can be computed explicitly using normalization constants of the Gaussian distribution, as \( \sqrt{\pi} e^{2uv} = \sqrt{\pi} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{ (2  u v)^k}{k!},\) leading to all desired orthogonality relationships using the uniqueness of all coefficients for factors \(t^k u^\ell\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence relationship.</strong> Taking the derivative of the generating function with respect to \(t\), one gets \( \displaystyle (2x-2t) e^{2tx-t^2} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} H_k(x),\) which is equal to (using again the generating function) \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^{k}}{k!} 2x H_k(x) \ – \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{t^{k+1}}{k!} 2 H_k(x).\) By equating the coefficients for all powers of \(t\), this leads to the desired recursion in Eq. (1).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Fourier transform.</strong> Again using the generating function, written $$ e^{-x^2/2 + 2xt – t^2} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} e^{-x^2/2} H_k(x), $$ we can take Fourier transforms and use the fact that the Fourier transform of \(e^{-x^2/2}\) is itself (for the chosen normalization), and then equate coefficients for all powers of \(t\) to conclude (see more details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials#Hermite_functions_as_eigenfunctions_of_the_Fourier_transform">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation for Gaussian distributions.</strong> We finish the appendix by proving Eq. (3). We consider computing for any \(t\), $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \rho^k \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k (y) = e^{2\rho t y – \rho^2 t^2},$$ using the generating function from Eq. (2). We then compute $$A=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\Big( – \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} \Big) \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\Big( – \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} \Big) \exp( 2tx – t^2) dx.$$ We then use \( \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} – 2tx + t^2 = \frac{x^2}{1-\rho^2}  – \frac{2x[ t(1-\rho^2) + \rho y]}{1-\rho^2}  + t^2 + \frac{\rho^2 y^2}{1-\rho^2}\), leading to $$A = \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \exp\Big( -t^2 – \frac{\rho^2 y^2}{1-\rho^2} +(1-\rho^2) \big( t + \frac{\rho y}{1-\rho^2} \big)^2 \Big) = \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{1-\rho^2} e^{2\rho t y – \rho^2 t^2}.$$ By equating powers of \(t\), this leads to Eq. (3).</p></div>

Random walks on expanders are a central and versatile tool in pseudorandomness.  If an arbitrary half of the vertices of an expander graph are marked, known Chernoff bounds for expander walks imply that the number $M$ of marked vertices visited in a long $n$-step random walk strongly concentrates around the expected $n/2$ value. Surprisingly, it was recently shown that the parity of $M$ also has exponentially small bias.

Is there a common unification of these results? What other statistics about $M$ resemble the binomial distribution (the Hamming weight of a random $n$-bit string)? To gain insight into such questions, we analyze a simpler model called the sticky random walk. This model is a natural stepping stone towards understanding expander random walks, and we also show that it is a necessary step. The sticky random walk starts with a random bit and then each subsequent bit independently equals the previous bit with probability $(1+\lambda)/2$. Here $\lambda$ is the proxy for the expander's (second largest) eigenvalue.
    
Using Krawtchouk expansion of functions, we derive several probabilistic results about the sticky random walk. We show an asymptotically tight $\Theta(\lambda)$ bound on the total variation distance between the (Hamming weight of the) sticky walk and the binomial distribution. We prove that the correlation between the majority and parity bit of the sticky walk is bounded by $O(n^{-1/4})$. This lends hope to unifying Chernoff bounds and parity concentration, as well as establishing other interesting statistical properties, of expander random walks.</div>

In certain complexity-theoretic settings, it is notoriously difficult to prove complexity separations which hold almost everywhere, i.e., for all but finitely many input lengths. For example, a classical open question is whether $\mathrm{NEXP} \subset \mathrm{i.o.-}\mathrm{NP}$; that is, it is open whether nondeterministic exponential time computations can be simulated on infinitely many input lengths by $\mathrm{NP}$ algorithms. This difficulty also applies to Williams' algorithmic method for circuit lower bounds [Williams, J. ACM 2014]. In particular, although [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018] proved $\mathrm{NTIME}[2^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}] \not\subset \mathrm{ACC}^0$, it has remained an open problem to show that $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ ($2^{O(n)}$ time with an $\mathrm{NP}$ oracle) is not contained in $\mathrm{i.o.-}\mathrm{ACC}^0$. 
	
In this paper, we show how many infinitely-often circuit lower bounds proved by the algorithmic method can be adapted to establish almost-everywhere lower bounds. 

- We show there is a function $f \in \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ such that for all sufficiently large input lengths $n$ and $\varepsilon \leq o(1)$, $f$ cannot be $(1/2+2^{-n^{\varepsilon}})$-approximated by $2^{n^\varepsilon}$-size $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ circuits on inputs of length $n$, improving lower bounds in [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020] and [Viola, ECCC 2020]. 

- We construct rigid matrices in $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ for all but finitely many inputs, rather than infinitely often as in [Alman and Chen, FOCS 2019] and [Bhangale et al., FOCS 2020]. 

- We show there are functions in $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ requiring constant-error probabilistic degree at least $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ for all large enough $n$, improving an infinitely-often separation of [Viola, ECCC 2020].
	
Our key to proving almost-everywhere worst-case lower bounds is a new ``constructive'' proof of an NTIME hierarchy theorem proved by [Fortnow and Santhanam, CCC 2016], where we show for every ``weak'' nondeterminstic algorithm (with smaller running-time and short witness), a ``refuter algorithm'' exists that can construct ``bad'' inputs for the hard language. We use this refuter algorithm to construct an almost-everywhere hard function. To extend our lower bounds to the average case, we prove a new XOR Lemma based on approximate linear sums, and combine it with the PCP-of-proximity applications developed in [Chen and Williams, CCC 2019] and [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020]. As a byproduct of our new XOR Lemma, we obtain a nondeterministic pseudorandom generator for poly-size $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ circuits with seed length $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$, which resolves an open question in [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020].</div>

<div class="content">
<p>I have been thinking about CH lately for two reasons</p><p>1) I reread the article</p><p>Hilbert's First Problem: The Continuum Hypothesis by Donald Martin from <b>Proceedings of Symposia </b> i<b>n Pure Mathematics: Mathematical developments arising from Hilbert Problems</b>. 1976. (For a book review of the symposia and, <b>The Honor Class</b>, also about Hilbert's problems, see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/bookrev/44-4.pdf">here</a>.)</p><p>The article takes the point of view that CH CAN have an answer. He discusses large cardinals (why assuming they exist is plausible, but alas, that assumption does not seem to resolve CH) and Projective Det.  (why assuming it is true is plausible, but alas, that assumption does not seem to resolve CH).</p><p>(A set A \subseteq {0,1}^omega is DETERMINED if either Alice or Bob has a winning strategy in the following non-fun game: they alternate picking bits a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, ... with Alice going first. If a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2... IS IN A then Alice wins, IF NOT then Bob wins. Martin showed that all Borel sets are determined. Proj Det is the statement that all projections of Borel sets are determined. AD is the axiom that ALL sets A are determined. It contradicts AC.)</p><p>But what really inspired this post is the last paragraph:</p><p><i>Throughout the latter part of my discussion, I have been assuming a naive and uncritical attitude towards CH. While this <b>is</b> in fact my attitude, I by no means wish to dismiss the opposite viewpoint.  Those that argue that the concept of set is not sufficiently clear to fix the truth-value of CH have a position that is at present difficult to assail. As long as no new axiom is found which decides CH, their case will continue to grow stronger, and our assertions that the meaning of CH is clear will sound more and more empty.</i></p><p>2) Scott Aaronson mentioned in a blog post (see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4962">here</a>) that  he has read and understood the proof that CH is independent of set theory.</p><p>SO, this seemed like a good time to revisit thoughts on CH.</p><p> I took a very short poll, just two people, about CH: Stephen Fenner (in a perfect world he would be a set theorists) and Scott Aaronson (having JUST read the proof that CH is ind.  he has thought about it recently).</p><p>Here are some thoughts of theirs and mine</p><p>1) All three of us are Platonists with regard to the Naturals (I was surprised to find recently that there are people who are not!) but not with regard to the reals.  So we would be OKAY with having CH have no answer.</p><p>2) All three of us  agree that it would be nice if SOME axiom was both</p><p>a) Intuitively appealing or aesthetically appealing ,  and</p><p>b) resolved CH.</p><p>I always thought that (a) would be the hard part-- or at least getting everyone (not sure who we are talking about) to AGREE on a new axiom. But even getting an axiom to resolve CH seems hard.  Large cardinals don't seem to do it, and various forms of Determinacy don't seem to do it.</p><p>Scott reminded me of Freiling's Axiom of Symmetry (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiling%27s_axiom_of_symmetry">here</a>) which IS intuitive and DOES resolve CH (its false) though there are problems with it--- a minor variant   of it contradicts AC (I am QUITE FINE with that since AC implies Banach-Tarski which Darling says shows `Math is broken'.)</p><p>Stephen recalled some of Hugh Woodin's opinions of CH, but Hugh seems to have changed his mind from NOT(CH): 2^{aleph_0} = aleph_2, to CH:  2^{aleph_0} = aleph_1.(See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24569622?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a>.)</p><p>3) All three of would be okay with V=L, though note that this would put many set theorists out of work. All the math that applies to the real world would still be intact.  I wonder if in an alternative history the reaction to Russell's paradox would be a formulation of set theory where V=L. We would KNOW that CH is true, KNOW that AC is true. We would know a lot about L but less about forcing.</p><p>4) Which Geometry is true: Euclidian, Riemannian, others? This is now regarded as a silly question: Right Tool, Right Job! If you build a bridge use Euclid. If you are doing astronomy use Riemann. Might Set Theory go the same way? It would be AWESOME if Scott Aaronson found some quantum thing where assuming 2^{aleph_0} = aleph_2 was the right way to model it.</p><p>5) If I was more plugged into the set theory community I might do a poll of set theorists, about CH. Actually, someone sort-of already has. Penelope Maddy has two excellent and readable articles where she studies what set theorists believe and why.</p><p><b>Believing The Axioms I</b>: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf">here</a></p><p><b>Believing The Axioms II</b>: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms2.pdf">here</a></p><p>Those articles were written in 1988.

<p>Apologies dear readers for the late posting. The beginning of the school year is always frenzied, and the pandemic has only added to that frenzy. We have an exciting September, with four papers on graph property testing, <s>one</s> two papers on distribution testing, and one paper that connects both topics.</p>



<p><em>(Ed: we normally scan through ECCC and arXiv, but are happy to post about papers that appear elsewhere. Thanks to the reader who pointed out a relevant COLT 2020 paper.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Estimation of Graph Isomorphism Distance in the Query World</strong> by Sourav Chakraborty, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/135/">ECCC</a>). Graph isomorphism is about as fundamental as it gets, and this papers studies approximating the graph isomorphism distance for dense graphs. There is a known graph \(G_k\) (with \(n\) vertices). The algorithm is given query access to an input graph \(G_u\) and needs to approximate the number of edge inserts/deletes required to make the graphs isomorphic. This is the tolerant testing version; the property testing version is known to be doable in \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})\) queries (<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070680795?journalCode=smjcat">Matsliah-Fischer</a>). The main insight of this paper is to relate the tolerant testing complexity to a distribution testing problem. Consider distributions over the \(\{0,1\}^n\) defined by multisets of \(n\) hypercube points. Our aim is to estimate the earthmover distance between a known distribution and an unknown distribution. Interestingly, the query model is different: one can sample the underlying multisets <em>without</em> replacement. It turns out that the optimal complexity of this problem is (upto polylog factors) is the same as the optimal complexity of tolerant testing of graph isomorphism. A direct corollary is that the isomorphism distance can be approximated upto additive \(\epsilon n^2\) using \(\widetilde{O}(n)\) samples. This equivalence also gives an alternate proof for lower bounds for property testing graph isomorphism.</p>



<p><strong>Robustly Self-Ordered Graphs: Constructions and Applications to Property Testing </strong>by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/149/">ECCC</a>). Let’s start from the application. The aim is to prove the following property testing lower bounds for the bounded-degree graph setting: an exponential separation between tolerant and vanilla testing, and finding an efficiently decidable property (in polynomial time) that cannot be property tested in sublinear time. For binary strings, results of this form are known. Can these be “ported” to the bounded-degree graph world? Can we construct graphs such that adjacency queries reduce to bit queries in strings? Naturally, one can simply represent the adjacency list as a string and treat graph queries as bit queries. But the problem is that of isomorphisms: different bit strings could represent the same graph and therefore, the different bit strings must have the same status with respect to the underlying property. The key insight in this paper is to introduce <em>robustly self-ordered graph</em>s, as a tool to port bit string property testing lower bounds to bounded-degree graphs. Such graphs essentially have a unique (identity) automorphism, even after a few edge insert/deletes. The actual definition is more technical, but that is the essence. The main result is an explicit construction of such graphs, from which the lower bound can be ported directly through a convenient lemma.</p>



<p><strong>Modifying a Graph’s Degree Sequence and the Testablity of Degree Sequence Properties </strong>by Lior Gishboliner (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12697.pdf">arXiv</a>). A sequence of numbers \(D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)\) is graphic if there exists an undirected graph on \(n\) vertices whose degrees are precisely the numbers of the sequence. Graphical sequences have been characterized by classic results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem">Erdös-Gállai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel%E2%80%93Hakimi_algorithm">Havel-Hakimi</a>. This paper first proves the following theorem. Suppose a graphic sequence \(D’\) has \(l_1\)-distance at most \(\delta\) from the degree sequence \(D\) of a graph \(G\). Then, there exists a graph \(G’\) with degree sequence \(D’\) such that the (dense graph) distance between \(G\) and \(G’\) is \(O(\sqrt{\delta})\). This theorem is used to prove an interesting property testing result. Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a subset of graphic sequences that are closed under permutation. Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be the set of graphs that have a degree sequence in \(\mathcal{D}\). Then \(\mathcal{G}\) can be tested in \(poly(1/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Sampling an Edge Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jakub Têtek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11178.pdf">arXiv</a>). In the general model for sublinear algorithms on graphs, an important choice is whether one allows uniform random edge queries. A natural question is whether such queries can simulated efficiently, using only random vertex, degree, and neighbor queries. This problem appears somewhat implicitly in previous sublinear subgraph counting algorithms, and <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10628/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2019-52.pdf">Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum</a> study it explicitly. They prove that one can sample from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution (over edges) using \(O(n/\sqrt{\epsilon m})\) samples. The problem of sampling from exactly the uniform distribution is left open. Until this paper. The main result shows that by modifying the Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum algorithm parameters, one can generate edge samples from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution using \(O((n/\sqrt{m})\log \epsilon^{-1})\) samples. The exact uniform distribution is achieved by setting \(\epsilon = 1/n\), to get a sample complexity of \(O((n\log n)/\sqrt{m})\).</p>



<p><strong>Faster Property Testers in a Variation of the Bounded Degree Model </strong>by Isolde Adler and Polly Fahey (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07770.pdf">arXiv</a>). The setting of bounded-degree graph property testing naturally extends to bounded-degree relational databases, which can be thought of as “directed” hypergraphs. This is an interesting new direction of research, that combines property testing with database theory (see <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/157699299.pdf">Adler-Harwath</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3294052.3319679">Chen-Yoshida</a>). One of the main contributions of this work is to consider another notion of distance: edge and vertex inserts/deletes. This is a natural extension, and we can now compare distances between graphs/databases with different numbers of vertices. The main result is that, under this notion of distance, a large class of properties can be tested in constant running time on databases with bounded degree and treewidth. Specifically, any property expressible in Counting Monadic Second-Order Logic (CMSO) can be tested in constant time. Previous results by Alder-Harwath showed that such properties can be tested (under the standard distance notion) in constant queries, but polylogarithmic time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Testing of Discrete Distributions with High Probability</strong> by Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, Daniel M. Kane, John Peebles, and Eric Price (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06540">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/140/">ECCC</a>). The focus of this paper is distribution testing in the “high probability” regime, where we wish the error of the tester to be \(&lt; \delta\). Typically, most results just get an error of at most \(1/3\), from which standard probabilistic boosting would tack on an extra \(O(\log 1/\delta)\) factor. In standard TCS settings, one doesn’t focus on optimizing this dependence, but in statistics, there is significant focus on the optimal sample complexity. And indeed, for practical applications, it is crucial to have sharp bounds on the right number of samples required for hypothesis testing. The paper also argues that getting the optimal sample complexity requires new algorithms, even for uniformity testing. There are optimal results given for closeness and independence testing. The optimal sample complexity only pays a multiplicative factor of \(\log^{1/3} (1/\delta)\) or \(\log^{1/2}(1/\delta)\) over the optimal bound for constant error (with other additive terms depending on \(\log(1/\delta)\)).</p>



<p><strong>Bessel Smoothing and Multi-Distribution Property Estimation</strong> by Yi Hao and Ping Li (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/hao20a.html">COLT 2020</a>). Let us consider some standard (tolerant) distribution testing questions, phrases as approximation algorithms. Given sample access to two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) over \([n]\), we may wish to estimate the \(l_1\)-distance, \(l_2\)-distance, relative entropy, etc. between these distributions. One can phrases this problem abstractly as estimating \(\sum_{i \in [n]} f(p_i, q_i)\), where \(f\) is some explicit function. This papers shows that for any 1-Lipschitz function \(f\) that satisfies some “regularity” property, the sum \(\sum_{i \in [n]} f(p_i, q_i)\) can be \(\epsilon\)-approximated with \(O(\epsilon^{-3}n/\sqrt{\log n})\) samples (apologies to the authors to replacing their \(k\) with the more familiar \(n\) for our readers). Thus, we can get sublinear sampling complexity for a very general class of estimation problems. Moreover, this was actually the simplest setting consider in the paper. One can deal with such functions of \(d\) distributions, not just two distributions. One of the corollaries of the theorems is a sublinear tolerant tester for the property of being a mixture of distributions.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We consider statistical inference tasks in a distributed setting where access to data samples is subjected to strict “local constraints,” through a unified framework that captures communication limitations and (local) privacy constraints as special cases. We study estimation (learning) and goodness-of-fit (testing) for both discrete and high-dimensional distributions. Our goal is to understand how the sample complexity increases under the information constraints.<br /><br />In this talk we will provide an overview of this field and a sample of some of our results. We will discuss the role of (public) randomness  and interactivity in information-constrained inference, and make a case for thinking about randomness and interactivity as resources.<br /><br />The work is part of a long-term ongoing collaboration with Clément Canonne (IBM Research) and Himanshu Tyagi (IISc), and includes works done with Cody Freitag (Cornell), Yanjun Han (Stanford), Yuhan Liu (Cornell), and Ziteng Sun (Cornell). </p></blockquote></div>

<p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, Oct 09th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC).  <strong>Alexandr Andoni </strong>from Columbia University will speak about “<em><strong>Approximating Edit Distance in Near-Linear Time</strong></em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edit distance is a classic measure of similarity between strings, with applications ranging from computational biology to coding. Computing edit distance is also a classic dynamic programming problem, with a quadratic run-time solution, often taught in the “Intro to Algorithms” classes. Improving this runtime has been a decades-old challenge, now ruled likely-impossible using tools from the modern area of fine-grained complexity. We show how to approximate the edit distance between two strings in near-linear time, up to a constant factor. Our result completes a research direction set forth in the breakthrough paper of [Chakraborty, Das, Goldenberg, Koucky, Saks; FOCS’18], which showed the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a (strongly) sub-quadratic running time.</p>

Emil Faber is the pretend founder of the pretend Faber College. The 1978 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_House">Animal House</a> starts with a close-up of Faber’s statue, which has the inscription, <b>Knowledge Is Good</b>.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we might talk about knowledge, science, mathematics, proofs, and more.<br />
<span id="more-17368"></span></p>
<p>
The phrase on Faber’s pedestal is meant to be a joke, as is the subtitle we added saying the same about science. But there is some truth to both of them. From the cause of climate change to the best response to the current pandemic to sports predictions there is much interest in science. Science is good, indeed.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/faberpedestal.jpg"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/faberpedestal.jpg?w=300" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-17661" height="228" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Science </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What is science and what are methods of creating knowledge via science? There is a whole world on the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>. The central questions are: What is science? What methods are used to create new science? Is science good?—just kidding. </p>
<p>
We are not experts on the philosophy of science. But there seem to be three main ways to create scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Experiments:</i> This is the classic one. Think about the testing of a candidate vaccine to stop the pandemic. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Computational Experiments:</i> This is relatively new. Think computer simulations of how climate change is effected by the methods of creating energy—for example. wind vs. coal. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Mathematical Proofs:</i> This is the one we focus on here at GLL. Think proofs that some algorithm works or that there is no algorithm that can work unless… </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Mathematical Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We are interested in creating knowledge via proving new theorems. This is how we try to create knowledge. Our science is based not on experiments and not on simulations but mostly on the theorem-proof method. Well not exactly. We do use experiments and simulations. For example, the field of quantum algorithms uses both of these.</p>
<p>
However, math proofs are the basis of complexity theory. This means that we need to create proofs and then check that they are correct. The difficulty of checking a proof is based on who created them: </p>
<ul>
<li>
You did—checking your own work. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone else did—refereeing for a journal. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone in your class did—grading exams. <p></p>
</li><li>
Some graduate student did—mentoring. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone on the web who claims a major result like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> did—debugging. <p></p>
</li><li>
And so on.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My Favorite Checking Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My favorite tool for checking is this trick: Suppose that we have a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> that demonstrates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies X}" class="latex" title="{A \implies X}" /> is true. Sometimes it is possible to show that there is a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> that proves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" title="{A \implies Y}" /> where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> is based on changing the claimed proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
The proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> demonstrates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" title="{A \implies Y}" />, and; <p></p>
</li><li>
The statement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> does not follow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
One way this commonly arises is when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> as a proof did not use all of the assumptions in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> really proves more that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and it proves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. But we note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is not a consequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />.</p>
<p>
For example, consider the Riemann hypothesis. Suppose that we claim that we have a proof that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%5Cneq+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " /></p>
<p>follows from the usual axioms of math plus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" />. Sounds great. But suppose this is based on an argument that assumes that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " /></p>
<p>and manipulates the summation, eventually yielding a contradiction, without using the condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" />. This is a problem, since there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3D+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" /> so that the sum is zero. This is an example of the above method of checking. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A New Checking Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
From time to time claims are made of resolutions to famous conjectures. Think <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. These claims have all been wrong to date. So most researchers are reluctant to take time to check any new claims. Why would you take the effort to try and find the bug that is likely there? </p>
<p>
I wonder if there could be a method that is based on competition. For concreteness, suppose Alice and Bob are two researchers who both claim a resolution to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> problem. Alice has a lower bound argument that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> and Bob has an upper bound that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. Could we have them play a “game”? </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Give their papers to each other. Have them try to find a flaw in each other’s paper. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
They are highly motivated. Could we argue that if they cannot find any flaw then we would be slightly more motivated to look at the papers? </p>
<p>
This might work even if they both claim <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. Ken and I, personally, have had more claims of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" /> brought to our attention. Even in this case they would be highly motivated: the awards, the prizes, the praise will go to the one who is correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Possible Extensions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One difference in our situation from classic empirical science is the nature of gaps in knowledge. For example, one of the big current controversies in physics is over the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>. The Wikipedia article we just linked seems to date mostly to years around 2012 when dark matter was more widely accepted than <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/doubting-dark-matter-f3e400c7dcd7">strikes</a> us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-dark-matter-real/">today</a> (see also <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/dark-matter-nightmare-what-if-we-just.html">this</a> and <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/are-dark-energy-and-dark-matter.html">this</a>). There are cases where two competing theories are incompatible yet the available data do not suffice to find a fault in either. </p>
<p>
Whereas, with claimed proofs of incompatible statements, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />, at least one must have a demonstrable error. The statements themselves may have barriers all the way up to undecidability, but that does not matter to judging the proffered proofs.</p>
<p>
The method may be more applicable in life sciences where the gap is gathering sufficient field or lab observations. For a topical example, consider claims about the risk or safety of human gatherings amid the pandemic. One extreme is represented by the extraordinary <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13670.pdf">claim</a>, which is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-do-crowds-contribute-to-covid-its-complicated/">evidently</a> quite <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/09/14/sturgis-bike-rally-paper-impact-on-covid-19-coronavirus-cases/">excessive</a>, that the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August led to over 250,000 Covid-19 cases. The other extreme would be analyses used to justify gatherings with minimal precautions. The extremes cannot coexist. The means to arbitrate between them are available in principle but require costly social effort for contact tracing and testing as well as resolving mathematical issues between epidemiological models.</p>
<p>

What do you think of our new checking method? Should it be more widely employed for evaluating claims and hypotheses?</p>

<p>David Blackwell was still roaming the corridors of UC Berkeley’s stat department during my postdoc years, circa 2009. Jake Abernethy, Sasha Rakhlin, Peter Bartlett and myself were discussing his results, and his seminal contributions to prediction theory were already well known.</p>

<p>At that time, still the early days of online convex optimization, we were contemplating everything from adaptive gradient methods to bandit convex optimization. Blackwell’s famed approachability theorem was looming in the background, considered to be one of the strongest theorems in the ML-theorists toolkit. </p>



<p>I’ve recently added a new draft chapter to to V2.0 of <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu">Introduction to Online Convex Optimization</a>, about the connection between OCO and Blackwell approachability: they are algorithmically equivalent! More precisely, an efficient algorithm for approachability gives rise to an efficient algorithm for OCO with sublinear regret, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Details are in the chapter draft, and  I recommend this music for reading it: (the song is called “together we won despite everything”, dedicated to music and science)</p>

Everything pre-covid seems at least five years ago to me, so it's hard to believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> is a 2020 result. To remind you, consider the model where we have two powerful provers put in separate rooms where they can't communicate (think suspects of a crime put in separate interrogation rooms). An computationally efficient verifier can ask them questions based on random coins. Thirty years ago, Laszlo Babai, Carsten Lund and myself <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01200056">showed</a> that every language in nondeterministic exponential time has proofs in this model.<div><br /></div><div>Now suppose the provers have entangled quantum bits. This question has a long history that culminates in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE paper</a> earlier this year by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, Henry Yuen showing that every proof of any length can be proven in this model. Incredible!</div><div><br /></div><div>But wait, why is there a new version 2 dated last week? Turns out the MIP* = RE paper relied on a 2016 paper by Vidick which was later discovered to have a bug. No worries, as the authors of the MIP* = RE paper got around this issue by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">quantum analysis</a> of a low-degree test from that old Babai-Fortnow-Lund paper.</div><div><br /></div><div>Vidick's <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">blog post</a> explains it all, including the angst of a major result falling apart temporarily. He has <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/babai-strikes-back.html">good</a> <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke">company</a>.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged.  They are a national treasure.  Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.”  Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism?  After all, only the most gifted athletes participate.  There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.<br />—Carl Sagan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"><em>The Demon-Haunted World</em></a> (1996)</p></blockquote>



<p>I’d like you to feel about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">impending destruction</a> of Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan">Bamyan Buddhas</a>, and then days later actually did blow them up.  Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape.  For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected.  I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the <em>avoidability</em>, and yet the finality, of the loss.</p>



<p>For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline.  Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but<em> totally within your control</em>—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system.  Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.</p>



<p>When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so <em>this</em> is the teenagerhood—the ironically <em>normal</em> teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else.  I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country.  I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html">Stuyvesant and Bronx Science</a> in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now.  The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.</p>



<p>Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening.  As the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s Jay Matthews <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646">explains</a>, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school <em>also</em> happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).</p>



<p>You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does?  It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/">they did in the 1990s</a>, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged.  But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it.  Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.</p>



<p>The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS.  More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity.  And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, <em>still</em> it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.</p>



<p>So yes, the district is <strong>embarrassed</strong>—note that the<em> Washington Post</em> writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni.  To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.</p>



<p>In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to <strong>drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically <em>increasing</em> (!!!) the number of White students</strong>.  The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small.  Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be<strong> overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant</strong>; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.</p>



<p>In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">protesting in front of TJHS</a> to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction.  But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed.  The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.</p>



<p>Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff <em>weigh</em> on you so heavily?  This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in <em>one</em> case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared.  On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me.  With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?</p>



<p>If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them.  You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.</p>



<p>I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of <em>resentment</em> toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity,  “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong.  And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?  Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept <em>you</em>, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow?  And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: <strong>I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison</strong>.  (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<p>

</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
