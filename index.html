widespread applications in machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics.
However, it is unknown whether Wasserstein barycenters can be computed in
polynomial time, either exactly or to high precision (i.e., with
$\textrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon)$ runtime dependence). This paper answers these
questions in the affirmative for any fixed dimension. Our approach is to solve
an exponential-size linear programming formulation by efficiently implementing
the corresponding separation oracle using techniques from computational
geometry.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Kevin O'Connor, Kevin McGoff, Andrew Nobel <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07998">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We study an extension of optimal transport techniques to stationary Markov
chains from a computational perspective. In this context, naively applying
optimal transport to the stationary distributions of the Markov chains of
interest would not capture the Markovian dynamics. Instead, we study a new
problem, called the optimal transition coupling problem, in which the optimal
transport problem is constrained to the set of stationary Markovian couplings
satisfying a certain transition matrix condition. After drawing a connection
between this problem and Markov decision processes, we prove that solutions can
be obtained via the policy iteration algorithm. For settings with large state
spaces, we also define a regularized problem, propose a faster, approximate
algorithm, and provide bounds on the computational complexity of each
iteration. Finally, we validate our theoretical results empirically,
demonstrating that the approximate algorithm exhibits faster overall runtime
with low error in a simulation study.

rides across areas in their operating road-networks. As such, dynamic pricing
methods have been used to mediate these demand asymmetries through surge price
multipliers, thus incentivising higher driver participation in the market.
However, the anticipated commercialisation of autonomous vehicles could
transform the current ride-sourcing platforms to fleet operators. The absence
of human drivers fosters the need for empty vehicle management to address any
vehicle supply deficiencies. Proactive redistribution using integer programming
and demand predictive models have been proposed in research to address this
problem. A shortcoming of existing models, however, is that they ignore the
market structure and underlying customer choice behaviour. As such, current
models do not capture the real value of redistribution. To resolve this, we
formulate the vehicle redistribution problem as a non-linear minimum cost flow
problem which accounts for the relationship of supply and demand of rides, by
assuming a customer discrete choice model and a market structure. We
demonstrate that this model can have a convex domain, and we introduce an edge
splitting algorithm to solve a transformed convex minimum cost flow problem for
vehicle redistribution. By testing our model using simulation, we show that our
redistribution algorithm can decrease wait times up to 50% and increase vehicle
utilization up to 8%. Our findings outline that the value of redistribution is
contingent on localised market structure and customer behaviour.

that of the vertex coloring algorithm (Xu et al., 2019a; Morris et al., 2018).
However, for rich node features, such a bound does not exist and GNNs can be
shown to be universal, namely, have the theoretical ability to approximate
arbitrary graph functions. It is well known, however, that expressive power
alone does not imply good generalization.
</p>
<p>In an effort to improve generalization of GNNs we suggest the Low-Rank Global
Attention (LRGA) module, taking advantage of the efficiency of low rank
matrix-vector multiplication, that improves the algorithmic alignment (Xu et
al., 2019b) of GNNs with the 2-folklore Weisfeiler-Lehman (FWL) algorithm;
2-FWL is a graph isomorphism algorithm that is strictly more powerful than
vertex coloring. Concretely, we: (i) formulate 2-FWL using polynomial kernels;
(ii) show LRGA aligns with this 2-FWL formulation; and (iii) bound the sample
complexity of the kernel's feature map when learned with a randomly initialized
two-layer MLP. The latter means the generalization error can be made
arbitrarily small when training LRGA to learn the 2-FWL algorithm. From a
practical point of view, augmenting existing GNN layers with LRGA produces
state of the art results on most datasets in a GNN standard benchmark.

and efficient solution to the active contours and image segmentation issues. In
its basic formulation, the dual-front model regards the meeting interfaces of
two adjacent Voronoi regions as the evolving curves in the course of curve
evolution. One of the most crucial ingredients for the construction of Voronoi
regions or Voronoi diagram is the geodesic metrics and the corresponding
geodesic distance. In this paper, we introduce a new type of geodesic metrics
that encodes the edge-based anisotropy features, the region-based homogeneity
penalization and asymmetric enhancement. In contrast to the original isotropic
dual-front model, the use of the asymmetric enhancement can reduce the risk of
shortcuts or leakage problems especially when the initial curves are far away
from the target boundaries. Moreover, the proposed dual-front model can be
applied for image segmentation in conjunction with various region-based
homogeneity terms, whereas the original model only makes use of the piecewise
constant case. The numerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show
that the proposed model indeed achieves encouraging results.

recent years. In a poisoning attack, the adversary can inject a small number of
specially crafted samples into the training data which make the decision
boundary severely deviate and cause unexpected misclassification. Due to the
great importance and popular use of support vector machines (SVM), we consider
defending SVM against poisoning attacks in this paper. We consider two common
strategies for defending: designing robust SVM algorithms and data
sanitization. Though several robust SVM algorithms have been proposed before,
most of them either are in lack of adversarial-resilience or rely on strong
assumptions about the data distribution or the attacker's behavior. Moreover,
the research on the complexities is still quite limited nowadays. We are the
first, to the best of our knowledge, to prove that even the simplest
hard-margin one-class SVM with outliers problem is NP-complete, and has no
fully PTAS unless P=NP. For the data sanitization defense, we link it to the
intrinsic dimensionality of data; in particular, we provide a sampling theorem
in doubling metrics for explaining the effectiveness of DBSCAN (as a
density-based outlier removal method) for defending against poisoning attacks.
In our empirical experiments, we compare several defenses including the DBSCAN
and robust SVM methods, and investigate the influences from the intrinsic
dimensionality and data density to their performances.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Sepehr Assadi, Shay Solomon <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07628">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Maximal independent set (MIS), maximal matching (MM), and
$(\Delta+1)$-coloring in graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ are among the most
prominent algorithmic graph theory problems. They are all solvable by a simple
linear-time greedy algorithm and up until very recently this constituted the
state-of-the-art. In SODA 2019, Assadi, Chen, and Khanna gave a randomized
algorithm for $(\Delta+1)$-coloring that runs in $\widetilde{O}(n\sqrt{n})$
time, which even for moderately dense graphs is sublinear in the input size.
The work of Assadi et al. however contained a spoiler for MIS and MM: neither
problems provably admits a sublinear-time algorithm in general graphs. In this
work, we dig deeper into the possibility of achieving sublinear-time algorithms
for MIS and MM.
</p>
<p>The neighborhood independence number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\beta(G)$,
is the size of the largest independent set in the neighborhood of any vertex.
We identify $\beta(G)$ as the ``right'' parameter to measure the runtime of MIS
and MM algorithms: Although graphs of bounded neighborhood independence may be
very dense (clique is one example), we prove that carefully chosen variants of
greedy algorithms for MIS and MM run in $O(n\beta(G))$ and
$O(n\log{n}\cdot\beta(G))$ time respectively on any $n$-vertex graph $G$. We
complement this positive result by observing that a simple extension of the
lower bound of Assadi et.al. implies that $\Omega(n\beta(G))$ time is also
necessary for any algorithm to either problem for all values of $\beta(G)$ from
$1$ to $\Theta(n)$. We note that our algorithm for MIS is deterministic while
for MM we use randomization which we prove is unavoidable: any deterministic
algorithm for MM requires $\Omega(n^2)$ time even for $\beta(G) = 2$.

could be given, when the transcendence degree $r$ of the input polynomials is
smaller than the number of variables $n$. If $d$ is the degree bound on the

$d^n\ge d^r$). Also, we significantly improve effective Nullstellensatz

bins, as follows: each ball selects a set $D$ of $d\ge 2$ bins, independently
and uniformly at random, then the ball is allocated to a least-loaded bin from
$D$ (ties broken randomly). The \emph{maximum load} is the maximum number of
balls in any bin. {In 1999, Azar et al.}\ showed that provided ties are broken
randomly, after $n$ balls have been placed the \emph{maximum load}, is
${\log_d\log n}+O(1)$, with high probability. We consider this popular paradigm
in a dynamic environment where the bins are structured as a \emph{dynamic
hypergraph}. A dynamic hypergraph is a sequence of hypergraphs, say
$\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$, arriving over discrete times $t=1,2,\ldots$, such that the
vertex set of $\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$'s is the set of $n$ bins, but (hyper)edges
may change over time. In our model, the $t$-th ball chooses an edge from
$\mathcal{H}^{(t)}$ uniformly at random, and then chooses a set $D$ of $d\ge 2$
random bins from the selected edge. The ball is allocated to a least-loaded bin
from $D$, with ties broken randomly. We quantify the dynamicity of the model by
introducing the notion of \emph{pair visibility}, which measures the number of
rounds in which a pair of bins appears within a (hyper)edge. We prove that if,
for some $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a dynamic hypergraph has pair visibility at most
$n^{1-\varepsilon}$, and some mild additional conditions hold, then with high
probability the process has maximum load $O(\log_d\log n)$. Our proof is based
on a variation of the witness tree technique, which is of independent interest.
</p>
<p>The model can also be seen as an adversarial model where an adversary decides
the structure of the possible sets of $d$ bins available to each ball.

concepts. The celebrated tree packing theorem of Tutte and Nash-Williams from
1961 states that every $k$-edge connected graph $G$ contains a collection
$\cal{T}$ of $\lfloor k/2 \rfloor$ edge-disjoint spanning trees, that we refer
to as a tree packing; the diameter of the tree packing $\cal{T}$ is the largest
diameter of any tree in $\cal{T}$. A desirable property of a tree packing, that
is both sufficient and necessary for leveraging the high connectivity of a
graph in distributed communication, is that its diameter is low. Yet, despite
extensive research in this area, it is still unclear how to compute a tree
packing, whose diameter is sublinear in $|V(G)|$, in a low-diameter graph $G$,
or alternatively how to show that such a packing does not exist.
</p>
<p>In this paper we provide first non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the
diameter of tree packing. First, we show that, for every $k$-edge connected
$n$-vertex graph $G$ of diameter $D$, there is a tree packing $\cal{T}$ of size
$\Omega(k)$, diameter $O((101k\log n)^D)$, that causes edge-congestion at most
$2$. Second, we show that for every $k$-edge connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ of
diameter $D$, the diameter of $G[p]$ is $O(k^{D(D+1)/2})$ with high
probability, where $G[p]$ is obtained by sampling each edge of $G$
independently with probability $p=\Theta(\log n/k)$. This provides a packing of
$\Omega(k/\log n)$ edge-disjoint trees of diameter at most $O(k^{(D(D+1)/2)})$
each. We then prove that these two results are nearly tight. Lastly, we show
that if every pair of vertices in a graph has $k$ edge-disjoint paths of length
at most $D$ connecting them, then there is a tree packing of size $k$, diameter
$O(D\log n)$, causing edge-congestion $O(\log n)$. We also provide several
applications of low-diameter tree packing in distributed computation.

When I first taught Diffie Helman I read the following<br />
1) Alice and Bob agree on p a prime and g a generator<br />
2) Alice picks a, sends g^a to Bob, Bob picks b, sends g^b to Alice<br />
3) Alice computes (g^b)^a and Bob computes (g^a)^b so they both have g^{ab}<br />
<br />
I knew how to find a prime- pick a number of length n (perhaps make sure the last digit is not even) and test for primality, if not then try again, you'll get one soon enough. I did not know how to find g. I had thought you<i> first </i>find p, and<i> then</i> given p you find g. I then figured out that you make actually pick  p to be a  <i>safe prime</i>, so q=(p-1)/2 is a prime, and then just pick random g and test them via computing  g^2  and g^q: if neither is 1 then g is a generator. You will find a generator soon enough.<br />
<br />
That was all fine. But how come my source didn't <i>say </i>how to find g.?You need to know that to run the algorithm. That was years ago. Then I wondered how common it is for an explanation to not say how to find g. So I Googled ``Diffie-Helman'' I only record those that had some technical content to them, and were not about other DH such as Elliptic Curves.<br />

(There are algorithms for Discrete Log that do well if (p-1)/2 has many factors.)<br />
<br />
3) <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/diffie-hellman-key-exchange/">Comparatech</a>: <i>Alice and Bob start out by deciding two numbers p and g.</i> No mention of how to find p or g.<br />

<br />
<br />
I looked at a few more but it was the same story.<br />
<br />
This is NOT a RANT or even a complaint, but its a question:<br />
<br />
<b>Why do so few expositions of DH mention how to find p,g? You really need to do that if you really want to DO DH.</b><br />
<b><br /></b>
Speculation<br />
<br />
1) Some of the above are for the laymen and hence can not get into that. But some are not.<br />
<br />
2) Some of them are for advanced audiences who would know how to do it. Even so, how to find the generator really needs to be mentioned.<br />
<br />
3) Goldilocks: Some papers are for the layman who would not notice the gap, and some papers are for the expert who can fill in the gap themselves, so no paper in between. I do not believe that.<br />
<br />
4) The oddest of the above is that the original paper did not say how to find g.<br />
<br />

<p>One of the difficulties of extending results from finite graphs to infinite ones is that it is not always obvious how to extend the definitions. A single class of finite graphs may correspond, in the infinite graph world, to several different natural classes of infinite graphs. One of the ways this can happen is through orderings: if a class of graphs has a natural ordering on its vertices (say, through a construction in which graphs in this class are built up by adding one vertex at a time) then we might get several classes of infinite graphs with different ways of restricting or not restricting this vertex ordering.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/threshold.svg" alt="Threshold graph" /></p>

<p>As an example of this phenomenon, consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_graph">threshold graphs</a>, one of the simplest classes of finite graphs. An example is shown above. These can be defined in multiple equivalent ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The finite threshold graphs are the graphs that can be built up by repeatedly adding either a universal vertex or an isolated vertex to a smaller graph. In the example, the vertices have been added in left-to-right order, with isolated vertices depicted in yellow and universal vertices in blue. This can be formalized in a way that extends to infinite graphs by saying that they are the graphs in which every nonempty induced subgraph contains either a universal vertex or an isolated vertex. Let’s call these graphs the “inductive threshold graphs”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can also construct graphs in the reverse ordering, by repeatedly adding a vertex whose neighbors form a clique and whose non-neighbors form an independent set. More concisely, the vertex is both simplicial and cosimplicial. The example above can be constructed in this way by adding the vertices in right-to-left order, with the blue neighbors of each added vertex forming a clique and the yellow neighbors forming an independent set. This can be formalized in a way that extends to infinite graphs by requiring that every induced subgraph has a vertex that is simplicial and cosimplicial. Let’s call a graph with this property a “coinductive threshold graph”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The finite threshold graphs are the -free finite graphs, meaning that no four vertices form an induced subgraph that is a path, cycle, or perfect matching.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The finite threshold graphs get their name from the following property: they are the graphs that we can generate by assigning weights in the interval  to the vertices and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever their sum of weights is at least one. Let’s call a graph with this property a “real threshold graph”.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All four of these properties are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_property">hereditary</a>: if a graph has the property, so do all its induced subgraphs. Because the three forbidden subgraphs , , and  have no universal or isolated vertex, have no simplicial and cosimplicial vertex, and have no valid weight assignment, the inductive threshold graphs, coinductive threshold graphs, and real threshold graphs are all subclasses of the -free graphs.</p>

<p>If a graph is -free, we can define a relation  on its vertices by saying that  if there is no vertex  with  forming an induced path or complement of a path. It follows from the nonexistence of the forbidden subgraphs that this is a total preorder, that every vertex  is universal or isolated among the vertices , and that every vertex  is simplicial and cosimplicial among the vertices . In the example above, two vertices are in the same equivalence class of the ordering if they are in a contiguous block of vertices with the same color, and otherwise their ordering according to  is the same as their left-to-right ordering. Because every finite total preorder has a minimal and a maximal element, every finite -free graph is an inductive threshold graph and a coinductive threshold graph.</p>

<p>However, these properties differ for infinite graphs. In an infinite inductive threshold graph, the total preorder must obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascending_chain_condition">ascending chain condition</a> that there be no strictly-increasing infinite sequence of vertices, for the subgraph induced by the vertices of such a sequence would have no isolated or universal vertex. Conversely, if the order does obey the ascending chain condition, one could find an isolated or universal vertex in any subgraph by starting from an arbitrary vertex and repeatedly moving upwards in the order until getting stuck. So the inductive threshold graphs are exactly the ones whose order obeys the ascending chain condition. Similarly, the coinductive threshold graphs are exactly the ones whose order obeys the descending chain condition. But it is easy to construct orders that violate one or both of these conditions. A graph can only be a real threshold graph if the total order on the equivalence classes of its preorder can be embedded into , and again this is not true of all total orders.</p>

<p>One consequence of this difference between classes of infinite graphs is the construction of natural statements in the first-order <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_of_graphs">logic of graphs</a> that are true for all finite graphs but untrue for some infinite graphs. For instance, the statements that a -free graph has an isolated or universal vertex, and that a -free graph has a simplicial and cosimplicial vertex, are both true of all finite graphs, but untrue of some infinite graphs.</p>

Equivalence testing for a polynomial family $\{g_m\}_{m \in \mathbb{N}}$ over a field F is the following problem: Given black-box access to an $n$-variate polynomial $f(\mathbb{x})$, where $n$ is the number of variables in $g_m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$, check if there exists an $A \in \text{GL}(n,\text{F})$ such that $f(\mathbb{x}) = g_m(A\mathbb{x})$. If yes, then output such an $A$. The complexity of equivalence testing has been studied for a number of important polynomial families, including the determinant (Det) and the family of iterated matrix multiplication polynomials. Two popular variants of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial are: IMM$_{w,d}$ (the $(1,1)$ entry of the product of $d$ many $w\times w$  symbolic matrices) and Tr-IMM$_{w,d}$ (the trace of the product of $d$ many $w\times w$ symbolic matrices). The families - Det, IMM and Tr-IMM - are VBP-complete under $p$-projections, and so, in this sense, they have the same complexity. But, do they have the same equivalence testing complexity? We show that the answer is 'yes' for Det and Tr-IMM (modulo the use of randomness). 

The above result may appear a bit surprising as the complexity of equivalence testing for IMM and that for Det are quite different over rationals: a randomized polynomial-time equivalence testing for IMM over rationals is known [Kayal,Nair,Saha,Tavenas 2019], whereas [Garg,Gupta,Kayal,Saha 2019] showed that equivalence testing for Det over rationals is integer factoring hard (under randomized reductions and assuming GRH). To our knowledge, the complexity of equivalence testing for Tr-IMM was not known before this work. We show that, despite the syntactic similarity between IMM and Tr-IMM, equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and that for Det are randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to each other over any field of characteristic zero or sufficiently large. The result is obtained by connecting the two problems via another well-studied problem in computer algebra, namely the full matrix algebra isomorphism problem (FMAI). In particular, we prove the following: 

1.Testing equivalence of polynomials to Tr-IMM$_{w,d}$, for $d\geq 3$ and $w\geq 2$, is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to testing equivalence of polynomials to Det$_w$, the determinant of the $w \times w$ matrix of formal variables. (Here, $d$ need not be a constant.)

2. FMAI is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to equivalence testing (in fact, to tensor isomorphism testing) for the family of matrix multiplication tensors $\{$Tr-IMM$_{w,3}\}_{w \in \mathbb{N}}$.

These results, in conjunction with the randomized poly-time reduction (shown in [GGKS19]) from determinant equivalence testing to FMAI, imply that the four problems - FMAI, equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and for Det, and the $3$-tensor isomorphism problem for the family of matrix multiplication tensors - are randomized poly-time equivalent under Turing reductions.</div>

<em>Proofs and perpetual motion machines</em><br />
<font color="#000000"></font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/picture.png"><img width="200" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/picture.png?w=200&amp;h=150" class="alignright  wp-image-17193" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>
Leonardo da Vinci is, of course, famous for his paintings and drawings, but was also interested in inventions, and in various parts of science including mathematics and engineering. It is hard to imagine that he died over 500 years ago, given his continued impact on our world. He invented practical and impractical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">inventions</a>: musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.</p>
<p>
Today I wish to discuss proofs and perpetual motion machines.</p>
<p>
You might ask: <i>What do proofs and perpetual motion machines have in common?</i> Proofs refer to math proofs that claim to solve open problems like P <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" title="{\neq}" /> NP. Ken and I get such claims all time. I take a look at them, not because I think they are likely to be correct. Rather because I am interested in understanding how people think. </p>
<p>
I started to work on discussing such proofs when I realized that such “proofs” are related to claims about perpetual motion machines. Let’s see how.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Perpetual Motion Machines </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A perpetual motion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion">machine</a> is a machine that operates indefinitely without an energy source. This kind of machine is impossible, as da Vinci knew already:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Oh ye seekers after perpetual motion, how many vain chimeras have you pursued? Go and take your place with the alchemists. <br />
—da Vinci, 1494 </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I like this statement about applying for US patents on such machines: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Proposals for such inoperable machines have become so common that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has made an official policy of refusing to grant patents for perpetual motion machines without a working model. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Here is a classic attempt at perpetual motion: The motion goes on “forever” since the right side floats up and the left side falls down. </p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/float.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/float.png?w=600" alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17194" /></a></p>
<p>
The analogy of proofs and to perpetual motion machines is: The debunking such a machine is not done by looking carefully at each gear and lever to see why the machine fails to work. Rather is done like this: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Your machine violates the fundamental laws of thermodynamics and is thus impossible. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Candidate machines are not studied to find the exact flaw in their design. The force of fundamental laws allows a sweeping, simple, and powerful argument against them. There are similar ideas in checking a proof. Let’s take a look at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Claims are made about proofs of open problems all the time. Often these are made for solutions to famous open problems, like P<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cneq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\neq}" class="latex" title="{\neq}" />NP or the Riemann Hypothesis (RH).</p>
<p>
Math proofs are used to try to get to the <i>truth</i>. As we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/24/why-check-a-proof/">before</a> proofs are only as good as the assumptions made and the rules invoked. The beauty of the proof concept is that arguments can be checked, even long and complex ones. If the assumptions and the rules are correct, then no matter how strange the conclusion is, it must be true.</p>
<p>
For <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2949/which-one-result-in-mathematics-has-surprised-you-the-most">example</a>:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The Riemann rearrangement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ri emann_series_theorem#Statement_of_the_theorem">theorem</a>. A sum 	</p>

<p>that is conditionally convergent can be reordered to yield any number. Thus there is series 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++b_%7B1%7D+%2B+b_%7B2%7D+%2B+b_%7B3%7D+%2B+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{3} + \dots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  b_{1} + b_{2} + b_{3} + \dots " /></p>
<p>that sums conditionally to your favorite number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> and yet the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb_%7B1%7D%2Cb_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b_{1},b_{2},\dots}" class="latex" title="{b_{1},b_{2},\dots}" /> is just a arrangement of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba_%7B1%7D%2Ca_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a_{1},a_{2},\dots}" class="latex" title="{a_{1},a_{2},\dots}" />. This says that addition is not commutative for infinite series.</p>

<p></p><p><br />
The point of a proof is that it is a series of small steps. If each step is correct, then the whole is correct. But in practice proofs are often checked in other ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Checking Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The starting point for my thoughts—joined here with Ken’s—are these two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A proof that <em>only</em> has many small steps but no global picture is hard to motivate. <p></p>
</li><li>
A proof with complex logic at the high level is hard to understand.
</li></ol>
<p>
Note that a deep, hard theorem can still have straightforward logic. A famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis#Littlewood's_theorem">theorem</a> of Littlewood has for its proof the structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Case the RH is false: Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> <p></p>
</li><li>
Case the RH is true: Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" />
</li></ul>
<p>
The RH-false case takes under a page. The benefit with this logic is that one gets to assume RH for the rest. The strategy for the famous proof by Andrew Wiles of Fermat’s Last Theorem (FLT)—incorporating the all-important fix by Richard Taylor—has this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
If not-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> implies FLT. <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> implies FLT.
</li></ul>
<p>
Wiles had done the last step long before but had put aside since he didn’t know how to get <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />. The key was framing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> so that it enabled bridged the gap in his originally-announced proof while its negation enabled the older proof.</p>
<p>
Thus what we should seek are proofs with simple logic at the high level that breaks into cases or into sequential sub-goals so that the proof is a chain or relatively few of those goals. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Shapes and Barriers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This makes Ken and I think again about an old <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.73.7682">paper</a> by Juris Hartmanis with his students Richard Chang, Desh Ranjan, and Pankaj Rohatgi in the May 1990 <em>Bulletin of the EATCS</em> titled, “On IP=PSPACE and Theorems With Narrow Proofs.” Ken’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/05/17/the-shapes-of-computations/">post</a> on it included this nice diagram of what the paper calls “shapes of proofs”:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/proofshapes.png"><img width="400" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/proofshapes.png?w=400&amp;h=252" class="aligncenter  wp-image-17197" height="252" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Ken’s thought now is that this taxonomy needs to be augmented with a proof shape corresponding to certain classes believed to be properly below polynomial time—classes within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_(complexity)">NC</a> hierarchy. Those proofs branch at the top into manageable-size subcases, and/or have a limited number of sequential stages, where each stage may be wide but is shallow in its chains of dependencies. Call this shape a “macro-tree.”</p>
<p>
The difference between the macro-tree shape and the sequential shapes pictured above is neatly captured by Ashley Ahlin on a <a href="http://www.math.wichita.edu/~pparker/classes/thms.htm">page</a> about “Reading Theorems”:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Note that, in some ways, the easiest way to read a proof is to check that each step follows from the previous ones. This is a bit like following a game of chess by checking to see that each move was legal, or like running a spell-checker on an essay. It’s important, and necessary, but it’s not really the point. … The problem with this is that you are unlikely to remember anything about how to prove the theorem, if you’ve only read in this manner. Once you’re read a theorem and its proof, you can go back and ask some questions to help synthesize your understanding. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The other high-level structure that a proof needs to make evident—before seeing it is reasonable to expend the effort to check it—is shaped by <em>barriers</em>. We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/barriers-to-pnp-proofs/">touched</a> on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/03/13/no-go-theorems/">this</a> topic <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/03/25/whos-afraid-of-natural-proofs/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/18/a-reason-why-circuit-lower-bounds-are-hard/">times</a> but maybe have not stated it full on for P versus NP. A recent <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~liyang/teaching/projects/formal-barriers-to-proving-P-ne-NP.pdf">essay</a> for a course led by Li-Yang Tan at Stanford does so in just a few pages. A proof should state up front how it works around barriers, and this alone makes its strategy easier to follow.</p>
<p>
The idea of barriers extends outside P versus NP, of course. Peter Scholze seems to be invoking it in a <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11709&amp;cpage=1#comment-235940">comment</a> two months ago in a <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=11709">post</a> by Peter Woit in April on the status of Shinichi Mochizuki’s claimed proof of the ABC conjecture:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> I may have not expressed this clearly enough in my manuscript with Stix, but there is just no way that anything like what Mochizuki does can work. … The reason it cannot work is a[nother] theorem of Mochizuki himself. … If the above claims [which are negated by the theorem] would have been true, I would see how Mochizuki’s strategy might have a nonzero chance of succeeding. … </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Thus what Ken and I conclude is that in order for a proof to be checkable <em>chunk by chunk</em>—not line by line—it needs to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A top-level decomposition into a relatively small number of components and stages—like legs in a sailing race—and <p></p>
</li><li>
A demonstration of how the stages navigate around known barriers.
</li></ol>
<p>
Lack of a clear plan in the first already says the proof attempt cannot avoid being snagged on a barrier, as surely as natural laws prevent building a perpetual-motion machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Does this help in ascertaining what shape a proof that resolves the P versus NP problem must have?</p>

<p><i>Guest post by <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~tborgers/">Tilman Borgers</a> (JET Lead Editor), <a href="https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~msi661/">Marciano Siniscalchi</a> (JET Editor), and <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Jason Hartline</a> (JET Associate Editor):</i></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-economic-theory">Journal of Economic Theory (JET)</a> would like to encourage submissions from computer scientists. JET is a leading journal of the economic theory community, and has a broader readership among economists and covers a broader range of topics than other theory journals. JET is also the first field journal of the economic theory community, having been founded more than 50 years ago. Many publications in JET in those 50 years have changed not just the direction of economic theory, but also the direction of economics overall.</p>
<p>The convergence of research interests of computer scientists and economic theorists has been a remarkable development, and JET would like to do more to help facilitate the exchange of ideas across fields. Therefore, we compile here some suggestions for computer scientists who are interested in submitting their work to JET.</p>
<p>The basic standard for a publication in JET is that the paper should be original, make a substantial contribution, and be of interest to a broad group of readers, and this group should include economic theorists. Of course, editors make subjective, and fallible, judgments when assessing whether a paper meets these criteria. Typically, the substantive contribution is a contribution to economic theory, i.e. to our understanding of models of markets, strategic games, mechanisms, etc. Papers may be computer-science centric in its contributions, but then these contributions should be on a topic of interest to economists. For example, new algorithmic results related to game theory or mechanism design may be of interest to JET, if it is the editors’ judgment that these algorithms will be of interest to economists. On the other hand, results on more applied computational problems, such as faster algorithms for winner determination in auctions, or for clearing prediction markets, may be out of scope for JET.</p>
<p>In terms of style, successful JET submissions include an introduction that is accessible to a broad theory audience, and that explains the motivation for the work, overviews the main results, and explains some key intuitions. The introduction, or a separate literature review section, should precisely situate the work relative to the most closely related research. The main body of the paper should explain the model rigorously, and state the results precisely. Proofs which are not very long, and which provide insight, are typically included in the main body of the paper, whereas other proofs are moved to an appendix. It is often useful to paraphrase results in words after stating them formally, and to give explanations of intuitions as well as explanations of proof structures. We encourage authors to make their work as simple as is possible without losing the main message.</p>
<p>There is no length limit per se, but published papers have rarely more than 40 pages, including appendix and references, in print. We value conciseness, and focus on a main theme throughout the paper. Minor results can be left out. On the other hand, we do provide authors with the space needed to be precise and clear.</p>
<p>One general recommendation for computer science authors in preparing manuscripts for economics journals is to have an economist colleague look over the paper before submitting.  This is a good way to identify inaccurate assumptions about readers’ knowledge, or omitted relationships to the prior literature in economics.  Such advice can also help better motivate the results of the paper from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>To be publishable, if an earlier version of a paper was published as an extended abstract in conference proceedings, then the journal version must make additional contributions beyond the conference version.  This additional contribution may include important conceptual aspects of economic interest that were omitted from the original extended abstract, proofs that were omitted from the extended abstract, and additional results that did not appear in the extended abstract. Authors should explain the differences between the conference version and the journal version in a cover letter. Papers that have previously appeared as one or two page abstracts in a conference volume do not need to distinguish themselves.  Mentioning these appearances in a cover letter would useful, however.</p></div>

<p>It’s been an unusually challenging year for both sides of the TCS job market with some unexpected obstacles and delays. Apologies for putting up the spreadsheet later than usual and congrats to both sides in each converged process!</p>

I put in a biased pseudorandom seed, please help populate and share!
Rules for the spreadsheet have been copied from previous years (with one substantial suggestion regarding senior hires based on one of my friends’ recommendation, see below) and all edits to the document are anonymized. Please, post a comment if you have any suggestions about the rules.</p>
<ul>
 <li>Separate sheets for faculty, industry and postdocs/visitors. </li>
 <li>People should be connected to theoretical computer science, broadly defined.</li>
 <li>Only add jobs that you are absolutely sure have been offered and accepted. This is not the place for speculation and rumors. <b>New:</b> Please, be particularly careful when adding senior hires (people who already have an academic or industrial job) -- end dates of their current positions might be still in the future. </li>
 <li>You are welcome to add yourself, or people your department has hired. </li>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-He-Go-Election-Meltdown/dp/1538751887">Will He Go?</a>, by legal scholar Lawrence Douglas, is, at 120 pages, a slim volume focused on a single question: <em>what happens if the 2020 US election delivers a narrow or disputed result favoring Biden, and Trump refuses to concede?</em>  This question will, of course, either be answered or rendered irrelevant in half a year.  And yet, in my estimation, there’s at least a 15% probability that <em>Will He Go?</em> will enter the ranks of the most important and prescient books ever written.  You should read it right now (or at least read <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/6/3/21257133/trump-2020-election-meltdown-lawrence-douglas">this Vox interview</a>), if you want to think through the contours of a civilizational Singularity that seems at least as plausible to me as the AI Singularity, but whose fixed date of November 3, 2020 we’re now hurtling toward.</p>



<p>In one of the defining memes of the past few years, a sign in a bookstore reads “Dear customers: post-apocalyptic fiction has been moved to the Current Affairs section.”  I was reminded of that as Douglas dryly lays out his horror scenario: imagine, hypothetically, that a President of the United States gets elected on a platform of racism and lies, with welcomed assistance from a foreign adversary.  Suppose that his every outrage only endears him further to his millions of followers.  Suppose that, as this president’s deepest (and perhaps only) principle, he never backs down, never apologizes, never acknowledges any inconvenient fact, and never accepts the legitimacy of any contest that he loses—and <em>this is perfectly rational for him, </em>as he’s been richly rewarded for this strategy his entire life.  Suppose that, during the final presidential debate, he pointedly refuses to promise to respect the election outcome if he loses—a first in American history.  And suppose that, after eking out a narrow win in the Electoral College, he then turns around and <em>disputes the election anyway</em> (!)—claiming, ludicrously, that he would’ve won the popular vote too, if not for millions of fraudulent voters.  Suppose that, for their own sordid reasons, Republican majorities in the Senate and Supreme Court enable this president’s chaotic rule, block his impeachment, and acquiesce to his daily cruelties and lies.</p>



<p>Then what happens in the <em>next</em> election?</p>



<p>Taking the existing catastrophe as given, Douglas asks: is America’s Constitutional machinery up to a challenge that it’s never yet faced, of a president who accepts democracy itself as legitimate only when he wins?  Douglas concludes that it isn’t—and this is the book’s terrifying and non-obvious part.  There are no checks or balances in the Constitution that will magically ensure a smooth transition of power.  On the contrary, the design flaws of our antiquated system make a meltdown <em>more</em> likely.</p>



<p>OK, but then why hasn’t America’s Reactor of Democracy exploded yet (or at least, not since the Civil War)?  Douglas spends a lot of time on historical parallels, including the Tilden-Hayes election of 1876 and the Bush-Gore election of 2000.  In each case, he finds, collapse was averted not because of mythical safeguards in our rickety, Rube-Goldberg system, but <em>only</em> because the relevant people (e.g., Samuel Tilden, Al Gore) stood down, having internalized the norm that the national good required them to.  But that’s precisely what Trump has telegraphed that he’ll never do.</p>



<p>The class of scenario that most worries Douglas runs as follows: just like last time, the election comes down to a few swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.  Crucially, right now all three of those states have Democratic governors and Republican-controlled legislatures … and <em>there’s no clear law about which of the two (the governor or the legislature) gets to certify election results and send them to Congress!</em>  So suppose Trump has a slight edge on election night, Fox News calls the race for him, but then an avalanche of absentee or provisional ballots shift things in Biden’s favor over the following week.  Can you imagine Trump or his supporters accepting the latter?</p>



<p>Or suppose that, on election day, Russian hackers cut off electricity or voter registration databases in Philadelphia or Detroit, via computer systems that <em>we know they already broke into and that remain exposed (!)</em>.  Hundreds of thousands are unable to vote; the Democratic governor orders a revote; the Republican legislature tries to preempt that by sending the original tally to Congress.</p>



<p>The final authority over election results rests with Congress.  The trouble is, the Senate is currently under Republican control and the House under Democratic control—and once again, <em>the Constitution and federal law provide no clear guidance on how to resolve a deadlock between the two on presidential succession (!!)</em>.  So what if Michigan or Pennsylvania or Wisconsin sends two separate sets of election results, and (predictably) the House accepts one and the Senate accepts the other?  And what if there’s no resolution by noon EST on January 20, 2021?  Then by law, the Speaker of the House, currently Nancy Pelosi, becomes acting president.  Can you imagine Trump willingly vacating the Oval Office if that comes to pass?</p>



<p>Douglas seems to have finished writing <em>Will He Go?</em> just as the coronavirus shut down the planet; he includes some comments about how that will massively exacerbate the above problems.  Election officials expect a historic number of absentee ballots, from people—disproportionately urban—who will (reasonably) consider it unsafe to wait in line for hours in a room packed with hundreds of strangers.  Alas, Trump has already told his followers that voting by mail is a scam to be fiercely opposed, never mind that he uses it himself.  Worse yet, the laws governing mail-in ballots—the signature, the postmark, the deadline for receipt—are byzantine, open to interpretation, and wildly different from county to county.  So again: imagine if mail-in ballots overturn what looked like a Trump win on election night.  The 2000 Florida recount battle was tea and cookies by comparison.</p>



<p>Douglas doesn’t mention, because it happened too recently, the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests (and in rarer cases, vandalism and looting) set off by the horrific murder of George Floyd, and the often shockingly militarized response.  But assuming the protests continue through the fall, they’ll of course give the Trumpists even more pretexts to meddle with the election, in the name of imposing “order.”</p>



<p>This is not a sound statistical methodology, but if I imagine a <em>gong</em> every time the US inches perceptibly closer to collapse—<em>gong</em> when Trump got elected, <em>gong</em> when covid made landfall and the states were abandoned to fight each other over medical supplies, <em>gong</em> when George Floyd was murdered and staid, conformist liberals suddenly became anarchists demanding the complete abolition of all police—well, the <em>gong</em>s seem to be getting more frequent!  Almost as if they were building toward a <em>gong</em>ularity that was, I dunno, sometime around November!</p>



<p>Douglas never mentions the prospect of a second Civil War until literally the book’s last sentence, but it’s the undercurrent of everything he writes—particularly given Trump’s frequent glorifications of violence, and his heavily armed base.  Having spent his career studying American jurisprudence, Douglas is willing to guide our imaginations all the way to the precipice but not over it.  Part of me still finds the possibility of going over unthinkable—although wasn’t the <em>first</em> Civil War similarly unthinkable until shortly before it happened?</p>



<p>If there <em>is</em> to be a Chernobyl-like meltdown of the Founding Fathers’ machine, at least it would retrospectively make sense of a lot that’s confused me in the past few years.  As I’m far from the only one to notice, “my” side, the left, has seemed less and less interested in debate and discussion, and more and more eager to denounce, ban, shame, and no-platform.  As just one example, out of hundreds that would serve, last week a 28-year-old analyst named David Shor was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/case-for-liberalism-tom-cotton-new-york-times-james-bennet.html">fired from his job</a> for <em>politely tweeting about an <a href="http://omarwasow.com/APSR_protests3_1.pdf">academic paper</a> offering evidence that peaceful protests are effective at winning public support for progressive, antiracist causes, while violence is ineffective</em>.  Hopefully <em>I</em> won’t now be fired for mentioning this!</p>



<p>Of course every cause has its extremists, but the puzzle is that I <em>know</em> plenty of people who will eagerly join whatever is the shaming or firing campaign du jour.  And many of those people strike me as friendly, insightful, honest, balanced, wise—at least when the topic is apolitical, as (alas) less and less seems to be these days.</p>



<p>Thought experiment: two protesters meet on a street, carrying huge signs that say “BLACK LIVES MATTER” and “ALL LIVES MATTER” respectively.  Can you imagine the following conversation ensuing: “Ah, my good fellow, it looks like you and I are allies, sharing deeply compatible moral messages with the world … one of us merely focused more on a special case, and the other on its generalization!  Shall we sit in the park to discuss our joint strategy?”</p>



<p>I guess it takes an Aspbergery STEM nerd even to <em>ask</em> why that never happens.  To spell it out: both sides are deploying English words, not for what they explicitly assert, but as markers of tribal affiliation, of <em>which side they’re on</em>.</p>



<p>It’s much the same with “Believe Women.”  “Believe <em>all</em> women, <em>always</em>?” asks our hapless STEM nerd.  “Women are goddesses who never lie?  Feminism is no longer the radical notion that women are people?”  “No, you sexist asshat,” replies the normie.  “It means listen to women, empathize with women, believe women, be on their side, be on <em>our</em> side.  What about that is so f-ing hard to understand?”</p>



<p>Or consider the slogans now conquering the world: “abolish the police” and “defund the police.”  “You mean <em>fundamentally reform</em> the police, right?” asks the STEM nerd.  “Eliminate qualified immunity, bust the unions that protect abusive cops, get rid of military gear, provide de-escalation training, stop treating homelessness and drug abuse as law enforcement problems, and all those other no-brainers?  But not, like, literally end all law enforcement, leave the 911 calls unanswered as machete-wielding rapists run free, and let gangsters and warlords fill the vacuum?”</p>



<p>“No, abolish the police means <em>abolish the police</em>,” reply the activists sternly.  “You refuse to listen.  You’re not our ally.”</p>



<p>Imagine a ragtag guerilla army encamped in the jungle, surrounded by a brutal occupying force and facing impossible odds, constantly on the alert for turncoats and spies and fair-weather friends in its midst.  Would it surprise you if these guerillas had a macabre initiation ritual for new recruits: say, slicing off the tips of recruits’ fingers?</p>



<p>Now suppose you reckoned that truth and justice were at least 3/4 on the guerillas’ side, and so decided to join them.  At your initiation, would you ask the guerillas if they’d analyzed whether finger-slicing <em>actually</em> leads to greater effectiveness in battle?  Or, as you swore the oath of eternal allegiance to the cause, with one hand on your heart and the other on your Kalashnikov, would you add: “… <em>assuming</em> that we continue to represent Enlightenment values like science, free speech, and intellectual charity”?</p>



<p>When the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, it suddenly became reasonable to take the side of the bloodthirsty Stalin.  And it would’ve been <em>praiseworthy</em> for a Russian to say: “I now pledge my life to fighting for the Soviet government—even if, likely as not, that government will thank me afterward by sending me to the gulag for an invented crime.”</p>



<p>Five years ago, thousands of woke activists shamed me for writing about my teenage experiences on this blog, a few even calling for an end to my career.  Especially if those activists emerge victorious from a turbulent 2020—<em>as I hope they will</em>—I expect that they’ll come for me again.  (Well, if they get around to it.  I’m nowhere near the top of their list.)</p>



<p>And yet, if Lawrence Douglas’s scenario comes to pass—if, for example, the 2020 election leaves Trump barricaded in the White House with his loyalists, while a duly elected government waits in limbo—then I pledge to render whatever assistance I can, and even risk my life if needed, for the same side that the woke activists will be on.</p>



<p>I’d rather not, though.  As Douglas points out, the more overwhelming we can make Trump’s electoral defeat, the less chance that it ever comes to this.</p></div>

In function inversion, we are given a function $f: [N] \mapsto [N]$, and want to prepare some advice of size $S$, such that we can efficiently invert any image in time $T$. This is a well studied problem with profound connections to cryptography, data structures, communication complexity, and circuit lower bounds. Investigation of this problem in the quantum setting was initiated by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015), who proved a lower bound of $ST^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$ for random permutations against classical advice, leaving open an intriguing possibility that Grover's search can be sped up to time $\tilde O(\sqrt{N/S})$. Recent works by Hhan, Xagawa, and Yamakawa (2019), and Chung, Liao, and Qian (2019) extended the argument for random functions and quantum advice, but the lower bound remains $ST^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$. 

In this work, we prove that even with quantum advice, $ST + T^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$ is required for an algorithm to invert random functions. This demonstrates that Grover's search is optimal for $S = \tilde O(\sqrt{N})$, ruling out any substantial speed-up for Grover's search even with quantum advice. Further improvements to our bounds would imply a breakthrough in circuit lower bounds, as shown by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (2019).

To prove this result, we develop a general framework for establishing quantum time-space lower bounds. We further demonstrate the power of our framework by proving the following results. 

* Yao's box problem: We prove a tight quantum time-space lower bound for classical advice. For quantum advice, we prove a first time-space lower bound using shadow tomography. These results resolve two open problems posted by Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015). 

* Salted cryptography: We show that “salting generically provably defeats preprocessing,” a result shown by Coretti, Dodis, Guo, and Steinberger (2018), also holds in the quantum setting. In particular, we prove quantum time-space lower bounds for a wide class of salted cryptographic primitives in the quantum random oracle model. This yields a first quantum time-space lower bound for salted collision-finding, which in turn implies that ${PWPP}^{O} \not\subseteq {FBQP}^{O}{/qpoly}$ relative to a random oracle $O$.</div>

We study time/memory tradeoffs of function inversion: an algorithm, i.e., an inverter, equipped with an $s$-bit advice for a randomly chosen function $f\colon [n] \mapsto [n]$ and using $q$ oracle queries to $f$, tries to invert a randomly chosen output $y$ of $f$ (i.e., to find $x$ such that $f(x)=y$). Much progress was done regarding adaptive function inversion - the inverter is allowed to make adaptive oracle queries. Hellman [IEEE transactions on Information Theory '80] presented an adaptive inverter that inverts with high probability a random $f$. Fiat and Naor [SICOMP '00] proved that for any $s,q$ with $s^2 q = n^2$ (ignoring low-order terms), an $s$-advice, $q$-query variant of Hellman's algorithm inverts a constant fraction of the image points of any function. Yao [STOC '90] proved a lower bound of $sq\ge n$ for  this problem. Closing the gap between the above lower and upper bounds is a long-standing open question.

Very little is known for the non-adaptive variant of the question - the inverter chooses its queries in advance. The only known upper bounds, i.e., inverters, are the trivial ones (with $s+q= n$), and the only lower bound is the above bound of Yao. In a recent work, Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan [TCC '19] partially justified the difficulty of finding lower bounds on non-adaptive inverters, showing that a lower bound on the time/memory tradeoff of non-adaptive inverters implies a lower bound on low-depth Boolean circuits. Bounds that for a strong enough choice of parameters, are notoriously hard to prove.

We make progress on the above intriguing question, both for the adaptive and the non-adaptive case, proving the following lower bounds on restricted families of inverters:

	- Linear-advice (adaptive inverter): If the advice string is a linear function of $f$ (e.g., $A\times f$, viewing $f$ as  a vector in $[n]^n$), then $s+q \in \Omega(n)$.
	
	- Affine non-adaptive decoders: If the non-adaptive inverter has an affine decoder - it outputs a linear function, determined by the advice string and the element to invert, of the query answers - then $s \in \Omega(n)$ (regardless of $q$).
	
	- Affine non-adaptive decision trees: If the non-adaptive inversion algorithm is a $d$-depth affine decision tree - it outputs the evaluation of a decision tree whose nodes compute a linear function of the answers to the queries - and $q \le cn$ for some universal $c&gt;0$, then $s\in \Omega(n/d \log n)$.</div>

A foundational result in the theory of quantum computation known as the ``principle of safe storage'' shows that it is always possible to take a quantum circuit and produce an equivalent circuit that makes all measurements at the end of the computation.  While this procedure is time efficient, meaning that it does not introduce a large overhead in the number of gates, it uses extra ancillary qubits and so is not generally space efficient.  It is quite natural to ask whether it is possible to defer measurements to the end of a quantum computation without increasing the number of ancillary qubits.
		
		We give an affirmative answer to this question by exhibiting a procedure to eliminate all intermediate measurements that is simultaneously space-efficient and time-efficient. A key component of our approach, which may be of independent interest, involves showing that the well-conditioned versions of many standard linear-algebraic problems may be solved by a quantum computer in less space than seems possible by a classical computer.</div>

We give a quantum logspace algorithm for powering contraction matrices, that is, matrices with spectral norm at most 1. The algorithm gets as an input an arbitrary $n\times n$ contraction matrix $A$, and a parameter $T \leq poly(n)$ and outputs the entries of $A^T$, up to (arbitrary) polynomially small additive error. The algorithm applies only unitary operators, without intermediate measurements. We show various implications and applications of this result:

First, we use this algorithm to show that the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory and with intermediate measurements is equivalent to the class of quantum logspace algorithms with only quantum memory without intermediate measurements. This shows that the deferred-measurement principle, a fundamental principle of quantum computing, applies also for quantum logspace algorithms (without classical memory). More generally, we give a quantum algorithm with space $O(S + \log T)$ that takes as an input the description of a quantum algorithm with quantum space $S$ and time $T$, with intermediate measurements (without classical memory), and simulates it unitarily with polynomially small error, without intermediate measurements.

Since unitary transformations are reversible (while measurements are irreversible) an interesting aspect of this result is that it shows that any quantum logspace algorithm (without classical memory) can be simulated by a reversible quantum logspace algorithm. This proves a quantum analogue of the result of Lange, McKenzie and Tapp that deterministic logspace is equal to reversible logspace.

Finally, we use our results to show non-trivial classical simulations of quantum logspace learning algorithms.</div>

<p>Last month saw activity across a diverse collection of topics in sublinear algorithms. In particular, we had the following <s>five</s> six papers. <em>(Sorry, I missed one)</em> </p>



<p><strong>One-Sided Error Testing of Monomials and Affine Subspaces</strong> by Oded Goldreich and Dana Ron (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/068/">ECCC</a>). This work focuses on one-sided testing of two kinds of problems (and their variants): <br /><span class="has-inline-color has-blue-color">1.</span> Testing Monomials: Suppose you are given a function \(f \colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}\). Is \(f = \wedge_{i \in I} x_i\) (that is, is \(f\) a monotone monomial). <br /><span class="has-inline-color has-blue-color">2.</span> Testing Affine Subspaces: Consider the task of testing whether a \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to \{0,1\}\) is the indicator of an \((n-k)\)-dimensional affine space for some \(k\) (where \(\mathcal{F}\) is a finite field).<br /></p>



<p>The paper shows that the general problem — the one in which the arity of the monomial (resp the co-dimension of the subspace) is not specified has one-sided query complexity \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\). The same holds for testing whether the arity of the monomial is at most \(k\) (resp the co-dimension of the subspace is at most \(k\)). Finally, the exact problem which seeks to test whether the arity of the monomial is exactly \(k\) (resp the co-dimension of the space is exactly \(k\)) has query complexity \(\Omega(\log n)\). For two sided testers however, size oblivious testers are known for this problem. Thus, like the authors remark, two-sided error is inherent in the case of the exact version of the problem.</p>



<p></p>



<p><strong>Sampling Arbitrary Subgraphs Exactly Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Hendrik Fichtenberger, Mingze Gao, Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01861v2">arXiv</a>). Readers of PT Review are no strangers to the problem of counting cliques in sublinear time (with a certain query model). Building on tools from [1], in [2], Eden-Ron-Seshadhri gave the first algorithms for counting number of copies \(K_r\) in a graph \(G\) to within a \((1 \pm \varepsilon)\) multiplicative factor. En route to this result, they also gave a procedure to sample cliques incident to some special set \(S \subseteq V(G)\). The query model in [2] allowed the following queries: a u.a.r vertex query, degree query, \(i^{th}\) neighbor query and a pair query which answers whether a pair \((u,v)\) forms an edge. The work under consideration shows a result which I personally find remarkable: given the additional ability to get a u.a.r edge sample, we can do the following. For any graph \(H\) we can obtain a uniformly random subgraph isomorphic to \(H\) in \(G\). Let that sink in: this work shows that you can sample \(H\) <em>exactly uniformly</em> from the graph \(G\).  </p>



<p><strong>Finding Planted Cliques in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jay Mardia, Hilal Asi, Kabir Aladin Chandrasekher (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12002">arXiv</a>). Planted Clique is a time honored problem in average case complexity. This classic problem asks the following: You are given a \(G \sim \mathcal{G}(n, 1/2)\). Suppose I select a subset of \(k\) vertices in this graph and put a clique on the subgraph they induce. In principle it is possible to recover the clique I planted if \(k &gt; (2 + \varepsilon) \log n\). But it seems you get polynomial time algorithms only when \(k \geq \Omega(\sqrt n)\) even after you throw SDPs at the problem. Moreover, so far, the algorithms which recover the planted \(k\)-clique were known to take \(\widetilde{O}(n^2)\) time. This work shows that you actually get algorithms which take time \(\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})\) if \(k \geq \Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})\). The key idea is to first obtain a “core” part of the clique of size \(O(\log n)\) in time \(\widetilde{O}(n^2/k)\). This is followed up with a clique completion routine where you mark all vertices connected to the entire core as being potentially in the clique. The paper also shows a conditional lower bound result which shows that given query access to adjacency matrix of the graph, a natural family of non-adaptive algorithms cannot recover a planted \(k\) clique in time \(o\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)^3\) (for \(k \geq \widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt n))\).</p>



<p><strong>A robust multi-dimensional sparse Fourier transform in the continuous setting</strong> by Yaonan Jin, Daogao Liu and Zhao Song (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06156">arXiv</a>).  Suppose you are given an unknown signal whose Fourier Spectrum is k-sparse (that is, there are at most k dominant Fourier Coefficients and all the others are zero or close to zero). Significant research effort has been devoted to learn these signals leading to works which study this problem for multi-dimensional discrete setting and in the one-dimensional continuous case. The \(d\)-dimensional continuous case \((d = \Theta(1))\) was largely unexplored. This work makes progress on this frontier by making some natural assumptions on the unknown signal. In particular, the paper assumes that the frequencies — which are vectors \(f_i’s \in R^d\) — are well separated and satisfy \(\|f_i – f_j\|_2 \leq \eta\) and that all \({f_i}_{i \in [k]} \subseteq [-F, F]^d\) sit inside a bounded box.<br />The authors assume sample access to the signal in the sense that at any desired timestep \(\tau\), the algorithm can sample the signal’s value. With this setup, the authors show that all the dominant frequencies can be recovered with a \(O_d(k \cdot \log(F/\eta))\) samples by considering a relatively small time horizon.</p>



<p><strong>Extrapolating the profile of a finite population</strong> by Soham Jana, Yury Polyanskiy, Yihong Wu (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10561">arXiv</a>). Consider the following setup. You are given a universe \(k\) balls. Ball come in up to \(k\) different colors. Say you \(\theta_j\) balls in color \(j\) for each \(j \in [k]\). One of the fundamental problems in statistics considers taking samples \(m\) balls from the universe and attempts estimating “population profile” (that is, the number of balls in each color). Historically, it is known that unless an overwhelming majority of the universe has been seen, one cannot estimate the empirical distribution of colors. This paper shows that in the sublinear regime, with \(m \geq \omega(k/\log k)\), it is possible to consistently estimate the population profile in total variation. And once you have a handle on the empirical distribution of the population, you can go ahead and learn lots of interesting label invariant properties of your universe (things like entropy, number of distinct elements etc). </p>



<p></p>



<p><em>(Edit added later)</em></p>



<p><strong>Testing Positive Semi-Definiteness via Random Submatrices</strong> by Ainesh Bakshi, Nadiia Chepurko, Rajesh Jayaram (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06441">arXiv</a>). Suppose I give you a PSD matrix \(A \in R^{n \times n}\). You know that all of its principle submatrices are also PSD. What if \(A\) was \(\varepsilon\)-far from the PSD cone (in a sense I will define soon)? What can you say about the eigenvalues of principle submatrices of \(A\) now? In this paper, the authors tackle precisely this question. The paper defines a matrix \(A\) to be \(\varepsilon\)-far in \(\ell_2^2\) distance from the PSD Cone if you have that \(\min_{B \geq 0: B \in R^{n \times n}}\|A – B\|_F^2 \geq \varepsilon n^2\). You are allowed to randomly sample a bunch of principle submatrices (of order roughly \(O(1/\varepsilon)\) by \(O(1/\varepsilon)\) and check if they are PSD. Armed with this setup, the paper gives a non-adaptive one sided tester for this problem which makes \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^4)\) queries. The paper also supplements this result with a lower bound of \(\widetilde{\Omega}(1/\varepsilon^2)\) queries.</p>

John Gott III is an emeritus professor of astrophysical sciences at Princeton. He was one of several independent inventors of the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">Doomsday</a> <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/doomsday_argument">Argument</a> (DA). He may have been the first to think of it but the last to expound it in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/363315a0.epdf">paper</a> or presentation.</p>
<p>
Today we expound DA as a defense against thought experiments that require unreasonable lengths of time.</p>
<p><span id="more-17136"></span></p>
<p>
Gott thought of the argument when he saw the Berlin Wall as a 22-year-old touring Berlin in 1969. He reasoned that his visit was a uniformly random event in the lifetime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> of the wall. That assumption gave him a 75% likelihood that he was not observing the wall in the first quarter of its lifetime. Since the wall was then 8 years old, that became a 75% likelihood that the wall would not last beyond 1993. It came down in late 1989.</p>
<p>
The “Doomsday” name comes when one’s birthdate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is regarded as a uniformly random sample from the sequence of all human births. If you are my age, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is probably <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=F7CF2C002ED22C17F221BE1788C43A6E?doi=10.1.1.49.5899&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">closer</a> to ordinal 60 billion than 70 or 100 billion. We can then say we are 95% confident that we are not in the initial 5% of this sequence. That <em>entails</em> the sequence stopping before 1.2 trillion births. If our population levels off at 10 billion with 80 years’ life expectancy, that makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> extend no further than the year 12,000 AD. The upshot is that a longer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> entails asserting that our random sample gave a point unusually <em>early</em> in the span. The purer form of DA also argues that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is not unusually <em>late</em>, giving this picture:</p>

<p>This doubles the span of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> allowed with 95% confidence while giving reason—at the time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> occurs—to believe that the end is not imminent: at least about 1.75 billion more births will come after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />.

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Debating DA </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The dependence on which observer is taken as the reference point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is one shiftable parameter of the DA. If you are a preteen reader, then your own birth may be closer to ordinal 70 billion in the sequence, which becomes <em>your</em> reference point. You can then tack on another 2,000 years to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" />. The earliest human cave painters may have been among the first 3 billion <em>Homo sapiens</em>. With regard to their reference point, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> has already gone past their 95% limit. </p>
<p>
A more fundamental rebuff to DA comes from the equal reasonableness of an alternate uniformity assumption: that you are a uniformly random element of the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> of all <em>possible</em> human beings. Only a subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{H}" class="latex" title="{H}" /> will ever be born. The longer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> is, the higher was your prior probability of belonging to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />. Thus the fact of your birth can be construed as weighting the odds toward longer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> in a way that cancels out the short-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" /> reasoning of DA.</p>
<p>
Even when an instance of DA passes these objections, the inference remains controversial. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">wrote</a> about DA last year in connection with estimating the lifespan of open problems remaining open. A clear <em>non</em>-instance is trying to apply DA to estimate the lifespan of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have all been going through the span together and <em>now</em> is not a uniformly random sample. </p>
<p>
The DA assumptions would however hold if an alien tourist with no prior knowledge of events dropped in on Earth today. The delicacy of the assumptions makes it significant to seek scenarios where DA firmly applies—and better, where the inference may be deemed <em>necessary</em> to preserve the validity of established modes of inference against extreme skeptical hypotheses. This is what we will try to argue in regard to inferences of cheating at chess. </p>

</p><p></p><h2> The 1-in-100,000 Question </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/06/18/the-problem-of-catching-chess-cheaters/">posted</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/09/17/littlewoods-law/">numerous</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/the-crown-game-affair/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2013/07/27/thirteen-sigma/">about</a> my statistical <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/10/18/london-calling/">chess</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/15/predicting-chess-and-horses/">model</a>, its giving judgments of odds against null hypotheses of fair play in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score"><em>z</em>-scores</a>, and my <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/empirical-humility/">means</a> of <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/08/20/our-trip-to-monte-carlo/">validating</a> them. We will suppose for this argument that the modeling is true in the sense that the distribution of <em>z</em>-scores from testing honest players conforms to the standard normal distribution. </p>
<p>
Now let us talk about chess in the years B.C.—before Covid—when the game was played over-the-board (OTB) in-person across a table. Suppose I obtained a <em>z</em>-score of 4.265 from a test of one player in one tournament. I have chosen this number for all of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It corresponds to what I call “face-value odds” of 100,000-to-1 against the null hypothesis, as one can see from <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/rpkp/experiments/analysis/zCalc.html">this</a> or any similar calculator. <p></p>
</li><li>
It is close to my number from an actual case in the year 1 B.C., that is, last year. <p></p>
</li><li>
It is also typical of <em>z</em>-scores I have been obtaining these past three months since chess went online, at the point where certain online platforms have made their own decisions to impose sanctions. Here I must add that the platforms’ cheating detection systems avail much information about the manner of play that often furnishes much greater statistical evidence, whereas my minimalist model uses only the record of the moves played in the games.
</li></ul>
<p>
Suppose there were no other relevant information about the case. How would one assess the significance of the <em>z</em>-score of 4.265? Here are two different ways of reasoning that—in the case of OTB chess—arrive at similar answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The Bayesian prior probability of cheating in OTB chess has been estimated between 1-in-10,000 and 1-in-5,000. Suppose the former, and consider a thought experiment in which 100,000 players are tested. For simplicity, let’s suppose all true instances—that is, cheating players—give above 4.265. We expect there to be ten of them, plus one <em>natural</em> occurrence of 4.265 or more. Thus the odds that our score represents a true positive are only 10-in-11. This is well short of the odds range usually needed to meet the standard of <em>comfortable satisfaction</em> used for example by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Thus the 4.265 datum alone should not be sufficient grounds for sanction. <p></p>
</li><li>
Suppose there were a policy of sanction above a threshold of 4.25. The sum of playing fields in events held under auspices of the International Chess Federation (FIDE) each year exceeds 100,000. Thus we would expect to find at least one <em>z</em>-score over 4.265 per year by natural chance, whose sanctioning would be a serious human-rights error. FIDE cannot afford a rate of one such error per year. Thus it is insufficient for sanction.
</li></ol>
<p>
A 5.0 standard, however, gives a natural frequency of just over 1-in-3.5 million. The resulting error rate of once in 20-to-30 years might be acceptable in prospect. And the Bayesian argument based on a 0.0001 prior leaves about 350-to-1 odds against the null hypothesis, which is comfortably within the comfortable-satisfaction range as it has been applied. </p>
<p>
FIDE nevertheless has maintained a policy that statistical evidence must be accompanied by some other kind of evidence. If a player is caught looking at a chess position in a bathroom, or found to have a buzzing device or wires on his-or-her person, or signaling behavior is observed, then in fact much lower <em>z</em>-scores (to a threshold of 2.50, about 160-to-1 odds, in current FIDE regulations) are deemed to lend strong support to such evidence. </p>

I posted a similar <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/chess/fidelity/Golfers.html">rationale</a> on my own website in early 2012, where causal evidence is likened to the “black spot” in the novel <em>Treasure Island</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> One More Datum </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Now, however, suppose we have the 4.265 and one more piece of “evidence” that is pertinent but not as clearly causal. It could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The player wore a hat that covers the ears, or <p></p>
</li><li>
An unusually bulky sweater (worn on a hot day), or <p></p>
</li><li>
Unusual gestures or movements during the games.
</li></ul>
<p>
Say a search of the player turned up nothing, but this occurred after the sequence of games giving the 4.265, a day after the player had been put on notice of suspicion. So the extra information is not a black spot but instead a “grey spot.” What can we conclude now?</p>
<p>
The Bayesian argument seems to depend on judging how this information affects the prior probability of cheating. Does it make cheating a more likely hypothesis? We don’t actually know. Whereas the 1-in-10,000 global prior estimate was based on knowing dozens of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess#Incidents">cases</a> over the past decade, only a handful conformed to this level of indication—short of more obvious things like making frequent visits to the restroom or being seen with an ear adornment. The most we can say is that the datum is not irrelevant. An example of an irrelevant datum would be if the player were wearing neon green sneakers—not bulky, no wires, just a weird green.</p>
<p>
I would like, however, to argue that the player’s membership in a smaller sample <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> that is <em>pertinent</em> enhances the significance of the <em>z</em>-score. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> must be defined by criteria that are not only independent of my statistical analysis of the games but also pertinent so as to avoid selection bias. What is needed to quantify this enhancement is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
(a) to collect all (other) kinds of items on a par with the above—say ostentatious bracelets that could camouflage electronic indicators—and</p>
<p>(b) to establish that the frequency of players having <em>any</em> such accoutrement over the global mass of tournaments is at most, say, 1-in-100.<br />
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Now there are several equivalent ways to continue the reasoning. One is to say that since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> is “at worst” independent, the face-value odds are amplified by a factor of at least 100. The Bayesian mitigation then still leaves about 1,000-to-1 odds against the null hypothesis. Another is to say that in any given year, the natural chance of seeing the conjunction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> and the <em>z</em>-score is at most 1-in-100. Thus aside from the frequency of true positives, a policy of sanctioning in such cases would have a prospective error rate of once in 100 years. The conjoined error rate of that and sanctioning on 5.0 in isolation would be acceptable.</p>
<p>
A Bayesian defense attorney might still counter: Consider a thought experiment in which we test 100,000 such “bulky” players. We don’t have any new information on the prior rate of cheating by players in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />. For all we know, it is still 1-in-10,000. Thus the same terms as before will apply: our experiment will expect to have 10 cheaters in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> plus the one natural false positive, leaving the odds only 10-to-1 as before. Put another way: without knowing the import of specializing to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> on the likelihood of cheating, you can’t reach any further conclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Doomsday to the Rescue </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The nub of rejecting this counter-argument is that:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Because there are only about 1,000 players in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> per year, the thought experiment of testing 100,000 players in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" /> now takes 100 years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, the defense attorney is asserting that the mistaken false positive has occurred <em>unusually early</em> in this span. If this is the first year under consideration, then it is a uniformly random event in the first 1% of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L}" class="latex" title="{L}" />. By the same reasoning of DA, the odds of this are only 1-in-100. Compounded by the 10-1 odds against this particular score in the thought experiment being the false positive, we recover something near the 1,000-to-1 odds of the original reasoning.</p>
<p>
We might allow that we are not in the first year of “the cheating era” in chess. The thicket of high-profile cases with solid grounds for judgment goes back a little over 10 years. The factor from DA then goes down to 1-in-10. But this still leaves the overall odds about 100-to-1 against the null hypothesis, and that is commonly taken as an anchor point for the standard of comfortable satisfaction after all mitigating factors have been addressed. </p>
<p>
Thus I am casting the Doomsday interval argument as a defense against unreasonably long thought experiments. It restores a dimension of time that is ignored by the Bayesian objection. This dimension of time is correctly preserved in the analysis of the expected error rate from a policy of imposing sanctions under this <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{B}" class="latex" title="{B}" />–<em>z</em> combination of circumstances.</p>
<p>
Is my line of reasoning valid? You can be the judge. If so, then it is a class of instances where DA is applied merely to <em>conserve</em> an inference of unlikelihood that was originally made by other means. This supports the validity of DA-type inference in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Online Chess and the Time Warp </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We are now in the third month of “the online era” in chess. Even though online platforms can process many more kinds of information than I can avail from OTB play, my work has proved highly relevant for global early indications, second opinions, and transparent explanations. Alas, the sanction rate at the new featured tournaments has been well in excess of 1%. We hope this will come down as the playing pool—which has been greatly democratized in massive online events—wises up to the reality of getting caught.</p>
<p>
What I want to discuss here is how this brave new world flips the Bayesian reasoning in a way that may come on too strong <em>for the prosecution</em>, again by its indifference to the element of time. </p>
<p>
Take the 4.265 <em>z</em>-score with a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1\%}" class="latex" title="{1\%}" /> prior. The face-value odds from the <em>z</em>-score are now mitigated only to 1-in-1,000. This gives 99.9% confidence in imposing a sanction. However, the <em>rate of errors</em> would be <em>higher</em> than once-per-year because more players total have been involved per tournament. The tournaments are played at faster Rapid and Blitz paces allowing eight or more games per day, whereas classic OTB tournaments feature one game per day, sometimes two, over a span of a week to ten days. </p>
<p>
This is also set against a vastly higher global sample size. Whereas the entire historical record of OTB chess represented by the ChessBase <a href="https://shop.chessbase.com/en/products/mega_database_2020?ref=RF32-OET9DCF5AK&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu9P-4-_u6QIVGqSzCh0QQQsyEAAYASAAEgKcevD_BwE">Mega</a> database has yet to hit the 10 million games mark, the online platform <a href="https://lichess.org/">Lichess</a> has now hit 75 million games played <a href="https://database.lichess.org/">per month</a>. Adding in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Chess_Club">ICC</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/home">chess.com</a> and ChessBase’s and FIDE’s own servers yields an equation that recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-4.htm">Ps 90:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm">2 Peter 3:8</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A thousand years of OTB are but a day that passes online. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
For online platforms in isolation, absent anything to distinguish one player’s set of games from any other’s (such as their belonging to a highest-profile tournament), this means that even a 5.0 standard is inadequate for sure judgment. At their volume, online sites can see deviations of by natural chance more than once per day. Thus they either tolerate a higher rate of errors or adopt a standard so high as to let many more guilty <a href="https://en.bab.la/dictionary/french-english/partie-d-echecs">parties</a> through the sieve. </p>
<p>
Such volume means all the more that one should hold a score of 4.265 as insufficient for judgment. This is despite the vastly higher Bayesian likelihood that a sanction based on that score is correct. The greater frequency of actual cheating does mean that the rate of error per positive reading declines, but the rate per absolute time, with regard to the fixed population of honest players, may matter more. This has accompanied deliberations of whether sanctions for online cheating must be given less permanent consequences in order to allow setting thresholds so that a high percentage of actual cheaters are flagged and the error rate can be tolerated.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Does this analysis square with you? Does it help in understanding controversies over the original Doomsday Argument’s paradigm?</p>
<p>
For another pass over the argument, suppose I get a <em>z</em>-score of 4.265 in a narrowly-defined event such as one country’s championship league. Does that limit the sample size, so that the score is more dispositive? The kind of reasoning in point (b) above, where we had to gather all possible indicators that would lead us to constrain the sample, would however mandate widening it at least to include other countries’ leagues. This is an aspect of the “look elsewhere” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-elsewhere_effect">effect</a> where the space of potential tests is widened even before actual tests are considered. Possibly it should be widened to include all tournaments with similar levels of players, in which case we are back to the “square 1” of the 1-in-100,000 section of this post. The point of the analysis of the extra datum about the player is that the sample expansion has an effective pre-defined limit.</p>
