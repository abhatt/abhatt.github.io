Tony Hoare is also known informally as Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare. He has made key contributions to programming languages, algorithms, operating systems, formal verification, and concurrent computing. </p>
<p>
He won the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hoare_4622167.cfm">1980 Turing Award</a> for <i>“Fundamental contributions to the definition and design of programming languages.”</i> </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/06/13/sorting-and-proving/th-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-20168"><img width="200" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/th.png?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-20168" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Quicksort </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Hoare invented a new sorting algorithm in 1959. It was not later directly cited in his winning of the Turing Award—see above. Back then Hoare was a visiting student at Moscow State University. His student project at the time needed to sort words in Russian sentences before looking them up in a Russian-English dictionary, which was in alphabetical order on a magnetic tape. He tried insertion sort but it was too slow, and so he invented a new sorting algorithm—it is now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">Quicksort</a>. Amazing. </p>
<p>
On his return to England, he was asked to write code for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort">Shellsort</a>. Hoare mentioned to his boss that he knew of a faster algorithm and his boss bet sixpence that he did not. His boss ultimately accepted that he had lost the bet. Quicksort is well named—it is a winner.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> And Still Champion </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The most amazing thing to me—Ken writing this and the next section—-is that Quicksort has remained the champion sorter. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">Mergesort</a> was earlier but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort">Heapsort</a> came five years later. No one has improved on Hoare’s idea to focus on <em>swaps</em> that improve the sortedness of two elements at once, both jumping over a guiding element called the <em>pivot</em>.</p>
<p>
Mergesort and Heapsort guarantee <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" /> time to sort <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> items, whereas Quicksort does not. Yet careful implementations of Quicksort almost always evade slow outcomes. Then they beat Mergesort and Heapsort and all other sorting methods cleanly in terms of the constant under the “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O}" class="latex" />.” </p>
<p>
The algorithms-and-data-structures course I taught at UB this past term includes sorting algorithms. I have brought together and polished code instances I showed during the term to compare these three algorithms in one <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/DataStructures/Sorts.scala">code file</a>. It is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)">Scala</a> programming language. The program has options described at the top, such as setting the “tradeoff point” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m}" class="latex" /> so that on recursive calls to sort pieces of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m}" class="latex" />, the code uses Insertion Sort instead. It counts comparisons and copies of items separately, as well as report the time in milliseconds. A swap counts as three not two copies. </p>
<p>
Here is an example run on the English <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse250/DataStructures/WarAndPeace.txt">text</a> of <em>War and Peace</em> using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+16%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{m = 16}" class="latex" /> for both Quicksort and Mergesort. I wanted to salute Hoare’s application by using the original Russian text, but every file of it I found was densely footnoted. The Russian version doesn’t begin in Russian anyway. I’ve edited the output slightly.<br />

This used the strategy of selecting the median of three randomly sampled elements of the array piece to be sorted as the pivot. Quicksort runs quickest when the pivot is the median, but it takes too long to find the exact median at each level of recursion. My program has the option “<font size="+1"><tt>ninther</tt></font>” to select the median of three such median-of-3 samples, as <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/06/23/tukey-median-ninther/">proposed</a> by John Tukey. Try my code to see if <font size="+1"><tt>ninther</tt></font> works faster and with fewer comparisons on your system. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Empirical Testing and Proving </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The person whose 1975 PhD <a href="https://sedgewick.io/wp-content/themes/sedgewick/papers/1975Quicksort.pdf">dissertation</a> studied the performance of Quicksort implementations with rigor and depth was none other than Bob Sedgewick, whose retirement party Dick recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/04/sedgewick-to-emeritus-status/">covered</a>. This led into Bob’s famous textbook <a href="https://sedgewick.io/books/algorithms/"><em>Algorithms</em></a>, which is now in its fourth edition with Kevin Wayne as co-author. Bob’s separate <a href="https://github.com/chrswt/algorithms-sedgewick/blob/master/notes/2.3-quicksort.md">notes</a> accompanying the book point out an aspect vital to running on inputs like <em>War and Peace</em> that have many identical (keys of) items. The simple partition for a pivot <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> into </p>
<p>
<code><br />
               [ elements &lt;= p ][ p ][ elements &gt;= p ]<br />
</code></p>
<p></p><p><br />
winds up doing many extra comparisons of keys equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" />. The extra initial effort to determine a 3-way partition</p>
<p>
<code><br />
               [ elements &lt; p ][ elements == p ][ elements &gt; p ]<br />
</code></p>
<p></p><p><br />
pays off in the recursion, which only needs to be on the outer two segments. Without this trick, Quicksort—on even a relatively high-entropy source like <em>War and Peace</em>—degrades to be worse than the other two algorithms. </p>
<p>
My code allows making all words distinct by setting the fifth bit. Then Quicksort makes more comparisons and copies than Mergesort. Yet it still runs almost 40% faster in my tests. As explained in general <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort-vs-merge-sort">here</a>, this is because the Quicksort gives better cache locality. Heapsort likewise runs in-place, but not with locality. </p>
<p>
The assertions itemized in this section are unimpeachable. But in what sense, and to what degree, are they <b>formally provable</b>? </p>
<p>
There is also a difference from the criterion of <b>reproducibility</b> in the sciences. The environmental conditions for reproducing an experiment are presumed to be closed and given. The primacy of Quicksort, however, applies to processing architectures that were unknown at the time of Sedgewick’s 1975 thesis, let alone Hoare’s 1959 concept. It is a more open-ended prediction that if you run mine or similar code on your system—in machine environments I may know nothing about—it will give much the same time performance.</p>
<p>
Now back to Dick, about Hoare’s take on formally proving properties of programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Hoare Logic </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Hoare invented a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">logic</a> for reasoning about the correctness of computer programs ten years later in 1969. It was directly counted toward his winning of the Turing Award. It was based on original ideas created by Robert Floyd, who had published a system for flowcharts. The logic is now known as Hoare logic—see <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/16.355/Hoare-CACM-69.pdf">this</a> for details. This is one of the most influential papers on the theory of programming. In this paper Hoare showed how to reason about program execution using logical specifications of statement behavior that has become known as <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/courses/654-sp09/notes/3-hoare-notes.pdf">Hoare triples</a>.</p>
<p>
A Hoare triple has three parts, a precondition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />, a program statement or series of statements <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" />, and a postcondition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" />. It’s is usually written in the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5C%7BP%5C%7D+S+%5C%7BQ%5C%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \{P\} S \{Q\} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The meaning is “if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> is true before <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> is executed, and if the execution of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> terminates, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" /> is true afterwards”. Note that the triple does not assert that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{S}" class="latex" /> will terminate; that requires a separate proof. As a simple example: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5C%7Bx%2B1%3D43%5C%7Dy%3A%3Dx%2B1%5C%7By%3D43%5C%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \{x+1=43\}y:=x+1\{y=43\} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
A key motivation for Hoare Logic is to be able to prove the correctness of real systems with real programs. The fact that Hoare Logic is possible is clear. It is possible to use it to <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.1739&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">prove</a> Quicksort, for example. But it is less clear whether or not we will be able to apply formal methods to complex practical systems. This is a topic that I have thought about for decades. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Codex </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Saturday’s Washington Post has a tech <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/">article</a>, “The Google engineer who thinks the company’s AI has come to life.” This prompted us to visit a long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/magazine/ai-language.html">article</a> in the April 15 New York Times Magazine on Open AI’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> language engine. </p>
<p>
GPT-3 works by playing a game of <em>guess the next word</em> in a phrase. This is akin to <em>guess the next move</em> in chess and other games, and we will have more to say about it. For an example with wider context, suppose we fed it this post up before this section, and then gave it “<b>A Cod-</b>” as the partially completed section title. Since this comes at the end, GPT-3 might guess <b>coda</b>. Or since this is an addendum, maybe <b>codicil</b>. A <b>codex</b>, on the other hand, is a large manuscript book.</p>
<p>
In fact, we do mean <i>codex</i>, or rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex">Codex</a>, which is an offshoot of GPT-3 for generating code in a wide variety of programming languages. Its emergence creates a new riff on our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/10/discussion-about-proving-again/">discussion</a> on proving and how <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/">software</a> projects have stayed robust while growing far beyond the scale on which they can be formally proved. Now <a href="https://openai.com/blog/codex-apps/">Codex</a> ventures to write one’s software by gleaning the intent from one’s prose specification—by drawing on millions of available coding projects that give relatable specifications. </p>
<p>
Is program output from Codex <em>proven</em>—or <em>provable</em>? This will be a challenge. It may be more feasible to integrate Codex with projects like the <a href="https://vst.cs.princeton.edu/">Verified Software Toolchain</a> led Andrew Appel, Lennart Beringer, William Mansky, and Qinshi Wang. This is at any rate further grist for discussion.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>

Take a look at <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">this</a> for comments about the recent Harry Lewis <a href="https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/2021/05/26/debate-that-changed-programming-living-history/">debate</a>.

unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$, output $\widehat{\rho}$
for which $\|\rho - \widehat{\rho}\|_{\mathsf{tr}} \le \varepsilon$. When one
is allowed to make coherent measurements entangled across all copies,
$\Theta(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient [Haah et al.
'17, O'Donnell-Wright '16]. Unfortunately, the protocols achieving this rate
incur large quantum memory overheads that preclude implementation on current or
near-term devices. On the other hand, the best known protocol using incoherent
(single-copy) measurements uses $O(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ copies
[Kueng-Rauhut-Terstiege '17], and multiple papers have posed it as an open
question to understand whether or not this rate is tight. In this work, we
fully resolve this question, by showing that any protocol using incoherent
measurements, even if they are chosen adaptively, requires
$\Omega(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$ copies, matching the upper bound of
[Kueng-Rauhut-Terstiege '17].
</p>
<p>We do so by a new proof technique which directly bounds the "tilt" of the
posterior distribution after measurements, which yields a surprisingly short
proof of our lower bound, and which we believe may be of independent interest.

codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by
$\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed
from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An
independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes
as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this
work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly)
equivalent.
</p>
<p>We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$
for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that
generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero
pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve
list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a
random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list
decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most
$\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.

Anchored Gradient (EAG) algorithm, originally proposed by Yoon and Ryu [2021]
for unconstrained convex-concave min-max optimization, can be applied to solve
the more general problem of Lipschitz monotone inclusion. More specifically, we
prove that the EAG solves Lipschitz monotone inclusion problems with an
\emph{accelerated convergence rate} of $O(\frac{1}{T})$, which is \emph{optimal
among all first-order methods} [Diakonikolas, 2020, Yoon and Ryu, 2021]. Our
second result is a new algorithm, called Extra Anchored Gradient Plus (EAG+),
which not only achieves the accelerated $O(\frac{1}{T})$ convergence rate for
all monotone inclusion problems, but also exhibits the same accelerated rate
for a family of general (non-monotone) inclusion problems that concern negative
comonotone operators. As a special case of our second result, EAG+ enjoys the
$O(\frac{1}{T})$ convergence rate for solving a non-trivial class of
nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems. Our analyses are based on
simple potential function arguments, which might be useful for analysing other
accelerated algorithms.

Specifically,
for a parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1/2)$, we are given $m$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^n$, $\lfloor \alpha m \rfloor$ of which are i.i.d. samples from a
distribution $D$ with unknown $k$-sparse mean $\mu$. No assumptions are made on
the remaining points, which form the majority of the dataset. The goal is to
return a small list of candidates containing a vector $\widehat \mu$ such that
$\| \widehat \mu - \mu \|_2$ is small. Prior work had studied the problem of
list-decodable mean estimation in the dense setting. In this work, we develop a
novel, conceptually simpler technique for list-decodable mean estimation. As
the main application of our approach, we provide the first sample and
computationally efficient algorithm for list-decodable sparse mean estimation.
In particular, for distributions with ``certifiably bounded'' $t$-th moments in
$k$-sparse directions and sufficiently light tails, our algorithm achieves
error of $(1/\alpha)^{O(1/t)}$ with sample complexity $m =
(k\log(n))^{O(t)}/\alpha$ and running time $\mathrm{poly}(mn^t)$. For the
special case of Gaussian inliers, our algorithm achieves the optimal error
guarantee of $\Theta (\sqrt{\log(1/\alpha)})$ with quasi-polynomial sample and
computational complexity. We complement our upper bounds with nearly-matching
statistical query and low-degree polynomial testing lower bounds.

distributed algorithm for $(2\alpha+1)(1 + \varepsilon)$ approximation of
minimum weighted dominating set on graphs with arboricity at most $\alpha$.
Here $\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree. We also show a lower bound proving
that this round complexity is nearly optimal even for the unweighted case, via
a reduction from the celebrated KMW lower bound on distributed vertex cover
approximation [Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer JACM'16].
</p>
<p>Our algorithm improves on all the previous results (that work only for
unweighted graphs) including a randomized $O(\alpha^2)$ approximation in
$O(\log n)$ rounds [Lenzen and Wattenhofer DISC'10], a deterministic $O(\alpha
\log \Delta)$ approximation in $O(\log \Delta)$ rounds [Lenzen and Wattenhofer
DISC'10], a deterministic $O(\alpha)$ approximation in $O(\log^2 \Delta)$
rounds [implicit in Bansal and Umboh IPL'17 and Kuhn, Moscibroda, and
Wattenhofer SODA'06], and a randomized $O(\alpha)$ approximation in
$O(\alpha\log n)$ rounds [Morgan, Solomon and Wein DISC'21].
</p>
<p>We also provide a randomized $O(\alpha \log\Delta)$ round distributed
algorithm that sharpens the approximation factor to $\alpha(1+o(1))$. If each
node is restricted to do polynomial-time computations, our approximation factor
is tight in the first order as it is NP-hard to achieve $\alpha - 1 -
\varepsilon$ approximation [Bansal and Umboh IPL'17].

model theory and propositional/algebraic proof systems. We show that if all
non-isomorphic graphs in a given graph class can be distinguished in the logic
Choiceless Polynomial Time with counting (CPT), then they can also be
distinguished in the bounded-degree extended polynomial calculus (EPC), and the
refutations have roughly the same size as the resource consumption of the
CPT-sentence. This allows to transfer lower bounds for EPC to CPT and thus
constitutes a new potential approach towards better understanding the limits of
CPT. A super-polynomial EPC lower bound for a PTIME-instance of the graph
isomorphism problem would separate CPT from PTIME and thus solve a major open
question in finite model theory. Further, using our result, we provide a model
theoretic proof for the separation of bounded-degree polynomial calculus and
bounded-degree extended polynomial calculus.

learning where addressing unfairness is a major challenge. Motivated by this,
we study Fair Correlation Clustering where the data points may belong to
different protected groups and the goal is to ensure fair representation of all
groups across clusters. Our paper significantly generalizes and improves on the
quality guarantees of previous work of Ahmadi et al. and Ahmadian et al. as
follows.
</p>
<p>- We allow the user to specify an arbitrary upper bound on the representation
of each group in a cluster.
</p>
<p>- Our algorithm allows individuals to have multiple protected features and
ensure fairness simultaneously across them all.
</p>
<p>- We prove guarantees for clustering quality and fairness in this general
setting. Furthermore, this improves on the results for the special cases
studied in previous work. Our experiments on real-world data demonstrate that
our clustering quality compared to the optimal solution is much better than
what our theoretical result suggests.

in a fair and equitable manner. However, it is complicated to quantify the
equity of such a distribution; important factors include distances to resource
sites, availability of transportation, and ease of travel. In this paper, we
use persistent homology, which is a tool from topological data analysis, to
study the effective availability and coverage of polling sites. The information
from persistent homology allows us to infer holes in the distribution of
polling sites. We analyze and compare the coverage of polling sites in Los
Angeles County and five cities (Atlanta, Chicago, Jacksonville, New York City,
and Salt Lake City), and we conclude that computation of persistent homology
appears to be a reasonable approach to analyzing resource coverage.

consists of matrices whose non-zero entries can only be at those positions
corresponding to edges in $G$. Tutte (J. London Math. Soc., 1947), Edmonds (J.
Res. Nat. Bur. Standards Sect. B, 1967) and Lov\'asz (FCT, 1979) observed
connections between perfect matchings in $G$ and full-rank matrices in
$\mathcal{S}_G$. Dieudonn\'e ({Arch. Math., 1948) proved a tight upper bound on
the dimensions of those matrix spaces containing only singular matrices. The
starting point of this paper is a simultaneous generalization of these two
classical results: we show that the largest dimension over subspaces of
$\mathcal{S}_G$ containing only singular matrices is equal to the maximum size
over subgraphs of $G$ without perfect matchings, based on Meshulam's proof of
Dieudonn\'e's result (Quart. J. Math., 1985).
</p>
<p>Starting from this result, we go on to establish more connections between
properties of graphs and matrix spaces. For example, we establish connections
between acyclicity and nilpotency, between strong connectivity and
irreducibility, and between isomorphism and conjugacy/congruence. For each
connection, we study three types of correspondences, namely the basic
correspondence, the inherited correspondence (for subgraphs and subspaces), and
the induced correspondence (for induced subgraphs and restrictions). Some
correspondences lead to intriguing generalizations of classical results, such
as for Dieudonn\'e's result mentioned above, and for a celebrated theorem of
Gerstenhaber regarding the largest dimension of nil matrix spaces (Amer. J.
Math., 1958).
</p>
<p>Finally, we show some implications of our results to quantum information and
present open problems in computational complexity motivated by these results.

problems by reusing existing single-component codes. In so doing, partitioned
methods can shorten code development and validation times for multiphysics and
multiscale applications. In this work, we consider a scenario in which one or
more of the "codes" being coupled are projection-based reduced order models
(ROMs), introduced to lower the computational cost associated with a particular
component. We simulate this scenario by considering a model interface problem
that is discretized independently on two non-overlapping subdomains. We then
formulate a partitioned scheme for this problem that allows the coupling
between a ROM "code" for one of the subdomains with a finite element model
(FEM) or ROM "code" for the other subdomain. The ROM "codes" are constructed by
performing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) on a snapshot ensemble to
obtain a low-dimensional reduced order basis, followed by a Galerkin projection
onto this basis. The ROM and/or FEM "codes" on each subdomain are then coupled
using a Lagrange multiplier representing the interface flux. To partition the
resulting monolithic problem, we first eliminate the flux through a dual Schur
complement. Application of an explicit time integration scheme to the
transformed monolithic problem decouples the subdomain equations, allowing
their independent solution for the next time step. We show numerical results
that demonstrate the proposed method's efficacy in achieving both ROM-FEM and
ROM-ROM coupling.

<p>… on Blake Lemoine, the Google engineer who <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/blake-lemoine-lamda-sentient-artificial-intelligence-google_n_62a5613ee4b06169ca8c0a2e?d_id=3887326&amp;ref=bffbhuffpost&amp;ncid_tag=fcbklnkushpmg00000063&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;utm_campaign=us_main&amp;fbclid=IwAR0o5U4wv2cDP8o3XIAekj2Xh5wVPZVzVhyH696N8tnLv_m-YXtUDt0tFNU">became convinced</a> that a machine learning model had become sentient, contacted federal government agencies about it, and was then <s>fired</s> placed on administrative leave for violating Google’s confidentiality policies.</p>



<p>(1) I don’t think Lemoine is right that <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">LaMDA</a> is at all sentient, but the <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/is-lamda-sentient-an-interview-ea64d916d917">transcript</a> is so mind-bogglingly impressive that I did have to stop and think for a second! Certainly, if you sent the transcript back in time to 1990 or whenever, even an expert reading it might say, yeah, it looks like by 2022 AGI has more likely been achieved than not (“but can I run my own tests?”).  Read it for yourself, if you haven’t yet.</p>



<p>(2) Reading Lemoine’s <a href="https://cajundiscordian.medium.com/">blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cajundiscordian">Twitter</a> this morning, he holds many views that I disagree with, not just about the sentience of LaMDA. Yet I’m touched and impressed by how principled he is, and I expect I’d hit it off with him if I met him. I wish that Google wouldn’t fire him.</p></div>

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $d = o(\log \log n)$, we prove that there is a Boolean function $F$ on $n$ bits and a value $\gamma = 2^{-\Theta(d)}$ such that $F$ can be computed by a uniform depth-$(d + 1)$ $\text{AC}^0$ circuit with $O(n)$ wires, but $F$ cannot be computed by any depth-$d$ $\text{TC}^0$ circuit with $n^{1 + \gamma}$ wires. This bound matches the current state-of-the-art lower bounds for computing explicit functions by threshold circuits of depth $d &gt; 2$, which were previously known only for functions outside $\text{AC}^0$ such as the parity function. Furthermore, in our result, the $\text{AC}^0$ circuit computing $F$ is a monotone *read-once formula* (i.e., an AND-OR tree), and the lower bound holds even in the average-case setting with respect to advantage $n^{-\gamma}$.

Our proof builds on the *random projection* procedure of Håstad, Rossman, Servedio, and Tan, which they used to prove the celebrated average-case depth hierarchy theorem for $\text{AC}^0$ (J. ACM, 2017). We show that under a modified version of their projection procedure, any depth-$d$ threshold circuit with $n^{1 + \gamma}$ wires simplifies to a near-trivial function, whereas an appropriately parameterized AND-OR tree of depth $d + 1$ maintains structure.</div>

<p>Thanks so much to everyone who sent messages of support following my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6444">last post</a>!  I vowed there that I’m going to stop letting online trolls and sneerers occupy so much space in my mental world.  Truthfully, though, while there <em>are</em> many trolls and sneerers who terrify me, there are also some who merely amuse me.  A good example of the latter came a few weeks ago, when an anonymous commenter calling themselves “String Theorist” submitted the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It’s honestly funny to me when you [Scott] call yourself a “nerd” or a “prodigy” or whatever <em>[I don’t recall ever calling myself a “prodigy,” which would indeed be cringe, though “nerd” certainly —SA]</em>, as if studying quantum computing, which is essentially nothing more than glorified linear algebra, is such an advanced intellectual achievement. For what it’s worth I’m a theoretical physicist, I’m in a completely different field, and I was still able to learn Shor’s algorithm in about half an hour, that’s how easy this stuff is. I took a look at some of your papers on arXiv and the math really doesn’t get any more advanced than linear algebra. To understand quantum circuits about the most advanced concept is a tensor product which is routinely covered in undergraduate linear algebra. Wheras in my field of string theory grasping, for instance, holographic dualities relating confirmal field theories and gravity requires vastly more expertise (years of advanced study). I actually find it pretty entertaining that you’ve said yourself you’re still struggling to understand QFT, which most people I’m working with in my research group were first exposed to in undergrad <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f609.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="😉" />  The truth is we’re in entirely different leagues of intelligence (“nerdiness”) and any of your qcomputing papers could easily be picked up by a first or second year math major. It’s just a joke that this is even a field (quantum complexity theory) with journals and faculty when the results in your papers that I’ve seen are pretty much trivial and don’t require anything more than undergraduate level maths.</p></blockquote>



<p>Why does this sort of trash-talk, reminiscent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubo%C5%A1_Motl">Luboš Motl</a>, no longer ruffle me?  Mostly because the boundaries between quantum computing theory, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity, which were never clear in the first place, have steadily gotten fuzzier.  Even in the 1990s, the field of quantum computing attracted amazing physicists—folks who definitely <em>do</em> know quantum field theory—such as Ed Farhi, John Preskill, and Ray Laflamme.  Decades later, it would be fair to say that the physicists have banged their heads against many of the same questions that we computer scientists have banged <em>our</em> heads against, oftentimes in collaboration with us.  And yes, there were cases where actual knowledge of particle physics gave physicists an advantage—with some famous examples being the algorithms of Farhi and collaborators (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_quantum_computation">adiabatic algorithm</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0209131">quantum walk on conjoined trees</a>, the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=207">NAND-tree algorithm</a>).  There were other cases where computer scientists’ knowledge gave <em>them</em> an advantage: I wouldn’t know many details about that, but conceivably shadow tomography, BosonSampling, PostBQP=PP?  Overall, it’s been what you wish <em>every</em> indisciplinary collaboration could be.</p>



<p>What’s new, in the last decade, is that the scientific conversation centered around quantum information and computation has dramatically “metastasized,” to encompass not only a good fraction of all the experimentalists doing quantum optics and sensing and metrology and so forth, and not only a good fraction of all the condensed-matter theorists, but even many leading string theorists and quantum gravity theorists, including Susskind, Maldacena, Bousso, Hubeny, Harlow, and yes, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11965">Witten</a>.  And I don’t think it’s <em>just</em> that they’re too professional to trash-talk quantum information people the way commenter “String Theorist” does.  Rather it’s that, because of the intellectual success of “It from Qubit,” we’re increasingly participating in the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpzigpEJnU">conversations</a> and working on the same technical questions.  One particularly exciting such question, which I’ll have more to say about in a future post, is the truth or falsehood of the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis for observers who jump into black holes.</p>



<p>Not to psychoanalyze, but I’ve noticed a pattern wherein, the more secure a scientist is about their position within their own field, the readier they are to admit ignorance about the <em>neighboring</em> fields, to learn about those fields, and to reach out to the experts in them, to ask simple or (as it usually turns out) not-so-simple questions.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>I can’t imagine any better illustration of these tendencies better than the 28th Solvay Conference on the Physics of Quantum Information, which I attended two weeks ago in Brussels on my 41st birthday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solvay.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="" src="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/solvay-1024x578.jpg" class="wp-image-6466" height="578" /></a>As others pointed out, the proportion of women is not as high as we all wish, but it’s higher than in 1911, when there was exactly one: Madame Curie herself.</figure>



<p>It was my first trip out of the US since before COVID—indeed, I’m so out of practice that I nearly missed my flights in <em>both</em> directions, in part because of my lack of familiarity with the COVID protocols for transatlantic travel, as well as the immense lines caused by those protocols.  My former adviser Umesh Vazirani, who was also at the Solvay Conference, was <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=40">proud</a>.</p>



<p>The Solvay Conference is the venue where, legendarily, the fundamentals of quantum mechanics got hashed out between 1911 and 1927, by the likes of Einstein, Bohr, Planck, and Curie.  (Einstein complained, in a letter, about being called away from his work on general relativity to attend a <a href="https://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2011/05/epn2011425p15.pdf">“witches’ sabbath.”</a>)  Remarkably, it’s still being held in Brussels every few years, and still funded by the same Solvay family that started it.  The once-every-few-years schedule has, we were constantly reminded, been interrupted only three times in its 110-year history: once for WWI, once for WWII, and now once for COVID (this year’s conference was supposed to be in 2020).</p>



<p>This was the first ever Solvay conference organized around the theme of quantum information, and apparently, the first ever that counted computer scientists among its participants (me, Umesh Vazirani, Dorit Aharonov, Urmila Mahadev, and Thomas Vidick).  There were four topics: (1) many-body physics, (2) quantum gravity, (3) quantum computing hardware, and (4) quantum algorithms.  The structure, apparently unchanged since the conference’s founding, is this: everyone attends every session, without exception.  They sit around facing each other the whole time; no one ever stands to lecture.  For each topic, two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapporteur">“rapporteurs”</a> introduce the topic with half-hour prepared talks; then there are short prepared response talks as well as an hour or more of unstructured discussion.  Everything everyone says is recorded in order to be published later.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Daniel Gottesman and I were the two rapporteurs for quantum algorithms: Daniel spoke about quantum error-correction and fault-tolerance, and I spoke about <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/aar-solvay.ppt">“How Much Structure Is Needed for Huge Quantum Speedups?”</a>  The link goes to my PowerPoint slides, if you’d like to check them out.  I tried to survey 30 years of history of that question, from Simon’s and Shor’s algorithms, to huge speedups in quantum query complexity (e.g., glued trees and Forrelation), to the recent quantum supremacy experiments based on BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, all the way to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">breakthrough</a> by Yamakawa and Zhandry a couple months ago.  The last slide hypothesizes a “Law of Conservation of Weirdness,” which after all these decades still remains to be undermined: “For every problem that admits an exponential quantum speedup, there must be some weirdness in its detailed statement, which the quantum algorithm exploits to focus amplitude on the rare right answers.”  My title slide also shows <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E2</a>‘s impressionistic take on the title question, “how much structure is needed for huge quantum speedups?”:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/speedups.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="" src="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/speedups-1024x418.jpg" class="wp-image-6474" height="418" /></a></figure>



<p>The discussion following my talk was largely a debate between me and Ed Farhi, reprising many debates he and I have had over the past 20 years: Farhi urged optimism about the prospect for large, practical quantum speedups via algorithms like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028">QAOA</a>, pointing out his group’s past successes and explaining how they wouldn’t have been possible without an optimistic attitude.  For my part, I praised the past successes and said that optimism is well and good, but at the same time, companies, venture capitalists, and government agencies are right now pouring billions into quantum computing, in many cases—as I know from talking to them—because of a mistaken impression that QCs are <em>already known</em> to be able to revolutionize machine learning, finance, supply-chain optimization, or whatever other application domains they care about, and to do so <em>soon</em>.  They’re genuinely surprised to learn that the consensus of QC experts is in a totally different place.  And to be clear: among quantum computing theorists, I’m not at all unusually pessimistic or skeptical, just unusually willing to say in public what others say in private.</p>



<p>Afterwards, one of the string theorists said that Farhi’s arguments with me had been a highlight … and I agreed.  What’s the point of a friggin’ Solvay Conference if everyone’s just going to <em>agree</em> with each other?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Besides quantum algorithms, there was naturally lots of animated discussion about the practical prospects for building scalable quantum computers.  While I’d hoped that this discussion might change the impressions I’d come with, it mostly confirmed them.  Yes, the problem is staggeringly hard.  Recent ideas for fault-tolerance, including the use of LDPC codes and bosonic codes, might help.  Gottesman’s talk gave me the insight that, at its core, quantum fault-tolerance is all about <em>testing</em>, <em>isolation</em>, and <em>contact-tracing</em>, just for bit-flip and phase-flip errors rather than viruses.  Alas, we don’t yet have the quantum fault-tolerance analogue of a vaccine!</p>



<p>At one point, I asked the trapped-ion experts in open session if they’d comment on the startup company <a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a>, whose stock price recently fell precipitously in the wake of a scathing analyst report.  Alas, none of them took the bait.</p>



<p>On a different note, I was tremendously excited by the quantum gravity session.  Netta Engelhardt spoke about her and others’ <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/netta-engelhardt-has-escaped-hawkings-black-hole-paradox-20210823/">celebrated recent work</a> explaining the Page curve of an evaporating black hole using Euclidean path integrals—and by questioning her and others during coffee breaks, I finally got a handwavy intuition for how it works.  There was also lots of debate, again at coffee breaks, about Susskind’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpzigpEJnU">recent speculations</a> on observers jumping into black holes and the quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis.  One of my main takeaways from the conference was a dramatically better understanding of the issues involved there—but that’s a big enough topic that it will need its own post.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the quantum gravity session, the experimentalist John Martinis innocently asked what actual experiments, or at least thought experiments, had been at issue for the past several hours.  I got a laugh by explaining to him that, while the gravity experts considered this too obvious to point out, the thought experiments in question all involve forming a black hole in a known quantum pure state, with total control over all the Planck-scale degrees of freedom; then waiting outside the black hole for ~10<sup>70</sup> years; collecting every last photon of Hawking radiation that comes out and routing them all into a quantum computer; doing a quantum computation that might actually require exponential time; <em>and then</em> jumping into the black hole, whereupon you might either die immediately at the event horizon, or else learn something in your last seconds before hitting the singularity, which you could then never communicate to anyone outside the black hole.  Martinis thanked me for clarifying.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Anyway, I had a total blast.  Here I am amusing some of the world’s great physicists by letting them mess around with GPT-3.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gpt3.jpg"><img width="1024" alt="" src="https://149663533.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gpt3-1024x768.jpg" class="wp-image-6467" height="768" /></a>Back: Ahmed Almheiri, Juan Maldacena, John Martinis, Aron Wall.  Front: Geoff Penington, me, Daniel Harlow.  Thanks to Michelle Simmons for the photo.</figure>



<p>I also had the following exchange at my birthday dinner:</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> So I don’t get this, Scott. Are you a physicist who studied computer science, or a computer scientist who studied physics?</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> I’m a computer scientist who studied computer science.</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> But then you…</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Yeah, at some point I learned what a boson was, in order to invent BosonSampling.</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> And your courses in physics…</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> They ended at thermodynamics. I couldn’t handle PDEs.</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> What are the units of h-bar?</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Uhh, well, it’s a conversion factor between energy and time. (*)</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> Good.  What’s the radius of the hydrogen atom?</p>



<p><strong>Me:</strong> Uhh … not sure … maybe something like 10<sup>-15</sup> meters?</p>



<p><strong>Physicist:</strong> OK fine, he’s not one of us.</p>



<p>(The answer, it turns out, is more like 10<sup>-10</sup> meters. I’d stupidly substituted the radius of the <em>nucleus</em>—or, y’know, a positively-charged hydrogen <em>ion</em>, i.e. proton. In my partial defense, I was massively jetlagged and at most 10% conscious.)</p>



<p>(*) Actually h-bar is a conversion factor between energy and <em>1/time</em>, i.e. frequency, but the physicist accepted this answer.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Anyway, I look forward to attending more workshops this summer, seeing more colleagues who I hadn’t seen since before COVID, and talking more science … including branching out in some new directions that I’ll blog about soon.  It does beat worrying about online trolls.</p></div>

<h3 id="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong></h3>



<p>A central goal of algorithmic fairness is to build systems with fairness properties that compose gracefully. A major effort towards this goal in fair machine learning has been the development of <em>fair representations</em> which guarantee demographic parity under sequential composition by removing group membership information from the data (i.e. by imposing a <em>demographic secrecy</em> constraint). This approach models all data consumers as utterly malicious adversaries whose sole objective is to be as unfair as possible (i.e. maximally violate demographic parity)—any other possible objective (i.e. incentive) that a data consumer may have is dismissed and ignored. In this talk, I describe joint work with Augustin Chaintreau, in which we elucidate limitations of demographically secret fair representations and propose a fresh approach to potentially overcome them by incorporating information about parties’ incentives into fairness interventions. We show that in a stylized model, it is possible to relax demographic secrecy to obtain <em>incentive-compatible representations</em>, where rational parties obtain exponentially greater utilities vis-à-vis any demographically secret representation and satisfy demographic parity. These substantial gains are recovered not from the well-known <em>cost of fairness</em>, but rather from a <em>cost of demographic secrecy</em> which we formalize and quantify for the first time. We further show that the sequential composition property of demographically secret representations is not robust to aggregation. Our results contribute to further understanding the challenges of fair composition while simultaneously suggesting that incentives may be an important and flexible tool for addressing or even overcoming those challenges.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In a recent work, Fan, Li, and Yang (STOC 2022) constructed a family of almost-universal hash functions such that each function in the family is computable by $(2n + o(n))$-gate circuits of fan-in $2$ over the $B_2$ basis. Applying this family, they established the existence of pseudorandom functions computable by circuits of the same complexity, under the standard assumption that OWFs exist. However, a major disadvantage of the hash family construction by Fan, Li, and Yang (STOC 2022) is that it requires a seed length of $\text{poly}(n)$, which limits its potential applications. 
        
We address this issue by giving an improved construction of almost-universal hash functions with seed length $\text{polylog}(n)$, such that each function in the family is computable with $\text{POLYLOGTIME}$-uniform $(2n + o(n))$-gate circuits. Our new construction has the following applications in both complexity theory and cryptography.
        
* ($\textbf{Hardness magnification}$). Let $\alpha : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ be any function such that $\alpha(n) \leq \log n / \log \log n$. We show that if there is an $n^{\alpha(n)}$-sparse $\textbf{NP}$ language that does not have probabilistic circuits of $2n + O(n/\log\log n)$ gates, then we have (1) $\textbf{NTIME}[2^n] \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE} \left[2^{n^{1/5}}\right]$ and (2) $\textbf{NP} \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE}[n^k]$ for every constant $k$. Complementing this magnification phenomenon, we present an $O(n)$-sparse language in $\textbf{P}$ which requires probabilistic circuits of size at least $2n - 2$. This is the first result in hardness magnification showing that even a \emph{sub-linear additive} improvement on known circuit size lower bounds would imply $\textbf{NEXP} \not\subseteq \textbf{P}_{/\text{poly}}$. 

Following Chen, Jin, and Williams (STOC 2020), we also establish a sharp threshold for \textbf{explicit obstructions}: we give an explict obstruction against $(2n-2)$-size circuits, and prove that a sub-linear additive improvement on the circuit size would imply (1) $\textbf{DTIME}[2^n] \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE} \left[2^{n^{1/5}}\right]$ and (2) $\textbf{P} \not\subseteq \textbf{SIZE}[n^k]$ for every constant $k$.

* ($\textbf{Extremely efficient construction of pseudorandom functions}$). Assuming that one of integer factoring, decisional Diffie-Hellman, or ring learning-with-errors is sub-exponentially hard, we show the existence of pseudorandom functions computable by $\text{POLYLOGTIME}$-uniform $\textbf{AC}^0[2]$ circuits with $2n + o(n)$ wires, with key length $\text{polylog}(n)$. We also show that PRFs computable by $\text{POLYLOGTIME}$-uniform $B_2$ circuits of $2n + o(n)$ gates follows from the existence of sub-exponentially secure one-way functions.</div>

A monotone Boolean circuit is a restriction of a Boolean circuit
  allowing for the use of disjunctions, conjunctions, the Boolean
  constants, and the input variables.  A monotone Boolean circuit is
  multilinear if for any AND gate the two input functions have no
  variable in common.  We show that the known lower bounds on the size
  of monotone arithmetic circuits for multivariate polynomials that
  are sums of monomials consisting of $k$ distinct variables yield the

  multilinear Boolean circuits computing the Boolean functions

<p>Codes! Distributed computing! Probability distributions!</p>



<p><strong>Improved local testing for multiplicity codes</strong>, by Dan Karliner and Amnon Ta-Shma (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.14137">ECCC</a>). Take the Reed–Muller code with parameters \(m, d\), whose codewords are the evaluation tables of all degree-\(m\) polynomials over \(\mathbb{F}^d\). RM codes are great, they are everywhere, and they are<em> locally testable</em>: one can test whether a given input \(x\) is a valid codeword (or far from every codeword) with only very few queries to \(x\). Now, take the <em>multiplicity code</em>: instead of just the evaluation table of the polynomial themselves, a codeword includes the evaluations of all its derivatives, up to order \(s\). These beasts generalize RM codes: are they <em>also</em> locally testable? Yes they are! And this work improves on our understanding of this aspect, by providing better bounds on the locality (how few queries are necessary to test), and simplifies the argument from previous work by Karliner, Salama, and Ta-Shma (2022).</p>



<p><strong>Overcoming Congestion in Distributed Coloring,</strong> by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Alexandre Nolin, Tigran Tonoyan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14478">arXiv</a>). Two of the main distributed computing models, LOCAL and CONGEST, differ in how they model the bandwidth constraints. In the former, nodes can send messages of arbitrary size, and the limiting quantity is the number of rounds of communications; while in the latter, each node can only send a logarithmic number of bits at each round. This paper introduces a new technique that allows for communication-efficient distributed (coordinated) sampling, which as a direct applications enables porting several LOCAL algorithms to the CONGEST model at a small cost: for instance, \((\Delta+1)\)-List Coloring. This new technique also has applications beyond these distributed models, to graph property testing – in a slightly non-standard setting where we define farness from the property in a “local” sense (detect vertices or edges which contribute to many violations, i.e., are “locally far” from the property considered).</p>



<p><strong>Robust Testing in High-Dimensional Sparse Models,</strong> by Anand Jerry George and Clément L. Canonne (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07488">arXiv</a>). In the Gaussian mean testing problem, you are given samples from a high-dimensional Gaussian \(N(\mu, I_d)\), where \(\mu\) is either zero or has \(\ell_2\) norm greater than \(\varepsilon\), and you want to decide which of the two holds. This “mean testing” equivalent (due to, erm, “standard facts”) to testing in total variation distance, and captures the setting where one wantss to figure out whether an underlying signal \(\mu\), subject to white noise, is null or significant. Now, what if this $\mu$ was promised to be \(s\)-sparse? Can we test more efficiently? But what if a small fraction of the samples were arbitrarily corrupted — how much harder does the testing task become? For some related tasks, it is known that being robust against adversarial corruptions makes testing as hard as learning… This paper addresses this “robust sparse mean testing” question, providing matching upper and lower bounds; as well as the related question of (robust, sparse) linear regression.</p>



<p><strong>Sequential algorithms for testing identity and closeness of distributions,</strong> by Omar Fawzi, Nicolas Flammarion, Aurélien Garivier, and Aadil Oufkir (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06069">arXiv</a>). Consider the two “usual suspects” of distribution testing, <em>identity</em> and <em>closeness</em> testing, where we must test if an unknown distribution is equal to some reference one or \(\varepsilon\)-far (in total variation distance) from it; or, the same thing, but with two unknown distributions (no reference one). These are, by now, quite well understood… but the algorithms for them take a worst-case number of samples, function of the distance parameter \(\varepsilon\). But if the two distributions are much further apart than \(\varepsilon\), fewer samples should be required! This is the focus of this paper, showing that with a sequential test one can achieve this type of guarantees: a number of samples which, in the “far” case, depends on the actual distance, not on its worst-case lower bound \(\varepsilon\). One could achieve this by combining known algorithms with a “doubling search;” however, this still would lose some constant factors in the sample complexity. The authors provide sequential tests which improve on this “doubling search technique” by constant factors, and back this up with empirical evaluations of their algorithms.</p>



<p><strong>Estimation of Entropy in Constant Space with Improved Sample Complexity,</strong> by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Andrew McGregor, Jelani Nelson, and Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09804">arXiv</a>). Suppose that, given samples from an unknown distribution \(p\) over \(n\) elements, your task is to estimate its (Shannon) entropy \(H(p)\) up to \(\pm\Delta\). You’re in luck! We know that \(\Theta(n/(\Delta\log n)+ (\log^2 n)/\Delta^2)\) samples are necessary and efficient. <em>But what if you had to do that under strict memory constraints? </em>Say, using only a <em>constant</em> number of words of memory? Previous work by Acharya, Bhadane, Indyk, and Sun (2019) shows that it is still possible, but the number of samples required shoots up, with their algorithm now requiring (up to polylog factors) \(n/\Delta^3\) samples. This works improves upon the dependence on \(\Delta\), providing a constant-memory algorithm with sample complexity \(O(n/\Delta^2 \cdot \log^4(1/\Delta))\); they further conjecture this to be optimal, up to the polylog factors.</p></div>

Roy Amara was a researcher and president of the Institute for the Future.  Among things he is known for is coining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Amara">Amara’s law</a> on the effect of technology. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to discuss “laws”. We hope you will like the smile that many of these give us. Perhaps they will give you some too. </p>

<p>
<span id="more-20150"></span></p>
<p><b> Amara’s Law and More </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Amara’s law is: <br />
 <i>We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.</i> </p>
<p>
Tom Cargill’s law is: <br />
 <i>The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time.</i></p>
<p>
Arthur Clarke’s law is: <br />
 <i>When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.</i></p>
<p>
Fred Brooks’s law is: <br />
 <i>Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</i></p>
<p>
Brooks explains it:  First, it takes the new guy some time to learn about the project before becoming productive. Teaching him takes resources that could otherwise be put into the project itself. Second, communication overheads increase as the number of people increases – sometimes, they spend more time talking to each other to keep the project in sync, rather than working on the project itself. </p>
<p>
Here is a list of many additional interesting <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/laws">laws</a> from <i>PC Magazine</i>. Some of our favorites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer. <p></p>
</li><li>
If you can think of four ways that something can go wrong, it will go wrong in the fifth way. <p></p>
</li><li>
Everything takes longer than you think it will. <p></p>
</li><li>
Nature always sides with the hidden flaw. <p></p>
</li><li>
The light at the end of the tunnel is only the light of an oncoming train.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
The third of the last five laws from <i>PC Magazine</i> was given a fuller <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law">statement</a> by Douglas Hofstadter: </p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Hofstadter’s Law</b>: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account <b>Hofstadter’s Law</b>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>

This is a reminder that the Workshop on Local Algorithms (WOLA) is<br />taking place in Warsaw this year from June 25 to 27. It is conveniently<br />scheduled right after STOC in Rome. Keynote speakers include Bernhard<br />Haeupler, Rotem Oshman, Michael Kapralov, and Vincent Cohen-Addad. More<br />information can be found on the official webpage:<br /><a href="https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/wola/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/wola/</a></p>



<p># Contributed talks and registration</p>



<p>Apart from keynote talks, WOLA is going back to the pre-pandemic<br />tradition of contributed talks by the workshop participants. **If you<br />are planning to attend in person and want to give a talk**, please<br />register as soon as possible at<br /><a href="https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/wola/registration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://ideas-ncbr.pl/en/wola/registration/</a>. Even if you are not<br />planning to give a talk, registering helps the local organizers with<br />estimating the number of attendees, which is useful for events such as...</p>



<p># A night tour of Warsaw on a retro bus</p>



<p>See the attached picture for what such a bus looks like! I'm told by the<br />local organizers that this will include a tasting of Polish specialties.<br />This event is scheduled for Saturday night.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://corner.mimuw.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/retro_bus.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1112" /></figure>



<p># Traveling from STOC in Rome</p>



<p>The workshop is starting at 1:30pm on Saturday to allow for more options<br />for traveling from STOC. There are direct flights with Wizz Air on both<br />Friday night and Saturday morning. You can also fly with KLM (via AMS)<br />or Air France (via CDG) on Saturday morning if you prefer a more<br />traditional air carrier.

<div class="content">
<p>A central problem of generalization theory is the following: <em>Given a training dataset and a deep net trained with that dataset, give a mathematical estimate of the test error.</em></p>

<p>While this may seem useless to a practitioner (“why not just retain some holdout data for testing?”), this is of great interest to theorists trying to understand what properties of the net or the training algorithm lead to good generalization. Old posts on this blog such as <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2018/02/17/generalization2/">this one</a> mentioned the difficulties in applying classic generalization theory to get estimates of generalization error even within a few orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>This blog post is about the topic of a 
 NeurIPS 20 competition <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pgdl2020">Predicting Generalization in Deep Learning competition</a> which suggested using machine learning techniques to  understand network properties that promote generalization! Contestants are given datasets and a set of deep nets trained on these datasets using unknown techniques. The goal is to rank the trained nets according to generalization error. Contestants provide a python code that, given a training set and a trained net, outputs a scalar estimate of the generalization error. The contestant’s performance is computed using a ranking measure of how well their scalar score correlates with actual generalization. 
 Several interesting ideas emerged from the competition, such as measuring networks’ resilience to distortions to the input; collecting specific statistics of hidden node activations; and measuring output consistency of identically structured networks but trained by SGD with different random seeds.</p>

<p>This blog post describes our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14212">ICLR22 spotlight paper</a>, coauthored with Nikunj Saunshi and Arushi Gupta, that gives a surprisingly easy method to predict generalization using <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2017/03/15/GANs/">Generative Adversarial Nets</a> or GANs.</p>

<h2 id="predicting-generalization-using-gans">Predicting Generalization using GANs</h2>
<p>Given a training dataset and a collection of nets trained using it, our method is very simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the same training dataset a</p>

  <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Draw samples from the GAN generator to obtain a synthetic dataset.</p>

  <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> For each classifier in the task, use its classification error on the synthetic data as our prediction for its true test error</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We find for a variety of image datasets that using pre-trained Studio-GANs directly downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN">public repositories</a>, we obtain scores that would ‘‘not only outperforms other methods but blows them out of the water’’ (to cite one of the reviews for our paper), including the winning methods proposed at the PGDL competition (see Table 1 in the paper for quantitative results). Here we show plots of true test errors v.s. errors on the synthetic data, where we generate one synthetic dataset from a GAN trained on each dataset, and each dot in the figures represents a trained deep net classifier.</p>

<figure align="center">
<img width="80%" alt="drawing" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/PGDL_linear_fit.jpg" />
</figure>

<p>Not only is the correlation linear; it appears remarkably close to the $y=x$ fit! Also the trained deep net classifiers here belong to drastically different architecture families —including VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, ShuffleNet, PNASNet, and MobileNet— which don’t correspond to the discriminator of Studio-GAN.</p>

<p>Frankly, this success at predicting generalization confounded the authors, some of whom had earlier shown that GANs <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2017/07/06/GANs3/">do not learn the distribution well, and suffer from serious mode collapse</a>).</p>

<p>Thus we conclude following three statements all appear to be true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Observation 1)</strong> GAN samples suffer from mode collapse (as detected by the <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2017/07/06/GANs3/">birthday paradox test</a> and do not appear to be as diverse as the distribution of images the GANs was trained on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Observation 2)</strong> Training deep net classifiers using only GAN samples leads to poor performance. This is another evidence that GAN samples are poor substitutes for the real thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Observation 3)</strong> Yet GAN samples are good enough to substitute for holdout data to give a reasonable prediction of test performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note however that there is no inherent contradiction here. For instance, suppose the GAN’s distribution has limited diversity: it only knows how to generate a $10,000$  random images, as well as $1000$ minor variations of each of these images. So long as the  $10,000$ distinct images are like random draws from the full distribution, it could  predict generalization for a trained net reasonably well, even though a million image samples from the GAN would not suffice to replace ImageNet’s 1 million images for training a deep net from scratch. (In fact this scenario was predicted and to some extent verified by <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/arora17a.html">our earlier work on why GANs may not be able to avoid mode collapse</a>.)</p>

<p>We hope our work motivates further investigations of the power of real-life GANs and what can be done using samples from their distributions.</p>

<p>(Aside: Of course, the field has now progressed beyond simple GANs to multimodal generators like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL-E</a>, and it would be interesting to understand how the generated images there can be leveraged to predict generalization.)</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>After <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2022/05/31/linkage.html">I wrote recently</a> about Ramanujan’s approximation \(\pi^4\approx 2143/22\), writing “why do powers of \(\pi\) seem to have unusually good rational approximations?”, 
Timothy Chow emailed to challenge my assumption, asking what evidence I had that their approximations were unusually good. So that led me to do a little statistical experiment to test that hypothesis, and the experiment showed…that the approximations seem to be about as good as we would expect, no more, no less. Not unusually good. Chow was correct, and my earlier statement was overstated. So if Ramanujan’s approximation is not just random fluctuation (which for all I know it could be), it at least does not seem to be part of a pattern of many good rational approximations for small powers of \(\pi\). Below are some details of how I came to this conclusion.</p>

<p>First off, one gets good rational approximations by truncating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">continued fraction representation</a> of a number. for instance, Ramanujan’s approximation can be obtained from the continued fraction</p>

\[\pi^4=97 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{3 + \cfrac{1}{1+\cfrac{1}{16539+\cdots}}}}}\]

<p>by stopping just before the big number \(16539\). You want to stop at those points, roughly speaking, because the accuracy of your approximation (as measured for instance by how many decimal digits you get correct) comes from combining all of the terms up to and including the big one you stopped before, but the complexity of your approximation (how many digits it takes to write it down) comes from only the terms before you stopped. When you stop just before a big term, you get a lot of accuracy for free. And so the question I was really asking was “why do the powers of \(\pi\) have unusually big terms in their continued fractions?” But the question I should have asked first was “do the powers of \(\pi\) have unusually big terms in their continued fractions?”</p>

<p>For a random number, the terms of the continued fraction will be distributed according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Kuzmin_distribution">Gauss–Kuzmin distribution</a>, according to which the probability of seeing a term with value exactly \(k\) is</p>

\[- \log_2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1+k)^2}\right).\]

<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-tailed_distribution">heavy-tailed distribution</a>, so one should expect to see some large numbers from time to time. What I wanted to test was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis">null hypothesis</a> that the continued fraction for powers of \(\pi\) are distributed in this way. If the tests revealed a low likelihood of this being true, it would suggest that they have some other distribution, confirming what I wrote in my earlier post. If they didn’t, it still might mean that there was something unusual about those terms, but it would have to be more subtle, subtle enough to be undetected by the statistical tests I used.</p>

<p>This is exactly the sort of thing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson%27s_chi-squared_test">Pearson’s \(\chi^2\) test</a> is good for. So I set up a \(\chi^2\) test in R comparing the observed data (the frequencies of each value in the continued fraction terms for \(\pi\), \(\pi^2\), \(\pi^3\), and \(\pi^4\), as taken from OEIS) with the Gauss–Kuzmin distribution. I omitted the initial term from each continued fraction, because those are the integer parts of the powers of \(\pi\), which are both nonrandom and uninteresting for approximation purposes. I also grouped the terms of the continued fractions into six exponentially-growing buckets, by mapping each term \(t_i\) to \(\min\bigl(5,\lfloor\log_2 t_i\rfloor\bigr)\), because the \(\chi^2\) test works better when it has only a small number of well-populated frequency counts to compare, rather than \(16539\) of them, many empty or with only one representative. This meant also computing the Gauss–Kuzmin probabilities for the same buckets. These buckets still don’t have uniform probabilities but I thought it better to stick to my first choice of bucketing rather than to repeatedly adjust the parameters of the test. Even with this bucketing the \(\chi^2\) test still wasn’t strong enough to work well on the OEIS data taken separately for each individual power of \(\pi\). Instead I had to concatenate the data for the four powers I had chosen into a single test to get it to work without R complaining.</p>

<p>Because I am more fluent in Python than R, I did this as <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2022/pipower.py">a Python script</a> to generate a very short R script, but it would have been as easy to do the whole thing directly in R. The results: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value">\(p\)-value</a> somewhat greater than \(\tfrac12\) (not small). So the null hypothesis was <em>not</em> rejected and I do not have evidence that the powers of \(\pi\) have unusually big terms in their continued fractions.</p>

<p>A new law in Texas states that any social media sites that has at least 50 million subscribers a month cannot ban anyone (its more nuanced than that, but that's the drift). </p><p>(I wrote this before the Supreme courts blocked the law, which you can read about <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/31/scotus-blocks-texas-law-targeting-social-media-censorship/">here</a>. This is a temporary block so the issue is not settled.) </p><p>Here is an article about the law: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/12/23068017/supreme-court-first-amendment-twitter-facebook-youtube-instagram-netchoice-paxton-texas">here</a></p><p>My random thoughts</p><p>1) How can any internet law be local to Texas or to any state? I wonder the same thing about the EU's law about right-to-be-forgotten and other restrictions. </p><p>2) Does the law apply to blogs? If Scott had over 50 million readers... <i>Hold that thought. </i>Imagine if that many people cared about quantum computing, complexity theory,  the Busy Beaver function,  and Scott's political and social views. T<i>hat would be an awesome world!</i> However, back to the point- if he did have that many readers would he not be allowed to ban anyone?</p><p>3) If Lance and I had over 50 million readers... <i>Hold that thought</i>. Imagine if that many people cared about Complexity Theory, Ramsey Theory, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/01/did-betty-white-die-in-2021why-do.html">Betty White</a> and Bill and Lance's political and social views. Would <i>that be an awesome world?</i> I leave that as an open question. However, back to the point- would they be able to block posts like: </p><p>                      Great Post. Good point about SAT. Click here for a good deal on tuxedos. </p><p>Either the poster thinks that Lance will win a Turing award and wants him to look good for the ceremony, or its a bot. </p><p>4) If Lipton and Regan's GLL blog had over 50 million readers.... <i>Hold that thought</i>. Imagine if that many people cared about Complexity theory, open-mindedness towards P=NP, catching people who cheat at chess, nice things about everyone they mention, and their political and social views. <i>That would</i> <i>be a very polite world! </i>However, back to the point- would they be able to block posts? Block people? </p><p>5) arxiv recently rejected a paper by Doren Zeilberger. This rejection was idiotic, though Doren can argue the case better than I can, so see <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/Opinion183.html">here</a> for his version of events (one sign  that he can argue better than I can: he does not use any negative terms like <i>idiot.)  </i>Under the moronic Texas law, can arxiv ban Doren for life? (of course, the question arises, do they have at least 50 million subscribers?)</p><p>6) Given who is proposing the law its intent is things like <i>you can't kick Donald Trump off Twitter</i>. I  wonder if Parler or 8-chan or Truth-Social which claim to be free-speech sites, but whose origins are on the right, would block  liberals. Or block anyone? I DO NOT KNOW if they do, but I am curious. If anyone knows please post- no speculation or rumor, I only want solid information. </p><p>7) Republicans default position is to not regulate industry. It is <i>not</i> necessarily  a contradiction to support a regulation; however, they would need  a strong argument why this particular case needs regulation when other issues do not. I have not seen such an argument; however, if you have one then leave a comment. (The argument <i>they are doing</i> <i>it  to please their base </i>is not what I mean- I want a fair objective argument.) </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

We run experiments on regression and classification tasks, on exchangeable data, under distribution shift, on real time series data, and on adversarial data orderings. Even when the data is i.i.d. and we only care about marginal coverage, our method has an important advantage over split conformal prediction --- since we don't need to preserve exchangability, we can use all of the data to train the underlying model, whereas split conformal prediction needs to reserve some fraction of it for a holdout set. The result is faster learning for our method, which results in smaller/more accurate prediction sets even without the complicating factors of groupwise coverage, threshold calibration or adversarial data!<p></p><p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"><br /></p><p style="line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 10pt;" class="MsoNormal"></p><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi_aZVJNKOwZAqvG8VakcezTF1GsazQ5tu-zh-UEMdNQKkQMtAWM0t4SD2qxqnLHzt9LVHlq-LpohdzzGTwVbmJyboe3qXdd6HBlkULcCWRWMCVgcDD6NcWZ1UMRR63nYS3GRReYei2bdat0WdJGvk6cbDezmXb59QwCRDbF8pOTJadJ6KWsQ"><img width="320" alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi_aZVJNKOwZAqvG8VakcezTF1GsazQ5tu-zh-UEMdNQKkQMtAWM0t4SD2qxqnLHzt9LVHlq-LpohdzzGTwVbmJyboe3qXdd6HBlkULcCWRWMCVgcDD6NcWZ1UMRR63nYS3GRReYei2bdat0WdJGvk6cbDezmXb59QwCRDbF8pOTJadJ6KWsQ" height="103" /></a></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;" class="separator"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj8Fz00pgB6ecV04-CrFtPrvPMp_g-csyIZ5A02Sjrizm9LAi8XGsL7G4nnTSojkNX8q9N5EmiRYlawVTwo9fP3qV_fErvIT19WYu3KReaZNDanVUDRTx9ZmS5rOfKgO_6o86wGESe3vheqsG6mLd6DKuomdV8GaQM3t3JIiHNkvaB1Sfbi5w"><img width="320" alt="" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj8Fz00pgB6ecV04-CrFtPrvPMp_g-csyIZ5A02Sjrizm9LAi8XGsL7G4nnTSojkNX8q9N5EmiRYlawVTwo9fP3qV_fErvIT19WYu3KReaZNDanVUDRTx9ZmS5rOfKgO_6o86wGESe3vheqsG6mLd6DKuomdV8GaQM3t3JIiHNkvaB1Sfbi5w" height="112" /></a></div><br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><p></p></div>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>This is a post about a new paper that is joint work with Bastani, Gupta, Jung, Noarov, and Ramalingam. The paper is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01067">https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01067</a>  and here is a recording of a recent talk I gave about it at the Simons Foundation: <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/robust-and-equitable-uncertainty-estimation/&amp;nbsp">https://www.simonsfoundation.org/event/robust-and-equitable-uncertainty-estimation/ </a></em></p>



<p>Machine Learning is really good at making point predictions — but it sometimes makes mistakes. How should we think about which predictions we should trust? In other words, what is the right way to think about the uncertainty of particular predictions? Together with Osbert Bastani, Varun Gupta, Chris Jung, Georgy Noarov, and Ramya Ramalingam, we have some new work I’m really excited about. </p>



<p>A natural way to quantify uncertainty is to predict a set of labels rather than a single one. Pick a degree of certainty — say 90%. For every prediction we make, we’d like to return the smallest set of labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label 90% of the time. These are “prediction sets”, and quantify uncertainty in a natural way: ideally, we will be sure about the correct label, and the prediction set will contain only a single label (the prediction we are certain about). But the larger our prediction set, the more our uncertainty, and the contents of the prediction set lets us know what exactly the model is uncertain about. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/toc4fairness.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/predictionset.png?resize=800%2C256&amp;ssl=1" style="width: 500px;" height="256" width="800" alt="" class="wp-image-2151" /><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/25562705/4217158232171967686"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center">An example of prediction sets for ImageNet. This example comes from a nice recent paper by Angelopoulos, Bates, Malik, and Jordan: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193">https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14193</a> </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>But how can we do this? Conformal Prediction provides a particularly simple way. Here is an outline of the vanilla version of conformal prediction (there are plenty of variants): </p>



<p>Step 1: Pick a (non)conformity score to measure how different a label y is from a prediction f(x). e.g. for a regression model we could choose $s(x,y) = |f(x)-y|$ — but lots of interesting work has been done recently to develop much fancier ones. A lot of the art of conformal prediction is in finding a good score function.</p>



<p>Step 2: Find a threshold $\tau$ such that for a new example <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,y)" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CPr%5Bs%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cleq+%5Ctau%5D+%3D+0.9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Pr[s(x,y) \leq \tau] = 0.9" class="latex" />. An easy way to do this is using a holdout set. </p>



<p>Step 3: On a new example <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" />, given a point prediction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x)" class="latex" />, produce the prediction set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28x%29+%3D+%5C%7By+%3A+s%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cleq+%5Ctau%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P(x) = \{y : s(x,y) \leq \tau\}" class="latex" />. </p>



<p>Thats it! Nice and simple. Check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07511">this recent survey by Angelopolous and Bates</a> for an accessible introduction to conformal prediction. </p>



<p>But a few things could go wrong. First, the technique of using a holdout set only works if the data is i.i.d. or more generally exchangable — i.e. the data distribution should be permutation invariant. But maybe its coming from some changing distribution. If the distribution has changed in an expected and well behaved way, there are some fixes that let you apply the same framework, but if not you are likely in trouble.</p>

<p>Second, an average over everyone might not be what you care about. If we are in a personalized medicine setting, you might care about the reliability of predictions not just overall, but for women with a family history of diabetes and egg allergies — or whatever else you think is medically relevant about you as an individual.</p>



<p>This is the problem that we want to solve: How to give prediction sets that cover their label 90% of the time even if we make no assumptions at all about the data generating process, and even if we care about coverage conditional on arbitrary intersecting subsets of the data.</p>



<p>We want stronger guarantees in another way too. If you think about our goal, there is a way to cheat: 90% of the time, predict the (trivial) set of all labels. 10% of the time predict the empty set. This covers the real label 90% of the time, but is completely uninformative.</p>



<p>To avoid this “solution”, we also ask that our predictions be threshold calibrated. Remember our prediction sets have the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P_t%28x%29+%3D+%5C%7By+%3A+s%28x%2Cy%29+%5Cleq+%5Ctau_t%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="P_t(x) = \{y : s(x,y) \leq \tau_t\}" class="latex" />.

<p>This rules out cheating. Remarkably (I think!), for every set of groups specified ahead of time, we’re able to guarantee that even if the data is generated by an adversary, that our empirical coverage converges to 90% at the statistically optimal rate. Here is what that means:</p>

Consider all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7B%5Ctau%2CG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n_{\tau,G}" class="latex" /> rounds in which the example <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" /> was in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="G" class="latex" />, and in which we predicted threshold <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctau&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\tau" class="latex" />.  We promise that on this set, we cover 90% <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpm&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\pm" class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1%2F%5Csqrt%7Bn_%7B%5Ctau%2CG%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="1/\sqrt{n_{\tau,G}}" class="latex" /> of the labels. This is the best you could do even with a known distribution.</p>



<p>The best thing is that the algorithm is super simple and practical. We had<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01739"> a paper last year</a> that showed how to do much of this in theory — but the algorithm from that paper was not easily implementable (it involved solving an exponentially large linear program with a separation oracle).  But here is our new algorithm — it only involves doing a small amount of arithmetic for each prediction:</p>

</p><p><b> Another Conference </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Soon she will be running another conference: <a href="https://womenintheory.wordpress.com/program/">Women in Theory 2022</a> from June 7 to June 10. Below is the 2018 group photo:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/06/03/women-in-theory/attachment/2018/" rel="attachment wp-att-20127"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2018.jpg?resize=600%2C162&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20127" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>
 The Women in Theory (WIT) Workshop is intended for graduate and exceptional undergraduate students in the area of theory of computer science. The workshop will feature technical talks and tutorials by senior and junior women in the field, as well as social events and activities. The motivation for the workshop is twofold. The first goal is to deliver an invigorating educational program; the second is to bring together theory women students from different departments and foster a sense of kinship and camaraderie. </p>
<p>
Here are the speakers, along with talk titles for some of them:</p>

A central open problem in complexity theory concerns the question of whether all efficient randomized algorithms can be simulated by efficient deterministic algorithms. We consider this problem in the context of promise problems (i.e,. the $\prBPP$ v.s. $\prP$ problem) and show that for all sufficiently large constants $c$, the following are \emph{equivalent}:
\BI
\item $\prBPP=\prP$.
\item For every $\BPTIME(n^c)$ algorithm $M$, and every sufficiently large $z \in \{0,1\}^n$, there exists some $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ such that $M$ fails to decide whether $Kt(x \mid z)$ is ``very large'' ($\geq n-1$) or ``very small'' ($\leq O(\log
n)$).
\EI
where $Kt(x \mid z$) denotes the Levin-Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ conditioned on $z$.

As far as we are aware, this yields the first full \emph{characterization} of when $\prBPP = \prP$ through the hardness of some class of problems. Previous hardness assumptions used for derandomization only provide a one-sided implication.</div>

Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a widely used probabilistic model for negatively correlated sets. DPPs have been successfully employed in Machine Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data. In these applications, the parameters of the DPP need to be fitted to match the data; typically, we seek a set of parameters that maximize the likelihood of the data. The algorithms used for this task to date either optimize over a limited family of DPPs, 
or use local improvement heuristics that do not provide theoretical guarantees of optimality.
   
It is natural to ask if there exist efficient algorithms for finding a maximum likelihood DPP model for a given data set. In seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza conjectured in his PhD Thesis (2011) that the problem is NP-complete. 
The lack of a formal proof  prompted Brunel, Moitra, Rigollet and Urschel (COLT 2017) to conjecture that, 
in opposition to Kulesza's conjecture, there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a maximum-likelihood DPP. They also presented some preliminary evidence supporting their conjecture.
   
In this work we prove Kulesza's conjecture. In fact, we prove the following stronger hardness of approximation result: even computing a $\left(1-O(\frac{1}{\log^9{N}})\right)$-approximation to the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP on a ground set of $N$ elements is NP-complete. At the same time, we also obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a nontrivial worst-case approximation 
to the optimal log-likelihood: the approximation factor is $\frac{1}{(1+o(1))\log{m}}$ unconditionally (for data sets that consist of $m$ subsets), and can be improved to $1-\frac{1+o(1)}{\log N}$ if all $N$ elements appear in a $O(1/N)$-fraction of the subsets.
   
In terms of techniques, we reduce approximating the maximum log-likelihood of DPPs on a data set to 
solving a gap instance of a ``vector coloring" problem on a  hypergraph. Such a hypergraph is built on a bounded-degree graph construction of Bogdanov, Obata and Trevisan (FOCS 2002), and is further enhanced by the strong  expanders of  Alon and Capalbo (FOCS 2007) to serve our purposes.</div>

<p>When the <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> wave washed over the world some months ago, I played along like everybody else, once a day collecting my rows of gray and gold and green letters. But my main interest was not in testing my linguistic intuitions; I wanted to write a computer program to solve the puzzle. Could I create something that would play a stronger game than I do? It’s now clear the answer to that question is yes, but I can’t say whether it’s because I’m such a hotshot programmer or such a mediocre Wordler.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that my motivation in this project is not to cheat. Josh Wardle, the creator of Wordle, took all the fun out of cheating by making it way too easy. Anybody can post impressive results like this one:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wordle-share-image1.png" height="56" width="136" alt="Image of the five green squares Wordle shows when you guess the word on the first try." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">That lonely row of green squares indicates that you’ve solved the puzzle with a single brilliant guess. The Wordle app calls that performance an act of “Genius,” but if it happens more than once every few years, your friends may suspect another explanation.</p>
<p>The software I’ve written will not solve today’s puzzle for you. You can’t run the program unless you already know the answer. Thus the program won’t tell you, in advance, how to play; but it may tell you, retrospectively, how you <em>should have</em> played.</p>
<hr />
<p>The aim in Wordle is to identify a hidden five-letter word. When you make a guess, the Wordle app gives you feedback by coloring the letter tiles. A green tile indicates that you have put the right letter in the right place. The rules are not quite as simple as they seem, as I’ll explain below.Gold means the letter is present in the target word, but not where you put it. Letters absent from the target word are marked with a gray tile.</p>
<p>Figure 1.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/example_game_crop.png" height="184" width="640" alt="Example game of Wordle, showing the initial blank grid and four guesses: CRATE, BUILT, LIMIT, and finally LIGHT, which is the target word." border="0" class="alignleft" /></p>
<p class="indent">The sequence of grids above records the progress of a game I played several weeks ago. The initial state of the puzzle is a blank grid with space for six words of five letters each. My first guess, CRATE <em>(far left)</em>, revealed that the letter T is present in the target word, but not in the fourth position; the other letters, CRAE, are absent. I then played BUILT and learned where the T goes, and that the letters I and L are also present. The third guess, LIMIT, got three letters in their correct positions, which was enough information to rule out all but one possibility. The four green tiles in row four confirm that LIGHT is the target word.</p>
<p>The official Wordle app gives you six chances to guess the Wordle-of-the-day. If you fill the grid with six wrong answers, the game ends and the app reveals the word you failed to find.</p>
<p>It’s important to bear in mind that Wordle is played in a closed universe. The word lists used throughout this essay come from the original version of the game published by Josh Wardle at <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/">powerlanguage.co.uk</a>. In February, when the game moved to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/">nytimes.com</a>, about two dozen words were shuffled around or removed. <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_1">Note 1</a> has further discussion of the word lists and the <em>Times</em>‘s revisions.The target words are drawn from a list of 2,315 possibilities, which are meant to be words familiar to anyone with a broad English vocabulary. All of these target words are also valid guess words. An additional 10,657 words are acceptable as guesses but will never appear as the Wordle-of-the-day. Many of these latter words are quite obscure, familiar only to the most serious Scrabble players. I call them the arcana.</p>
<p>Both of the word lists are downloaded to your web browser whenever you play the game, and you can examine or copy them by peeking at the JavaScript source code with your browser’s developer tools.</p>
<hr />
<p>Conceptually, a Wordle-playing program conducts a dialogue between two compu­tational agents: the Umpire and the Player. The Umpire knows the target word, and responds to submitted guess words in much the same way the Wordle app does. It marks each of the five letters in the guess as either <em>correct</em>, <em>present</em>, or <em>absent</em>, corresponding to the Wordle color codes of green, gold, and gray.</p>
<p>The Player component of the program does <em>not</em> know the target word, but it has access to the lists of common and arcane words. On each turn, the Player selects a word from one of these lists, submits it to the Umpire, and receives feedback classifying each of the letters as <em>correct</em>, <em>present</em>, or <em>absent</em>. This infor­mation can then be used to help choose the next guess word. The guessing process continues until the Player identifies the target word or exhausts its six turns.</p>
<p>Here’s a version of such a program. Type in a start word and a target word, then press <em>Go</em>. Briefly displayed in gray letters are the words the program evaluates as possible next guesses. The most promising candidate is then submitted to the Umpire and displayed with the green-gold-gray color code.</p>
<p>Program 1.
</p>
<p class="undent">Feel free to play with the buttons below the grid. The “<code>?</code>” button will pop up a brief explanation. If you’d like to peek behind the curtain, the source code for the project is available <a href="https://github.com/bit-player/thewordler">on GitHub</a>. Also, a <a href="http://bit-player.org/extras/wordler/">standalone version</a> of the program may be more convenient if you’re reading on a small screen.</p>
<p>This program is surely not the best possible Wordler, but it’s pretty good. Most puzzle instances are solved in three or four guesses. Failures to finish within six guesses are uncommon if you choose a sensible starting word. The algorithms behind Program 1 will be the main subject of this essay, but before diving into them I would like to consider some simpler approaches to playing the game.</p>
<hr />
<p>When I first set out to write a Wordler program, I chose the easiest scheme I could think of. At the start of a new game, the Player chooses a word at random from the list of 2,315 potential target words. (The arcana will not be needed in this program.) After submitting this randomly chosen word as a first guess, the Player takes the Umpire’s feedback report and uses it to sift through the list of potential targets, retaining those words that are still viable candidates and setting aside all those that conflict in some way with the feedback. The Player then selects another word at random from among the surviving candidates, and repeats the process. On each round, the list of candidates shrinks further.</p>
<p>The winnowing of the candidate list is the heart of the algorithm. Suppose the first guess word is COULD, and the Umpire’s evaluation is equivalent to this Wordle markup: <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/COULD-with-coloring.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="COULD colored gray, gold, gray, green, gray" border="0" />. You can now go through the list of candidate words and discard all those that have a letter other than L in the fourth position. You can also eliminate all words that include any instance of the letters C, U, or D.  The gold letter O rules out all words in two disjoint classes: those that <em>don’t</em> have an O anywhere in their spelling, and those that <em>do</em> have an O in the second position. After this winnowing process, only seven words remain as viable candidates.</p>
<p>One aspect of these rules often trips me up when I’m playing. Wordle is not Wheel of Fortune: The response to a guess word might reveal that the target word has an L, but it doesn’t necessarily show you <em>all</em> the Ls. If you play COULD and get the feedback displayed above, you should not assume that the green L in the fourth position is the <em>only</em> L. The target word could be ATOLL, HELLO, KNOLL, or TROLL. (When both the guess and the target words have multiple copies of the same letter, the rules get even trickier. If you want to know the gory details, see <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_2">Note 2</a>.)</p>
<p>The list-winnowing process is highly effective. Even with a randomly chosen starter word, the first guess typically eliminates more than 90 percent of the target words, leaving only about 220 viable candidates, on average. In subsequent rounds the shrinkage is not as rapid, but it’s usually enough to identify a unique solution within the allotted six guesses.</p>
<p>I wrote the random Wordler as a kind of warmup exercise, and I didn’t expect much in the way of performance. Plucking words willy-nilly from the set of all viable candidates doesn’t sound like the shrewdest strategy. However, it works surprisingly well. The graph below shows the result of running the program on each of the 2,315 target words, with the experiment repeated 10,000 times to reduce statistical noise.</p>
<p>Figure 2.Guess criterion: random<br />Guess pool: remaining target words<br />Start word: randomly chosen<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/graphWordleRandomly_1000.svg" height="" width="" alt="Bar chart showing the results of running the WordleRandomly algorithm 1,000 times on the data set of 2,315 target words." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">The average number of guesses needed to find the solution is 4.11, and only 2 percent of the trials end in failure (requiring seven or more guesses).</p>
<p>Incidentally, this result is quite robust, in the sense that the outcome doesn’t depend at all on the composition of the words on the target list. If you replace the official Wordle list with 2,315 strings of random letters, the graph looks the same.</p>
<p>The surprising strength of a random player might be taken as a sign that Wordle isn’t really a very hard game. If you are guided by a single, simple rule—play any word that hasn’t already been excluded by feedback from prior guesses—you will win most games. From another point of view the news is not so cheering: If a totally mindless strategy can often solve the puzzle in four moves, you may have to work really hard to do substantially better.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still another lesson might be drawn from the success of the random player: The computer’s complete ignorance of English word patterns is not a major handicap and might even be an advantage. A human player’s judgment is biased by ingrained knowledge of differences in word frequency. If I see the partial solution BE _ _ _, I’m likely to think first of common words such as BEGIN and BENCH, rather than the rarer BELLE and BEZEL. In the Wordle list of potential targets, however, each of these words occurs with exactly the same frequency, namely 1/2315. A policy favoring common words over rare ones is not helpful in this game.</p>
<p>But a case can be made for a slightly different strategy, based on a preference not for common words but for common letters. A guess word made up of high-frequency letters should elicit more information than a guess consisting of rare letters. By definition, the high-frequency letters are more likely to be present in the target word. Even when they are absent, that fact becomes valuable know­ledge. If you make JIFFY your first guess and thereby learn that the target word does not contain a J, you eliminate 27 candidates out of 2,315. Playing EDICT and learning that the target has no E rules out 1,056 words.</p>
<p>The table below records the number of occurrences of each letter from A to Z in all the Wordle target words, broken down according to position within the word. For example, A is the first letter of 141 target words, and Z is the last letter of four words.</p>
<p>Figure 3.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/table-of-letter-frequencies.png" height="182" width="640" alt="Table of letter frequencies by position in the data set of target words." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">The same information is conveyed in the heatmap below, where lighter colors indicate more common letters.</p>
<p>Figure 4.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/letterFreqHeatmapcrop.svg" height="" width="640" alt="Heat map representing letter frequencies as a range of colors from deep purple (lowest frequencies) through bright yellow (highest frequencies." border="0" class="alignleft" /></p>
<p class="indent">These data form the basis of another Wordle-playing algorithm. Given a list of candidate words, we compute the sum of each candidate’s letter frequencies, and select the word with the highest score. For example, the word SKUNK gets 366 points for the initial S, then 10 points for the K in the second position, and so on through the rest of the letters for an aggregate score of 366 + 10 + 165 + 182 + 113 = 836. SKUNK would win over KOALA, which has a score of 832, but lose to PIGGY (851).</p>
<p>Testing the letter-frequency algorithm against all 2,315 target words yields this distribution of results:</p>
<p>Figure 5.Guess criterion: maximize letter frequency<br />Guess pool: remaining target words<br />Start word: determined by algorithm (SLATE)<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/graphWordlePositionalFreq.svg" height="" width="" alt="Bar chart showing the results of running the Wordle algorithm based on positional letter frequencies on the data set of 2,315 target words." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">The mean number of guesses is 3.83, noticeably better than the random-choice average of 4.11. The failure rate—words that aren’t guessed within six turns—is pushed down to 1.1 percent (28 out of 2,315).</p>
<p>There’s surely room for improvement in the letter-frequency algorithm. One weakness is that it treats the five positions in each word as independent variables, whereas in reality there are strong correlations between each letter and its neighbors. For example, the groups CH, SH, TH, and WH are common in English words, and Q is constantly clinging to U. Other pairs such as FH and LH are almost never seen. These attractions and repulsions between letters play a major role in human approaches to solving the Wordle puzzle (or at least they do in <em>my</em> approach). The letter-frequency program could be revised to take advantage of such knowledge, perhaps by tabulating the frequencies of bigrams (two-letter combinations). I have not attempted anything along these lines. Other ideas hijacked my attention.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like other guessing games, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows">Bulls and Cows</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf">Mastermind</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_questions">Twenty Questions</a>, Wordle is all about acquiring the information needed to unmask a hidden answer. Thus if you’re looking for guidance on playing the game, an obvious place to turn is the body of knowledge known as information theory, formulated 75 years ago by Claude Shannon.</p>
<p>Shannon’s most important contribution (in my opinion) was to establish that information is a quantifiable, measurable substance. The unit of measure is the <em>bit</em>, defined as the amount of information needed to distinguish between two equally likely outcomes. If you flip a fair coin and learn that it came up heads, you have acquired one bit of information.</p>
<p>This scheme is easy to apply to the game of Twenty Questions, where the questions are required to have just two possible answers—yes or no. If each answer conveys one bit of information, 20 questions yield 20 bits, which is enough to distinguish one item among \(2^{20} \approx 1\) million equally likely possibilties. In general, if a collection of things has \(N\) members, then the quantity of information needed to distinguish one of its members is the base-2 logarithm of \(N\), written \(\log_2 N\).</p>
<p>In Wordle we ask no more than six questions, but answers are not just yes or no. Each guess word is a query submitted to the Umpire, who answers by coloring the letter tiles. There are more than two possible answers; in fact, there are 243 of them. As a result, a Wordle guess has the potential to yield much more than one bit of information. But there’s also the possibility of getting <em>less</em> than one bit.</p>
<p>Where does that curious number 243 come from? In the Umpire’s response to a guess, each letter is assigned one of three colors, and there are five letters in all. Hence the set of all possible responses has \(3^5 = 243\) members. Here they are, in all their poly­chrome glory:</p>
<p>Figure 6.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tableau_of_color_codes1.svg" height="" width="900" alt="Tableau of color codes" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">These color codes represent every feedback message you could ever possibly receive when playing Wordle. (And then some! The five codes outlined in pink can never occur. <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_2">Note 2</a> explains why.) Each color pattern can be represented as a five-digit numeral in ternary (base-3) notation, with the digit 0 signifying <em>gray</em> or <em>absent</em>, 1 indicating <em>gold</em> or <em>present</em>, and 2 corresponding to <em>green</em> or <em>correct</em>. Because these are five-digit numbers, I’ve taken to calling them Zip codes. The all-gray 00000 code at the upper left appears in the Wordle grid when your guess has no letters in common with the target word. A solid-green 22222, at the bottom right, marks the successful conclusion of a game. In the middle of the grid is the all-gold 11111, which is reserved for “deranged anagrams”: Also OCEAN CANOE, REGAL GLARE, and NIGHT THING.pairs of words composed of the same letters but all in different positions, such as BOWEL and ELBOW, or BRUTE and TUBER.</p>
<p>When you play a guess word in Wordle, you can’t know in advance which of the 243 Zip codes you’ll receive as feedback, but you can know the spectrum of possibilities for that particular word. Program 2, <a href="https://github.com/bit-player/wordlespectrum.git">Source code</a> on GitHub.below, displays the spectrum graphically. When you enter a five-letter guess word, the program will pair it with each of the 2,315 target words and show how many of the pairings fall into each of the Zip-code categories.</p>
<p>Program 2.
</p>
<p>Each of the slender bars that grow from the baseline of the chart represents a single Zip-code, from all-gray at the far left, through all-gold in the middle, and on to all-green at the extreme right. The coloring of the bars interpolates between gray, gold, and green, based on the number of tiles with the corresponding color, but ignoring the position of those tiles within the word. Thus codes such as <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/01122-Zip-code.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 0.0px;" height="16" width="85" alt="01122 Zip code" border="0" /> and <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/21021-Zip-code.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 0.0px;" height="16" width="85" alt="21021 Zip code" border="0" /> get the same color in the bar chart.The height of each bar indicates (on a loga­rithmic scale) how often the guess receives the corresponding color code. If you hover the mouse pointer over a bar, the five letters in the tiles at the top of the display will be colored accordingly. (The meaning of the notations that appear in the “Statistics” box will be explained below.)</p>
<p>The pattern of short and tall bars in Program 2 is something like an atomic spectrum for Wordle queries. Each guess word generates a unique pattern. A word like MOMMY or JIFFY yields a sparse distribution, with a few very tall bars and wide empty spaces between them. The sparsest of all is QAJAQ (a word on the arcane list that seems to be a variant spelling of KAYAK): All but 18 of the 243 Zip codes are empty. Words such as SLATE, CRANE, TRACE, and RAISE, on the other hand, produce a dense array of shorter bars, like a lush carpet of grass, where most of the categories are occupied by at least one target word.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can these spectra help us solve Wordle puzzles? Indeed they can! The guiding principle is simple: Choose a guess word that has a “flat” spectrum, distributing the target words uniformly across the 243 Zip codes. The ideal is to divide the set of candidate words into 243 equal-size subsets. Then, when the Umpire’s feedback singles out one of these categories for further attention, the selected Zip code is sure to have relatively few occupants, making it easier to determine which of those occupants is the target word. In this way we maximize the expected information gain from each guess.</p>
<p>This advice to spread the target words broadly and thinly across the space of Zip codes may seem obvious and in no need of further justification. If you feel that way, read on. Those who need persuading (as I did) should consult <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_3">Note 3</a>. </p>
<p>The ideal of distributing words with perfect uniformity across the Wordle spectrum is, lamentably, unattainable. None of the 12,972 available query words achieves this goal. The spectra all have lumps and bumps and bare spots. The best we can do is choose the guess that comes closest to the ideal. But how are we to gauge this kind of closeness? What mathematical criterion should we adopt to compare those thousands of spiky spectra?</p>
<p>Information theory again waves its hand to volunteer an answer, promising to measure the number of bits of information one can expect to gain from any given Wordle spectrum. The tool for this task is an equation that appeared in Shannon’s 1948 paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” I have taken some liberties with the form of the equation, adapting it to the peculiarities of the Wordle problem and also trying to make its meaning more transparent. For the mathematical details see <a href="http://bit-player.org/2022/words-for-the-wordle-weary#note_4">Note 4</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the equation in my preferred format:</p>
<p>\[H_w = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\n_i \ne 0}}^{242} \frac{n_i}{m} (\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i) .\]</p>
<p class="undent">\(H_w\), the quantity we are computing, is the amount of information we can expect to acquire by playing word \(w\) as our next guess. According to an <a href="http://www.eoht.info/page/Neumann-Shannon%20anecdote">oft-told tale</a>, Shannon adopted the term <em>entropy</em> at the suggestion of John von Neumann, who pointed out that “no one knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.” The letter \(H\) (which might be a Greek Eta) was introduced by Ludwig Boltzmann.Shannon named this quantity <em>entropy</em>, in analogy with the measure of disorder in physics. A Wordle spectrum has higher entropy when the target words are more broadly dispersed among the Zip codes.</p>
<p>On the righthand side of the equation we sum contributions from all the occupied Zip codes in \(w\)’s Wordle spectrum. The index \(i\) on the summation symbol \(\Sigma\) runs from 0 to 242 (which is 00000 to 22222 in ternary notation), enumerating all the Zip codes in the spectrum. The variable \(n_i\) is the number of target words assigned to Zip code \(i\), and \(m\) is the total number of target words included in the spectrum. At the start of the game, \(m = 2{,}315\), but after each guess it gets smaller.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the expression in parentheses. Here \(\log_2 m\) is the amount of information—the number of bits—needed to distinguish the target word among all \(m\) candidates. Likewise \(\log_2 n_i\) is the number of bits needed to pick out a single word from among the \(n_i\) words in Zip code \(i\). The difference between these quantities, \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i\), is the amount of information we gain if Zip code \(i\) turns out to be the correct choice—if it harbors the target word and is therefore selected by the Umpire. </p>
<p>Perhaps a numerical example will help make all this clearer. If \(m = 64\), we have \(\log_2 m = 6\): It would take 6 bits of information to single out the target among all 64 candidates. If the target is found in Zip code \(i\) and \(n_i = 4\), we still need \(\log_2 4 = 2\) bits of information to pin down its identity. Thus in going from \(m = 64\) to \(n_i = 4\) we have gained \(6 - 2 = 4\) bits of information.</p>
<p>So much for what we stand to gain if the target turns out to live in Zip code \(i\). We also have to consider the probability of that event. Intuitively, if there are more words allocated to a Zip code, the target word is more likely to be among them. The probability is simply \(n_i / m\), the fraction of all \(m\) words that land in code \(i\). Hence \(n_i / m\) and \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i\) act in opposition. Piling more words into Zip code \(i\) increases the probability of finding the target there, but it also increases the difficulty of isolating the target among the \(n_i\) candidates.</p>
<p>Each Zip code makes a contribution to the total expected information gain; the contribution of Zip code \(i\) is equal to the product of \(n_i / m\) and \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i\). Summing the contributions coming from all 243 categories yields \(H_w\), the amount of information we can expect to gain from playing word \(w\).</p>
<p>In case you find programming code more digestible than either equations or words, here is a JavaScript function for computing \(H_w\). The argument <code>spectrum</code> is an array of 243 numbers representing counts of words assigned to all the Zip codes.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function entropy(spectrum) {
  const nzspectrum = spectrum.filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 0);
  const m = sum(spectrum);
  let H = 0;
  for (let n of spectrum) {
    H += n/m * (log2(m) - log2(n));
  }
  return H;
}
</code></pre>
<p class="undent">In Program 2, this code calculates the entropy value labeled \(H\) in the Statistics panel. The same function is invoked in Program 1 when the “Maximize entropy” algorithm is selected.</p>
<p>Before leaving this topic behind, it’s worth pausing to consider a few special cases. If \(n_i = 1\) (<em>i.e.</em>, there’s just a single word in Zip code \(i\)), then \(\log_2 n_i = 0\), and the information gain is simply \(\log_2 m\); we have acquired all the information we need to solve the puzzle. This result makes sense: If we have narrowed the choice down to a single word, it has to be the target. Now suppose  \(n_i = m\), meaning that all the candidate words have congregated in a single Zip code. Then we have \(\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i = 0\), and we gain nothing by choosing word \(w\). We had \(m\) candidates before the guess, and we still have \(m\) candidates afterward.</p>
<p>What if \(n_i = 0\)—that is, Zip code \(i\) is empty? The base-2 logarithm is defined by the equation \(2^{\lambda} = N\), where \(\lambda\) is the logarithm of \(N\). But there is no number \(\lambda\) such that \(2^{\lambda} = 0\).That’s trouble, because the logarithm of 0 is undefined, and attempting to calculate it in a computer program will raise an error signal. In the entropy equation the subscript \(n_i \ne 0\) excludes all empty Zip codes from the summation. In the JavaScript function the expression <code>spectrum.filter(x =&gt; x &gt; 0)</code> does the same thing. This exclusion does no harm because if \(n_i\) is zero, then \(n_i / m\) is also zero, meaning there’s no chance that category \(i\) holds the winner. (If a Zip code has no words at all, it can’t have the winning word.)</p>
<p>\(H_w\) attains its maximum value when all the \(n_i\) are equal. As mentioned above, there’s no word \(w\) that achieves this ideal, but we can certainly calculate how many bits such a word would produce if it did exist. In the case of a first guess, each \(n_i\) must equal \(2315 / 243 \approx 9.5\), and the total information gain is \(\log_2 2315 - \log_2 9.5 \approx 7.9\) bits. This is an upper bound for a Wordle first guess; it’s the most we could possibly get out of the process, even if we were allowed to play any arbitrary string of five letters as a guess. As we’ll see below, no real guess gains as much as six bits.</p>
<hr />
<p>These mathematical tools of information theory suggest a simple recipe for a Wordle-playing computer program. At any stage of the game the word to play is the one that elicits the most information about the target. We can estimate the information yield of each potential guess by computing its Wordle spectrum and applying the \(H_w\) equation to the resulting sequence of numbers. That’s what the JavaScript code below does.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function maxentropy(guesswordlist, targetwordlist) {
	maxH = 0
	bestguessword = ""
	for (g in guesswordlist) {      // outer loop
		spectrum = []
		for t in targetwordlist {   // inner loop
			zipcode = score(g, t)
			spectrum(zipcode) += 1
		}
		H = entropy(spectrum)
		if (H &gt; maxH) {
			maxH = H
			bestguessword = g
		}
	}
	return bestguessword
}</code></pre>
<p class="undent">In this function the outer loop visits all the guess words; then for each of these words the inner loop sifts through all the potential target words, constructing a spectrum. When the spectrum for guess word <code>g</code> is complete, the <code>entropy</code> procedure computes the information <code>H</code> to be gained by playing word <code>w</code>. The <code>maxH</code> and <code>bestguessword</code> variables keep track of the best results seen so far, and ultimately <code>bestguessword</code> is returned as the result of the function.</p>
<p>This procedure can be applied at any stage of the Wordling process, from the first guess to the last. When choosing the first guess—the word to be entered in the blank grid at the start of the game—all 2,315 common words are equally likely potential targets. We also have 12,972 guess words to consider, drawn from both the common and arcane lists. Calculating the information gain for each such starter word reveals that the highest score goes to SOARE, at 5.886 bits. (SOARE is apparently either a variant spelling of SORREL, a reddish-brown color, or an obsolete British term for a young hawk.) ROATE, a variant of ROTE, and RAISE are not far behind.  At the bottom of the list is the notorious QAJAQ, providing just 1.892 bits of information.</p>
<p>Adopting SOARE as a starter word, we can then play complete games of Wordle with this algorithm, recording the number of guesses required to find all 2,315 target words. The result is a substantial improvement over the random and the letter-frequency methods.</p>
<p>Figure 7.Guess criterion: maximize entropy<br />Guess pool: common and arcane<br />Start word: SOARE<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/maxH_performance_soare.svg" height="" width="" alt="MaxH performance soare" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>The average number of guesses per game is down to about 3.5, and almost 96 percent of all games are won in either three or four guesses. Only one target word requires six guesses, and there are no lost games, requiring seven or more guesses. As a device for Wordling, Shannon’s information theory is quite a success!</p>
<hr />
<p>Shannon’s entropy equation was explicitly designed for the function it performs here—finding the distribution with maximum entropy. But if we consider the task more broadly as looking for the most widely dispersed and most nearly uniform distribution, other approaches come to mind. For example, a statistician might suggest variance or standard deviation as an alternative to Shannon entropy. The standard deviation is defined as:</p>
<p>\[\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_i (n_i - \mu)^2}{N}},\]</p>
<p class="undent">where \(\mu\) is the average of the \(n_i\) values and \(N\) is the number of values. In other words, we are measuring how far the individual elements of the spectrum differ from the average value. If the target words were distributed uniformly across all the Zip codes, every \(n_i\) would be equal to \(\mu\), and the standard deviation \(\sigma\) would be zero. A large \(\sigma\) indicates that many \(n_i\) differ greatly from the mean; some Zip codes must be densely populated and others empty or nearly so. Our goal is to find the guess word whose spectrum has the smallest possible standard deviation.</p>
<p>In the Wordling program, it’s an easy matter to substitute minimum standard deviation for maximum entropy as the criterion for choosing guess words. The JavaScript code looks like this:In this case we <em>don’t</em> exclude empty Zip codes. Doing so would badly skew the results. A spectrum with all words crowded into a single Zip code would have \(\sigma = 0\), making it seem the most—rather than the least—desirable configuration.</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code>function stddev(spectrum) {
  const mu = sum(spectrum) / 243;
  const diffs = spectrum.map(x =&gt; x - mu);
  const variance = sum(diffs.map(x =&gt; x * x)) / 243;
  return Math.sqrt(variance);
}</code></pre>
<p> In Program 1, you can see the standard deviation algorithm in action by selecting the button labeled “Minimum std dev.” In Program 2, standard deviation values are labeled \(\sigma\) in the Statistics panel.</p>
<p>Testing the algorithm with all possible combinations of a starting word and a target word reveals that the smallest standard deviation is 22.02, and this figure is attained only by the spectrum of the word ROATE. Not far behind are RAISE, RAILE, and SOARE. At the bottom of the list, the worst choice by this criterion is IMMIX, with \(\sigma = 95.5\).</p>
<p>Using ROATE as the steady starter word, I ran a full set of complete games, surveying the standard-deviation program’s performance across all 2,315 target words. I was surprised at the outcome. Although the chart looks somewhat different—more 4s, fewer 3s—the average number of guesses came within a whisker of equalling the max-entropy result: 3.54 vs. 3.53. Of particular note, there are fewer words requiring five guesses, and a few more are solved with just two guesses.</p>
<p>Figure 8.Guess criterion: minimize standard deviation<br />Guess pool: common and arcane<br />Start word: ROATE<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/minStdDevLong_roate.svg" height="" width="" alt="Bar chart showing the percent of Wordle puzzles solved in n guesses, for n=1 through n=7+, using minimum standard deviation to choose guesses." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">Why was I surprised by the strength of the standard-deviation algorithm? Well, as I said, Shannon’s \(H\) equation is a tool designed specifically for this job. Its mathematical underpinnings assert that no other rule can extract information with greater efficiency. That property seems like it ought to promise superior performance in Wordle. Standard deviation, on the other hand, is adapted to problems that take a different form. In particular, it is meant to measure dispersion in distributions with a normal or Gaussian shape. There’s no obvious reason to expect Wordle spectra to follow the normal law. Nevertheless, the \(\sigma\) rule is just as successful in choosing winners.</p>
<hr />
<p>Following up on this hint that the max-entropy algorithm is not the only Wordle wiz, I was inspired to try a rule even simpler than standard deviation. In this algorithm, which I call “max scatter,” we choose the guess word whose spectrum has the largest number of occupied Zip codes. In other words, we count the bars that sprout up in Program 2, but we ignore their height. In the Statistics panel of Program 2, the max-scatter results are designated by the letter \(\chi\) (Greek chi), which I chose by analogy with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function">indicator function of set theory</a>. In Program 1, choose “Maximize scatter” to Wordle this way.</p>
<p>If we adopt the \(\chi\) standard, the best first guess in Wordle is TRACE, which scatters target words over 150 of the 243 Zip codes. Other strong choices are CRATE and SALET (148 codes each) and SLATE and REAST (147). The bottom of the heap is good ole QAJAQ, with 18.</p>
<p>Using TRACE as the start word and averaging over all target words, the performance of the scatter algorithm actually exceeds that of the max-entropy program. The mean number of guesses is 3.49. There are no failures requiring 7+ guesses, and only one target word requires six guesses.</p>
<p>Figure 9.Guess criterion: maximize scatter<br />Guess pool: common and arcane<br />Start word: TRACE<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/maxScatterLong_trace.svg" height="" width="" alt="Bar chart showing the percent of Wordle puzzles solved in n guesses, for n=1 through n=7+, using maximum scatter to choose guesses." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">What I find most noteworthy about these results is how closely the programs are matched, as measured by the average number of guesses needed to finish a game. It really looks as if the three criteria are all equally good, and it’s a matter of indifference which one you choose. This (tentative) conclusion is supported by another series of experiments. Instead of starting every game with the word that appears best for each algorithm, I tried generating random pairs of start words and target words, and measured each program’s performance for 10,000 such pairings. Having traded good start words for randomly selected ones, it’s no surprise that performance is somewhat weaker across the board, with the average number of guesses hovering near 3.7 instead of 3.5. But all three algorithms continue to be closely aligned, with figures for average outcome within 1 percent. And in this case it’s not just the averages that line up; the three graphs look very similar, with a tall peak at four guesses per game.</p>
<p>Figure 10.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/randompair_10000_comparison.svg" height="" width="900" alt="Three bar charts showing the percent of Wordle puzzles solved in n guesses, for n=1 through n=7+, with random pairs of start words and target words. From left to right the charts show results for max entropy, min standard deviation, and max scatter." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">As I looked at these results, it occurred to me that the programs might be so nearly interchangeable for a trivial reason: because they are playing identical games most of the time. Perhaps the three criteria are similar enough that they often settle on the same sequence of guess words to solve a given puzzle. This <em>does</em> happen: There are word pairs that elicit exactly the same response from all three programs. It’s not a rare occurrence. But there are also plenty of examples like the trio of game grids in Figure 11, where each program discovered a unique pathway from FALSE to VOWEL.</p>
<p>Figure 11.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/false-vowel-comparison.svg" height="" width="640" alt="Comparison of Wordle trajectories for the starting word FALSE and the target word VOWEL with three algorithms: max entropy, min standard deviation, max scatter." border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">A few further experiments show that the three programs arrive at three distinct solutions in about 35 percent of random games; in the other 65 percent, at least two of the three solutions are identical. In 20 percent of the cases all three are alike. Figure 12.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/unique_unanimous_graph.svg" height="" width="" alt="Unique unanimous graph" border="0" class="alignright" />Figure 12 shows the relevant statistics for a sample of 5,000 games with random pairings of start and target words. (The notation \(H =\sigma =\chi\) refers to outcomes in which all programs yield the same result. In \(H \ne\sigma \ne\chi\) the three solutions are all distinct. The other three bars count individual pairwise matches.) The result for \(\sigma = \chi\) is a curiosity I don’t understand. It seems those two programs almost never agree unless \(H\) also concurs.</p>
<p>I puzzled over these observations for some time. If the algorithms discover wholly different paths through the maze of words, why are those paths so often the same length? I now have a clue to an answer, but it may not be whole story, and I would welcome alternative explanations.</p>
<hr />
<p>My mental model of what goes on inside a Wordling program runs like this: The program computes the spectrum of each word to be considered as a potential guess, then computes some function—\(H\), \(\sigma\), or \(\chi\)—that reduces the spectrum to a single number. The number estimates the expected quality or efficiency of the word if it is taken as the next guess in the game. Finally we choose the word that either maximizes or minimizes this figure of merit (the word with largest value of \(H\) or \(\chi\), or the smallest value of \(\sigma\)).</p>
<p>So far so good, but there’s an unstated assumption in that scheme: I take it for granted that evaluating the spectra will always yield a single, unique extreme value of \(H\), \(\sigma\), or \(\chi\). What happens if two words are tied for first place? One could argue, of course, that if the words earn the same score, they must be equally good choices, and we should pick one of them at random or by some arbitrary rule. Even if there are three or four or a dozen co-leaders, the same reasoning should apply. But when there are two thousand words all tied for first place, I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>Can such massive traffic jams at the finish line actually happen in a real game of Wordle? At first I didn’t even consider the possibility. When I rated all possible starting words for the Shannon max-entropy algorithm, the ranking turned out to be a total order: In the list of 12,792 words there were no ties—no pairs of words whose spectra have the same \(H\) value. Hence there’s no ambiguity about which word is best, as measured by this criterion.</p>
<p>But this analysis applies only to the opening play—the choice of a first guess, when all the common words are equally likely to be the target. In the endgame the situation is totally different. Suppose the list of 2,315 common words has been whittled down to just five viable candidates for Wordle-of-the-day. When the five target words are sorted into Zip-code categories and the entropy of these patterns is calculated (excluding empty Zip codes), there are only seven possible outcomes, as shown in Figure 13. The patterns correspond to the seven ways of partitioning the number 5 (namely 5, 4+1, 3+2, 3+1+1, 2+2+1, 2+1+1+1, and 1+1+1+1+1).</p>
<p>Figure 13.The bars in these graphs could be rearranged in various ways, but the \(H\), \(\sigma\), and \(\chi\) measures give the same result for all permutations. <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/spectra_of_five_words.svg" height="" width="" alt="Spectra of five words" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">In this circumstance, the 12,972 guess words cannot all have unique values of \(H\). On the contrary, with only seven distinct values to go around, there must be thousands of tie scores in the ranking of the words. Thus the max-entropy algorithm cannot pick a unique winner; instead it assembles a large class of words that, from the program’s point of view, are all equally good choices. Which of those words ultimately becomes the next guess is more or less arbitrary. For the most part, my programs pick the one that comes first in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>The same arguments apply to the minimum-standard-deviation algorithm. As for the max-scatter function, that has numerous tied scores even when the number of candidates is large. Because the variable \(\chi\) takes on integer values in the range from 1 to 243 (and in practice never strays outside the narrower range 18 to 150), there’s no avoiding an abundance of ties.</p>
<p>The presence of all these co-leaders offers an innocent explanation of how the three algorithms might arrive at solutions that are different in detail but generally equal in quality. Although the programs pick different words, those words come from the same equivalence class, and so they yield equally good outcomes.</p>
<p>But a doubt persists. Can it really be true that hundreds or thousands of words are all equally good guesses in some Wordle positions?  Can you choose any one of those words and expect to finish the game in the same number of plays?</p>
<p>Let’s go back to Figure 11, where the maximum-entropy program follows the opening play of FALSE with DETER and then BINGO. Some digging through the entrails of the program reveals that BINGO is not the uniquely favored guess at this point in the progress of the game; VENOM, VINYL, and VIXEN are tied with BINGO at \(H = 3.122\) bits. The program chooses BINGO simply because it comes first alphabetically. As it happens, the choice is an unfortunate one. Any of the other three words would have concluded the game more quickly, in four guesses rather than five.</p>
<p>Does that mean we now have unequivocal evidence that the program is suboptimal? Not really. At the stage of the game where BINGO was chosen, there were still 10 viable possibilities for the target word. The true target might have been LIBEL, for example, in which case BINGO would have been superior to VENOM or VIXEN.</p>
<hr />
<p>Human players see Wordle as a word game. What else could it be? To solve the puzzle you scour the dusty corners of your vocabulary, searching for words that satisfy certain constraints or fit a given template. You look for patterns of vowels and consonants and other curious aspects of English orthography. </p>
<p>For the algorithmic player, on the other hand, Wordle is a numbers game. What counts is maximizing or minimizing some mathematical function, such as entropy or standard deviation. The words and letters all but disappear. </p>
<p>The link between words and numbers is the Umpire’s scoring rule, with the spectrum of Zip codes that comes out of it. Every possible combination of a guess word and a target word gets reduced to a five-digit ternary number. Instead of computing each of these numbers as the need arises, we can precompute the entire set of Zip codes and store it in a matrix. The content of the matrix is determined by the letters of the words we began with, but once all the numbers have been filled in, we can dispense with the words themselves. Operations on the matrix depend only on the numeric indices of the columns and rows. We can retrieve any Zip code by a simple table lookup, without having to think about the coloring of letter tiles. </p>
<p>In exploring this matrix, let’s set aside the arcana for the time being and work only with common words. With 2,315 possible guesses and the same number of possible targets, we have \(2{,}315^2 \approx 5.4\) million pairings of a guess and a target. Each such pairing gets a Zip code, which can be represented by a decimal integer in the range from 0 to 242. Because these small numbers fit in a single byte of computer memory, the full matrix occupies about five-and-a-half megabytes.</p>
<p>Figure 14 is a graphic representation of the matrix. Each column corresponds to a guess word, and each row to a target word. The words are arranged in alphabetical order from left to right and top to bottom. The matrix element where a column intersects a row holds the Zip code for that combination. The color scheme is the same as in Program 2. The main diagonal (upper left to lower right) is a bright green stripe because each word when played against itself gets a score of 22222, equivalent to five green tiles. The blocks of lighter green all along the diagonal mark regions where guess words and target words share the same first letter and hence have scores with at least one green tile. The largest of these blocks is for words beginning with the letter S. A few other blocks are quite tiny, reflecting the scarcity of words beginning with J, K, Q, Y, and Z. A box for X is lacking entirely; the Wordle common list has no words beginning with X.</p>
<p>Figure 14.Mouseover to magnify<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/score_matrix_HSL2.png" height="900" width="900" alt="Score matrix HSL2" border="0" class="centered withLoupe" /></p>
<p class="indent">Gazing deeply into the tweedy texture of Figure 14 reveals other curious structures, but some features are misleading. The matrix appears to be symmetric across the main diagonal: The point at (<em>a, b</em>) always has the same color as the point at  (<em>b, a</em>). But the symmetry is an artifact of the graphic presentation, where colors are assigned based only on the <em>number</em> of gray, gold, and green tiles, ignoring their positions within a word. The underlying mathematical matrix is not symmetric.</p>
<p>I first built this matrix as a mere optimization, a way to avoid continually recomputing the same Zip codes in the course of a long series of Wordle games. But I soon realized that the matrix is more than a technical speed boost. It encapsulates pretty much everything one might want to know about the entire game of Wordle.</p>
<p>Figure 15 presents a step-by-step account of how matrix methods lead to a Wordle solution. In the first stage <em>(upper left)</em> the player submits an initial guess of SLATE, which singles out column 1778 in the matrix (1778 being the position of SLATE in the alphabetized list of common words). The second stage <em>(upper right)</em> reveal’s the Umpire’s feedback, coloring the tiles as follows: <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SLATE_colored_for_FIRST_10010.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="SLATE with gold tiles at S and T, gray elsewhere" border="0" />. To the human solver this message would mean: “Look for words that have an S (but not in front) and a T (but not in fourth position).” To the computer program the message says: “Look for rows in the matrix whose 1778th entry is equal to 10010 (base 3) or 84 (base 10). It turns out there are 24 rows meeting this condition, which are highlighted in blue. (Some lines are too closely spaced to be distinguished.) I have labeled the highlighted rows with the words they represent, but the labels are for human consumption only; the program has no need of them.</p>
<p>Figure 15.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/matrix_solution_four_stages_900px.svg" height="" width="895" alt="Matrix solution four stages 900px" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>In the third panel <em>(lower left)</em>, the program has chosen a second guess word, TROUT, which earns the feedback <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/TROUT-colored-for-FIRST-01002.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="TROUT with a gold tiles at R and a green tile for the final T" border="0" />. I should mention that this is not a word I would have considered playing at this point in the game. The O and U make sense, because the first guess eliminated A and E and left us in need of a vowel; but the presence of two Ts seems wasteful. We already know the target word has a T, and pinning down where it is seems less important than identifying the target word’s other constituent letters. I might have tried PROUD here. Yet TROUT is a brilliant move! It eliminates 7 words that start with T, 12 words that don’t have an R, 17 words that have either an O or a U or both, and 4 words that don’t end in T. In the end only one word remains in contention: FIRST.</p>
<p>All this analysis of letter positions goes on only in my mind, not in the algorithm. The computational process is simpler. The guess TROUT designates column 2118 of the matrix. Among the 24 rows identified by the first guess, SLATE, only row 743 has the Zip code value 01002 (or 29 decimal) at its intersection with column 2118. Row 743 is the row for FIRST. Because it is the only remaining viable candidate, it must be the target word, and this is confirmed when it is played as the third guess <em>(lower right)</em>. </p>
<p>There’s something disconcerting—maybe even uncanny—about a program that so featly wins a word game while ignoring the words. Indeed, you can replace all the words in Wordle with utter gibberish—with random five-letter strings like SCVMI, AHKZB, and BOZPA—and the algorithm will go on working just the same. It has to work a little harder—the average number of guesses is near 4—but a human solver would find the task almost impossible.</p>
<p>The square matrix of Figure 14 includes only the common words that serve as both guesses and targets in Wordle. Including the arcane words expands the matrix to 12,972 columns, with a little more than 30 million elements. At low resolution this wide matrix looks like this:</p>

<hr />
<p>Commentators on Wordle have given much attention to the choice of a first guess: the start word, the sequence of letters you type when facing a blank grid. At this point in the game you have no clues of any kind about the composition of the target word; all you know is that it’s one of 2,315 candidates. Because this list of candidates is the same in every game, it seems  there might be one universal best starter word—an opening play that will lead to the smallest average number of guesses, when the average is taken over all the target words. Furthermore, because 2,315 isn’t a terrifyingly large number, a brute-force search for that word might be within the capacity of a less-than-super computer.</p>
<p>Start-word suggestions from players and pundits are a mixed lot. A website called <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/22884031/wordle-game-tips-best-first-guess-5-letter-words">Polygon</a> offers some whimsical ideas, such as FARTS and OUIJA. GameRant also has oddball options, including JUMBO and ZAXES. <a href="https://medium.com/@tglaiel/the-mathematically-optimal-first-guess-in-wordle-cbcb03c19b0a">Tyler Glaiel</a> offers better advice, reaching deep into the arcana to come up with SOARE and ROATE. Grant Sanderson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA">skillfully deduces</a> that CRANE is the best starter, then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg">takes it all back</a>.</p>
<p>For each of the algorithms I have mentioned above (except the random one) the algorithm itself can be pressed into service to suggest a starter. For example, if we apply the max-entropy algorithm to the entire set of potential guess words, it picks out the one whose spectrum has the highest \(H\) value. As I’ve already noted, that word is SOARE, with \(H = 5.886\). Table 1 gives the 15 highest-scoring choices, based on this kind of analysis, for the max-entropy, min–standard deviation and max-scatter algorithms.</p>

<p>Perusing these lists reveals that they all differ in detail, but many of the same words appear on two or more lists, and certains patterns turn up everywhere. A disproportionate share of the words have the letters A, E, R, S, and T; and half the alphabet never appears in any of the lists.</p>
<p>Figure 17 looks at the distribution of starter quality ratings across the entire range of potential guess words, both common and arcane. The 12,972 starters have been sorted from best to worst, as measured by the max-entropy algorithm. The plot gives the number of bits of information gained by playing each of the words as the initial guess, in each case averaging over all 2,315 target words. </p>
<p>Figure 17.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/first_round_starter_rankings_maxH.svg" height="" width="" alt="First round starter rankings maxH" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>The peculiar shape of the curve tells us something important about Wordling strategies. A small subset of words in the upper left corner of the graph make exceptionally good starters. In the first round of play they elicit almost six bits of information, which is half of what’s needed to finish the game. At the other end of the curve, a slightly larger cohort of words produce really awful results as starters, plunging down to the 1.8 bits of QAJAQ. In between these extremes, the slope of the curve is gradual, and there are roughly 10,000 words that don’t differ greatly in their performance.</p>
<p>These results might be taken as the last word on first words, but I would be a cautious about that. The methodology makes an implicit “greedy” assumption: that the strongest first move will always lead to the best outcome in the full game. It’s rather like assuming that the tennis player with the best serve will always win the match. Experience suggests otherwise. Although a strong start is usually an advantage, it’s no guarantee of victory.</p>
<p>We can test the greedy assumption in a straightforward if somewhat laborious way: For each proposed starter word, we run a complete set of 2,315 full games—one for each of the target words—and we keep track of the average number of guesses needed to complete a game. Playing 2,315 games takes a few minutes for each algorithm; doing that for 12,792 starter words exceeds the limits of my patience. But I have compiled full-game results for 30 starter words, all of them drawn from near the top of the first-round rankings. </p>
<p>Table 2 gives the top-15 results for each of the algorithms. Comparing these lists with those of Table 1 reveals that first-round supremacy is not in fact a good predictor of full-game excellence. None of the words leading the pack in the first-move results remain at the head of the list when we measure the outcomes of complete games.</p>

<p class="indent">What’s the lesson here? Do I recommend that when you get up in the morning to face your daily Wordle, you always start the game with REAST or TRACE or SALET or one of the other words near the top of these lists? That’s not <em>bad</em> advice, but I’m not sure it’s the <em>best</em> advice. One problem is that each of these algorithms has its own favored list of starting words. Your own personal Wordling algorithm—whatever it may be—might respond best to some other, idiosyncratic, set of starters.</p>
<p>Moreover, my spouse, who Wordles and <a href="https://www.quordle.com/#/">Quordles</a> and <a href="https://octordle.com/">Octordles</a> and <a href="https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html">Absurdles</a>, reminds me gently that it’s all a game, meant to be fun, and some people may find that playing the same word day after day gets boring.</p>
<p>Figure 18 presents the various algorithms at their shiny best, each one using the starter word that brings out its best performance. For comparison I’ve also included my own Wordling record, based on 126 games I’ve played since January. I’m proud to say that I Wordle better than a random number generator.</p>

<hr />
<p>I turn now from the opening move to the endgame, which I find the most interesting part of Wordle—but also, often, the most frustrating. It seems reasonable to say that the endgame begins when the list of viable targets has been narrowed down to a handful, or when most of the letters in the target are known, and only one or two letters remain to be filled in.</p>
<p>Occasonally you might find yourself entering the endgame on the very first move. There’s the happy day when your first guess comes up all green—an event I have yet to experience. Or you might have a close call, such as playing the starter word EIGHT and getting this feedback: <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EIGHT-scored-4green.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="EIGHT scored 4green" border="0" />. Having scored four green letters, it looks like you’ve got an easy win. With high hopes, you enter a second guess of FIGHT, but again you get the same four greens and one gray. So you type out LIGHT next, and then MIGHT. After two more attempts, you are left with this disappointing game board:</p>
<p>Figure 19.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/the-IGHT-catastrophe.png" height="" width="200" alt="The IGHT catastrophe" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>What seemed like a sure win has turned into a wretched loss. You have used up your six turns, but you’ve not found the Wordle-of-the-day. Indeed, there are still three candidate targets yet to be tried: SIGHT, TIGHT, and WIGHT. </p>
<p>The _ IGHT words are by no means the only troublemakers. Similar families of words match the patterns _ ATCH, _ OUGH, _ OUND, _ ASTE and _ AUNT. You can get into even deeper endgame woes when an initial guess yields three green tiles. For example, 12 words share the template S_ _ ER, 25  match _ O_ ER, and 29 are consistent with _ A_ ER. </p>
<p>These sets of words are challenging not only for the human solver but also, under some circumstances, for Wordling algorithms. In Program 1, choose the word list “Candidates only” and then try solving the puzzle for target words such as FOYER, WASTE, or VAUNT. Depending on your starter word, you are likely to see the program struggle through several guesses, and it may fail to find the answer within six tries.</p>
<p>The “Candidates only” setting requires the program to choose each guess from the set of words that have not yet been excluded from consideration as the possible target. For example, if feedback from an earlier guess has revealed that the target ends in T and has an I, then every subsequent guess must end in T and have an I. (Restricting guesses to candidates only is similar to the Wordle app’s “hard mode” setting, but a little stricter.)</p>
<p>Compelling the player to choose guesses that might be winners doesn’t seem like much of a hardship or handicap. However, trying to score a goal with every play is seldom the best policy. Other guesses, although they can’t possibly be winners, may yield more information.</p>
<p>An experienced and wordly-wise human Wordler, on seeing the feedback <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EIGHT-scored-4green.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="EIGHT scored 4green" border="0" />, would know better than to play for an immediate win. The prudent strategy is play a word that promises to reveal the identity of the one missing letter. Here’s an example of how that works.</p>
<p>Figure 20.
</p><div style="display: flex; padding: 20px 0px;">
<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EIGHT_FLOWN_WIGHT.png" style="padding: 0px 0px;" height="240" width="200" alt="EIGHT FLOWN WIGHT" border="0" /><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EIGHT_FLOWN_MARSH_SIGHT.png" style="padding: 0px 0px;" height="240" width="200" alt="EIGHT FLOWN MARSH SIGHT" border="0" /><img width="200" alt="EIGHT FLOWN MARSH TIGHT" src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/EIGHT_FLOWN_MARSH_TIGHT.png" border="0" height="240" />
</div>
<p>At left the second-guess FLOWN detects the presence of a W, which means the target can only be WIGHT. In the middle, FLOWN reveals only absences, but the further guess MARSH finds an S, which implies the target must be SIGHT. At right, the second and third guesses have managed to eliminate F, L, W, N, M, R, and S as initial letters, and all that’s left is the T of TIGHT.</p>
<p>This virtuoso performance is not the work of some International Grand­master of Wordling. It is produced by the max-entropy algorithm, when the program is allowed a wider choice of potential guesses. The standard-deviation and max-scatter algorithms yield identical results. There is no special logic built into any of these programs for deciding when to play to win and when to hunker down and gather more information. It all comes out of the Zip code spectrum: FLOWN and MARSH are the words that maximize \(H\) and \(\chi\), and that minimize \(\sigma\). And yet, when you watch the game unfold, it looks mysterious or magical.</p>
<hr />
<p>The cautious strategy of accumulating intelligence before committing to a line of play yields better results on average, but it comes with a price. All of the best algorithms achieve their strong scores by reducing the number of games that linger for five or six rounds of guessing. However, those algorithms also reduce the number of two-guess games, an effect that has to be counted as collateral damage. Two-guess triumphs make up less than 3 percent of the games played by the Zip code–based programs. Contrast that with the letter-frequency algorithm: In most respects it is quite mediocre, but it wins more than 6 percent of its games in two guesses. And among my personal games, 7 percent are two-guess victories. (I don’t say this to brag; what it suggests is that my style of play is a tad reckless.)</p>
<p>The Zip code–based programs would have even fewer two-guess wins without a heuristic that improves performance in a small fraction of cases. Whenever the list of candidate target words has dwindled down to a length of two, there’s no point in seeking more information to distinguish between the two remaining words. Suppose that after the first guess you’re left with the words SWEAT and SWEPT as the only candidates. For your second guess you could play a word such as ADEPT, where either the A or the P would light up to indicate which candidate is the target. You would then have a guaranteed win in three rounds. But if you simply played one of the candidate words as your second guess, you would have a 50 percent chance of winning in two rounds, and otherwise would finish in three, for an average score of 2.5.</p>
<p>This heuristic is already implemented in the programs discussed above. It makes a noticeable difference. Removing it from the max-entropy program drops the number of two-guess games from 51 down to 35 (out of 2,315). </p>
<p>Can we go further with this idea? Suppose there are three candidates left as you’re preparing for the second round of guessing. The cautious, information-gathering strategy would bring consistent victory on the third guess. Playing one of the candidates leads to a game that lasts for two, three, or four turns, each with probability one-third, so the average is again three guesses. The choice appears to be neutral. In practice, playing one of the candidates brings a tiny improvement in average score—too tiny to be worth the bother. </p>
<p>Another optimization says you should always pick one of the remaining candidates for your sixth guess. Gathering additional information is pointless in this circumstance, because you’ll never have a chance to use it. However, the better algorithms almost never reach the sixth guess, so this measure has no payoff in practice.</p>
<p>Apart from minor tricks and tweaks like these, is there any prospect of building significantly better Wordling programs? I have no doubt that im­provement is possible, even though all my own attempts to get better results have failed miserably. </p>
<p>Getting to an average performance of 3.5 guesses per game seems fairly easy; getting much beyond that level may require new ideas. My impression is that existing methods work well for choosing the first guess and perhaps the second, but are less effective in closing out the endgame. When the number of candidates is small, the Zip code–based algorithms cannot identify a single best next guess; they merely divide the possibilities into a few large classes of better and worse guesses. We need finer means of discrimination. We need tiebreakers.</p>
<p>I’ll briefly mention two of my failed experiments. I thought I would try going beyond the Zip code analysis and computing for each combination of a guess word and a potential target word how much the choice would shrink the list of candidates. After all, the point of the game is to shrink that list down to a single word. But the plague of multitudinous ties afflicts this algorithm too. Besides, it’s computationally costly.</p>
<p>Another idea was to bias the ranking of the Zip code spectra, favoring codes that have more gold and green letter tiles, on the hypothesis that we learn more when a letter is present or correct. The hypothesis is disproved! Even tiny amounts of bias are detrimental.</p>
<p>My focus has been on reducing the average number of guesses, but maybe there are other goals worth pursuing. For example, can we devise an algorithm that will solve every Wordle with no more than four guesses? It’s not such a distant prospect. Already there are algorithms that exceed four guesses only in about 2 percent of the cases. </p>
<p>Perhaps progress will come from another quarter. I’ve been expecting someone to put one of the big machine-learning systems to work on Wordle. All I’ve seen so far is a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00557">small-scale study</a>, based on the technique of reinforcement learning, done by Benton J. Anderson and Jesse G. Meyer. Their results are not impressive, and I am led to wonder if there’s something about the problem that thwarts learning techniques just as it does other algorithmic approaches.</p>
<p>Wordle falls into the class of combinatorial word games. All you need to know is how letters go together to make a word; meaning is beside the point. Most games of this kind are highly susceptible to computational <em>force majeure</em>. A few lines of code and a big word list will find exhaustive solutions in milliseconds. For example, another New York <em>Times</em> game called Spelling Bee asks you to make words out of seven given letters, with one special letter required to appear in every word. I’m not very good at Spelling Bee, but my computer is an ace. The same code would solve the Jumble puzzles on the back pages of the newspaper. With a little more effort the program could handle Lewis Carroll’s Word Links (better known today as Don Knuth’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder">Word Ladders</a>). And it’s a spiffy tool for cheating at Scrabble.</p>
<p>In this respect Wordle is different. One can easily write a program that plays a competent game. Even a program that chooses words at random can turn in a respectable score. But this level of proficiency is nothing like the situation with Spelling Bee or Jumble, where the program utterly annihilates all competition, leaving no shred of the game where the human player could cling to claims of supremacy. In Wordle, every now and then I beat my own program. How can that happen, in this day and age?</p>
<p>The answer might be as simple and boring as computational complexity. If I want my program to win, I’ll have to invest more CPU cycles. Or there might be a super-clever Wordle-wrangling algorithm, and I’ve just been too dumb to find it. Then again, there might be something about Wordle that sets it apart from other combinatorial word games. That would be interesting.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<h3 id="note_1">Note 1. History of the game and of the word lists.</h3>
<p>The charming story of Wordle’s creation was told last January in the New York <em>Times</em>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">“Wordle Is a Love Story”</a> read the headline. Josh Wardle, a software developer formerly at Reddit, created the game as a gift to his partner, Palak Shah, a fan of word games. The <em>Times</em> story, written by Daniel Victor, marvelled at the noncommercial purity of the website: “There are no ads or flashing banners; no windows pop up or ask for money.” Three weeks later the <em>Times</em> bought the game, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/media/new-york-times-wordle.html">commenting in its own pages</a>, “The purchase . . . reflects the growing importance of games, like crosswords and Spelling Bee, in the company’s quest to increase digital subscriptions to 10 million by 2025.” So much for love stories.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, the new owners have not fiddled with the rules of the game, but there have been a few revisions to the word lists. Here’s a summary based on changes observed between February and May.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p class="undent">Six words were removed from the list of common words (a.k.a. target words), later added to the list of arcane words, then later still removed from that list as well, so that they are no longer valid as either a guess or a target:</p>
<p>AGORA, PUPAL, LYNCH, FIBRE, SLAVE, WENCH</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p class="undent">Twenty-two words were moved from various positions in the common words list to the end of that list (effectively delaying their appearance as Wordle-of-the-day until sometime in 2027):</p>
<p>BOBBY, ECLAT, FELLA, GAILY, HARRY, HASTY, HYDRO, </p>
<p>LIEGE, OCTAL, OMBRE, PAYER, SOOTH, UNSET, UNLIT, </p>
<p>VOMIT, FANNY, FETUS, BUTCH, STALK, FLACK, WIDOW, </p>
<p>AUGUR</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p class="undent">Two words were moved forward from near the end of the common list to a higher position where they replaced FETUS and BUTCH:</p>
<p>SHINE, GECKO</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p class="undent">Two words were removed from the arcane list and not replaced:</p>
<p>KORAN, QURAN</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p class="indent">Almost all the changes to the common list affect words that would have been played at some point in 2022 if they had been left in place. I expect further purges when the editors get around to vetting the rest of the list. </p>
<h3 id="note_2">Note 2. The Umpire’s scoring rule.</h3>
<p>When I first started playing Wordle, I had a simple notion of what the tile colors meant. If a tile was colored green, then that letter of the guess word appeared in the same position in the target word. A gold tile meant the letter would be found elsewhere in the target word. A gray tile indicated the letter was entirely absent from the target word. For my first Wordler program I wrote a procedure implementing this scheme, although its output consisted of numbers rather than colors: green = 2, gold = 1, gray = 0.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function scoreGuess(guess, target)
	score = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
	for i in 1:5
		if guess[i] == target[i]
			score[i] = 2
		elseif occursin(guess[i], target)
			score[i] = 1
		end
	end
	return score
end</code></pre>
<p class="indent">This rule and its computer implementation work correctly as long as we never apply them to words with repeated letters. But suppose the target word is MODEM and you play the guess MUDDY. Following the rule above, the Umpire would offer this feedback: <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MUDDY-20210.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="MUDDY scored 2 0 2 1 0, or green gray green gold gray" border="0" />. Note the gold coloring of the second D. It’s the correct marking according to the stated rule, because the target word has a D not in the fourth position. But that D in MODEM is already “spoken for”; it is matched with the green D in the middle of MUDDY. The gold coloring of the second D could be misleading, suggesting that there’s another D in the target word.</p>
<p>The Wordle app would color the second D gray, not gold: <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MUDDY-20200.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="MUDDY scored 2 0 2 0 0, or green gray green gray gray" border="0" />. The rule, apparently, is that each letter in the target word can be matched with only one letter in the guess word. Green matches take precedence.</p>
<p>There remains some uncertainty about which letter gets a gold score when there are multiple options. If MUDDY is the target word and ADDED is the guess word, we know that middle D will be colored green, but which of the other two Ds in ADDED gets a gold tile? I have not been able to verify how the Wordle app handles this situation, but my program assigns priority from left to right: <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ADDED-01200.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="ADDED scored 0 1 2 0 0, or gray gold green gray gray" border="0" />.</p>
<p>This minor amendment to the rules brings a considerable cost in complexity to the code. We need an extra data structure (the array <code>tagged</code>) and an extra loop. The first loop (with index <code>i</code>) finds and marks all the green matches; the second loop (indices <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>) identifies gold tiles that have not been preempted by earlier green or gold matches. </p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function scoreGuess(guess, target)
  score  = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  tagged = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  for i in 1:5
    if guess[i] == target[i]
      score[i] = 2
      tagged[i] = 2
    end
  end
  for j in 1:5
    for k in 1:5
      if guess[j] == target[k] &amp;&amp; score[j] == 0 &amp;&amp; tagged[k] == 0
        score[j] = 1
        tagged[k] = 1
      end
    end
  end
  return score
end</code></pre>
<p>It is this element of the scoring rules that forbids Zip codes such as <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/four_green_one_gold.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="Zip code 2 2 2 2 1, colored green green green green gold" border="0" /> and its permutations in Figure 6. Under the naive rules, the guess STALL played against the target STALE would have been scored <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/STALL-22221.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="STALL scored 2 2 2 2 1, or green green green green gold" border="0" />. The refined rule renders it as <img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/STALL-22220.png" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: bottom; margin-bottom: 3.5px;" height="20" width="" alt="STALL scored 2 2 2 2 0, or green green green green gray" border="0" />.</p>
<h3 id="note_3">Note 3. The virtues of a uniform distribution.</h3>
<p>Let’s think about a game that’s simpler than Wordle, though doubtless less fun to play. You are given a deck of 64 index cards, each with a single word written on it; one of the words, known only to the Umpire, is the target. Your instructions are to “cut” the deck, dividing it into two heaps. Then the all-seeing Umpire will tell you which heap includes the target word. For the next round of play, you set aside the losing heap, and divide the winning heap into two parts; again the Umpire indicates which pile holds the winning word. The process continues until the heap approved by the Umpire consists of a single card, which must necessarily be the target. The question is: How many rounds of play will it take to reach this decisive state?</p>
<p>If you always divide the remaining stack of cards into two <em>equal</em> heaps, this question is easy to answer. On each turn, the number of cards and words remaining in contention is cut in half: from 64 to 32, then on down to 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. It takes six halvings to resolve all uncertainty about the identity of the target. This bisection algorithm is a central element of information theory, where the fundamental unit of measure, the <em>bit</em>, is defined as the amount of information needed to choose between two equally likely alternatives. Here the choices are the two heaps of equal size, which have the same probability of holding the target word. When the Umpire points to one heap or the other, that signal provides exactly one bit of information. To go all the way from 64 equally likely candidates to one identified target takes six rounds of guessing, and six bits of information.</p>
<p>Bisection is known to be an optimal strategy for many problem-solving tasks, but the source of its strength is sometimes misunderstood. What matters most is not that we split the deck into <em>two</em> parts but that we divide it into <em>equal</em> subsets. Suppose we cut a pack of 64 cards into four equal heaps rather than two. When the Umpire points to the pile that includes the target, we get twice as much information. The search space has been reduced by a factor of four, from 64 cards to 16. We still need to acquire a total of six bits to solve the problem, but because we are getting two bits per round, we can do it in three splittings rather than six. In other words, we have a tradeoff between more simple decisions and fewer complex decisions.</p>
<p>Figure 21 illustrates the nature of this tradeoff by viewing a decision process as traversing a tree from the root node (at the top) to one of 16 leaf nodes (at the bottom). For the binary tree on the left, finding your way from the root to a leaf requires making four decisions, in each case choosing one of two paths. In the quaternary tree on the right, only two decisions are needed, but there are four options at each level. Assuming a four-way choice “costs” twice as much as a two-way choice, the information content is the same in both cases: four bits.</p>
<p>Figure 21.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/trees_binary_and_quad.svg" height="" width="" alt="Trees binary and quad" border="0" class="align-center" /></p>
<p class="indent">But what if we decide to split the deck unevenly, producing a larger and a smaller heap? For example, a one-quarter/three-quarter division would yield a pile of 16 cards on the left and 48 cards on the right. If the target happens to lie in the smaller heap, we are better off than we would be with an even split: We’ve gained two bits of information instead of one, since the search space has shrunk from 64 cards to 16. However, the probability of this outcome is only 1/4 rather than 1/2, and so our expected gain is only one bit. When the target card is in the larger pile, we acquire less than one bit of information, since the search space has fallen from 64 cards only as far as 48, and the probability of this event is 3/4. Averaging across the two possible outcomes,  the loss outweighs the gain.</p>
<p>Figure 22 shows the information budget for every possible cut point in a deck of 64 cards. The red curves labeled <em>left</em> and <em>right</em> show the number of bits obtained from each of the two piles as their size varies. (The <em>x</em> axis labels the size of the left pile; wherever the left pile has \(n\) cards, the right pile has \(64 - n\).) The overarching green curve is the sum of the left and right values. Note that the green curve has its peak in the center, where the deck has been split into two equal subsets of 32 cards each. This is the optimum strategy.</p>
<p>Figure 22.The equation for the left curve is \(y = (n/m)(\log_2 m - \log_2 n)\), where \(m = 64\) and \(n\) is the size of the left subset. For the right curve, substitute \(m - n\) for \(n\).<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/plot_of_info_from_unequal_subsets.svg" height="" width="" alt="Plot of info from unequal subsets" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="indent">I have made this game go smoothly by choosing 64 as the number of cards in the deck. Because 64 is a power of 2, you can keep dividing by 2 and never hit an odd number until you come to 1. With decks of other sizes the situation gets messy; you can’t always split the deck into two equal parts. Nevertheless, the same principles apply, with some compromises and approx­imations. Suppose we have a deck of 2,315 cards, each inscribed with one of the Wordle common words. (The deck would be about two feet high.) We repeatedly split it as close to the middle as possible, allowing an extra card in one pile or the other when necessary. Eleven bisections would be enough to distinguish one card out of \(2^{11} = 2{,}048\), which falls a little short of the goal. With 12 bisections we could find the target among \(2^{12} = 4{,}096\) cards, which is more than we need. There’s a mathematical function that interpolates between these fenceposts: the base-2 logarithm. Specifically, \(\log_2 2{,}315\) is about 11.18, which means the amount of information we need to solve a Wordle puzzle is 11.18 bits. (Note that \(2^{11.18} \approx 2315\). Of the 2,315 positions where the target card might lie within the deck, 1,783 are resolved in 11 bisections, and 532 require a 12th cut.)</p>
<h3 id="note_4">Note 4. Understanding the Shannon entropy equation.</h3>
<p>The foundational document of information theory, Claude Shannon’s 1948 paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication,” gives the entropy equation is this form:</p>
<p>\[H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i .\]</p>
<p class="undent">The equation’s pedigree goes back further, to Josiah Willard Gibbs and Ludwig Boltzmann, who introduced it in a different context, the branch of physics called statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>Over the years I’ve run into this equation many times, but I do not count it among my close friends. Whenever I come upon it, I have to stop and think carefully about what the equation means and how it works. The variable \(p_i\) represents a probability. We are asked to multiply each \(p_i\) by the logarithm of \(p_i\), then sum up the products and negate the result. Why would one want to do such a thing? What does it accomplish? How do these operations reveal something about entropy and information?</p>
<p class="indent">When I look at the righthand side of the equation, I see an expression of the general form \(n \log n\), which is a familiar trope in several areas of mathematics and computer science. It generally denotes a function that grows faster than linear but slower than quadratic. For example, sorting \(n\) items might require \(n \log n\) comparison operations. (For any \(n\) greater than 2, \(n \log_2 n\) lies between \(n\) and \(n^2\).) </p>
<p>That’s <em>not</em> what’s going on here. Because \(p\) represents a probability, it must lie in the range \(0 \le p \le 1\). The logarithm of a number in this range is negative or at most zero. This gives \(p \log p\) a different complexion. It also draws attention to that weird minus sign hanging out in front of the summation symbol.</p>
<p class="indent">I believe another form of the equation is easier to understand, even though the transformation introduces more bristly mathematical notation. Let’s begin by moving the minus sign from outside to inside the summation, attaching it to the logarithmic factor:</p>
<p>\[H = \sum_{i} p_i (-\log_2 p_i) .\]</p>
<p class="undent">The rules for logarithms and exponents tell us that \(-\log x = \log x^{-1}\), and that \(x^{-1} = 1/x\). We can therefore rewrite the equation again as</p>
<p> \[H = \sum_{i} p_i \log_2 \frac{1}{p_i} .\]</p>
<p>Now the nature of the beast becomes a little clearer. Figure 23.<img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/graph_of_p_log_1overp1.svg" style="margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;" height="" width="275" alt="Graph of p log 1overp" border="0" class="alignright" />The factors \(p\) and \(\log (1/p)\) pull in opposite directions. If you make \(p\) larger, you make \(\log (1/p)\) smaller, and vice versa. At both extremes of the allowed range, near \(p = 0\) and \(p = 1\), the value of \(p \log (1/p)\) approaches 0. In between these limits, \(p \log (1/p)\) is always positive, and should have a maximum for some value of \(p\). Figure 23 shows that this is true. It’s no coincidence that the curve has the same form as one of those in Figure 22. (If you’re curious about the location of the peak, I’ll give you a hint: It lies where \(p\) is equal to the reciprocal of a famous number.)</p>
<p>We can now bring in some of the particulars of the Wordle problem. The probability \(p_i\) is in fact the probability that the target word is found in Zip code \(i\). Note that \(n_i / m\) has the proper behavior for a probability. It always lies between 0 and 1, and the sum of \(n_i / m\) for all \(i\) is equal to 1.This probability is equal to \(n_i / m\), where \(n_i\) is the number of words assigned to Zip code \(i\), and \(m\) is the total number of words in all the Zip codes. Making the substitutions \(p_i \rightarrow n_i / m\) and \(1 / p_i \rightarrow m / n_i\), we get the new equation</p>
<p> \[H = \sum_{i} \frac{n_i}{m} \log_2 \frac{m}{n_i} .\]</p>
<p>And now for the final transformation. The laws of logarithms state that \(\log x/y\) is equal to \(\log x - \log y\), so we can rewrite the Shannon equation as</p>
<p>\[H = \sum_{i} \frac{n_i}{m} (\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i) .\]</p>
<p class="undent">In this form the equation is easy to relate to the problem of solving a Wordle puzzle. The quantity \(\log_2 m\) is the total amount of information (measured in bits) that we need to acquire in order to identify the target word; \(\log_2 n_i\) is the amount of information we will still need to ferret out if Zip code \(i\) turns out the hold the target word. The difference of these two quantities is what we gain if the target is in Zip code \(i\). The coefficient \(n_i / m\) is the probability of this event.</p>
<p>One further emendation is needed. The logarithm function is undefined at 0, as \(\log x\) diverges toward negative infinity as \(x\) approaches 0 from above. Thus we have to exclude from the summation all terms with \(n_i = 0\). We can also fill in the limits of the index \(i\).</p>
<p>\[H = \sum_{\substack{i = 1\\n_i \ne 0}}^{242} \frac{n_i}{m} (\log_2 m - \log_2 n_i) \]</p>
<p>Shannon’s discussion of the entropy equation is oddly diffident. He introduces it by listing a few assumptions that the \(H\) function should satisfy, and then asserting as a theorem that \(H = -\Sigma p \log p\) is the only equation meeting these requirements. In an appendix to the 1948 paper he proves the theorem. But he also goes on to write, “This theorem, and the assumptions required for its proof, are in no way necessary for the present theory [<em>i.e.</em>, information theory]. It is given chiefly to lend a certain plausibility to some of our later definitions.” I’m not sure what to make of Shannon’s cavalier dismissal of his own theorem, but in the case of Wordle analysis he seems to be right. Other measures of dispersion work just as well as the entropy function.</p></div>

In logarithmic spirals, the pitch angle is constant, in Archimedean spirals it decreases with radius, and in hyperbolic spirals it increases. All three are used as models of galaxies. But real galaxies have more varied pitch angles that do not match these models.</p>

    <p>Does anyone understand why this continued fraction has such a big term? Equivalently, why do powers of \(\pi\) seem to have unusually good rational approximations?</p>

    <p>Relatedly, I reviewed (but did not significantly edit) another new Good Article, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_runner_conjecture">Lonely runner conjecture</a>, on the unproven conjecture that for \(n\) runners moving at different linear speeds around a circular track, each runner will eventually be far from all other runners.</p>

    <p>When I was an undergrad, I had a job on campus as a DECsystem-20 systems programmer <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108376805535251788">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>).</span> So when my colleague Rich Pattis announced that, in preparation for his impending retirement, he was clearing out his office and giving away, among other things, the PDP-10 front console he had rescued from the trash pile of another university, I jumped at the opportunity. Here it is, atop one of my office bookshelves. Note the 36 keys in the front row: its memory was organized into 36-bit words, not bytes.</p>

It involves solving a transcendental equation, so this seemed like a good time to write <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mrs_Miniver%27s_Problem.svg">a script to find the geometry numerically</a> before switching to a graphics editor to color it in.</p>

The trick is that the “random article” button isn’t uniformly random on articles. It tags articles with permanent random numbers in the unit interval, and when pressed picks another random number and looks for the next larger tag. For seldom-viewed articles, most views are random, and the probability of getting a random view is proportional to the length of the gap between an article’s permanent random number and the next smaller one. So the tail of least-viewed articles is dominated by unlucky articles whose gap is small.</p>
