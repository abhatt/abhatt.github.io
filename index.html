intervals. We show that the greedy algorithm computes a permutation $\Pi =
\pi_1, \pi_2,\ldots$ of the intervals that is $3/4$-competitive for any prefix
of $k$ intervals. That is, for any $k$, the intervals $\pi_1 \cup \cdots \cup
\pi_k$ covers at least $3/4$-fraction of the points covered by the optimal
solution using $k$ intervals.
</p>
<p>We also provide an approximation algorithm that, in $O(n + m/\varepsilon)$
time, computes a cover by $(1+\varepsilon)k$ intervals that is as good as the
optimal solution using $k$ intervals, where $n$ is the number of input points,
and $m$ is the number of intervals (we assume here the input is presorted).
</p>
<p>Finally, we show a counter example illustrating that the optimal solutions
for set cover do not have the diminishing return property -- that is, the
marginal benefit from using more sets is not monotonically decreasing.
Fortunately, the diminishing returns does hold for intervals.

is both critical and expensive. Critical, because the quantity and quality of
the training data has a high impact on the performance of the learned function.
Expensive, because most practical cases rely on humans-in-the-loop to label the
data. The process of determining the correct labels is much more expensive than
comparing two items to see whether they belong to the same class. Thus
motivated, we propose a setting for training data gathering where the human
experts perform the comparatively cheap task of answering pairwise queries, and
the computer groups the items into classes (which can be labeled cheaply at the
very end of the process). Given the items, we consider two random models for
the classes: one where the set partition they form is drawn uniformly, the
other one where each item chooses its class independently following a fixed
distribution. In the first model, we characterize the algorithms that minimize
the average number of queries required to cluster the items and analyze their
complexity. In the second model, we analyze a specific algorithm family,
propose as a conjecture that they reach the minimum average number of queries
and compare their performance to a random approach. We also propose solutions
to handle errors or inconsistencies in the experts' answers.

Budgeted Coloring Problem} (\bcp). Given a graph $G$, an integer $c$ and an
ordered list of integers $\{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_c\}$, \bcp asks whether there
exists a proper coloring of $G$ where the $i$-th color is used to color at most
$b_i$ many vertices. This problem generalizes two well-studied graph coloring
problems, {\sc Bounded Coloring Problem} (\bocp) and {\sc Equitable Coloring
Problem} (\ecp) and as in the case of other coloring problems, it is \nph even
for constant values of $c$. So we study \bcp under the paradigm of
parameterized complexity. \begin{itemize}
</p>
<p>\item We show that \bcp is \fpt (fixed-parameter tractable) parameterized by
the vertex cover size. This generalizes a similar result for \ecp and
immediately extends to the \bocp, which was earlier not known.
</p>
<p>\item We show that \bcp is polynomial time solvable for cluster graphs
generalizing a similar result for \ecp. However, we show that \bcp is \fpt, but
unlikely to have polynomial kernel, when parameterized by the deletion distance
to clique, contrasting the linear kernel for \ecp for the same parameter.
</p>
<p>\item While the \bocp is known to be polynomial time solvable on split
graphs, we show that \bcp is \nph on split graphs. As \bocp is hard on
bipartite graphs when $c&gt;3$, the result follows for \bcp as well. We provide a
dichotomy result by showing that \bcp is polynomial time solvable on bipartite
graphs when $c=2$. We also show that \bcp is \nph on co-cluster graphs,
contrasting the polynomial time algorithm for \ecp and \bocp. \end{itemize}
Finally we present an $\mathcal{O}^*(2^{|V(G)|})$ algorithm for the \bcp,
generalizing the known algorithm with a similar bound for the standard
chromatic number.

and $k$-center problems such as: capacitated, fault-tolerant, fair, etc. These
problems fall under a broad framework of constrained clustering. A unified
framework for constrained clustering was proposed by Ding and Xu [SODA 2015] in
context of the $k$-median and $k$-means objectives. In this work, we extend
this framework to the $k$-supplier and $k$-center objectives. This unified
framework allows us to obtain results simultaneously for the following
constrained versions of the $k$-supplier problem: $r$-gather, $r$-capacity,
balanced, chromatic, fault-tolerant, strongly private, $\ell$-diversity, and
fair $k$-supplier problems, with and without outliers. We obtain the following
results: We give $3$ and $2$ approximation algorithms for the constrained
$k$-supplier and $k$-center problems, respectively, with $\mathsf{FPT}$ running
time $k^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $n = |C \cup L|$. Moreover, these
approximation guarantees are tight; that is, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, no
algorithm can achieve $(3-\epsilon)$ and $(2-\epsilon)$ approximation
guarantees for the constrained $k$-supplier and $k$-center problems in
$\mathsf{FPT}$ time, assuming $\mathsf{FPT} \neq \mathsf{W}[2]$. Furthermore,
we study these constrained problems in outlier setting. Our algorithm gives $3$
and $2$ approximation guarantees for the constrained outlier $k$-supplier and
$k$-center problems, respectively, with $\mathsf{FPT}$ running time
$(k+m)^{O(k)} \cdot n^{O(1)}$, where $n = |C \cup L|$ and $m$ is the number of
outliers.

modern datacenter networks. State-of-the-art switches with near line rate
computing and aggregation capabilities are developed to enable, e.g.,
acceleration and better utilization for modern applications like big data
analytics, and large-scale distributed and federated machine learning. We
formulate and study the problem of activating a limited number of in-network
computing devices within a network, aiming at reducing the overall network
utilization for a given workload. Such limitations on the number of in-network
computing elements per workload arise, e.g., in incremental upgrades of network
infrastructure, and are also due to requiring specialized middleboxes, or
FPGAs, that should support heterogeneous workloads, and multiple tenants.
</p>
<p>We present an optimal and efficient algorithm for placing such devices in
tree networks with arbitrary link rates, and further evaluate our proposed
solution in various scenarios and for various tasks. Our results show that
having merely a small fraction of network devices support in-network
aggregation can lead to a significant reduction in network utilization.
Furthermore, we show that various intuitive strategies for performing such
placements exhibit significantly inferior performance compared to our solution,
for varying workloads, tasks, and link rates.

solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Its performance monotonically
improves with its depth $p$. We apply the QAOA to MaxCut on large-girth
$D$-regular graphs. We give an iterative formula to evaluate performance for
any $D$ at any depth $p$. Looking at random $D$-regular graphs, at optimal
parameters and as $D$ goes to infinity, we find that the $p=11$ QAOA beats all
classical algorithms (known to the authors) that are free of unproven
conjectures. While the iterative formula for these $D$-regular graphs is
derived by looking at a single tree subgraph, we prove that it also gives the
ensemble-averaged performance of the QAOA on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)
model. Our iteration is a compact procedure, but its computational complexity
grows as $O(p^2 4^p)$. This iteration is more efficient than the previous
procedure for analyzing QAOA performance on the SK model, and we are able to
numerically go to $p=20$. Encouraged by our findings, we make the optimistic
conjecture that the QAOA, as $p$ goes to infinity, will achieve the Parisi
value. We analyze the performance of the quantum algorithm, but one needs to
run it on a quantum computer to produce a string with the guaranteed
performance.

Unfortunately, there exist strong theoretical limits on the performance of any
algorithm for the $k$-means problem on worst-case inputs. To overcome this
barrier, we consider a scenario where "advice" is provided to help perform
clustering. Specifically, we consider the $k$-means problem augmented with a
predictor that, given any point, returns its cluster label in an approximately
optimal clustering up to some, possibly adversarial, error. We present an
algorithm whose performance improves along with the accuracy of the predictor,
even though na\"{i}vely following the accurate predictor can still lead to a
high clustering cost. Thus if the predictor is sufficiently accurate, we can
retrieve a close to optimal clustering with nearly optimal runtime, breaking
known computational barriers for algorithms that do not have access to such
advice. We evaluate our algorithms on real datasets and show significant
improvements in the quality of clustering.

allocation problem where a decision maker accepts or rejects incoming customer
requests irrevocably in order to maximize expected revenue given limited
resources. At each time, a new order/customer/bid is revealed with a request of
some resource(s) and a reward. We consider a stochastic setting where all the
orders are i.i.d. sampled from an unknown distribution. Such formulation
contains many classic applications such as the canonical (quantity-based)
network revenue management problem and the Adwords problem. Specifically, we
study the objective of providing fairness guarantees while maintaining low
regret. Our definition of fairness is that a fair online algorithm should treat
similar agents/customers similarly and the decision made for similar
individuals should be consistent over time. We define a fair offline solution
as the analytic center of the offline optimal solution set, and propose a fair
algorithm that uses an interior-point LP solver and dynamically detects unfair
resource spending. Our algorithm can control cumulative unfairness (the
cumulative deviation from the online solutions to the offline fair solution) on
the scale of order $O(\log(T))$, while maintaining the regret to be bounded
with dependency on $T$. Our approach do not formulate the fairness requirement
as a constrain in the optimization instance, and instead we address the problem
from the perspective of algorithm design. We get the desirable fairness
guarantee without imposing any fairness constraint, and our regret result is
strong for the reason that we evaluate the regret by comparing to the original
objective value.

Servedio</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14607">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Given a set of $n$ input integers, the Equal Subset Sum problem asks us to
find two distinct subsets with the same sum. In this paper we present an
algorithm that runs in time $O^*(3^{0.387n})$ in the~average case,
significantly improving over the $O^*(3^{0.488n})$ running time of the best
known worst-case algorithm and the Meet-in-the-Middle benchmark of
$O^*(3^{0.5n})$.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm generalizes to a number of related problems, such as the
``Generalized Equal Subset Sum'' problem, which asks us to assign a coefficient
$c_i$ from a set $C$ to each input number $x_i$ such that $\sum_{i} c_i x_i =
0$. Our algorithm for the average-case version of this problem runs in~time
$|C|^{(0.5-c_0/|C|)n}$ for some positive constant $c_0$, whenever $C=\{0, \pm
1, \dots, \pm d\}$ or $\{\pm 1, \dots, \pm d\}$ for some positive integer $d$
(with $O^*(|C|^{0.45n})$ when $|C|&lt;10$). Our results extend to the~problem of
finding ``nearly balanced'' solutions in which the target is a not-too-large
nonzero offset $\tau$.
</p>
<p>Our approach relies on new structural results that characterize the
probability that $\sum_{i} c_i x_i$ $=\tau$ has a solution $c \in C^n$ when
$x_i$'s are chosen randomly; these results may be of independent interest. Our
algorithm is inspired by the ``representation technique'' introduced by
Howgrave-Graham and Joux. This requires several new ideas to overcome
preprocessing hurdles that arise in the representation framework, as well as a
novel application of dynamic programming in the solution recovery phase of the
algorithm.

cryptocurrency. In the Tangle, each block has two parents. As a result, the
blocks do not form a chain, but a directed acyclic graph. In traditional
Blockchain, a new block is appended to the heaviest chain in case of fork. In
the Tangle, the parent selection is done by the Tip Selection Algorithm (TSA).
In this paper, we make some important observations about the security of
existing TSAs. We then propose a new TSA that has low complexity and is more
secure than previous TSAs.

to its elements (vertices and edges) so that adjacent or incident elements have
different colors. The total chromatic number is the smallest integer $k$ for
which the graph $G$ has a $k$-total coloring. Clearly, this number is at least
$\Delta(G)+1$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$. When the lower
bound is reached, the graph is said to be Type~1. The upper bound of
$\Delta(G)+2$ is a central problem that has been open for fifty years, is
verified for graphs with maximum degree 4 but not for regular graphs.
</p>
<p>Most classified direct product of graphs are Type~1. The particular cases of
the direct product of cycle graphs $C_m \times C_n$, for $m =3p, 5\ell$ and
$8\ell$ with $p \geq 2$ and $\ell \geq 1$, and arbitrary $n \geq 3$, were
previously known to be Type 1 and motivated the conjecture that, except for
$C_4 \times C_4$, all direct product of cycle graphs $C_m \times C_n$ with $m,n
\geq 3$ are Type 1.
</p>
<p>We give a general pattern proving that all $C_m \times C_n$ are Type 1,
except for $C_4 \times C_4$. dditionally, we investigate sufficient conditions
to ensure that the direct product reaches the lower bound for the total
chromatic number.

<p>We're in the midst of a great transformation in computing, one where data takes center stage and I predict this will start to have a larger effect on hiring in computer science departments. We'll see a bigger need to grow in data science, particularly machine learning and autonomous systems. Cybersecurity and quantum computing will also grow with a push due to competition with China. Quantum winter might be coming but we're not there yet.</p><p>Harder to predict is the rest of computer science, such as traditional areas like networks, operating systems, programming languages and, yes, theory, particularly theory unrelated to quantum, learning or security. There is still a need for CS departments to grow in these areas, but we may be moving away from a rising tide raising all boats. On the other hand due to the digital transformation of just about everything, non-CS departments are hiring people who look a lot like computer scientists.</p><p>Other factors may cause US universities to be more conservative in hiring such as a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-university-fall-higher-education-men-women-enrollment-admissions-back-to-school-11630948233?st=1oz46jkmsdq8jcq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">drop in male students</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.cupahr.org/issue/feature/higher-ed-enrollment-cliff/">demographic cliff</a>, an unclear future for international students coming to the states, and a lingering COVID budget hangover.</p><p>So go get a job while the going is still good though I would not suggest forgoing a faculty position for a postdoc, particularly if you aren't working in data science.</p><p>I also wonder how the post-COVID world will affect the job search. We'll probably see more virtual interviews than the pre-COVID days at least in the early rounds. It's also harder for students to network and make themselves known at virtual and hybrid conferences which will likely persist for some time.</p><p>Give yourself a good virtual face. Have a well-designed web page with access to all your job materials and papers. Maintain your Google Scholar page. Add yourself to the CRA's <a href="https://cra.org/cv-database/">CV database</a>. Find a way to stand out, perhaps a short video describing your research. </p><p>Best source for finding jobs are the ads from the <a href="https://cra.org/ads/">CRA</a> and the <a href="https://jobs.acm.org/">ACM</a>. For theoretical computer science specific postdoc and faculty positions check out <a href="https://cstheory-jobs.org/">TCS Jobs</a> and <a href="http://dmatheorynet.blogspot.com/">Theory Announcements</a>. If you have jobs to announce, please post to the above and/or feel free to leave a comment on this post. Even if you don't see an ad for a specific school they may still be hiring, check out their website or email someone at the department. You'll never know if you don't ask.</p></div>

<p>In many applications of machine learning, such as machine learning for medical diagnosis, we would like to have machine learning algorithms that do not memorize sensitive information about the training set, such as the specific medical histories of individual patients. Differential privacy is a notion that allows quantifying the degree of privacy protection provided by an algorithm on the underlying (sensitive) data set it operates on. Through the lens of differential privacy, we can design machine learning algorithms that responsibly train models on private data.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-private-machine-learning-algorithms">Why do we need private machine learning algorithms?</h2>

<p>Machine learning algorithms work by studying a lot of data and updating their parameters to encode the relationships in that data. Ideally, we would like the parameters of these machine learning models to encode general patterns (e.g., ‘‘patients who smoke are more likely to have heart disease’’) rather than facts about specific training examples (e.g., “Jane Smith has heart disease”). Unfortunately, machine learning algorithms do not learn to ignore these specifics by default. If we want to use machine learning to solve an important task, like making a cancer diagnosis model, then when we publish that machine learning model (for example, by making an open source cancer diagnosis model for doctors all over the world to use) we might also inadvertently reveal information about the training set. A malicious attacker might be able to inspect the published model’s predictions and learn private information about Jane Smith. For instance, the adversary could mount a membership inference attack to know whether or not Jane Smith contributed her data to the model’s training set [SSS17]. The adversary could also build on membership inference attacks to extract training data by repeatedly guessing possible training points until they result in a sufficiently strong membership signal from the model’s prediction [CTW20]. In many instances, the model itself may be represented by a few of the data samples (e.g., Support Vector Machine in its dual form).</p>

<p>A common misconception is that if a model generalizes (i.e., performs well on the test examples), then it preserves privacy. As mentioned earlier, this is far from being true. One of the main reasons being that generalization is an average case behavior of a model (over the distribution of data samples), whereas privacy must be provided for everyone, including outliers (which may deviate from our distributional assumptions).</p>

<p>Over the years, researchers have proposed various approaches towards protecting privacy in learning algorithms (k-anonymity [SS98], l-diversity [MKG07], m-invariance [XT07], t-closeness [LLV07] etc.). Unfortunately, [GKS08] all these approaches are vulnerable to what are called composition attacks, that use auxiliary information to violate the privacy protection. Famously, this strategy allowed researchers to de-anonymize part of a movie ratings dataset released to participants of the Netflix Prize when the individuals had also shared their movie ratings publicly on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) [NS08]. If Jane Smith had assigned the same ratings to movies A, B and C in the Netflix Prize dataset and publicly on IMDb at similar times, then researchers could link data corresponding to Jane across both datasets. This would in turn give them the means to recover ratings that were included in the Netflix Prize but not on IMDb. This example shows how difficult it is to define and guarantee privacy because it is hard to estimate the scope of knowledge—about individuals—available to adversaries. While the dataset released by Netflix has since been taken down, it is difficult to ensure that all of its copies have been deleted. In recent years, data sample instance encoding based methods like InstaHide [HSL20], and NeuraCrypt [YEO21] have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to such composition attacks as well.</p>

<p>As a result, the research community has converged on differential privacy [DMNS06], which provides the following semantic guarantee, as opposed to ad-hoc approaches: An adversary learns almost the same information about an individual whether or not they are present in or absent from the training data set. In particular, it provides a condition on the algorithm, independent from who might be attacking it, or the specifics of the data set instantiation.  Put another way, differential privacy is a framework for evaluating the guarantees provided by a system that was designed to protect privacy. Such systems can be applied directly to “raw” data which potentially still contains sensitive information, altogether removing the need for procedures that sanitize or anonymize data and are prone to the failures described previously. That said, minimizing data collection in the first place remains a good practice to limit other forms of privacy risk.</p>

<h2 id="designing-private-machine-learning-algorithms-via-differential-privacy">Designing Private Machine Learning Algorithms via Differential Privacy</h2>

<p>Differential privacy [DMNS06] is a semantic notion of privacy that addresses a lot of the limitations of previous approaches like k-anonymity. The basic idea is to randomize part of the mechanism’s behavior to provide privacy. In our case, the mechanism considered is a learning algorithm, but the differential privacy framework can be applied to study any algorithm.</p>

<p>The intuition for why we introduce randomness into the learning algorithm is that it obscures the contribution of an individual, but does not obscure important statistical patterns. Without randomness, we would be able to ask questions like: “What parameters does the learning algorithm choose when we train it on this specific dataset?” With randomness in the learning algorithm, we instead ask questions like: “What is the probability that the learning algorithm will choose parameters in this set of possible parameters, when we train it on this specific dataset?”</p>

<p>We use a version of differential privacy which requires (in our use case of machine learning) that the probability of learning any particular set of parameters stays roughly the same if we change a single data record in the training set. A data record can be a single training example from an individual, or the collection of all the training examples provided by an individual. The former is often referred to as example level/item level privacy, and the latter is referred to as user level differential privacy. While user level privacy provides stronger semantics, it may be harder to achieve. For a more thorough discussion about the taxonomy of these notions, see [DNPR10, JTT18, HR12, HR13]. In this document, for the ease of exposition of the technical results, we focus on the example level notion. This could mean to add a training example, remove a training example, or change the values within one training example. The intuition is that if a single patient (Jane Smith) does not affect the outcome of learning much, then that patient’s records cannot be memorized and her privacy is respected. In the rest of this post, how much a single record can affect the outcome of learning is called the sensitivity of an algorithm.</p>

<p>The guarantee of differential privacy is that the adversary is not able to distinguish the answers produced by the randomized algorithm based on the data of two of the three users from the answers returned by the same algorithm based on the data of all three users. We also refer to the degree of indistinguishability as the privacy loss. Smaller privacy loss corresponds to a stronger privacy guarantee.</p>

<p>It is often thought that privacy is a fundamental bottleneck in obtaining good prediction accuracy/generalization for machine learning algorithms. In fact, recent research has shown that in many instances it actually helps in designing algorithms with strong generalization ability. Some of the examples where DP has resulted in designing better learning algorithms are Online linear predictions [KV05] and online PCA [DTTZ13]. Notably, [DFH15] formally showed that generalization for any DP learning algorithm comes for free. More concretely, if a DP learning algorithm has good training accuracy, it is guaranteed to have good test accuracy.
This is true because differential privacy itself acts as a very strong form of regularization.</p>

<p>One might argue that the generalization guarantee which a DP algorithm can achieve may be sub-par to that of its non-private baselines. For a large class of learning tasks, one can show that asymptotically DP does not introduce any further error beyond the inherent statistical error [SSTT21]. [ACG16,BFTT19] highlights that in the presence of enough data, a DP algorithm can get arbitrarily close to the inherent statistical error, even under strong privacy parameters.</p>

<h2 id="private-empirical-risk-minimization">Private Empirical Risk Minimization</h2>

<p>Before we go into the design of specific differentially private learning algorithms, we first formalize the problem setup, and standardize some notation. Consider a training data set \(D={(x_1,y_1),…,(x_n,y_n)}\) drawn i.i.d. from some fixed (unknown) distribution \(\Pi\), with the feature vector being \(x_i\) and label/response being \(y_i\). We define the training loss at any model \(\theta\) as \(L_{train} (\theta, D) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} l(\theta; (x_i, y_i))\), and the corresponding test loss as \(L_{test} (\theta) = E_{(x,y) \sim \Pi} l(\theta;(x,y)) \).
We will design DP algorithms to output models that approximately minimize the test loss while having access only to the training loss.</p>

<p>In the literature, there are a variety of approaches towards designing these DP learning algorithms [CMS11, KST12, BST14, PAE16, BTT18]. One can categorize them broadly as: i) algorithms that assume that the individual loss function \(l(\theta;\cdot) \) is convex in the model parameter  to ensure differential privacy, ii) algorithms that are differentially private even when the loss function is non-convex in nature (e.g., deep learning models), and iii) model agnostic algorithms, that do not require any information about the representation of the model \(\theta\), or the loss function \(l(\theta;\cdot) \). In our current discussion, we will only focus on designing algorithms for (ii), and (iii). This is because it turns out that the best known algorithms for (ii) are already competitive to algorithms that are specific for (i) [INS19].</p>

<h2 id="private-algorithms-for-training-deep-learning-models">Private Algorithms for Training Deep Learning Models</h2>

<p>The first approach, due to SCS13, BST14, and ACG16, is named differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). It proposes to modify the model updates computed by the most common optimizer used in deep learning: stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Typically, stochastic gradient descent trains iteratively. At each iteration, a small number of training examples (a “minibatch”) are sampled from the training set. The optimizer computes the average model error on these examples, and then differentiates this average error with respect to each of the model parameters to obtain a gradient vector. Finally, the model parameters (\(\theta_t\)) are updated by subtracting this gradient (\(\nabla_t\)) multiplied by a small constant \(\eta\) (the learning rate controls how quickly the optimizer updates the model’s parameters). At a high level, two modifications are made by DP-SGD to obtain differential privacy: gradients, which are computed on a per-example basis (rather than averaged over multiple examples), are first clipped to control their sensitivity, and, second, spherical Gaussian noise \(b_t\) is added to their sum to obtain the indistinguishability needed for DP. Succinctly, the update step can be written as follows: \(\theta_{t+1} \leftarrow \theta_t - \eta \cdot (\nabla_t + b_t)\).</p>

<p>Let us take the example of a hospital training a model to predict whether patients will be readmitted after being released. To train the model, the hospital uses information from patient records, such as demographic variables and admission variables (e.g., age, ethnicity, insurance type, type of Intensive Care Unit admitted to) but also time-varying vitals and labs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, white blood cell counts) [JPS16]. The modifications made by DP-SGD ensure that if (1) Jane Smith’s individual patient record contained unusual features, e.g., her insurance provider was uncommon for people of her age or her heart rate followed an unusual pattern, the resulting signal will have a bounded impact on our model updates, and (2) the model’s final parameters would be essentially identical should Jane Smith have chosen to not contribute (i.e., opt-out) her patient record to the training set. Stronger differential privacy is achieved when one is able to introduce more noise (i.e., sample noise with larger standard deviation) and train for as few iterations as possible.</p>

<p>Two main components in the above DP-SGD algorithm that distinguishes itself from traditional SGD are: i) per-example clipping and ii) Gaussian noise addition. In addition, for the analysis to hold, DP-SGD requires that sub-sampling of mini batches is uniform at random from the training data set. While this is not a requirement of DP-SGD per se, in practice many implementations of SGD do not satisfy this requirement and instead analyze different permutations of the data at each epoch of training.</p>

<p>While gradient clipping is common in deep learning, often used as a form of regularization, it differs from that in DP-SGD as follows: The average gradient over the minibatch is clipped, as opposed to clipping the gradient of individual examples (i.e., \(l(\theta_t;(x,y)) \) before averaging. It is an ongoing research direction to both understand the effect of per-example clipping in DP-SGD in model training [SSTT21], and also effective ways to mitigate its impact both in terms of accuracy [PTS21], and training time [ZHS19].</p>

<p>In standard stochastic gradient descent, subsampling is usually used either as a way to speed up the training process [CAR16], or as a a form of regularization [RCR15]. In DP-SGD, the randomness in the subsampling of the minibatch is used to guarantee DP. The technical component for this sort of privacy analysis is called privacy amplification by subsampling [KLNRS08,BBG18]. Since the sampling randomness is used to guarantee DP, it is crucial that the uniformity in the sampling step is of cryptographic strength. Another, (possibly) counterintuitive feature of DP-SGD is that for best privacy/utility trade-off it is in general better to have larger batch sizes. In fact, full-batch DP-gradient descent may provide the best privacy/utility trade-offs, albeit at the expense of computational feasibility.</p>

<p>For a fixed DP guarantee, the magnitude of the Gaussian noise that gets added to the gradient updates in each step in DP-SGD is proportional to \(\sqrt{the\ number\ of\ steps}\) the model is trained for. As a result, it is important to tune the number of training steps for best privacy/utility trade-offs.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy/blob/master/tutorials/mnist_dpsgd_tutorial.py">following tutorial</a>, we provide a small code snippet to train a model with DP-SGD.</p>

<h2 id="model-agnostic-private-learning">Model Agnostic Private Learning</h2>

<p>The Sample and Aggregate framework [NRS07] is a generic method to add differential privacy to a non-private algorithm without caring about the internal workings of it, a.k.a. model agnostic. In the context of machine learning, one can state the main idea as follows: Consider a multi-class classification problem. Take the training data, and split into k disjoint subsets of equal size. Train independent models \(\theta_1, \theta_2, …, \theta_k \) on the disjoint subsets. In order to predict on an test example x, first, compute a private histogram over the set of k predictions \(\theta_1(x), \theta_2(x), …, \theta_k(x) \). Then, select and output the bin in the histogram based on the highest count, after adding a small amount of Laplace/Gaussian noise to the counts. In the context of DP learning, this particular approach was used in two different lines of work: i) PATE [PAE16], and ii) Model agnostic private learning [BTT18]. While the latter focussed on obtaining theoretical privacy/utility trade-offs for a class of learning tasks (e.g., agnostic PAC learning), the PATE approach focuses on practical deployment. Both these lines of work make one common observation. If the predictions from \(\theta_1(x), \theta_2(x), …, \theta_k(x) \) are fairly consistent, then the privacy cost in terms of DP is very small. Hence, one can run a large number of prediction queries, without violating DP constraints. In the following, we describe the PATE approach in detail.</p>

<p>The private aggregation of teacher ensembles (PATE) demonstrated in particular that this approach allows one to learn deep neural networks with differential privacy. It proposes to have an ensemble of models trained without privacy predict with differential privacy by having these models predict in aggregate rather than revealing their individual predictions. In PATE, we start by partitioning the private dataset into smaller subsets of data. These subsets are partitions, so there is no overlap between the data included in any pair of partitions. If Jane Smith’s record was in our private dataset, then it is included in one of the partitions only. That is, only one of the teachers has analyzed Jane Smith’s record during training. We train a ML model, called a teacher, on each of these partitions. We now have an ensemble of teacher models that were trained independently, but without any guarantees of privacy. How do we use this ensemble to make predictions that respect privacy? In PATE, we add noise while aggregating the predictions made individually by each teacher to form a single common prediction. We count the number of teachers who voted for each class, and then perturb that count by adding random noise sampled from the Laplace or Gaussian distribution. Each label predicted by the noisy aggregation mechanism comes with rigorous differential privacy guarantees that bound the privacy budget spent to label that input. Again, stronger differential privacy is achieved when we are able to introduce more noise in the aggregation and are able to answer as few queries as possible. Let us now come back to our running example. Imagine that we’d like to use the output of PATE to know if Jane likes a particular movie. The only teacher trained on the partition containing Jane Smith’s data—has now learned that a record similar to Jane’s is characteristic of an individual who likes similar movies, and as a consequence changes its prediction on a test input which is similar to Jane’s to predict the movie rating assigned by Jane. However, because the teacher only contributes a single vote to the aggregation, and that the aggregation injects noise, we won’t be able to know whether the teacher changed its prediction to the movie rating assigned by Jane because the teacher indeed trained on Jane’s data or because the noise injected during the aggregation “flipped” that teacher’s vote. The random noise added to vote counts prevents the outcome of aggregation from reflecting the votes of any individual teachers to protect privacy.</p>

<h2 id="practically-deploying-differential-privacy-in-machine-learning">Practically deploying differential privacy in machine learning</h2>

<p>The two approaches we introduced have the advantage of being conceptually simple to understand. Fortunately, there also exist several open-source implementations of these approaches. For instance, DP-SGD is implemented in TensorFlow Privacy, Objax, and Opacus. This means that one is able to take an existing TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch pipeline for training a machine learning model and replace a non-private optimizer with DP-SGD. An example implementation of PATE is also available in TensorFlow Privacy. So what are the concrete potential obstacles to deploying machine learning with differential privacy?</p>

<p>The first obstacle is the accuracy of privacy-preserving models. Datasets are often sampled from distribution with heavy tails. For instance, in a medical application, there are typically (and fortunately) fewer patients with a given medical condition than patients without that condition. This means that there are fewer training examples for patients with each medical condition to learn from. Because differential privacy prevents us from learning patterns which are not found generally across the training data, it limits our ability to learn from these patients for which we have very few examples of [SPG]. More generally, there is often a trade-off between the accuracy of a model and the strength of the differential privacy guarantee it was trained with: the smaller the privacy budget is, the larger the impact on accuracy typically is. That said, this tension is not always inevitable and there are instances where privacy and accuracy are synergical because differential privacy implies generalization [DFH15] (but not vice versa).</p>

<p>The second obstacle to deploying differentially private machine learning can be the computational overhead. For instance, in DP-SGD one must compute per-example gradients rather than average gradients. This often means that optimizations implemented in machine learning frameworks to exploit matrix algebra supported by underlying hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs) are harder to take advantage of. In another example, PATE requires that one train multiple models (the teachers) rather than a single model so this can also introduce overhead in the training procedure. Fortunately, this cost is mostly mitigated in recent implementations of private learning algorithms, in particular in Objax and Opacus.</p>

<p>The third obstacle to deploying differential privacy, in machine learning but more generally in any form of data analysis, is the choice of privacy budget. The smaller the budget, the stronger the guarantee is. This means one can compare two analyses and say which one is “more private”. However, this also means that it is unclear what is “small enough” of a privacy budget. This is particularly problematic given that applications of differential privacy to machine learning often require a privacy budget that provides little theoretical guarantees in order to train a model whose accuracy is large enough to warrant a useful deployment. Thus, it may be interesting for practitioners to evaluate the privacy of their machine learning algorithm by attacking it themselves. Whereas the theoretical analysis of an algorithm’s differential privacy guarantees provides a worst-case guarantee limiting how much private information the algorithm can leak against any adversary, implementing a specific attack can be useful to know how successful a particular adversary or class of adversaries would be. This helps interpret the theoretical guarantee but may not be treated as a direct substitute for it. Open-source implementations of such attacks are increasingly available: e.g., for membership inference <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy/tree/master/tensorflow_privacy/privacy/privacy_tests/membership_inference_attack">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cchoquette/membership-inference">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the above, we discussed some of the algorithmic approaches towards differentially private model training which have been effective both in theoretical and practical settings. Since it is a rapidly growing field, we could not cover all the important aspects of the research space. Some prominent ones include: i) Choice of the best hyperparameters in the training of DP models.In order to ensure that the overall algorithm preserves differential privacy, one needs to ensure that the choice of hyperparameters itself preserves DP. Recent research has provided algorithms for selecting the best hyperparameters in a differentially private fashion [LT19]. ii) Choice of network architecture: it is not always true that the best known model architectures for non-private model training are indeed the best for training with differential privacy. In particular, we know that the number of model parameters may have adverse effects on the privacy/utility trade-offs [BST14]. Hence, choosing the right model architecture is important for providing a good privacy/utility trade-off [PTS21]. (iii) Training in the federated/distributed setting: in the above exposition, we assumed that the training data lies in a single centralized location. However, in settings like Federated Learning (FL) [MMRHA17], the data records can be highly distributed, e.g., across various mobile devices. Running DP-SGD in the FL setting, which is required for FL to provide privacy guarantees for the training data, raises a series of challenges [KMA19] which are often facilitated by distributed private learning algorithms designed specifically for FL settings [BKMTT20, KMSTTZ21]. Some of the specific challenges in the context of FL include, limited and non-uniform availability of clients (holding individual data records) and unknown (and variable) size of the training data [BKMTT18]. On the other hand, PATE style algorithms lend themselves naturally to the distributed setting once combined with existing cryptographic primitives, as demonstrated by the CaPC protocol [CDD21]. It is an active area of research to address these above challenges.</p>

<p>In this post, we'll look at the natural problem of how to communicate an estimate of a real value in [0,1], using just 1 bit.  The post is based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02331" target="_blank">this paper</a> (by Ran Ben-Basat of UCL and Shay Vargaftik of VMware Research and myself -- they helped also with the post) that appeared in ICALP last year. </p><p>This question is motivated by various aggregation problems;  multiple sending devices may measure a value, and wish to send the value to an aggregator who will compute something from the received values, such as the average.  In our problem, the senders have a real value x in [0,1] to send, but are constrained to send just a single bit.  Variations of this problem have come up in recent work on distributed/federated learning, where clients compute a gradient vector and send it to a centralized parameter server to update a learning model;  we may want to compress the vector to a small number of bits, or even 1 bit, per coordinate.  (We'll have more to say on the federated learning problem in a future post.)  Of course, it's also just an interesting randomized algorithm problem that seems interesting in its own right.  </p><p>A natural way to look at the problem is as a variation on rounding.  Given a value x in [0,1], one natural approach if limited to one bit is to deterministically round it to X.  But what should the receiver do when they receive the (rounded) bit value X?  It depends on what one's optimization goal is, but to minimize the maximum possible error, the receiver should have their estimate x' take on the value 3/4 when X is 1, 1/4 otherwise.  Note though that deterministic rounding this way is biased -- the expectation E[x'] does not equal x.  Randomized rounding, where the sender sends 1 with probability x and 0 otherwise, and the receiver uses the received bit X as the estimate x', has the property that E[x'] = x.  Unbiased estimators are arguably more natural for many estimation problems.  Here the measure of performance would be the maximum variance for the estimate over all inputs x, so for randomized rounding the cost is 1/4 (when x = 1/2).  </p><p>Can one do better than these schemes?  It turns out that you can, if you have available shared randomness.  An approach that has been known in the engineering world (where it has been used in signal processing) is subtractive dithering:  </p><p>We assume that the sender and receiver have access to shared randomness ℎ∼𝑈[−1/2,1/2].  Given a value x, the sender sends 1 if x+h≥1/2, 0 otherwise.  The receiver estimates x' = X - h.  We leave as an exercise that this is unbiased, which can be shown by deriving the stronger fact that x' is distributed as 𝑈[𝑥−1/2,𝑥+1/2] , and thus Var[𝑥']=1/12.</p><p>Subtractive dithering ignores that generating a shared real number may be more costly or problematic than generating a finite number of shared bits.  So one of the results of our paper is developing a "finite shared random bits" unbiased estimator, that corresponds to randomized rounding with no shared bits and converges to subtractive dithering as the number of shared random bits goes to infinity.  (The approach does allow for generating a private random real value.)  </p><p>Also in our paper, we study biased schemes, aiming to minimize the worst-case expected mean-squared error (where the expectation is over randomness used in the algorithm).  For example, it's very odd in the setting of subtractive dithering that one can obtain estimates smaller than 0 or greater than 1, when the input is restricted to [0,1], but that's a price we pay for having an unbiased estimator.  For  a biased estimator, you might naturally truncate the result from subtractive dithering;  by truncating to [z,1-z] for an appropriate z &gt; 0, you can indeed slightly improve over the worst-case mean-squared error of 1/16 for deterministic rounding.</p><p>We then studied various algorithmic improvements to obtain better biased schemes.  We were able to progress by looking at limited shared randomness, namely finding the best algorithm with s shared bits.  For example, consider the case of just 1 shared random bit h in {0,1}.  The receiver receives 1 bit X from the sender, and thus can have four possible estimates x' depending on X and h.  If the 4 possible estimate values are v0, v1, v2, v3 (all between 0 and 1), then it is possible to show the largest possible expected squared error occurs at one of the five inputs 0, 1, (v0+v1)/2, (v1+v2)/2, (v2+v3)/2.   We can then write a quadratic program to find the values that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error.  The end result is the following rounding algorithm:  given 1 shared random bit h in {0,1} and the value x, let X = 1 if x ≥ 0.4 + 0.2h, and 0 otherwise;  then let the estimate x' = 0.1 + 0.2h + 0.6X.  This has a worst-case expected mean-squared error of 1/20, beating deterministic rounding and truncated subtractive dithering.  Using some additional arguments we can handle more shared random bits;  at 8 bits we improve the worst-case expected squared error to about 0.04599, which is quite close to our lower bound of about 0.0459, and this is better than anything we could come up with analytically.  The optimal solution is still not known (an open question for future work!).  </p><p>Overall there are many variants of the rounding problem, and few tight bounds currently.  So even for simple-seeming problems like rounding, there are still interesting things to do.  </p></div>

<p>The other day I couldn’t remember Fibonacci’s original motivation/presentation of the sequence now famously named after him.  This had to be corrected immediately, because of the picture above and my <a href="https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/viola/papers/amigaMagazine.pdf">first publication</a> (1994) which includes a simple algorithm to decompress sounds.  The compression algorithm works by storing rather than the sound data — think of it as the key — the difference between consecutive keys.  The saving comes from not allowing every possible difference, but only those in… the Fibonacci sequence.  Why those differences are the right ones is part of the mystique which makes studying the sequence fun.  For further technical but not mystical details see the paper; an implementation of the decompressor is given in the Motorola 68000 assembly code.</p>



<p>This is me on my way to Fibonacci from Rome, some years ago:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01563-1.jpg"><img src="https://emanueleviola.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/dsc01563-1.jpg?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-947" /></a></figure>



<p>I actually find some presentations of the sequence a little hard to grasp, so I came up with a trivially different rendering which now will make it impossible for me to forget:</p>



<p>There are two types of trees: Young and old.  You start with one young tree. In one period, a young tree produces another young tree and becomes old, and an old tree produces a young tree and dies. How many young trees are there after t periods?</p>



<p></p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Period</td><td>Young trees</td><td>Old trees</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I also couldn’t exactly remember the spiral you can make with these numbers.  But you can tile the plane with squares whose sides come from the sequence, if you arrange them in a spiral.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The problem of <i>squaring the circle</i>: Given a circle, construct (with ruler and compass) a square with the same area. While browsing the web for more information on this problem (for the blog entry on problems that might be similar to P vs NP: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/10/is-math-ready-for-pnp-is-alexandra.html">here</a>)  I came across the following:</p><p>In the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera <i>Princess Ida</i>, in the song <i>Gently, Gently</i>  is the line:</p><p>                                <i>    ... and the circle they will square it one fine day.</i></p><p>(To hear the song see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r2hEcDmeIY">here</a>. The line is towards the end.) </p><p>They lyrics are <a href="https://www.gsarchive.net/princess_ida/webop/pi_12.html">here</a>. That website begins  <i>gsarchive.ne</i>t which made me wonder<i> Did I at one time set</i> u<i>p a website of math refs in Gilbert and Sullivan plays (gsarch is very close to gasarch) ? </i>which IS the kind of thing I would do. The answer is no: <i> gsarch</i> stands for <i>Gilbert and Sullivan archive.</i> They could have called it <i>gasarch </i>if they used the <i>and </i>in <i>Gilbert and Sullivan</i> but abbreviated <i>archive </i>as arch. Then I would have been far more confused. </p><p>Moving on...</p><p>In 1884<i> Princess Ida</i> opened in 1884. For more on this comic opera see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Ida">here</a>.</p><p>In 1882 pi was proven  transcendental and hence one cannot square the circle. For more on pi being transcendental see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">here</a>.</p><p>Kolmogorov Random Thoughts on all of this</p><p>0) The song is sung my three men who are making fun of the notion of a women's college. The song is about all the things the women are trying to do that are absurd such as squaring the circle. They also mention perpetual motion machines. </p><p>1) Did G and S know that the squaring the circle had been proven impossible, or just that it was thought to be impossible, or just that it was thought to be hard?</p><p>2) Was it known that perpetual motion machines were impossible? Or just very hard? </p><p>3) G and S used Mathematics in at least one other song: <i> I am the very model of a modern major general, </i>from<i> The Pirates of Penzance  </i>has the lines:</p><p><br /></p><p>                                       <i>I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical</i></p><p><i>                                       I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,</i></p><p><i>                                       About binomial theorems I'm teeming with the a lot o' news---</i></p><p><i>                                       With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse</i></p><p><br /></p><p>and later </p><p><i>                                        I'm very good at integral and differential calculus</i></p><p>See <a href="https://naic.edu/~gibson/poems/gilbert1.html">here</a> for all the lyrics. The website mentioned in the next point has a pointer to a YouTube video of people singing it. </p><p>4) There are many parodies of <i>Modern Major General. </i>The earliest ones I know of is Tom Lehrer's  <i>The Elements. </i>Since making a website of them IS the kind of thing I would do,  while writing this post I did it (Are we compelled to do things that fit our image of ourselves? Yup.) The website is <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/FUN//modmajgen.html">here</a>. It has 36 parodies (as of Oct 17, 2021 when I wrote this blog--- it may have more if you read this later.) That may seem like a lot, but it pales in comparison  to the most satirized song of all time: <i>The 12 days of Christmas </i>which I did an ugly lyrics-only website for back before html had nice tools, see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/12days.html">here</a>. It has 143 songs on it but I am sure there are many more. (Note to self: redo that website when you have time. Maybe when I retire.) </p><p>4) I suspect that G and S knew more math, or perhaps knew of more math,  than Broadway composers know now. I suspect this is a more general trend: people are more specialized now. Having said that, I need to mention the off-Broadway musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Tango">Fermat's last Tango</a> which I liked more than Lance (see his post on it <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2004/02/fermats-last-tango.html">here</a>). </p><p>5) How much math would you need to know in order to insert some into your play or movie? With Wikipedia and other web sources you could find out some things, but you would have to have some idea what you are looking for. And perhaps you would need some math background in order to even want to insert some math into your work in the first place. </p><p>6)  Here's hoping someone will make a musical about William Rowan Hamilton using this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZXHoWwBcDc">here</a> as a starting point. I blogged rather optimistically about that possibility <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/04/william-rowan-hamilton-musical.html#comment-form">here</a>.</p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>Over the past year or so I’ve been working with Marc van Kreveld and Wolfgang Mulzer to set up a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access">diamond open access</a> computational geometry journal, <em><a href="https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt">Computing in Geometry and Topology</a></em>, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.computational-geometry.org/">Society for Computational Geometry</a>, the organization set up to run the annual <em>Symposium on Computational Geometry</em>. It is the second such journal to be established, after the <em><a href="https://jocg.org/index.php/jocg">Journal of Computational Geometry</a></em>. This week the new journal went live and it is now available for submissions. Below is the official announcement we sent out to several mailing lists:</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear all,</p>

<p>As of this week, the new diamond open access journal</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em></p>

<p>is welcoming submissions. The website of the journal is <a href="https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt">https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt</a></p>

<p>Here you can also find the editorial board, the submission guidelines, the scope, and a style file.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the journal, please send them to info@cgt-journal.org</p>

<p>Best regards,
David Eppstein, Marc van Kreveld, and Wolfgang Mulzer</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Purpose and scope</strong></p>

<p><em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em> aims to support the broader computational geometry and topology community by being a peer-reviewed scientific journal that provides diamond open access. <em>Computing in Geometry and Topology</em> is sponsored by the Society for Computational Geometry.</p>

<p>With the broader computational geometry and topology community, we include researchers in discrete and combinatorial geometry, and any application area of computational geometry and topology. We also include algorithm engineering for geometric computations.</p>

<p>The journal publishes two types of papers. Firstly, the journal publishes original research of sufficient depth and interest. Secondly, the journal publishes high-quality survey papers. Every paper has been thoroughly reviewed by experts in the area.</p>

<p>To emphasize the breadth of the interpretation of computational geometry and topology, the editorial board has different sections that represent the algorithmic and mathematical aspects, the applied aspects, and the engineering aspects.</p>

We consider the problem of extracting randomness from \textit{sumset sources}, a general class of weak sources introduced by Chattopadhyay and Li (STOC, 2016). An $(n,k,C)$-sumset source $\mathbf{X}$ is a distribution on $\{0,1\}^n$ of the form $\mathbf{X}_1 + \mathbf{X}_2 + \ldots + \mathbf{X}_C$, where $\mathbf{X}_i$'s are independent sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy at least $k$. Prior extractors either required the number of sources $C$ to be a large constant or the min-entropy $k$ to be at least $0.51 n$. 

As our main result, we construct an explicit extractor for sumset sources in the setting of $C=2$ for min-entropy $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ and polynomially small error. We can further improve the min-entropy requirement  to $(\log n) \cdot (\log \log n)^{1 + o(1)}$ at the expense of worse error parameter of our extractor. We find applications of our sumset extractor for extracting randomness from other well-studied models of weak sources such as affine sources, small-space sources,  and interleaved sources.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Based on the recent breakthrough of Huang (2019), we show that for any total Boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />,</p>
<ul>
<li>The degree of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is at most quadratic in the approximate degree of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />. This is optimal as witnessed by the OR function.</li>
<li>The deterministic query complexity of f is at most quartic in the quantum query complexity of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" />. This matches the known separation (up to log factors) due to Ambainis, Balodis, Belovs, Lee, Santha, and Smotrovs (2017).</li>
</ul>
<p>We apply these results to resolve the quantum analogue of the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture. We show that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f" class="latex" /> is a nontrivial monotone graph property of an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" />-vertex graph specified by its adjacency matrix, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Q%28f%29%3D%5COmega%28n%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="Q(f)=\Omega(n)" class="latex" />, which is also optimal. We also show that the approximate degree of any read-once formula on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> variables is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CTheta%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Theta(\sqrt{n})" class="latex" />.</p>

Robert Tarjan is well known to most—a Turing award winner in 1986 with <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/tarjan_1092048.cfm">John Hopcroft</a>. Bob is a professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, and one of the world experts on linear time graph algorithms. I always thought if some NP-complete graph problem had a linear time algorithm, then P=NP would have long been solved by Bob. </p>
<p>
Today we talk about a problem that hasn’t been solved by Bob.</p>
<p>
The problem I mean was <em>quasi-</em>solved by Bob. That is, he gave a quasi-polynomial time algorithm. The problem is <em>group isomorphism</em> (GpI). Laci Babai discusses its relation as a special case of <em>graph isomorphism</em> (GI) in section 13.2 of his famous 2016 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03547.pdf">paper</a> giving a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for GI. He says that the annoyance of GpI should temper expectations for getting GI into polynomial time, because:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [I]n spite of considerable effort and the availability of powerful algebraic machinery, Group Isomorphism is still not known to be in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Bob’s Least Result </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Bob has many great and deep results. For example, Donald Knuth <a href="https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2213858">described</a> Bob’s strong connected component algorithm for directed graphs in these words:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The data structures that he devised for this problem fit together in an amazingly beautiful way, so that the quantities you need to look at while exploring a directed graph are always magically at your fingertips. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Here is Ken’s slight editing of Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">presentation</a>:</p>
<p><code><br />

<p></p><h2> The Annoying Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Just over ten years ago we talked about: How do we tell if two groups are isomorphic? Precisely on October 8, 2011 we talked about <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/10/08/an-annoying-open-problem/">group isomorphism</a>. We called it an annoying problem. It remains annoying. </p>
<p>
In the group isomorphism problem (GpI), we are given two finite groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> in terms of their multiplication tables and must decide if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ccong+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \cong H}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
Bob Tarjan famously noted that this could be done <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%5Clog_2+n+%2B+O%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{\log_2 n + O(1)}}" class="latex" /> time. He never published this result and just orally told others about it. The insight was that every group of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> had a generator set of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog_2+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\log_2 n}" class="latex" />. Since his insight the group isomorphism problem remains roughly the same complexity. The best is the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2013/05/11/advances-on-group-isomorphism/">improvement</a> due to David Rosenbaum. His algorithm is still of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7Bc+%5Clog+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{c \log n}}" class="latex" />. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.3935.pdf">here</a> for details. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> General group isomorphism is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B%281%2F2%29+log_p+n%2BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^{(1/2) log_p n+O(1)}}" class="latex" /> deterministic time where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> is the smallest prime dividing the order of the group. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Better than Bob’s insight, but still not polynomial time. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Order Restriction </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The results to date on GpI have relied mainly on basic group theory. Bob’s result uses an elementary fact about finite groups. David uses the same insight and adds a deep fact about isomorphism type problems. Neither use any of the “millions” of theorems known about finite groups. </p>
<p>
I wondered if there is some hope to start to exploit more of the papers on group structure? The trouble I think is that these results are quite difficult for those not in group theory to understand. But perhaps there is some hope. What do you think?</p>
<p>
I still wonder if there is a polynomial time algorithm for the general group isomorphism problem? Can we eliminate the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\log n}" class="latex" /> exponent somehow? This lead us to note the following simple theorem:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> be finite groups of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> that is square free.Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ccong+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \cong H}" class="latex" /> can be determined in time polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
That is, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> has no prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p}" class="latex" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p^2}" class="latex" /> divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But Wait… </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As I worked on this I found a nice <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08872.pdf">paper</a> by Heiko Dietrich and James Wilson, titled “Polynomial Time Isomorphism Tests Of Black-Box Type Groups Of Most Orders.” They reference another <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03467.pdf">paper</a> that proved a stronger theorem than our above one:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 3</b> <em> There is an algorithm that given groups <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of permutations on finitely many points, decides whether they are of cube-free order, and if so, decides that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Ccong+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \cong H}" class="latex" /> or constructs an isomorphism <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Crightarrow+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \rightarrow H}" class="latex" />. The algorithm runs in time polynomial in the input size. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proof of Our Theorem </h2><p></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote><p><b>Definition 4</b> <em> A finite group <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is <b>metacyclic</b> provided it has a normal subgroup <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%2FN%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G/N}" class="latex" /> are both cyclic. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Every finite group of square-free order (i.e. the order is not divisible by the square of a natural number) is metacyclic.</p>
<p>
<em>Proof:</em>  We claim that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> are both metacyclic. This follows from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacyclic_group">fact</a> that their order is square free. But then we know that both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> are generated by at most two elements—see <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1734406/prove-metacyclic-group-is-generated-by-two-elements">this</a>. This yields an isomorphism algorithm based on the above generator trick. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Box" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
Their stronger proof uses quite a bit more group theory. But our simple proof may give you some intuition why the restriction on the order of the group helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>
The above result fits well with the belief that the worst case for isomorphism is when the order of the groups is a power of a prime. Some possible conjectures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Can we generalize “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> is square free” to “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p^4}" class="latex" /> does not divide <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />“?

<p>Ever since I posted my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5566">obituary for the great Steven Weinberg</a> three months ago, I’ve gotten a steady trickle of emails—all of which I’ve appreciated enormously—from people who knew Steve, or were influenced by him, and who wanted to share their own thoughts and memories.  Last week, I was contacted by one Moshe Katz, an Orthodox rabbi, who wanted to share a long email exchange that he’d had with Steve, about Steve’s reasons for rejecting his birth-religion of Judaism (along with every other religion).  Even though Rabbi Katz, rather than Steve, does most of the talking in this exchange, and even though Steve mostly expresses the same views he’d expressed in many of his public writings, I knew immediately on seeing this exchange that it could be of broader interest—so I secured permission to share it here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, both from Rabbi Katz and from Steve’s widow Louise.</p>



<p>While longtime readers can probably guess what <em>I</em> think about most of the topics discussed, I’ll refrain from any editorial commentary in this post—but of course, feel free to share your own thoughts in the comments, and maybe I’ll join in.  Mostly, reading this exchange reminded me that someone at some point should write a proper book-length biography of Steve, and someone should also curate and publish a selection of his correspondence, much like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Reasonable-Deviations-Letters-Richard/dp/141934322X"><em>Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track</em></a> did for Richard Feynman.  There must be a lot more gems to be mined.</p>



<p>Anyway, without further ado, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/weinberg.pdf"><strong>here’s the exchange</strong></a> (10 pages, PDF).</p></div>

<p>If you’ve visited <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> lately — which, uh, I suppose you have — you may have noticed that your URL was redirected from www.scottaaronson.com/blog to scottaaronson.blog.  That’s because Automattic, makers of <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>, volunteered to move my blog there from Bluehost, free of charge.  If all goes according to plan, you should notice faster loading times, less downtime, and <em>hopefully</em> nothing else different.  Please let me know if you encounter any problems.  And <em>huge</em> thanks to the WordPress.com Special Projects Team, especially Christopher Jones and Mark Drovdahl, for helping me out with this.</p></div>

If you are interested and you have any questions, feel free to email me (L.Trevisan at Unibocconi dot it)</p>



<p>The negotiable start date is September 1st, 2022. Each position is for one year, renewable for a second. The positions offer an internationally competitive salary (up to 65,000 Euro per year, tax-free, plus relocation assistance and travel allowance), in a wonderful location that, at long last, is back to more or less normal life. The application deadline is <strong>December 17, 2021</strong>.</p>



<p>Among the topics that I am interested in are spectral graph theory, average-case complexity, “applications” of semidefinite programming, random processes on networks, approximation algorithms, pseudorandomness and combinatorial constructions.</p>



<p>Bocconi Computer Science is building up a theory group: besides me, we have <a href="https://www.alonrosen.net/">Alon Rosen</a>, <a href="https://elias.ba30.eu/">Marek Elias</a>, a tenured person that will join next Fall, and more hires are on the horizon. Now that traveling is ok again, and considering that Alon and I both have ERC grants, we should expect a big stream of theory visitors coming and going through Bocconi from week-long visits to semester or year long sabbaticals.</p></div>

<p>Please consider applying for <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science/graduate-programs/how-apply"><strong>graduate studies in computer science</strong></a> (or encourage others to apply if like me, your grad-school days are behind you). </p>



<p>In recent years, I’ve taken a special interest in the <a href="https://mltheory.org/"><strong>theory of machine learning</strong></a>, and there are <a href="https://mltheory.org/#opportunities"><strong>several opportunities at Harvard</strong></a> in this area. In particular, I’ve been collaborating with people both in and outside CS, including incoming CS faculty <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/"><strong>Sham Kakade</strong></a>, as well as <a href="http://www.demba-ba.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Demba Ba</strong></a> (Electrical Engineering and Bioengineering), <a href="http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Lucas Janson</strong></a> (Statistics), and  <a href="https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Cengiz Pehlevan</strong></a> (Applied Mathematics). I’m very much open to co-advising students outside computer science as well. </p>



<p>Students interested in <a href="https://quantum.harvard.edu/"><strong>quantum computation and information</strong></a> can apply to any of our programs (including computer science, physics, and others) as well as to the new <a href="https://gsas.harvard.edu/programs-of-study/all/quantum-science-and-engineering"><strong>quantum science and engineering degree</strong></a>. There are a number of Harvard faculty interested in <a href="https://quantum.harvard.edu/hqi-members">quantum computing</a>  including new incoming faculty member <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~anuraganshu/"><strong>Anurag Anshu</strong></a>. In this area as well I am open to co-advising, including students outside CS.</p>



<p>If you are applying to graduate studies and are potentially interested in working with me, you can indicate this in the application form and statement of interest. This is the best way to ensure that I read your application (and in particular better than emailing me separately: for fairness sake I read all the applications together in batch, regardless of whether the candidate emailed me or not).</p>



<p>We are also looking for <strong>postdocs</strong>! We have the general <strong>Rabin postdoc position</strong>, as well as specific positions in <strong>privacy</strong>, <strong>fairness</strong>, and <strong>theory of machine learning</strong>, all <a href="https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/10730"><strong>described in the following ad</strong></a>. There is also a separate <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2021/10/networkingtheory-postdoc-at-harvard.html"><strong>networking+theory</strong></a> postdoc position. Several other machine-learning theory related postdocs are linked in our <a href="https://mltheory.org/#opportunities"><strong>ML theory opportunities page</strong></a>. See also the <strong><a href="https://quantum.harvard.edu/external-candidates">quantum initiative postdoctoral fellowship</a></strong>. There may be more CS, ML and quantum related opportunities that I am missing. If I hear of more relevant opportunities then I will post them here and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/boazbaraktcs"><strong>on Twitter</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Finally, Harvard welcomes applications from candidates of all backgrounds, regardless of disability, gender identity and expression, physical appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation. I would like to <strong>especially encourage</strong> applications from <strong>members of under-represented groups</strong>. Computer Science, and in particular the areas I work in, have a significant diversity problem. We are trying at Harvard to create an environment that is welcoming and inclusive for people from all backgrounds. I am sincerely grateful and appreciative of people placing their trust in us by applying, and we will do our best to live up to that trust.</p></div>

<p>The last couple of years one aspect of research I've greatly enjoyed is getting back into networking, which is really due to my excellent (and patient) collaborators Ran Ben Basat (now at UCL, was a postdoc at Harvard) and Minlan Yu (at Harvard).  Minlan and I are working to establish a larger-scale Networking+Theory (hopefully broadening to an even larger Systems+Theory) group at Harvard, working on algorithmic problems in the context of real (or at least very real-ish) systems.  We have funding, and are looking for a postdoc, the basic description is below.  Ideally we're looking for people comfortable with the theory side and the systems side.  The website link for applying is <a href="https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/10748">https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/10748</a> .  We have preliminary website for the group at <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/theosys">https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/theosys</a> (it's just a start, Minlan and I are both on sabbatical, but you can see some of our publications).  We look forward to finding another member of the team!</p><p><span style="background-color: white; color: #212529; font-family: AvenirLTStd55Roman, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-family: Avenir-Heavy, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bolder;">Networking + Theory Postdoctoral Position</span></span><br style="background-color: white; color: #212529; font-family: AvenirLTStd55Roman, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;" /><br style="background-color: white; color: #212529; font-family: AvenirLTStd55Roman, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #212529; font-family: AvenirLTStd55Roman, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The John A.

<p><em>(This is the sixth in a series of posts on online optimization techniques and their “applications” to complexity theory, combinatorics and pseudorandomness. The plan for this series of posts is to alternate one post explaining a result from the theory of online convex optimization and one post explaining an “application.” The first two posts were about the technique of multiplicative weight updates and its application to “derandomizing” probabilistic arguments based on combining a Chernoff bound and a union bound. The third and fourth post were about the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework, and how it unifies multiplicative weights and gradient descent, and a “gradient descent view” of the Frieze-Kannan Weak Regularity Lemma. The fifth post was about the constrained version of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework, and today we shall see how to apply that to a proof of the Impagliazzo Hard-Core Lemma.)</em></p>

Thus, the reason why functions from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" /> make a mistake in predicting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{g}" class="latex" /> at least a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" /> fraction of the times is that there is a “hard-core” set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of inputs such that every function from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" /> makes a mistake about 1/2 of the times for the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2\delta}" class="latex" /> fraction of inputs coming from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>The result is actually not literally true as stated above, and it is useful to understand a counterexample, in order to motivate the correct statement. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" /> contains just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/\delta}" class="latex" /> functions, and that each function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%5Cin+%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f\in \cal F}" class="latex" /> differs from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{g}" class="latex" /> in exactly a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" /> fraction of inputs from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B+0%2C1+%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\{ 0,1 \}^n}" class="latex" />, and that the set of mistakes are <em>disjoint</em>. Thus, for every set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%5Csubseteq+%5C%7B+0%2C1+%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H\subseteq \{ 0,1 \}^n}" class="latex" />, no matter its size, there is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%5Cin+%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f\in \cal F}" class="latex" /> that agrees with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{g}" class="latex" /> on at least a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1-%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1-\delta}" class="latex" /> fraction of inputs from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />. The reason is that the sets of inputs on which the functions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" /> differ from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{g}" class="latex" /> form a partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B+0%2C1+%5C%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\{ 0,1 \}^n}" class="latex" />, and so their intersections with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> form a partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />. By an averaging argument, one of those intersections must then contain at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%7CH%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta |H|}" class="latex" /> elements of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>In the above example, however, if we choose any three distinct functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%2Cf_2%2Cf_3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f_1,f_2,f_3}" class="latex" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" />, we have</p>

<p>So, although <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{g}" class="latex" /> is weakly hard on average with respect to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" />, we have that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{g}" class="latex" /> is not even worst-case hard for a slight extension of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" /> in which we allow functions obtained by simple compositions of a small number of functions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" />.</p>

<p><b>2. Proving the Lemma </b></p>

The proofs of Impagliazzo and Nisan did not immediately give a set of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Cdelta2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2\delta2^n}" class="latex" /> (the set had size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\delta 2^n}" class="latex" />), although this could be achieved by iterating their argument. An idea of Holenstein allows to prove the above statement in a more direct way.</p>
<p>Today we will see how to obtain the Impagliazzo Hard-Core Lemma from online optimization, as done by Barak, Hardt and Kale. Their proof achieves all the parameters claimed above, once combined with Holenstein’s ideas.</p>

<p>We say that a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> (here “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" />” stands for probability <em>measure</em>; we use this letter since we have already used <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> last time to denote the Bregman divergence) has min-entropy at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K}" class="latex" /> if, for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28x%29+%5Cleq+2%5E%7B-K%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M(x) \leq 2^{-K}}" class="latex" />. In other words, the min-entropy of a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> over a sample space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{X}" class="latex" /> is defined as</p>

We will prove the following version of the hard-core lemma:</p>

<p>As in previous posts, we are going to think about a game between a “builder” that works toward the construction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{h}" class="latex" /> and an “inspector” that looks for defects in the construction. More specifically, at every round <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2CT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{i = 1,\ldots,T}" class="latex" />, the inspector is going to pick a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M_i}" class="latex" /> of min-entropy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgeq+%5Clog_2+2%5Cdelta%7CX%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\geq \log_2 2\delta|X|}" class="latex" /> and the builder is going to pick a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_i%5Cin+%7B%5Ccal+F%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f_i\in {\cal F}}" class="latex" />. The loss function, that the inspector wants to minimize, is</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+L_i+%28M%29+%3A%3D+%5Cmathop%7B%5Cmathbb+P%7D_%7Bx%5Csim+M%7D+%5Bf_i+%28x%29+%3D+g%28x%29%5D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle L_i (M) := \mathop{\mathbb P}_{x\sim M} [f_i (x) = g(x)] " class="latex" /></p>
<p>The inspector runs the agile online mirror descent algorithm with the constraint of picking distributions of the required min-entropy, and using the entropy regularizer; the builder always chooses a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f_i}" class="latex" /> such that that</p>

<p>which is always a possible choice given the assumptions of our theorem.</p>
<p>Just by plugging the above setting into the analysis from the previous post, we get that if we play this online game for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%3D+O%28%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-2%7D+%5Clog+%5Cdelta%5E%7B-1%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T = O(\epsilon^{-2} \log \delta^{-1})}" class="latex" /> steps, the builder picks functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cf_T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f_1,\ldots,f_T}" class="latex" /> such that, <em>for every distribution</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of min-entropy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgeq+%5Clog+2%5Cdelta+%7CX%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\geq \log 2\delta |X|}" class="latex" />, we have</p>

<p>We will prove that <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/feed/#game">(1)</a> holds in the next section, but we emphasize again that it is just a matter of mechanically using the analysis from the previous post.

<p>which is the statement that we promised and from which the Impagliazzo Hard-Core Lemma follows.</p>
<p><b>4. Some Final Remarks </b></p>
<p>After Impagliazzo circulated a preliminary version of his paper, Nisan had the following idea: consider the game that we define above, in which a builder picks an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%5Cin+%7B%5Ccal+F%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f\in {\cal F}}" class="latex" />, an inspector picks a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM+%5Cin+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M \in {\cal K}}" class="latex" /> of the prescribed min-entropy, and the loss for the inspector is given by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPr+%5B+f%28x%29+%3D+g%28x%29+%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Pr [ f(x) = g(x) ]}" class="latex" />. We can think of it as a zero-sum game if we also assign a gain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CPr+%5B+f%28x%29+%3D+g%28x%29%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Pr [ f(x) = g(x)]}" class="latex" /> to the builder.</p>
<p>If the builder plays second, there is a strategy that guarantees a gain that is at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2+%2B+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/2 + \epsilon}" class="latex" />, and so there must be a mixed strategy, that is, a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Ccal+DF%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\cal DF}}" class="latex" /> over functions in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+F%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\cal F}" class="latex" />, that guarantees such a gain even if the builder plays first. In other words, for all distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" /> of the prescribed min-entropy we have</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CPr_%7Bx%5Csim+H%2C+f%5Csim+%7B%5Ccal+DF%7D%7D+%5B+f%28x%29+%3D+g%28x%29+%5D+%5Cgeq+%5Cfrac+12+%2B+%5Cepsilon+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle \Pr_{x\sim H, f\sim {\cal DF}} [ f(x) = g(x) ] \geq \frac 12 + \epsilon " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Nisan then observes that we can sample <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT+%3D+%5Cfrac+1%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2%7D+%5Clog+%7CX%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T = \frac 1{\epsilon^2} \log |X|}" class="latex" /> functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cf_T%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f_1,\ldots,f_T}" class="latex" /> and have, with high probability</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CPr_%7Bx%5Csim+H%2C+i%5Csim+%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2CT%5C%7D%7D+%5B+f_i%28x%29+%3D+g%28x%29+%5D+%3E+%5Cfrac+12+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle \Pr_{x\sim H, i\sim \{1,\ldots,T\}} [ f_i(x) = g(x) ] &gt; \frac 12 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>and the sampling bound on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{T}" class="latex" /> can be improved to order of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac+1+%7B%5Cepsilon%5E2%7D+%5Clog+%5Cfrac+1%7B%5Cepsilon+%5Cdelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac 1 {\epsilon^2} \log \frac 1{\epsilon \delta}}" class="latex" /> with the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Basically, what we have been doing today is to come up with an algorithm that finds an approximate solution for the LP that defines the optimal mixed strategy for the game, and to design the algorithm is such a way that the solution is very sparse.</p>
<p>This is a common feature of other applications of online optimization techniques to find “sparse approximations”: one sets up an optimization problem whose objective function measures the “approximation error” of a given solution. The object we want to approximate is the optimum of the optimization problem, and we use variants of mirror descent to prove the existence of a sparse solution that is a good approximation.</p></div>

<p>The first machine learning benchmark dates back to the late 1950s. Few used it and even fewer still remembered it by the time benchmarks became widely used in machine learning in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>In 1959 at Bell Labs, Bill Highleyman and Louis Kamenstky designed a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1457838.1457894">scanner to evaluate character recognition techniques</a>. Their goal was “to facilitate a systematic study of character-recognition techniques and an evaluation of methods prior to actual machine development.” It was not clear at the time which part of the computations should be done in special purpose hardware and which parts should be done with more general computers. Highleyman later <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2978675A/en">patented an OCR scheme</a> that we recognize today as a convolutional neural network with convolutions optically computed as part of the scanning.</p>

<p>Highleyman and Kamentsky used their scanner to create a dataset of 1800 alphanumeric characters. They gathered the 26 letters of the alphabet and 10 digits from 50 different writers. Each character in their corpus was scanned in binary at a resolution of 12 x 12 and stored on punch cards that were compatible with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_704">IBM 704</a>, the GPGPU of the era.</p>

<p class="center"><img width="95%" alt="A look at Highleyman’s digits" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/highleyman-data.png" /></p>

<p>With the data in hand, Highleyman and Kamenstky began studying various proposed techniques for recognition. In particular, they analyzed a method of Woody Bledsoe and published an analysis claiming to be <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5219829">unable to reproduce Bledsoe’s results</a>. Bledsoe found their numbers to be considerably lower than he had expected, and asked Highleyman to send him the data. Highleyman obliged, mailing the package of punch cards across the country to Sandia Labs.</p>

<p>Upon receiving the data, Bledsoe conducted a new experiment. In what may be the first implementation of a train-test split, he divided the characters up, using 40 writers for training and 10 for testing. By tuning the hyperparameters, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5219162">Bledsoe was able to achieve approximately 60% error</a>. Bledsoe also suggested that the high error rates were to be expected as Highleyman’s data was too small. Prophetically, he declared that 1000 alphabets might be needed for good performance.</p>

<p>By this point, Highleyman had also shared his data with Chao Kong “C.K.” Chow at the Burroughs Corporation (a precursor to Unisys). A pioneer of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5222035">using decision theory for pattern recognition</a>, Chow built a pattern recognition system for characters. Using the same train-test split as Bledsoe, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5219431">Chow obtained an error rate of 41.7%</a> using a convolutional neural network.</p>

<p class="center"><img width="75%" alt="Chow’s architecture" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/chownet.png" /></p>

<p>Highleyman made at least six additional copies of the data he had sent to Bledsoe and Chow, and many researchers remained interested. He thus decided to <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4037813">publicly offer to send a copy to anyone</a> willing to pay for the duplication and shipping fees. An interested party would simply have to mail him a request. Of course, the dataset was sent by US Postal Service. Electronic transfer didn’t exist at the time, resulting in sluggish data transfer rates on the order of a few bits per minute.</p>

<p>Highleyman not only created the first machine learning benchmark. He authored the the first formal study of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6768949">train-test splits</a> and proposed <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4066882">empirical risk minimization for pattern classification</a> as part of his 1961 dissertation.
By 1963, however, Highleyman had left his research position at Bell Labs and abandoned pattern recognition research.</p>

<p>We don’t know how many people requested Highleyman’s data. The total number of copies may have been less than twenty. Based on citation surveys, we determined there were at least another six copies made after Highleyman’s public offer for duplication, sent to  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1671536">CMU</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1671257">Honeywell</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5008873">SUNY Stony Brook</a>, <a href="https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/16132/2/Ullmann-JR-1968-PhD-Thesis.pdf">Imperial College</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031320371900045">UW Madison</a>, and Stanford Research Institute (SRI).</p>

<p>The SRI team of John Munson, Richard Duda, and Peter Hart performed some of the most <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1687355">extensive experiments with Highleyman’s data</a>. A 1-nearest-neighbors baseline achieved an error rate of 47.5%. With a more sophisticated approach, they were able to do significantly better. They used a multi-class, piecewise linear model, trained using Kesler’s multi-class version of the perceptron algorithm (what we’d now call “one-versus all classification”). Their feature vectors were 84 simple pooled edge detectors in different regions of the image at different orientations. With these features, they were able to get a test error of 31.7%, 10 percentage points better than Chow. When restricted only to digits, this method recorded 12% error. The authors concluded that they needed more data, and that the error rates were “still far too high to be practical.” They concluded that “larger and higher-quality datasets are needed for work aimed at achieving useful results.” They suggested that such datasets “may contain hundreds, or even thousands, of samples in each class.”</p>

<p>Munson, Duda, and Hart also performed informal experiments with humans to gauge the readability of Highleyman’s characters. On the full set of alphanumeric characters, they found an average error rate of 15.7%, about 2x better than their pattern recognition machine. But this rate was still quite high and suggested the data needed to be of higher quality. They (again prophetically) concluded that “an array size of at least 20X20 is needed, with an optimum size of perhaps 30X30.”</p>

<p>Decades passed until such a dataset appeared. Thirty years later, with 125 times as much training data, 28x28 resolution, and with grayscale scans, a neural net achieved 0.7% test error on the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST digit recognition task</a>. In fact, a similar model to Munson’s architecture consisting of kernel ridge regression trained on pooled edged detectors also achieves 0.6% error. Intuition from the 1960s proved right. The resolution was higher and the number of examples per digit was now in the thousands, just as Bledsoe, Munson, Duda, and Hart predicted would be sufficient. Reasoning heuristically that the test error should be inversely proportional to the square root of the number of training examples, we would expect an 11x improvement over Munson’s approaches. The actual recorded improvement from 12% to 0.7% was closer to 17x, not far from what the back of the envelope calculation predicts.</p>

<p>Unlike Highleyman’s data, MNIST featured only digits, no letters. Only recently, in 2017, researchers from Western Sydney University <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373">extracted alphanumeric characters from the NIST-19 repository</a>. The resulting <em>EMNIST_Balanced</em> dataset has 2400 examples in each of the 47 classes, with a class for all upper case letters, all digits, and some of the non-ambiguous lower case letters. Currently, the best performing <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/9/15/3169">model achieves a test error rate of 9.4%</a>. While the dataset is still fairly new, this is only a 3x improvement over the methods of Munson, Duda, and Hart. Applying the same naive scaling argument as above, the increase in dataset size would predict a 7x improvement if such an improvement was achievable. Considering that the SRI team observed a human-error rate of 11% on Highleyman’s data, it is quite possible that an accuracy of 90% is close to the best that we can expect for recognizing handwritten digits without context.</p>

<p>The story of Highleyman’s data foreshadows many of the later waves of machine learning research. A desire for better evaluation inspired the creation of novel data. Dissemination of the experimental results on this data led to sharing in order for researchers to be content that the evaluation was fair. Once the dataset was distributed, others requested the data to prove their methods were superior. And then the dataset itself became enshrined as a benchmark for competitive testing.  Such comparative testing led to innovations in methods, theory, and data collection and curation itself. We have seen this pattern time and time again in machine learning, from <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">the UCI repository</a>, to <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST</a>, to <a href="https://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>, to <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/">CASP</a>. The nearly forgotten history of Highleyman’s data marks the beginning of this pattern recognition research paradigm.</p>

<p><em>We are, as always, deeply indebted to Chris Wiggins for sending us Munson et al.’s paper after watching a talk by BR on the history of ML benchmarking. We also thank Ludwig Schmidt for pointing us to EMNIST.</em></p>

<h2 id="addendum-on-our-protagonist-bill-highleyman">Addendum on our protagonist Bill Highleyman.</h2>

<p>After posting this blog, we found <a href="https://availabilitydigest.com/public_articles/1208/thesis.pdf">some lovely recollections by Bill Highleyman about his thesis</a>. It is remarkable how Bill invented so many powerful machine learning primitives—finding linear functions that minimize empirical risk, gradient descent to minimize the risk, train-test splits, convolutional neural networks—all as part of his PhD dissertation project. That said,
Bill considered the project to be a failure. He (and Bell Labs) realized the computing of 1959 was not up to the task of character recognition.</p>

<p>After he finished his thesis, Bill abandoned pattern recognition and moved on to work on other cool and practical computer engineering projects that interested him, never once looking back. By the mid sixties Bill had immersed himself in data communication and transmission, and patented novel approaches to electrolytic printing and financial transaction hardware. He eventually ended up specializing in high-reliability computing. Though he developed many of the machine learning techniques we use today, he was content to leave the field and work to advance general computing to catch up with his early ideas.</p>

<p>It’s odd but not surprising that while every machine learning class mentions Rosenblatt, Minsky, and Papert, almost everyone we’ve spoken with so far has never heard of Bill Highleyman.</p>

<p>We worry Bill is no longer reachable as he seems to have no online presence after 2019 and would be 88 years old today. If anyone out there on has met Bill, we’d love to hear more about him. Please drop us a note.</p>

<p>And if anyone has any idea of where we can get a copy of his 1800 characters from 1959, please let us know about that too…</p></div>
