<p>
The Claimers are a gang on the hit AMC television <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">series</a> <em>The Walking Dead</em>. They are the main antagonists in the second half of the zombie-apocalypse show’s Season 4. According to Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(season_4)#The_Claimers">description</a>, they “live by the philosophy of ‘claiming’.”</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss issues about ‘claiming’ and give advice on how to present your claims—or not.</p>
<p>
Yes, this post is about our own “claimers” in complexity theory. It is especially about those who claim to have a solution to P=NP. We will not give any names today. You know who you are.</p>
<p>
The TV Claimers meet a grisly end. We will not say any more about it. We want to be nice. But we would like to not keep seeing the same level of zombie claims raised again and again.</p>
<p>
<b>Please: Do not stop reading.</b> Yes we know that it is likely that no claimer really has such a proof. However, our suggestions apply to all of us when we have a non-trivial result. Especially a result that has been open, even if the result is not a major open problem. So please keep reading today.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> So You Can Prove P=NP </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This is a list of ideas for anyone who claims to have solved P=NP or some similar hard open problem in mathematics. There are already lots of suggestions online about what you should do, so this is just a list of additional thoughts. We hope they are helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> You are being pretty arrogant </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
In order to succeed in mathematics research one has to be a bit arrogant. It is quite difficult to prove new things without some swagger. However, proving or resolving P=NP requires a very non-humble attitude. I think many claimers have not thought how arrogant they are being. The P=NP problem is a huge open problem. Thousands and thousands of researchers have spent years thinking about it. Why do you, the claimer, think you see the light and we remain in the dark?</p>
<p>
It might be useful for the claimers to ponder: <i>Why did I succeed where all others have failed?</i> It might be useful to be a bit humble and at least think what did they see that we all missed? If they can say something like:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The reason I succeeded in finding an algorithm for P=NP is that I noticed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> No one else seems to see that this insight is very powerful. It is very useful since it implies <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> Working alone </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I think the vast majority of claimers of P=NP or other big results have almost always worked alone. This is okay, but the average number of authors these days of a theory paper is pretty large. So any paper that is sole authored, perhaps, leads the community think it is unusual—and is wrong. Another point is that being part of a team may help control the arrogance. It can also be invaluable in detecting errors. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> Show them the money </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There is an advantage in “proving” P=NP over other major problems. There is the Clay prize of a million dollars. I wonder if claimers could use the prize money in some interesting way. How about saying: If you read the my proof and repair it or make it more readable and it is correct, then you get something. A certain dollar amount. Or a percentage of the prize. Or—you get the idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> The role of code </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Many claimers have also supplied working code for their algorithm. That is they also supply a program that claims to solve some NP-complete problem. I have several thoughts about this. In some cases it seems that it could be possible to have code that works for small size problems, but not in the general case. This seems to be possible for the claims by some that they can solve the Traveling Salesman Problem, for example. Their algorithm could be correct for small instances.</p>
<p>
Mathematics is filled with surprises like: This effect works for all values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> less than some bound. If the claimers give a program, our expectation based on experience is that it may work for small cases but will probably fail in general. </p>
<p>
The last point is that working code could actually be valuable. If the code can be used to solve SAT problems how about using your program to enter a SAT contest and win it. A win, or even a good showing, would help tremendously in convincing people to read the paper. Or use the code to break some known cryptosystem. That would also convince people that they need to read your paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Writing Your Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Okay we all dream about solving a major open problem. Or even a minor one. Here we give an outline of how to write up such a paper. </p>
<p></p><h3> How to write up the proof </h3><p></p>
<p>
I would suggest that you not have any statements about why P=NP is an important problem. None. No history of the problem. No literature survey is needed. None. You goal is to get an expert to read and believe the proof. They will just skip over the above. Also please no statements of how your algorithm that solves P=NP is going to change the world. Just give us the proof.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h3> How to get them to read the proof </h3><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This is really hard. Hard. I have read a number of claimers’ papers. I try to be helpful. However, many of us do not have the time to look at such papers. Years ago, before Fermat’s Last Theorem was solved, a famous mathematician once made up a post-card that looked like this:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/04/21/pnp-proofs/postcard/" rel="attachment wp-att-15784"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/postcard.png?w=300&amp;h=221" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-15784" height="221" /></a></p>
<p>
I think that we all have a mental version of this card. There are definitely ways to help induce someone to read a paper and its proof. Look at some recent top theory papers. Even the authors of these papers, often well known authors, work hard to motivate potential readers. The authors often do several things:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <em>They often sketch the proof.</em> By leaving out details they may help get a reader interested. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <em>They often explain the new trick—or tricks.</em> The goal here is to explain some new insight that is used in the proof. We are very self-oriented: If I see that your new trick could be useful in my research that is a huge motivator for me to understand the proof. People are very excited about a strong result, but they are even more excited about a new trick. Explain what is new in your proof. If there is nothing new, no new trick or method, then hmmmm<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <em>They often first prove a weaker result.</em> That is, they show that their method can already make progress. If you could prove that the zeta function has all its nontrivial zeros on the critical line, that would be apocalyptic—the famous Riemann Hypothesis, of course. But if you could merely prove that there is no zero in some new region, then that would still be <em>wonderful</em>. And also probably more believable. If you could prove that there is no zero <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bz%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{z}" class="latex" title="{z}" /> with its real part <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.99999%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.99999}" class="latex" title="{0.99999}" /> that would be huge. If the proof of this is simpler, then use it to get readers excited about your full result. </p>
<p>
An observation related to the last point is: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Why do all claims of progress on P=NP give a polynomial time bound?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>How about just getting a better bound of say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%2F10%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{n/10}}" class="latex" title="{2^{n/10}}" /> for the Traveling Salesman Problem? Or a better bound for factoring? Or a better bound for your favorite problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>I hope these points help. One last pointer is to double-check dependencies. If your proof relies on a result by someone else, make sure the result really gives what you need. Terms may be defined differently from what you expect, or you may really need a feature of the proof rather than the mere statement. A mis-attributed result can become “undead.”</p></font></font></div>

arrivals. We are given a fixed metric with a server at each of the points, and
then requests arrive online, each drawn independently from a known probability
distribution over the points. Each request has to be matched to a free server,
with cost equal to the distance. The goal is to minimize the expected total
cost of the matching.
</p>
<p>Such stochastic arrival models have been widely studied for the maximization
variants of the online matching problem; however, the only known result for the
minimization problem is a tight $O(\log n)$-competitiveness for the
random-order arrival model. This is in contrast with the adversarial model,
where an optimal competitive ratio of $O(\log n)$ has long been conjectured and
remains a tantalizing open question.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show improved results in the i.i.d arrival model. We show
how the i.i.d model can be used to give substantially better algorithms: our
main result is an $O((\log \log \log n)^2)$-competitive algorithm in this
model. Along the way we give a $9$-competitive algorithm for the line and tree
metrics. Both results imply a strict separation between the i.i.d model and the
adversarial and random order models, both for general metrics and these
much-studied metrics.

both academic research and real-world applications. However, in order to reach
widespread adoption, new models that ensure the secure cooperation of these
systems need to be developed. This work proposes a novel model to encapsulate
cooperative robotic missions in Merkle trees, one of the fundamental components
of blockchain technology. With the proposed model, swarm operators can provide
the "blueprint" of the swarm's mission without disclosing raw data about the
mission itself. In other words, data verification can be separated from data
itself. We propose a system where swarm robots have to "prove" their integrity
to their peers by exchanging cryptographic proofs. This work analyzes and tests
the proposed approach for two different robotic missions: foraging (where
robots modify the environment) and maze formation (where robots become part of
the environment). In both missions, robots were able to cooperate and carry out
sequential operations in the correct order without having explicit knowledge
about the mission's high-level goals or objectives. The performance,
communication costs, and information diversity requirements for the proposed
approach are analyzed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future work
directions are suggested.

In particular, our goal is to find local minima (second-order stationary
points) instead of just finding first-order stationary points which may be some
bad unstable saddle points. We show that a simple perturbed version of
stochastic recursive gradient descent algorithm (called SSRGD) can find an
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-second-order stationary point with
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\delta^4 + n/\delta^3)$
stochastic gradient complexity for nonconvex finite-sum problems. As a
by-product, SSRGD finds an $\epsilon$-first-order stationary point with
$O(n+\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$ stochastic gradients. These results are almost
optimal since Fang et al. [2018] provided a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$ for finding even just an $\epsilon$-first-order
stationary point. We emphasize that SSRGD algorithm for finding second-order
stationary points is as simple as for finding first-order stationary points
just by adding a uniform perturbation sometimes, while all other algorithms for
finding second-order stationary points with similar gradient complexity need to
combine with a negative-curvature search subroutine (e.g., Neon2 [Allen-Zhu and
Li, 2018]). Moreover, the simple SSRGD algorithm gets a simpler analysis.
Besides, we also extend our results from nonconvex finite-sum problems to
nonconvex online (expectation) problems, and prove the corresponding
convergence results.

admits an edge coloring using at most $\Delta+1$ colors. In contrast, Bar-Noy,
Naor and Motwani showed over a quarter century that the trivial greedy
algorithm, which uses $2\Delta-1$ colors, is optimal among online algorithms.
Their lower bound has a caveat, however: it only applies to low-degree graphs,
with $\Delta=O(\log n)$, and they conjectured the existence of online
algorithms using $\Delta(1+o(1))$ colors for $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. Progress
towards resolving this conjecture was only made under stochastic arrivals
(Aggarwal et al., FOCS'03 and Bahmani et al., SODA'10).
</p>
<p>We resolve the above conjecture for \emph{adversarial} vertex arrivals in
bipartite graphs, for which we present a $(1+o(1))\Delta$-edge-coloring
algorithm for $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$ known a priori. Surprisingly, if $\Delta$
is not known ahead of time, we show that no $\big(\frac{e}{e-1} - \Omega(1)
\big) \Delta$-edge-coloring algorithm exists. We then provide an optimal,
$\big(\frac{e}{e-1}+o(1)\big)\Delta$-edge-coloring algorithm for unknown
$\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. Key to our results, and of possible independent
interest, is a novel fractional relaxation for edge coloring, for which we
present optimal fractional online algorithms and a near-lossless online
rounding scheme, yielding our optimal randomized algorithms.

subject to a matroid constraint, there is much less work on the corresponding
supermodular maximization problems. We develop new techniques for attacking
these problems inspired by the continuous greedy method applied to the
multi-linear extension of a submodular function. We first adapt the continuous
greedy algorithm to work for general twice-continuously differentiable
functions. The performance of the adapted algorithm depends on a new smoothness
parameter. If $F:[0,1]^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is one-sided
$\sigma$-smooth, then the approximation factor only depends on $\sigma$. We
apply the new algorithm to a broad class of quadratic supermodular functions
arising in diversity maximization. The case $\sigma=2$ captures metric
diversity maximization. We also develop new methods (inspired by swap rounding
and approximate integer decomposition) for rounding quadratics over a matroid
polytope. Together with the adapted continuous greedy this leads to a
$O(\sigma^{3/2})$-approximation. This is the best asymptotic approximation
known for this class of diversity maximization and the evidence suggests that
it may be tight.
</p>
<p>We then consider general (non-quadratic) functions. We give a broad
parameterized family of monotone functions which include submodular functions
and the just-discussed supermodular family of discrete quadratics. Such set
functions are called \emph{$\gamma$-meta-submodular}. We develop local search
algorithms with approximation factors that depend only on $\gamma$. We show
that the $\gamma$-meta-submodular families include well-known function classes
including meta-submodular functions ($\gamma=0$), proportionally submodular
($\gamma=1$), and diversity functions based on negative-type distances or
Jensen-Shannon divergence (both $\gamma=2$) and (semi-)metric diversity
functions.

carry and exchange the package among them. The objective is to compute a
delivery schedule that minimizes the delivery time of the package. In this
paper, we propose an O(kn log(kn) + k m) time algorithm for this problem. This
improves the previous state-of-the-art O(k^2 m + k n^2 + APSP) time algorithm
for this problem, where APSP stands for the running-time of an algorithm for
the All-Pairs Shortest Paths problem.

platform for processing large data sets. MapReduce offers a streamlined
computational framework by interleaving sequential and parallel computation
while hiding underlying system issues from the programmer. Due to the
popularity of MapReduce, there have been attempts in the theoretical computer
science community to understand the power and limitations of the MapReduce
framework. In the most widely studied MapReduce models each machine has memory
sub-linear in the input size to the problem, hence cannot see the entire input.
This restriction places many limitations on algorithms that can be developed
for the model; however, the current understanding of these restrictions is
still limited.
</p>
<p>In this paper, our goal is to work towards understanding problems which do
not admit efficient algorithms in the MapReduce model. We study the basic
question of determining if a graph is connected or not. We concentrate on
instances of this problem where an algorithm is to determine if a graph
consists of a single cycle or two disconnected cycles. In this problem, locally
every part of the graph is similar and the goal is to determine the global
structure of the graph. We consider a natural class of algorithms that can
store/process/transfer the information only in the form of paths and show that
no randomized algorithm cannot answer the decision question in a
sub-logarithmic number of rounds. Currently, there are no absolute super
constant lower bounds on the number of rounds known for any problem in
MapReduce. We introduce some of the first lower bounds for a natural graph
problem, albeit for a restricted class of algorithms. We believe our result
makes progress towards understanding the limitations of MapReduce.

that evaluates the smallest number of vertex and edge deletions/insertions
required to transform one graph to another. It is NP-hard to compute in
general, and a large number of heuristics have been proposed for approximating
this quantity. With few exceptions, these methods generally provide upper
bounds on the edit distance between two graphs. In this paper, we propose a new
family of computationally tractable convex relaxations for obtaining lower
bounds on graph edit distance. These relaxations can be tailored to the
structural properties of the particular graphs via convex graph invariants.
Specific examples that we highlight in this paper include constraints on the
graph spectrum as well as (tractable approximations of) the stability number
and the maximum-cut values of graphs. We prove under suitable conditions that
our relaxations are tight (i.e., exactly compute the graph edit distance) when
one of the graphs consists of few eigenvalues. We also validate the utility of
our framework on synthetic problems as well as real applications involving
molecular structure comparison problems in chemistry.

This paper proves new limitations on the power of quantum computers to solve approximate counting---that is, multiplicatively estimating the size of a nonempty set $S\subseteq [N]$.

Given only a membership oracle for $S$, it is well known that approximate counting takes $\Theta(\sqrt{N/|S|})$ quantum queries. But what if a quantum algorithm is also given "QSamples"---i.e., copies of the state $|S\rangle = \sum_{i\in S}|i\rangle$---or even the ability to apply reflections about $|S\rangle$? Our first main result is that, even then, the algorithm needs either $\Theta(\sqrt{N/|S|})$ queries or else $\Theta(\min\{|S|^{1/3},\sqrt{N/|S|}\})$ reflections or samples. We also give matching upper bounds.

We prove the lower bound using a novel generalization of the polynomial method of Beals et al. to Laurent polynomials, which can have negative exponents. We lower-bound Laurent polynomial degree using two methods: a new "explosion argument" and a new formulation of the dual polynomials method.

Our second main result rules out the possibility of a black-box Quantum Merlin-Arthur (or QMA) protocol for proving that a set is large. We show that, even if Arthur can make $T$ quantum queries to the set $S$, and also receives an $m$-qubit quantum witness from Merlin in support of $S$ being large, we have $Tm=\Omega(\min\{|S|,\sqrt{N/|S|}\})$. This resolves the open problem of giving an oracle separation between SBP and QMA.

Note that QMA is "stronger" than the queries+QSamples model in that Merlin's witness can be anything, rather than just the specific state $|S\rangle$, but also "weaker" in that Merlin's witness cannot be trusted. Intriguingly, Laurent polynomials also play a crucial role in our QMA lower bound, but in a completely different manner than in the queries+QSamples lower bound. This suggests that the "Laurent polynomial method" might be broadly useful in complexity theory.</div>

<div class="content">
We present a trichotomy theorem for the quantum query complexity of regular languages. Every regular language has quantum query complexity $\Theta(1)$, $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt n)$, or $\Theta(n)$. The extreme uniformity of regular languages prevents them from taking any other asymptotic complexity. This is in contrast to even the context-free languages, which we show can have query complexity $\Theta(n^c)$ for all computable $c \in [1/2,1]$. Our result implies an equivalent trichotomy for the approximate degree of regular languages, and a dichotomy---either $\Theta(1)$ or $\Theta(n)$---for sensitivity, block sensitivity, certificate complexity, deterministic query complexity, and randomized query complexity.

The heart of the classification theorem is an explicit quantum algorithm which decides membership in any star-free language in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt n)$ time. This well-studied family of the regular languages admits many interesting characterizations, for instance, as those languages expressible as sentences in first-order logic over the natural numbers with the less-than relation. Therefore, not only do the star-free languages capture functions such as OR, they can also express functions such as ``there exist a pair of 2's such that everything between them is a 0."  

Thus, we view the algorithm for star-free languages as a nontrivial generalization of Grover's algorithm which extends the quantum quadratic speedup to a much wider range of string-processing algorithms than was previously known.  We show a variety of applications---new quantum algorithms for dynamic constant-depth Boolean formulas, balanced parentheses nested constantly many levels deep, binary addition, a restricted word break problem, and path-discovery in narrow grids---all obtained as immediate consequences of our classification theorem.</div>

<p>From left: Sándor Szalai,  Catherine Rényi, Alfréd Rényi, András Hajnal and Paul Erdős (Matrahaza ) The picture is from Janos Pach’s Lancaster lecture, who also discussed how Szalai came up with Ramsey’s theorem.

<p>In the course of an examination of friendship between children some fifty years ago, the Hungarian sociologist Sandor Szalai observed that among any group of about twenty children he checked he could always find four children any two of whom were friends, or else four children no two of whom were friends. Despite the temptation to try to draw sociological conclusions, Szalai realized that this might well be a mathematical phenomenon rather than sociological one.  He got interested in the problem, discussed it with  Erdős, Rényi , and Turán and in a short time he came up with a number of interesting constructions. In fact, he obtained record lower bound estimates for several Ramsey numbers.</p>
<p>(Janos’ further remarks: “Sandor (Alexander) Szalai was a well known Hungarian sociologist and a famously bright and witty man. I am not sure whether he was the first to notice and study the the laws of clique- and anti-clique formation among groups of schoolchildren, but I suspect that he was not. The sociology of small groups used to be a popular alternative to more “dangerous” Marxist theories of classes in the 50-ies and 60-ies. My guess would be that Szalai discussed these issues and was fascinated by this subject some time around 1960. It is fair to say that he independently<em> conjectured</em> Ramsey’s theorem.”)</p></div>

games, denoted by $(G,\psi)$, where $G$ is a two-player one-round game and
$\psi$ is a bipartite state independent of the game $G$. In the mono-state game
$(G,\psi)$, the players are only allowed to share arbitrary copies of $\psi$.
This paper provides a doubly exponential upper bound on the copies of $\psi$
for the players to approximate the value of the game to an arbitrarily small
constant precision for any mono-state binary game $(G,\psi)$, if $\psi$ is a
noisy EPR state, which is a two-qubit state with completely mixed states as
marginals and maximal correlation less than $1$. In particular, it includes
$(1-\epsilon)|\Psi\rangle\langle\Psi|+\epsilon\frac{I_2}{2}\otimes\frac{I_2}{2}$,
an EPR state with an arbitrary depolarizing noise $\epsilon&gt;0$. This paper
develops a series of new techniques about the Fourier analysis on matrix spaces
and proves a quantum invariance principle and a hypercontractive inequality of
random operators. The structure of the proofs is built the recent framework
about the decidability of the non-interactive simulation of joint
distributions, which is completely different from all previous
optimization-based approaches or "Tsirelson's problem"-based approaches. This
novel approach provides a new angle to study the decidability of the complexity
class MIP$^*$, a longstanding open problem in quantum complexity theory.

first scenario, we assume that the viewers are all points of the polygon. We
solve the related problem of minimizing the number of guards and approximate
(up to only an additive error) the number of colours in the special case of
funnels. We also give an upper bound of O(log n) colours on weak-visibility
polygons which generalizes to all simple polygons. In the second scenario, we
assume that the viewers are only the vertices of the polygon. We show a lower
bound of 3 colours in the general case of simple polygons and conjecture that
this is tight. We also prove that already deciding whether 1 or 2 colours are
enough is NP-complete.

<p>Last night, two papers appeared on the quantum physics arXiv that my coauthors and I have been working on for more than a year, and that I’m pretty happy about.</p>



<p>The first paper, with Guy Rothblum, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08747">Gentle Measurement of Quantum States and Differential Privacy</a> (85 pages, to appear in STOC’2019).  This is Guy’s first paper that has anything to do with quantum, and also my first paper that has anything to do with privacy.  (What do I care about privacy?  I just share everything on this blog…)  The paper has its origin when I gave a talk at the Weizmann Institute about “shadow tomography” (a task where you have to measure quantum states very carefully to avoid destroying them), and Guy was in the audience, and he got all excited that the techniques sounded just like what they use to ensure privacy in data-mining, and I figured it was just some wacky coincidence and brushed him off, but he persisted, and it turned out that he was 100% right, and our two fields were often studying the same problems from different angles and we could prove it.  Anyway, here’s the abstract:</p>



<blockquote>In <i>differential privacy (DP)</i>, we want to query a database about n users, in a way that “leaks at most ε about any individual user,” even conditioned on any outcome of the query.  Meanwhile, in <i>gentle measurement</i>, we want to measure n quantum states, in a way that “damages the states by at most α,” even conditioned on any outcome of the measurement.  In both cases, we can achieve the goal by techniques like deliberately adding noise to the outcome before returning it.  This paper proves a new and general connection between the two subjects.  Specifically, we show that on products of n quantum states, any measurement that is α-gentle for small α is also O(α)-DP, and any product measurement that is ε-DP is also O(ε√n)-gentle.
<p>Illustrating the power of this connection, we apply it to the recently studied problem of <i>shadow tomography</i>.  Given an unknown d-dimensional quantum state ρ, as well as known two-outcome measurements E<sub>1</sub>,…,E<sub>m</sub>, shadow tomography asks us to estimate Pr[E<sub>i</sub> accepts ρ], for <i>every</i> i∈[m], by measuring few copies of ρ.  Using our connection theorem, together with a quantum analog of the so-called <i>private multiplicative weights</i> algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum, we give a protocol to solve this problem using O((log m)<sup>2</sup>(log d)<sup>2</sup>) copies of ρ, compared to Aaronson’s previous bound of ~O((log m)<sup>4</sup>(log d)).  Our protocol has the advantages of being <i>online</i> (that is, the E<sub>i</sub>‘s are processed one at a time), gentle, and conceptually simple.
</p><p>Other applications of our connection include new <i>lower</i> bounds for shadow tomography from lower bounds on DP, and a result on the safe use of estimation algorithms as subroutines inside larger quantum algorithms.</p></blockquote>



<p>The second paper, with Robin Kothari, UT Austin PhD student William Kretschmer, and Justin Thaler, is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08914">Quantum Lower Bounds for Approximate Counting via Laurent Polynomials</a>.  Here’s the abstract:</p>



<blockquote>Given only a membership oracle for S, it is well-known that approximate counting takes Θ(√(N/|S|)) quantum queries.  But what if a quantum algorithm is also given “QSamples”—i.e., copies of the state |S〉=Σ<sub>i∈S</sub>|i〉—or even the ability to apply reflections about |S〉?  Our first main result is that, even then, the algorithm needs either Θ(√(N/|S|)) queries or else Θ(min{|S|<sup>1/3</sup>,√(N/|S|)}) reflections or samples.  We also give matching upper bounds.

<p>We prove the lower bound using a novel generalization of the polynomial method of Beals et al. to <i>Laurent polynomials</i>, which can have negative exponents.  We lower-bound Laurent polynomial degree using two methods: a new “explosion argument” that pits the positive- and negative-degree parts of the polynomial against each other, and a new formulation of the dual polynomials method.

</p><p>Our second main result rules out the possibility of a black-box Quantum Merlin-Arthur (or QMA) protocol for proving that a set is large. More precisely, we show that, even if Arthur can make T quantum queries to the set S⊆[N], and also receives an m-qubit quantum
witness from Merlin in support of S being large, we have Tm=Ω(min{|S|,√(N/|S|)}).  This resolves the open problem of giving an oracle separation between SBP, the complexity class that captures
approximate counting, and QMA.

</p><p>Note that QMA is “stronger” than the queries+QSamples model in that Merlin’s witness can be anything, rather than just the specific state |S〉, but also “weaker” in that Merlin’s witness cannot be trusted.  Intriguingly, Laurent polynomials <i>also</i> play a crucial role in our QMA lower bound, but in a completely different
manner than in the queries+QSamples lower bound.  This suggests that the “Laurent polynomial method” might be broadly useful in complexity theory.</p></blockquote>



<p>I need to get ready for our family’s Seder now, but after that, I’m happy to answer any questions about either of these papers in the comments.</p>



<p>Meantime, the biggest breakthrough in quantum complexity theory of the past month isn’t either of the above: it’s the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05870">paper by Anand Natarajan and John Wright</a> showing that MIP*, or multi-prover interactive proof systems with entangled provers, contains NEEXP, or nondeterministic <strong>doubly</strong>-exponential time (!!).  I’ll try to blog about this later, but if you can’t wait, check out <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2019/04/14/randomness-and-interaction-entanglement-ups-the-game/">this excellent post by Thomas Vidick</a>.</p></div>

<p>
Valentine Kabanets is a famous complexity theorist from Simon Fraser University. He has been at the forefront of lower bounds for over two decades. </p>
<p>
Today we draw attention to this work and raise an idea about trying to unravel what makes circuit lower bounds hard.<span id="more-15768"></span></p>
<p>
He is the common author on <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/022/">two</a> new <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/018/">papers</a> on the Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP), which belongs to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> but is not known to be complete or in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" />. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/news-on-intermediate-problems/">posted</a> on MCSP four years ago and mentioned his 1999 <a href="http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/1999/045">paper</a> with Jin-Yi Cai, which gives evidence for MCSP truly being neither complete nor in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" />. This “intermediate” status and the problem’s simplicity have raised hopes that direct attacks might succeed. The new papers prove direct lower bounds against some restricted circuit/formula models, including constant-depth circuits with mod-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> gates for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> prime. But they stop short of mod-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> composite and other barrier cases.</p>
<p>
He has a nifty research <a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~kabanets/research.html">statement</a> on his home page. It shows how derandomization, pseudorandomness, circuit complexity, and crypto combine into his two current projects. In a clickable tab for the third heading, he puts the meta-issue in pithy terms:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Why is proving circuit lower bounds so difficult?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
His first answer tab speaks a connection we have also often emphasized here:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Traditionally, designing efficient algorithms is the subject of the theory of algorithms, while lower bounds are sought in complexity theory. It turns out, however, that there is a deep connection between the two directions: better algorithms (for a certain class of problems) also yield strong lower bounds (for related problems), and vice versa: strong lower bounds translate into more efficient algorithms. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course we agree, and we love connections shown in the new papers to problems such as distinguishing a very slightly biased coin from a true one. But we will try to supplement the algorithmic view of circuit lower bounds with a direct look at the underlying logic.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Logical Structure of Lower Bounds </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Okay we all know that circuit lower bounds are hard. For all Kabanets’ success and beautiful work—he like the rest of the complexity field—are unable to prove what we believe is true. They cannot in the full circuit model prove anything close to what is believed to be true for at least a half a century: There are explicit Boolean functions that cannot be computed by any linear size circuit.</p>
<p>
We feel that the logical structure of lower bounds statements gives insight into their difficulty. Perhaps this is almost a tautology. Of course the logical structure of any mathematical statement helps us understand its inherent difficulty. But we believe more: That this structure can reveal quite a bit about lower bounds. Let’s take a look at lower bounds and see if this belief holds up.</p>
<p>
In particular let’s compare the two main approaches to proving lower bounds: non-uniform and uniform. Our claim is that they have different logical structure, and that this difference explains why there is such a gap between the two. While lower bounds—non-uniform or uniform—are hard, uniform ones are at least possible now. Non-uniform lower bounds are really very difficult.</p>
<p>
Here is one example. To prove an explicit size lower bound for Boolean circuits—we’ll be content with just a linear one—we must give a particular family of Boolean functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bn%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{n}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{n}(x)}" /> (each of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> inputs) so that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> we can evaluate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bn%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{n}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{n}(x)}" /> in polynomial time; <p></p>
</li><li>
There is no Boolean circuit of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha n}" class="latex" title="{\alpha n}" /> that correctly computes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bn%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{n}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{n}(x)}" /> on all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> is a constant and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is assumed to be large enough. The terrific <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~ranraz/publications/P5nlb.pdf">paper</a> of Kazuo Iwama, Oded Lachish, Hiroki Morizumi, and Ran Raz gives explicit Boolean functions whose size for circuits with the usual <em>not</em> and binary <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> operators exceeds <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5n-o%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5n-o(n)}" class="latex" title="{5n-o(n)}" />. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Approach </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s look at the above example more carefully. Suppose that in place of a single Boolean function on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> inputs we have a list of them: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f_%7Bn%2C1%7D%28x%29%2C%5Cdots%2Cf_%7Bn%2Cm%7D%28x%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f_{n,1}(x),\dots,f_{n,m}(x). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f_{n,1}(x),\dots,f_{n,m}(x). " /></p>
<p>Can we prove the following? </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cexists+n_%7B0%7D%5C+%5Cforall+n+%3E+n_%7B0%7D+%5C+%5Cexists+f_%7Bn%2Ck%7D+%5C+%5Cforall+C+%5Cin+%5Cmathsf%7BSIZE%7D%28%5Calpha+n%29+%5C+%5Cneg%5Cmathsf%7Bcompute%7D%28C%2Cf_%7Bn%2Ck%7D%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \exists n_{0}\ \forall n &gt; n_{0} \ \exists f_{n,k} \ \forall C \in \mathsf{SIZE}(\alpha n) \ \neg\mathsf{compute}(C,f_{n,k}). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \exists n_{0}\ \forall n &gt; n_{0} \ \exists f_{n,k} \ \forall C \in \mathsf{SIZE}(\alpha n) \ \neg\mathsf{compute}(C,f_{n,k}). " /></p>
<p>The first thing to note is the effect of letting the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> of functions vary:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m = 1}" class="latex" title="{\bf m = 1}" />, this just becomes our original explicit circuit lower bound problem. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> is a huge value, however, this becomes the exponential lower bound shown by Claude Shannon—a known quantity. </p>
<p>
In our terms, the latter takes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{2^{n}}}" class="latex" title="{2^{2^{n}}}" />, so that given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> our function list is just the list of all Boolean functions. If all we care about is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha n}" class="latex" title="{\alpha n}" /> lower bound, then the high end of the range can be something like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+2%5E%7B2%5Calpha+n%5Clog%28n%29%7D+%3D+n%5E%7B2%5Calpha+n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m = 2^{2\alpha n\log(n)} = n^{2\alpha n}}" class="latex" title="{m = 2^{2\alpha n\log(n)} = n^{2\alpha n}}" />. So at the high end we have a simple counting argument for the proof but have traded away explicitness. The question will be about the tradeoffs for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> in-between the extremes.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Analogy </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The above idea that we can model the lower bound methods by controlling the length of the list of the functions is the key to our approach. Perhaps it may help to note an analogy to other famous hard problems of constructing explicit objects. In particular, let’s look at constructing transcendental numbers. Recall these are real numbers that are not algebraic: they are not roots of polynomials with integer coefficients. They include <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi+%3D+3.14159%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pi = 3.14159\dots}" class="latex" title="{\pi = 3.14159\dots}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be+%3D+2.71828%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{e = 2.71828\dots}" class="latex" title="{e = 2.71828\dots}" /></p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville_number">Liouville</a> numbers of Joseph Liouville. 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bk%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+%5Cfrac%7Ba_k%7D%7Bb%5E%7Bk%21%7D%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}. " /></p>
<p>These are explicit numbers that were proved by him in 1844 to be transcendental. In terms of our model <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m=1}" class="latex" title="{\bf m=1}" />.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The great <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" title="{\pi}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{e}" class="latex" title="{e}" /> puzzle. This is the observation that of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi+%2B+e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pi + e}" class="latex" title="{\pi + e}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi+-+e%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\pi - e}" class="latex" title="{\pi - e}" />, at least one is a transcendental number. In our terms this gives <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%3D2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m=2}" class="latex" title="{\bf m=2}" />.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> The famous theorem of Georg Cantor—read as proving the existence of transcendental numbers since algebraic ones are countable.</p>
<p>
Here the high end of the range is as extreme as can be. Cantor’s `list’ of numbers is uncountable—in our model, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> is the cardinality of the real numbers. Note, the fact that his <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> is huge, really huge, may explain why some at the time were unimpressed by this result. They wanted the ‘list’ to be small, actually they wanted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m=1}" class="latex" title="{\bf m=1}" />. See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975129?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">this</a> for a discussion of the history of these ideas.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> The theorem by Waim Zudilin, in a 2001 <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/RM2001v056n04ABEH000427/meta">paper</a>, that at least one of the numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Czeta%285%29%2C+%5Czeta%287%29%2C+%5Czeta%289%29%2C+%5Czeta%2811%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\zeta(5), \zeta(7), \zeta(9), \zeta(11)}" class="latex" title="{\zeta(5), \zeta(7), \zeta(9), \zeta(11)}" /> must be irrational. It is for “irrational” not “transcendental,” but exemplified <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m+%3D+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m = 4}" class="latex" title="{\bf m = 4}" /> in a highly nontrivial manner. The technical point that makes this work is interactions among these numbers that cannot be captured just by considering any one of them separately. This has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m+%3D+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m = 4}" class="latex" title="{\bf m = 4}" />.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Joining Functions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The issue is this: Suppose that we have a list of several boolean functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7B1%7D%28x%29%2C%5Cdots%2Cf_%7Bm%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{1}(x),\dots,f_{m}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{1}(x),\dots,f_{m}(x)}" />. Then we can join them together to form one function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{g(x,y)}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++g%28x%2C1%29+%3D+f_%7B1%7D%28x%29%2C+%5Ccdots%2C+g%28x%2Cm%29+%3D+f_%7Bm%7D%28x%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  g(x,1) = f_{1}(x), \cdots, g(x,m) = f_{m}(x). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  g(x,1) = f_{1}(x), \cdots, g(x,m) = f_{m}(x). " /></p>
<p>Clearly the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bg%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{g(x,y)}" class="latex" title="{g(x,y)}" /> is easy implies that all of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7By%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{y}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{y}(x)}" /> are easy. This join trick shows that we can encode several boolean functions into one function. Note, we can even make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> have only order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log(n)}" class="latex" title="{\log(n)}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> bits.</p>
<p>
Thus we can join any collection of functions to make a “universal” one that is at least as hard as the worst of the single functions. More precisely, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7Bcomplexity%7D%28g%29+%5Cge+%5Cmathsf%7Bcomplexity%7D%28f_%7By%7D%29+%5Ctext%7B+for+%7D+y%3D1%2C%5Cdots%2Cm.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{complexity}(g) \ge \mathsf{complexity}(f_{y}) \text{ for } y=1,\dots,m. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{complexity}(g) \ge \mathsf{complexity}(f_{y}) \text{ for } y=1,\dots,m. " /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7Bcomplexity%7D%28h%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{complexity}(h)}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{complexity}(h)}" /> is the circuit complexity of the boolean function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bh%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{h}" class="latex" title="{h}" />.</p>
<p>
If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m}" class="latex" title="{m}" /> is bigger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7BO%28n%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{O(n)}}" class="latex" title="{2^{O(n)}}" />, that is if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bm+%3D+2%5E%7B%5Comega%28n%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{m = 2^{\omega(n)}}" class="latex" title="{m = 2^{\omega(n)}}" />, then the joined function has more than linearly many variables. Can we possibly establish nontrivial interactions among so many functions, say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+m%7D+%3D+n%5E%7B2n%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\bf m} = n^{2n}}" class="latex" title="{{\bf m} = n^{2n}}" />?</p>
<p>
One can also try to get this effect with fewer or no additional variables by taking the XOR of some subset of functions in the list. If this is done randomly for each input length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> then one can expect hard functions to show up for many <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />. If this process can then be <em>de-randomized</em>, then this may yield an explicit hard function. We wonder how this idea might meld with Andy Yao’s famous XOR Lemma and conditions to <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.441.2818&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">de-randomize</a> it.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Joining Numbers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken and I thought about the above simple fact about joins, which seems special to functions. Joining by interleaving the decimal expansions is not an arithmetic operation. However, it appears that there may be a similar result possible for transcendental numbers. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 1</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" title="{\beta}" /> are real numbers. Then 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Calpha+%2B+i%5Cbeta+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \alpha + i\beta " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \alpha + i\beta " /></p>
</em><p><em>is a transcendental complex number if at least one of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" title="{\beta}" /> are transcendental. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgamma+%3D+%5Calpha+%2B+i%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\gamma = \alpha + i\beta}" class="latex" title="{\gamma = \alpha + i\beta}" /> be an algebraic number. Thus there must be a polynomial <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(x)}" class="latex" title="{q(x)}" /> with integer coefficients so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++q%28%5Cgamma%29+%3D+q%28%5Calpha+%2B+i%5Cbeta%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  q(\gamma) = q(\alpha + i\beta) = 0. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  q(\gamma) = q(\alpha + i\beta) = 0. " /></p>
<p>Then it follows by complex conjugation that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++q%28%5Calpha+-+i%5Cbeta%29+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  q(\alpha - i\beta) = 0. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  q(\alpha - i\beta) = 0. " /></p>
<p>	 Therefore <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%2B+i%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha + i\beta}" class="latex" title="{\alpha + i\beta}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+-i%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha -i\beta}" class="latex" title="{\alpha -i\beta}" /> are both algebraic; thus, so is their sum which is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2\alpha}" class="latex" title="{2\alpha}" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" /> is algebraic. It follows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbeta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\beta}" class="latex" title="{\beta}" /> is also algebraic. This shows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cgamma%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\gamma}" class="latex" title="{\gamma}" /> is transcendental. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\Box" class="latex" title="\Box" /></p>
<p>
A question: Can we show that we can do a “join” operation for three or more numbers? That is given numbers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7B1%7D%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bm%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_{1},\dots,x_{m}}" class="latex" title="{x_{1},\dots,x_{m}}" /> can we construct a number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> that is transcendental if and only if at least one of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_{i}}" class="latex" title="{x_{i}}" /> is transcendental?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>

Is the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbf+m%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bf m}" class="latex" title="{\bf m}" /> model useful? Is it possible for it to succeed where a direct explicit argument (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cbf+m%7D+%3D+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\bf m} = 1}" class="latex" title="{{\bf m} = 1}" />) does not?

One of the classic results in concurrency theory is the Hennessy-Milner Theorem. This result states that<br /><ol><li>two bisimilar states in a labelled transition system satisfy exactly the same formulae in a multi-modal logic now called Hennessy-Milner logic, and </li><li>two states in a labelled transition system that satisfy a mild finiteness constraint (called image finiteness)  and enjoy the same properties expressible in Hennessy-Milner logic are bisimilar.</li></ol>See, for instance, Section 1.2 in <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/cps/chapbisim.pdf">these notes by Colin Stirling</a> for an exposition of that result. A consequence of the Hennessy-Milner Theorem is that whenever two states <i>p </i>and <i>q </i>in a labelled transition system are <i>not</i> bisimilar, one can come up with a formula in Hennessy-Milner logic that <i>p </i>satisfies, but<i> q </i>does not<i>. </i>Moreover, for each state <i>p </i>in a finite, loop-free labelled transition systems, it is possible to construct a formula <i>F(p) </i>in Hennessy-Milner logic that completely characterizes <i>p</i> up to bisimilarity. This means that, for each state <i>q</i>, <i>p</i> is bisimilar to <i>q</i> if, and only if, <i>q</i> satisfies <i>F(p)</i>. The formula<i> F(p) </i>is called a characteristic formula for<i> p </i>up to bisimilarity.<i> </i>One can obtain a similar result for states in finite labelled transition systems by extending Hennessy-Milner logic with greatest fixed points. <i><br /></i><br /><br />Characteristic formulae have a long history in concurrency theory. However, to be best of my knowledge, the complexity of determining whether a formula is characteristic had not been studied before <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/antonisachilleos">Antonis Achilleos</a> first addressed the problem in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01004">this conference paper</a>. In that paper, Antonis focused on the complexity of the problem of determining whether a formula <i>F</i> is complete, in the sense that, for each formula <i>G</i>, it can derive either <i>G</i> or its negation.<br /><br />Our recent preprint    <a href="http://icetcs.ru.is/theofomon/CharFormComplexity.pdf"><i>The   Complexity of Identifying Characteristic Formulae</i></a> extends the results originally obtained by Antonis to a variety of modal logics, possibly including least and greatest fixed-point operators. In the paper, we show that completeness, characterization, and validity have the same complexity — with some exceptions for which there are, in general, no complete formulae. So, for most modal logics of interest, the problem is coNP-complete or PSPACE-complete, and becomes EXPTIME-complete for modal logics with fixed points. To prove our upper bounds, we present a nondeterministic procedure with an oracle for validity that combines tableaux and a test for bisimilarity, and determines whether a formula is complete.<br /><br />I think that there is still a lot of work that can be done in studying this problem, with respect to a variety of other notions of equivalence considered in concurrency theory, so stay tuned for further updates.</div>

<div class="content">
In differential privacy (DP), we want to query a database about $n$ users, in a way that "leaks at most $\varepsilon$ about any individual user," even conditioned on any outcome of the query.  Meanwhile, in gentle measurement, we want to measure $n$ quantum states, in a way that "damages the states by at most $\alpha$," even conditioned on any outcome of the measurement.  In both cases, we can achieve the goal by techniques like deliberately adding noise to the outcome before returning it.  This paper proves a new and general connection between the two subjects. Specifically, we show that on products of $n$ quantum states, any measurement that is $\alpha$-gentle for small $\alpha$ is also $O( \alpha)$-DP, and any product measurement that is $\varepsilon$-DP is also $O(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})$-gentle.

Illustrating the power of this connection, we apply it to the recently studied problem of shadow tomography.  Given an unknown $d$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$, as well as known two-outcome measurements $E_{1},\ldots,E_{m}$, shadow tomography asks us to estimate $\Pr\left[  E_{i}\text{ accepts }\rho\right]  $, for every $i\in\left[ m\right]  $, by measuring few copies of $\rho$. Using our connection theorem, together with a quantum analog of the so-called private multiplicative weights algorithm of Hardt and Rothblum, we give a protocol to solve this problem using $O\left( \left(  \log m\right)  ^{2}\left(  \log d\right)  ^{2}\right)$ copies of $\rho$, compared to Aaronson's previous bound of $\widetilde{O} \left(\left(  \log m\right) ^{4}\left( \log d\right)\right) $.  Our protocol has the advantages of being online (that is, the $E_{i}$'s are processed one at a time), gentle, and conceptually simple.

Other applications of our connection include new lower bounds for shadow tomography from lower bounds on DP, and a result on the safe use of estimation algorithms as subroutines inside larger quantum algorithms.</div>

Based on <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3654">Scott's review</a>, I read through Stephen Pinker's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Enlightenment-Now-Science-Humanism-Progress-ebook/dp/B073TJBYTB/ref=as_li_ss_tl?crid=2O1U6VZR84R2Q&amp;keywords=enlightenment+now&amp;qid=1554897483&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=engligh,aps,597&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=computation09-20&amp;linkId=8f668f77297b7cd8b57a85dca27802b0&amp;language=en_US">Enlightenment Now</a>. I can't top Scott's exposition of the book, but it is pretty incredible how far humanity has gone when you step back to look at the big picture.<br />
<br />
One line intrigued me, one that Pinker credits to a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Big-Picture-Origins-Meaning-Universe/dp/1101984252/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=computation09-20&amp;linkId=6c644c72e1d0c1f818a5907f9b221ce1&amp;language=en_US">The Big Picture</a> by Sean Carroll<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
The laws of physics underlying everyday life (that is excluding extreme values of energy and gravitation like black holes, dark matter and the Big Bang) are <i>completely known.</i></blockquote>
Hasn't this statement almost always been true, in the sense that the leading minds would make this claim at many times in history. The ancient Greeks probably believed they understood physics that underlies everyday life. So did physicists after Newton. Life back then not today. My everyday life involves using a GPS device that requires understanding relativistic effects and computer chips that needed other scientific advances.<br />
<br />
Is it possible we could do more in everyday life if we knew more physics? I'd certainly use a teleporter in everyday life.<br />
<br />
And is the statement even true today? We all use public key cryptography, even to read this blog. It's not completely clear if we understand the physics enough to know how or if large-scale quantum computers capable of breaking those systems can be built.<br />
<br />
Everday life is relative.</div>

Blasiok (SODA'18) recently introduced the notion of a subgaussian sampler, defined as an averaging sampler for approximating the mean of functions $f:\{0,1\}^m \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(U_m)$ has subgaussian tails, and asked for explicit constructions. In this work, we give the first explicit constructions of subgaussian samplers (and in fact averaging samplers for the broader class of subexponential functions) that match the best-known constructions of averaging samplers for $[0,1]$-bounded functions in the regime of parameters where the approximation error $\varepsilon$ and failure probability $\delta$ are subconstant. Our constructions are established via an extension of the standard notion of randomness extractor (Nisan and Zuckerman, JCSS'96) where the error is measured by an arbitrary divergence rather than total variation distance, and a generalization of Zuckerman's equivalence (Random Struct. Alg.'97) between extractors and samplers. We believe that the framework we develop, and specifically the notion of an extractor for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, are of independent interest. In particular, KL-extractors are stronger than both standard extractors and subgaussian samplers, but we show that they exist with essentially the same parameters (constructively and non-constructively) as standard extractors.</div>

<p>Recently a Twitter account started called <a href="https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice">justsaysinmice</a>.  The only thing this account does, is to repost breathless news articles about medical research breakthroughs that fail to mention that the effect in question was only observed in mice, and then add the words “IN MICE” to them.  Simple concept, but it already seems to be changing the conversation about science reporting.</p>



<p>It occurred to me that we could do something analogous for quantum computing.  While my own deep-seated aversion to Twitter prevents me from doing it myself, which of my readers is up for starting an account that just reposts one overhyped QC article after another, while appending the words “A CLASSICAL COMPUTER COULD ALSO DO THIS” to each one?</p></div>

<h3>Sweden</h3>
<p>I just came back from a trip to Sweden and the U.K. I was invited to Gothenburg to be the opponent for a Ph. D. Candidate  Malin Palö Forsström (by now Dr. Malin Palö Forsström),  who wrote her excellent Ph. D. thesis under the supervision of Jeff Steif in Chalmers University. We also used the opportunity for a lovely mini-mini-workshop</p>
<p>From Gothenburg I took the train to Stockholm to spend the weekend with Anders Björner and we talked about some old projects regarding algebraic shifting.  We had dinner with several colleagues including Svante Linusson who is a candidate for the European parliament!</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/acg80s.jpeg"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/acg80s.jpeg?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17296" /></a> <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/20190407_194045.jpg"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/20190407_194045.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-17297" height="168" /></a></p>

<h3>The United Kingdom</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/maths/bmc2019/">British Mathematical Colloquium at Lancaster</a> was a lovely 4-day general meeting, an opportunity to meet some old and new friends (and Internet MO friend <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/users/763/yemon-choi">Yemon Choi</a> in real life), and to learn about various new developments. I am aware of the fact that my list of unfulfilled promises is longer than those of most politicians, but I do hope to come back to some mathematics from this trip to Sweden and to Lancaster.</p>
<h3>Election Day</h3>
<p>Last week’s Tuesday was election day in Israel,  and as much as I like to participate (and to devote a post to election day here on the blog – in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/majority-rules-the-story-of-achnais-oven/">2009</a>, <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/election-day/">2012</a>, and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/election-day-2/">2015</a>) I had to miss the election, for the first time since 1985. (I still tried to follow the outcomes in real time.)</p>
<h3>The Negev, Israel</h3>
<p>And we are now spending a three-day vacation and doing some mild hiking in Mitzpe Ramon, in the Negev, the Israeli desert.  The view around here is spectacular. I first fell in love with the sights of the Negev when I spent six months here when I was 19 (in the army). Since then we have been caming here many times over the years, and in 2002 the annual meeting of the Israeli Mathematical Union took place here, in the same hotel.</p>

<h3>The stance of the main Israeli parties on quantum computing</h3>
<p>One anecdote about the Israeli election is that both major political parties of Israel, the Likud, led by Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu that won 35 seats in the parliament and will probably lead the coalition, and the newly formed “Blue-and-White” party, led by Benny (Benjamin) Gantz that also won 35 seats and will probably lead the opposition, stand behind quantum computing! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

 Last year I took some time off to study online convex optimization in some detail. The reason for doing that was similar to the reason why at some point I took time off to study spectral graph theory: it was coming up in several papers that I wanted to understand, and I felt that I was missing out by not mastering an important tool. In particular, I wanted to understand: </p>
<ol>
<li> The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1496770.1496899">Barak-Hardt-Kale</a> proof of the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/492584">Impagliazzo hard-core lemma</a>.
</li><li> The online convex optimization viewpoint on the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/548459">Frieze-Kannan weak regularity lemma</a>, on the dense model theorem of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4690942">(RTTV)</a>, and on the abstract weak regularity lemma of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5231258">(TTV)</a> that were described to me by Madhur Tulsiani a few years ago. Furthermore, I wanted to see if Russel Impagliazzo’s subsequent improvements to the dense model theorem and to the abstract weak regularity lemma could be recovered from this point of view.
</li><li> The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2906142.2837020">Arora-Kale</a> algorithms for semidefinite programming, including their nearly linear-time algorithm for approximating the Goemans-Williamson relaxation of Max Cut.
</li><li> The meaning of the sentence “multiplicative weights and gradient descent are both special cases of follow-the-regularized-leader, using negative entropy and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cell_2%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ell_2^2}" class="latex" title="{\ell_2^2}" /> as regularizer, respectively.”
</li><li> The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04838">AllenZhu-Liao-Orecchia</a> online optimization proof of the Batson-Spielman-Srivastava sparsification result.
</li></ol>
<p>
I am happy to say that, except for the “furthermore” part of (2), I achieved my goals. To digest this material a bit better, I came up with the rather ambitious plan of writing a series of posts, in which I would alternate between (i) explaining a notion or theorem from online convex optimization (at a level that someone learning about optimization or machine learning might find useful) and (ii) explaining a complexity-theoretic application. Now that a very intense Spring semester is almost over, I plan to get started on this plan, although it is not clear that I will see it through the end. So stay tuned for the forthcoming first episode, which will be about the good old multiplicative weights algorithm.</p>

<p>Both books talk about the early years of computing in Italy, on the industrial and academic side, respectively. They briefly intersect with the story of Olivetti’s Elea computer.</p>
<p><span id="more-4224"></span></p>
<p>Olivetti was a company that was founded in 1908 to make typewriters, and then branched out to other office/business machines and avionics. In the 1930s, Adriano Olivetti, a son of the founder Camillo Olivetti, took over the company. Adriano Olivetti was an unusual figure of entrepreneur deeply interested in arts, humanities and social sciences, with a utopian vision of a company reinvesting its profits in its community. In the 1950s, he led the company to develop the Elea, the first Italian computer. The Elea was made with transistors, and it came out before IBM had built its own first transistor-based computer.</p>
<p>The development of Elea was led by Mario Tchou. Mario Tchou was a Chinese-Italian born and raised in Rome, who studied electrical engineering at the Sapienza University of Rome and then at Brooklyn Polytechnic, eventually becoming an assistant professor at Columbia University. Olivetti persuaded Tchou to move back to Italy and lead the development of Elea, whose first prototype came out in 1957. </p>
<p>As production was ramping up, tragedy struck: Adriano Olivetti died in 1960, and Mario Tchou died in 1961. To shore up the finances of the company, the new CEO Roberto Olivetti brought in a series of new investors, who pushed to spin off the computer business.</p>
<p>At that point, Olivetti was working on another revolutionary machine, the P101, a programmable desktop calculator billed as the “first desktop computer,” which came out in 1964, attracting huge interest. Nonetheless the company spun off its “computer” division into a joint venture with GE, eventually divesting of it completely. Fortunately, they kept control of the P101 project, because those working on it were careful in branding it internally as a “calculator” (not part of the of deal with GE) rather than a “computer.”</p>
<p>These events are narrated, with a fascinating insider view, in Garuzzo’s book.</p>
<p>Giorgio Ausiello is one of the founding fathers of academic computer science in Italy. His book is a professional memoir that starts in the 1960s, at the time in which he started working on his undergraduate thesis at the Istituto Nazionale per le Applicazioni del Calcolo (INAC, later renamed IAC) at the National Research Council in Rome. At that point INAC had one of Italy’s few computers, a machine bought in 1954 from the Ferranti company in Manchester (when it was installed, it was Italy’s <i>second</i> computer).</p>
<p>As narrated in a <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/corrado-bohm/">previous post</a>, Mauro Picone, the mathematician who was leading INAC, brought Corrado Bohm to Rome to work on this computer, and Ausiello started to work with Bohm at the time in which he was just starting to think about models of computation and lambda-calculus.</p>
<p>Later, Ausiello visited Berkeley in the 1968-69 academic year, when Manuel Blum and Dick Karp had just joined the faculty. Ausiello took part in the first STOC, which was held in Marina del Rey in May 1969, and, later that month, he witnessed the occupation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Park_(Berkeley)">People’s Park</a> in Berkeley.</p>
<p>The Fall of 1969 marks the start of the first Italian undergraduate programs in Computer Science, in just four universities:  Bari, <del datetime="2019-04-17T11:04:18-07:00">Milan,</del> Pisa and Torino. Back in Italy from Berkeley, Ausiello continued to work at the National Research Council in Rome.</p>
<p>The book continues with a behind-the-scene narration of the events that led to the founding of the EATCS professional society, the ICALP conference and the TCS journal. There is also another trip to Berkeley in the 1980s, featuring Silvio Micali and Vijay Vazirani working on their matching algorithm, and Shafi Goldwasser just arriving in Berkeley.</p>
<p>Methodically documented and very detail-oriented, the book is a fascinating read, although it leaves you sometimes wanting to hear more about the personalities and the stories of the people involved and less about the attendance lists of certain meetings.</p>
<p>Even when it comes to the dryer details, however, I am happy that the books documents them and makes them available to future generations that will not have any living memory of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>I should also mention that Alon Rosen has recently interviewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKCE7QnsFcw&amp;t=67s">Christos Papadimitriou</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GQnK6ys6C0&amp;t=20s">Avi Wigderson</a> and those (<i>long</i>) interviews are full of good stories. Finally, the Simons Foundation site has an <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2013/02/14/laszlo-lovasz/">interview of Laszlo Lovasz</a> in conversation with Avi Wigderson which I very highly recommend everybody to watch.</p></div>

<div class="content">
A random variable $X$ is an $(n,k)$-zero-fixing source if for some subset $V\subseteq[n]$, $X$ is the uniform distribution on the strings $\{0,1\}^n$ that are zero on every coordinate outside of $V$. An $\epsilon$-extractor for $(n,k)$-zero-fixing sources is a mapping $F:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$, for some $m$, such that $F(X)$ is $\epsilon$-close in statistical distance to the uniform distribution on $\{0,1\}^m$ for every $(n,k)$-zero-fixing source $X$. Zero-fixing sources were introduced by Cohen and Shinkar in~2015 in connection with the previously studied extractors for bit-fixing sources. They constructed, for every $\mu&gt;0$, an efficiently computable extractor that extracts a positive fraction of entropy, i.e., $\Omega(k)$ bits, from $(n,k)$-zero-fixing sources where $k\geq(\log\log n)^{2+\mu}$. 

In this paper we present two different constructions of extractors for zero-fixing sources that are able to extract a positive fraction of entropy for $k$ essentially smaller than $\log\log n$. The first extractor works for $k\geq C\log\log\log n$, for some constant $C$. The second extractor extracts a positive fraction of entropy for $k\geq \log^{(i)}n$ for any fixed $i\in \N$, where $\log^{(i)}$ denotes $i$-times iterated logarithm. The fraction of extracted entropy decreases with $i$. The first extractor is a function computable in polynomial time in~$n$ (for $\epsilon=o(1)$, but not too small); the second one is computable in polynomial time when $k\leq\alpha\log\log n/\log\log\log n$, where $\alpha$ is a positive constant.</div>

<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="822b">The year was 2005. I was applying for a PhD program in Computer Science in the top US universities. I have applied to 14 US universities. On Dec 2nd 2015, I received the following email (see the screenshot below) from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), Penn Engineering, Office of Academic Programs, Graduate Admissions. I have redacted the name, email address and the phone numbers in the emails, to preserve their privacy.</p>
<p><img src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/upenn1.png?w=660" alt="upenn1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1226" /></p>
<p>Here are the photos of the original transcript (I received from IIT Kharagpur when I graduated) and the additional transcripts (I received from IIT Kharagpur when I requested them for my PhD application). They are all <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">laminated by IIT Kharagpur</strong> and sent to me. Feel free to laugh at my appearance on the transcript. I do too <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><img src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/kgp.jpeg?w=660" alt="kgp" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1227" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="e20e">IIT Kharagpur stated the following in their transcripts policy.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p" id="60be"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Institute does not take responsibility of sending the duplicate copy of grade cards (transcripts) directly to other institutions/organizations, in connection with the applicants’ admission/employment etc.”</em></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="a381">My reply to the above email and the response from UPenn are shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<p><img src="https://kintali.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/upenn2.png?w=660" alt="upenn2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1228" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="1fc0">In Summary, UPenn was concerned that my transcript is laminated and opened. Surprised at their response (“Your application will not go any further with the opened transcript”), I have spent couple of hours searching online and discovered that there is a lot of scam involving fake degrees and fake transcripts. There are “professionals” in India and China creating the “highest quality fakes”. These fakes are often laminated. So, UPenn decided not to process any applications with opened and laminated credentials. All my credentials are valid and correct, but my application was not processed because IIT Kharagpur has no way to “securely send” valid transcripts and UPenn has no way to “efficiently validate applicants’ transcripts”.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="0588">I have applied to 14 universities and some of them rejected me because ‘they found a better candidate’ or ‘the research group is not looking for new PhD students’ etc etc. But my UPenn application not going further because of an “inefficient and broken system” is frustrating, to say the least.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="291f">After a week, I have recovered from this frustration and went back to my daily routine of reading research papers on Theoretical Computer Science. I said to myself “I will get into one of the remaining 13 universities and I have to focus on research and resolve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">P vs NP problem</a>” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="bc4f"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">On a lighter note:</strong> There is a simple way to verify that my transcript is valid — ‘Simply open it and look at my grades’. I have received several B’s, some C’s and even couple of D’s. My CGPA is just average. Nobody in their right senses would create a fake transcript with those grades <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> During the last decade, whenever I met any IITian I first set them up telling <a href="http://shivakintali.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">my credentials</a> (B-Tech from IIT Kharagpur, Masters from USC, PhD from GeorgiaTech, Taught at Princeton) and after they say “wow”, I bet with them that their CGPA at IIT is greater than mine. I never lost till date. I take pride in this fact <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> In my defense, I was an all-rounder at IIT Kharagpur, balancing studies, serving as a ‘secretary of fine arts, modeling and dramatics’ of my hostel, painting, learning guitar and many more things.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p" id="d9e1"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">A second incident:</strong> During summer 2010 (at the end of my fourth year as a PhD student at GeorgiaTech), I was offered an internship at Yahoo labs and the Yahoo HR team said they want to verify all my credentials (my IIT B-Tech degree, USC Master’s degree, work experience). Yahoo uses a third-party service to rigorously verify all credentials of potential employees / interns. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/farewell-yahoo-ceo-scott-thompson-ousted-for-a-resume-lie" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yahoo fired their own CEO</a> when they found that he lied in his resume. This process is very rigorous, but very time-consuming. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">verification of all my credentials took more than couple of months</strong>.

About a month ago (after my P NP poll appeared) I got email from Jacob Aron asking me some questions about it. One thing he was excited about was that the number of people who thought P vs NP would be solved in the next decade had increased from 11% to 22%. I told him that this also surprised me and <i>there had been no major advances to warrant that increase.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
Then the article came out. Here is the pointer to the headline and the first few lines, the rest is behind a paywall<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2198151-we-could-solve-the-biggest-problem-in-maths-in-the-next-decade/">here</a><br />
<br />
You may notice that the headline is<br />
<br />
<i>We could solve the biggest problem in math in the next decade</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
I emailed Jacob to send me the article, which he did. The article was fine, even quoting me as saying that the increase of people who thought it would be solved soon was unwarranted.<br />
<br />
1) So, article fine, headline terrible.<br />
<br />
2)  A more honest headline would be<br />
<br />
<i>The Complexity Theory Community slightly more optimistic about when P vs NP will be resolved for no apparent reason.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
3) More bad science:<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329780-400-turings-oracle-the-computer-that-goes-beyond-logic/">here</a><br />
<br />
Headline is<br />
<br />
<i>Turing's Oracle: The computer that goes beyond logic</i><br />
<br />
I think the article was about how a Turing Machine with an oracle for HALT can solve HALT. (If I am wrong about this let me know in the comments and I'll correct it.)<br />
<br />
4) More bad science:<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/finally-a-problem-that-only-quantum-computers-will-ever-be-able-to-solve-20180621/">here</a><br />
<br />
Headline<br />
<br />
<i>Finally, a problem that only Quantum Computers will ever be able to solve.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
This was about the oracle such that BQP is not in PH. Really!<br />
<br />
5) I invite you to add your own.<br />
<br />
6) OKAY, so why is the press SO BAD at reporting on our field? And is it just our field? I have one explanation, though I am sure there are many.<br />
<br />
Our field is about showing the LIMITS of computation. Its hard to make that sexy so they ... lie? exaggerate. They themselves don't really understand our field? Note:<br />
<br />
To explain to someone who does not really know CS why its important to have an oracle where BQP is not in PH is hard<br />
<br />
To explain this to someone IN CS but not in Theory is still hard!<br />
<br />
To explain this to someone IN CS and even in CS Theory, but not complexity (e.g., algorithms) might be hard, though it may depend on the person.<br />
<br />
7) The old saying is `I don't care if you get the story wrong so long as you spell my name right' And indeed, they did spell my name right. So there is that! But more seriously and less about me or even the article that refers to my poll--- is it bad that science reporting is often wrong?<br />

<p><em>by <a href="http://www.abbyvansoest.com/">Abby van Soest</a> and Elad Hazan, based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">this paper</a> </em></p>
<p>When humans interact with the environment, we receive a series of signals that indicate the value of our actions. We know that chocolate tastes good, sunburns feel bad, and certain actions generate praise or disapproval from others. Generally speaking, we learn from these signals and adapt our behavior in order to get more positive “rewards” and fewer negative ones.</p>
<p><i>Reinforcement learning</i> (RL) is a sub-field of machine learning that formally models this setting of learning through interaction in a reactive environment. In RL, we have an <b>agent</b> and an <b>environment</b>. The agent observes its position (or “state”) in the environment and takes actions that transition it to a new state. The environment looks at an agent’s state and hands out rewards based on a hidden set of criteria.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="360" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null.png?w=360&amp;h=145" title="" height="145" /></p>
<p><i>Source: <a href="http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf">Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</a>. Sutton &amp; Barto, 2017.</i></p>
<p>Typically, the goal of RL is for the agent to learn behavior that maximizes<i> </i>the total reward it receives from the environment. This methodology has led to some notable successes: machines have learned how to<a href="https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/"> play Atari games</a>, how to <a href="https://sigmoidal.io/alphago-how-it-uses-reinforcement-learning-to-beat-go-masters/">beat human masters</a> of Go, and how to write <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224704/ai-machine-learning-language-models-read-write-openai-gpt2">long-form responses</a> to an essay prompt.</p>
<h2>But what can we learn without an external reward signal?</h2>
<p>It seems like a paradoxical question to ask, given that RL is all about rewards. But even though the reward paradigm is fundamentally flexible in many ways, it is also brittle and limits the agent’s ability to learn about its environment. This is due to several reasons. First, a reward signal directs the agents towards a single specific goal that may not generalize. Second, the reward signal may be sparse and uninformative, as we illustrate below.</p>
<p>Imagine that you want a robot to learn to navigate through the following maze.</p>
<p><b>Case 1: Sparse Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 when it exits the maze, and a reward of 0 everywhere else. The agent doesn’t learn anything until it stumbles upon the exit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Clear reward signals are not always available.</p>
<p><b>Case 2: Misleading Rewards.</b> The agent gets a reward of +1 at the entrance and a reward of +10 at the exit. The agent incorrectly learns to sit at the entrance because it hasn’t explored its environment sufficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">⇒ Rewards can <i>prevent</i> discovery of the full environment.</p>
<p>These issues are easy to overcome in the small maze on the left. But what about the maze on the right? As the size of the environment grows, it’ll get harder and harder to find the correct solution — the intractability of the problem scales exponentially.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="244" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/image.png?w=244&amp;h=238" title="" height="238" /><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/pasted-image-0.png?w=1100" alt="pasted image 0.png" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-130" /></p>
<p>So what we find is that there is power<i> </i>in being able to learn effectively in the <b>absence</b> of rewards. This intuition is supported by a body of research that shows learning fails when rewards aren’t dense or are <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/cs287-fa09/readings/NgHaradaRussell-shaping-ICML1999.pdf">poorly shaped</a>; and fixing these problems can require substantial engineering effort.</p>
<p>By enabling agents to discover the environment without the requirement of a reward signal, we create a more<b> flexible and generalizable</b> form of reinforcement learning. This framework can be considered a form of “unsupervised” RL. Rather than relying on explicit and inherently limited signals (or “labels”), we can deal with a broad, unlabelled pool of data. Learning from this pool facilitates a more general extraction of knowledge from the environment.</p>
<h2>Our new approach: Maximum Entropy</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690">recent work</a>, we propose finding a policy that maximizes entropy (which we refer to as a MaxEnt policy), or another related and concave function of the distribution. This objective is reward-independent and favors exploration.</p>
<p>In the video below, a two-dimensional cheetah robot learns to run backwards and forwards, move its legs fast and in all different directions, and even do flips. The cheetah doesn’t have access to any external rewards; it only uses signals from the MaxEnt policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<div style="width: 1100px; height: 620px;" class="video-player" id="v-ro0BDWO4-1">
</div>
<p>Entropy is a function of the distribution over states. A high entropy distribution visits all states with near-equal frequency — it’s a <i>uniform</i> distribution. On the other hand, a low entropy distribution is biased toward visiting some states more frequently than others. (In the maze example, a low entropy distribution would result from the agent sitting at the entrance of the maze forever.)</p>
<p><img src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/sladx3i4fcsebwejbiohb_g.png?w=1100" alt="slAdX3I4FcseBWeJbioHb_g.png" class=" size-full wp-image-129 aligncenter" /></p>
<p>So given that policy <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\pi" class="latex" title="\pi" /> creates a distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d_%5Cpi&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="d_\pi" class="latex" title="d_\pi" /> over states, the problem we are hoping to solve is:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cpi%5E%2A+%3D+%5Carg+%5Cmax_%7B%5Cpi%7D+%5Ctext%7Bentropy%7D%28d_%5Cpi%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " class="latex" title="\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} \text{entropy}(d_\pi) " /></p>
<p>When we know all the states, actions, and dynamics of a given environment, finding the policy with maximum entropy is a concave optimization problem. This type of problem can be easily and exactly solved by convex programming.</p>
<p>But we very rarely have all that knowledge available to use. In practice, one of several complications usually arise:</p>
<ol>
<li>The states are <b>non-linearly approximated </b>by a neural network or some other function approximator.</li>
<li>The transition dynamics are unknown.</li>
<li>The state space is intractably large. (As an interesting example, the game of Go has more than<b> one googol or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="10^{100}" class="latex" title="10^{100}" /></b> possible states. That’s more than the number of atoms in the universe, according to <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html">this blog</a> from 2016, and definitely more than can fit on a computer.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In such cases, the problem of finding a max-entropy policy becomes non-convex and computationally hard.</p>
<p>So what to do? If we look at many practical RL problems (Atari, OpenAI Gym), we see that there are many known, efficient solvers that can construct an optimal (or nearly-optimal) policy when they are <i>given a reward signal</i>.</p>
<p>We thus consider an <i>oracle model</i>: let’s assume that we have access to one of these solvers, so that we can pass it an explicit reward vector and receive an optimal policy in return. Can we now maximize entropy in a provably efficient way? In other words, is it possible to reduce this high complexity optimization problem to that of “standard” RL?</p>
<p>Our approach does exactly that! It is based on the Frank-Wolfe method. This is a gradient-based optimization algorithm that is particularly suited for oracle-based optimization. Instead of moving in the direction of the steepest decline of the objective function, the Frank-Wolfe method iteratively moves in the direction of the optimal point in the direction of the gradient. This is depicted below (and deserves a separate post…). The Frank-Wolfe method is a projection-free algorithm, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GIDnw7T-NT4Do3eC0B5kYJlzwOs6nzIO/view">this exposition</a> about its theoretical properties.</p>

<p>For the exact specification of the algorithm and its performance guarantee, see<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02690"> our paper</a>.</p>
<h2>Experiments</h2>
<p>To complement the theory, we also created some experiments to test the MaxEnt algorithm on simulated robotic locomotion tasks (<a href="https://github.com/abbyvansoest/maxent/tree/refactor">open source code available here</a>). We used test environments from <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">OpenAI Gym</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py">Mujoco</a> and trained MaxEnt experts for various environments.</p>
<p>These are some results from the Humanoid experiment, where the agent is a human-like bipedal robot. The behavior of the MaxEnt agent (blue) is baselined against a random agent (orange), who explores by sampling randomly from the environment. This random approach is often used in practice for epsilon-greedy RL exploration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="442" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-1.png?w=442&amp;h=332" title="" height="332" /></p>
<p>In this figure, we see that over the course of 25 epochs, the MaxEnt agent progressively increases the total entropy over the state space.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="460" alt="" src="https://minimizingregret.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/null-2.png?w=460&amp;h=345" title="" height="345" /></p>
<p>Here, we see a visualization of the Humanoid’s coverage of the $xy$-plane, where the shown plane is of size 40-by-40. After one epoch, there is <b>minimal</b> coverage of the area. But by the 5th, 10th, and 15th epoch, we see that the agent has learned to visit all the different states in the plane, obtaining full and nearly uniform coverage of the grid!</p>

<p>Color the points of an  grid with two colors. How big a monochromatic grid-like subset can you find? By “grid-like” I mean that it should be possible to place equally many horizontal and vertical lines, partitioning the plane into  cells each of which contains a single point.</p>

<p>So for the coloring of the  grid below, there are several  monochromatic grid-like subsets. The image below shows one, and the completely red and blue southwest and northeast quadrants provide two others.
The blue quadrant prevents any red grid-like subset from being larger than , and vice versa, so these are the largest grid-like subsets in this grid.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/subgrid.svg" alt="Monochromatic grid-like subset in a colored grid" /></p>

<p>It’s not hard to prove that there always exists a monochromatic grid-like subset of size at least .
Just use vertical and horizontal lines to partition the big grid into blocks of that size. If one of those blocks is monochromatic, then it’s the grid-like subset you’re looking for. And if not, you can choose a red point from each block to get a grid-like subset of the same size.</p>

<p>In the other direction, there exist colorings of an  grid for which the largest monochromatic grid-like subset has size only a little bigger, . To find such a coloring, partition the big grid into square blocks of size , and make each block monochromatic with a randomly chosen color.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/blocked-coloring.svg" alt="Coloring a grid by dividing into square blocks and coloring each block randomly" /></p>

<p>Now, consider any partition by axis-parallel lines into (irregular) rectangles, each containing one of the points of a grid-like subset.  Only one row or column of the rectangles can cross each line of the partition into square blocks, so the number of rectangles that include parts of two or more square blocks is . Any remaining rectangles of the partition must come from a grid-like subset of square blocks that are all colored the same as each other. But with a random coloring, the expected size of this largest monochromatic subset of square blocks is . Therefore, the number of rectangles that stay within a single square block is limited to the total number of points in this grid-like subset of square blocks, which is again .</p>

<p>I’m not sure how to eliminate the remaining  gap between these two bounds, or which way it should go.</p>

<p>One application of these ideas involves the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpattern">superpatterns</a>, permutations that contain as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_pattern">pattern</a> every smaller permutation up to some size .
If  is a superpattern for the permutations of size , then we can obtain a point set by interpreting the position and value of each element of  as Cartesian coordinates. This point set includes a grid-like subset of size , coming from a permutation of size  that translates to a grid-like set of points.
If the elements of the superpattern are colored with two colors, there still exists a monochromatic grid-like subset of size .
And this monochromatic grid-like subset corresponds to a superpattern, for permutations of size . So, whenever the elements of a superpattern are colored with two (or finitely many) colors, there remains a monochromatic subset of elements that is still a superpattern for permutations of some smaller but non-constant size.</p>

<div class="content">
For quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), a resolution system with a symmetry rule was recently introduced by Kauers and Seidl (Inf. Process. Lett. 2018). In this system, many formulas hard for QBF resolution admit short proofs.

Kauers and Seidl apply the symmetry rule on symmetries of the original formula. Here we propose a new formalism where symmetries are dynamically recomputed during the proof on restrictions of the original QBF. This presents a theoretical model for the potential use of symmetry learning as an inprocessing rule in QCDCL solving.

We demonstrate the power of symmetry learning by proving an exponential separation between Q-resolution with the symmetry rule and Q-resolution with our new symmetry learning rule. In fact, we show that bounding the number of symmetry recomputations gives rise to a hierarchy of QBF resolution systems of strictly increasing strength.</div>

A locally decodable code (LDC) C:{0,1}^k -&gt; {0,1}^n is an error correcting code wherein individual bits of the message can be recovered by only querying a few bits of a noisy codeword. LDCs found a myriad of applications both in theory and in practice, ranging from probabilistically checkable proofs to distributed storage. However, despite nearly two decades of extensive study, the best known constructions of O(1)-query LDCs have super-polynomial blocklength.

The notion of relaxed LDCs is a natural relaxation of LDCs, which aims to bypass the foregoing barrier by requiring local decoding of nearly all individual message bits, yet allowing decoding failure (but not error) on the rest. State of the art constructions of O(1)-query relaxed LDCs achieve blocklength n = O(k^{1+ \gamma}) for an arbitrarily small constant \gamma.

We prove a lower bound which shows that O(1)-query relaxed LDCs cannot achieve blocklength n = k^{1+ o(1)}. This resolves an open problem raised by Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004).</div>
