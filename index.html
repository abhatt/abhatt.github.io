problems, namely regression and linear contextual bandits, from the perspective
of adversarial robustness. Existing works in algorithmic robust statistics make
strong distributional assumptions that ensure that the input data is evenly
spread out or comes from a nice generative model. Is it possible to achieve
strong robustness guarantees even without distributional assumptions
altogether, where the sequence of tasks we are asked to solve is adaptively and
adversarially chosen?
</p>
<p>We answer this question in the affirmative for both regression and linear
contextual bandits. In fact our algorithms succeed where convex surrogates fail
in the sense that we show strong lower bounds categorically for the existing
approaches. Our approach is based on a novel way to use the sum-of-squares
hierarchy in online learning and in the absence of distributional assumptions.
Moreover we give extensions of our main results to infinite dimensional
settings where the feature vectors are represented implicitly via a kernel map.

of $K$ of volume $1$, then the intersection of the whole family contains an
isometric copy of $K$ scaled by a factor of $(1-\varepsilon)$, where
$\varepsilon$ is positive and fixed in advance. Unless $K$ is very similar to a
disk, the shrinking factor is unavoidable. We prove similar results for affine
copies of $K$. We show how our results imply the existence of randomized
algorithms that approximate the largest copy of $K$ that fits inside a given
polytope $P$ whose expected runtime is linear on the number of facets of $P$.

permutation graphs that supports distance, adjacency, neighborhood and
shortest-path queries in optimal time; a variant of our data structure also
supports degree queries in time independent of the neighborhood's size at the
expense of an $O(\log n/\log \log n)$-factor overhead in all running times. We
show how to generalize our data structure to the class of circular permutation
graphs with asymptotically no extra space, while supporting the same queries in
optimal time. Furthermore, we develop a similar compact data structure for the
special case of bipartite permutation graphs and conjecture that it is succinct
for this class. We demonstrate how to execute algorithms directly over our
succinct representations for several combinatorial problems on permutation
graphs: Clique, Coloring, Independent Set, Hamiltonian Cycle, All-Pair Shortest
Paths, and others.
</p>
<p>Moreover, we initiate the study of semi-local graph representations; a
concept that "interpolates" between local labeling schemes and standard
"centralized" data structures. We show how to turn some of our data structures
into semi-local representations by storing only $O(n)$ bits of additional
global information, beating the lower bound on distance labeling schemes for
permutation graphs.

reusable resources where customers arrive sequentially in an adversarial
fashion and allocated resources are used or rented for a stochastic duration
that is drawn independently from known distributions. Focusing on the case of
large inventory, we give an algorithm that is $(1-1/e)$ competitive for general
usage distributions. At the heart of our result is the notion of a relaxed
online algorithm that is only subjected to fluid approximations of the
stochastic elements in the problem. The output of this algorithm serves as a
guide for the final algorithm. This leads to a principled approach for
seamlessly addressing stochastic elements (such as reusability, customer
choice, and combinations thereof) in online resource allocation problems, that
may be useful more broadly.

the Euclidean plane. It is not known whether or not these problems are NP-hard.
We present approximation algorithms with better approximation ratios for both
problems. The improved ratios are obtained mainly by employing the Steiner
ratio, which has not been used in this context earlier.
</p>
<p>(i) Longest noncrossing spanning tree: Given a set of points in the plane,
the goal is to find a maximum-length noncrossing spanning tree. Alon,
Rajagopalan, and Suri (SoCG 1993) studied this problem for the first time and
gave a $0.5$-approximation algorithm. Over the years, the approximation ratio
has been successively improved to $0.502$, $0.503$, and to $0.512$ which is the
current best ratio, due to Cabello et al.. We revisit this problem and improve
the ratio further to $0.519$. The improvement is achieved by a collection of
ideas, some from previous works and some new ideas (including the use of the
Steiner ratio), along with a more refined analysis.
</p>
<p>(ii) Longest spanning tree with neighborhoods: Given a collection of regions
(neighborhoods) in the plane, the goal is to select a point in each
neighborhood so that the longest spanning tree on selected points has maximum
length. We present an algorithm with approximation ratio $0.524$ for this
problem. The previous best ratio, due to Chen and Dumitrescu, is $0.511$ which
is in turn the first improvement beyond the trivial ratio $0.5$. Our algorithm
is fairly simple, its analysis is relatively short, and it takes linear time
after computing a diametral pair of points. The simplicity comes from the fact
that our solution belongs to a set containing three stars and one double-star.
The shortness and the improvement come from the use of the Steiner ratio.

a satisfying assignment to a formula $\varphi$ in CNF such that exactly one
literal in each clause is assigned to be "1" and the other literals in the same
clause are set to "0". Since it is an important variant of the satisfiability
problem, XSAT has also been studied heavily and has seen numerous improvements
to the development of its exact algorithms over the years.
</p>
<p>The fastest known exact algorithm to solve XSAT runs in $O(1.1730^n)$ time,
where $n$ is the number of variables in the formula. In this paper, we propose
a faster exact algorithm that solves the problem in $O(1.1674^n)$ time. Like
many of the authors working on this problem, we give a DPLL algorithm to solve
it. The novelty of this paper lies on the design of the nonstandard measure, to
help us to tighten the analysis of the algorithm further.

of sampling points from a spectrahedron, that is the feasible region of a
semidefinite program. Our main tool is geometric random walks. We analyze the
arithmetic and bit complexity of certain primitive geometric operations that
are based on the algebraic properties of spectrahedra and the polynomial
eigenvalue problem. This study leads to the implementation of a broad
collection of random walks for sampling from spectrahedra that experimentally
show faster mixing times than methods currently employed either in theoretical
studies or in applications, including the popular family of Hit-and-Run walks.
The different random walks offer a variety of advantages , thus allowing us to
efficiently sample from general probability distributions, for example the
family of log-concave distributions which arise in numerous applications. We
focus on two major applications of independent interest: (i) approximate the
volume of a spectrahedron, and (ii) compute the expectation of functions coming
from robust optimal control. We exploit efficient linear algebra algorithms and
implementations to address the aforemen-tioned computations in very high
dimension. In particular, we provide a C++ open source implementation of our
methods that scales efficiently, for the first time, up to dimension 200. We
illustrate its efficiency on various data sets.

IoT-enabled sensors deployed in different environments. Significant insights
can be obtained through mining temporal patterns from these time series. Unlike
traditional pattern mining, temporal pattern mining (TPM) adds additional
temporal aspect into extracted patterns, thus making them more expressive.
However, adding the temporal dimension into patterns results in an exponential
growth of the search space, significantly increasing the mining process
complexity. Current TPM approaches either cannot scale to large datasets, or
typically work on pre-processed event sequences rather than directly on time
series. This paper presents our comprehensive Frequent Temporal Pattern Mining
from Time Series (FTPMfTS) approach which provides the following contributions:
(1) The end-to-end FTPMfTS process that directly takes time series as input and
produces frequent temporal patterns as output. (2) The efficient Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Graph Mining (HTPGM) algorithm that uses efficient data
structures to enable fast computations for support and confidence. (3) A number
of pruning techniques for HTPGM that yield significantly faster mining. (4) An
approximate version of HTPGM which relies on mutual information to prune
unpromising time series, and thus significantly reduce the search space. (5) An
extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets from the energy and
smart city domains which shows that HTPGM outperforms the baselines and can
scale to large datasets. The approximate HTPGM achieves up to 3 orders of
magnitude speedup compared to the baselines and consumes significantly less
memory, while obtaining high accuracy compared to the exact HTPGM.

use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. Similar to previous works
like Fish et al. (WWW '19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI '19), we study the maximin
criterion for (group) fairness. In contrast to their work however, we model the
problem in such a way that, when choosing the seed sets, probabilistic
strategies are possible rather than only deterministic ones. We introduce two
different variants of this probabilistic problem, one that entails
probabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based problem) and a second one that
entails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem). While
the original deterministic problem involving the maximin criterion has been
shown to be inapproximable, interestingly, we show that both probabilistic
variants permit approximation algorithms that achieve a constant multiplicative
factor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the
simulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide
implementations of multiplicative-weight routines for both problems and compare
the achieved fairness values to existing methods. Maybe non-surprisingly, we
show that the ex-ante values of the computed probabilistic strategies are
significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods.
This indicates that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile path to
follow. Interestingly and maybe more surprisingly, we observe that even the
ex-post fairness values computed by our routines, dominate over the fairness
achieved by previous methods on most of the instances tested.

however eclipsed by the complicated and long proofs. The main purpose of this

the sum of any given function of data stream frequencies. Special cases include
fundamental data stream problems such as computing the number of distinct
elements ($F_0$), frequency moments ($F_k$), and heavy-hitters. It can also be
applied to calculate the maximum frequency of an element ($F_{\infty}$).
</p>
<p>Given that exact computation of most of these special cases provably do not
admit any sublinear space algorithm, a natural approach is to consider them in
an enhanced data streaming model, where we have a computationally unbounded but
untrusted prover sending proofs or help messages to ease the computation. Think
of a memory-restricted client delegating the computation to a stronger cloud
service whom it doesn't want to trust blindly. Using its limited memory, it
wants to verify the proof that the cloud sends. Chakrabarti et al.~(ICALP '09)
introduced this setting as the "annotated data streaming model" and showed that
multiple problems including exact computation of frequency-based
functions---that have no sublinear algorithms in basic streaming---do have
annotated streaming algorithms, also called "schemes", with both space and
proof-length sublinear in the input size.
</p>
<p>We give a general scheme for computing any frequency-based function with both
space usage and proof-size of $O(n^{2/3}\log n)$ bits, where $n$ is the size of
the universe. This improves upon the best known bound of $O(n^{2/3}\log^{4/3}
n)$ given by the seminal paper of Chakrabarti et al.~and as a result, also
improves upon the best known bounds for the important special cases of
computing $F_0$ and $F_{\infty}$. We emphasize that while being quantitatively
better, our scheme is also qualitatively better in the sense that it is simpler
than the previously best scheme that uses intricate data structures and
elaborate subroutines.

high accuracy. We further develop a reduction framework, inspired by
\emph{proximal point methods} in convex optimization, which bootstraps samplers
for regularized densities to improve dependences on problem conditioning. A key
ingredient in our framework is the notion of a "restricted Gaussian oracle"
(RGO) for $g: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which is a sampler for
distributions whose negative log-likelihood sums a quadratic and $g$. By
combining our reduction framework with our new samplers, we obtain the
following bounds for sampling structured distributions to total variation
distance $\epsilon$. For composite densities $\exp(-f(x) - g(x))$, where $f$
has condition number $\kappa$ and convex (but possibly non-smooth) $g$ admits
an RGO, we obtain a mixing time of $O(\kappa d \log^3\frac{\kappa

query complexity were previously known. For densities with condition number
$\kappa$, we give an algorithm obtaining mixing time $O(\kappa d

constructs a corresponding tree decomposition as well. Our algorithm is a
faster variation of Reed's classical algorithm. For the benefit of the reader,
and to be able to compare these two algorithms, we start with a detailed time
analysis for Reed's algorithm. We fill in many details that have been omitted
in Reed's paper. Computing tree decompositions parameterized by the treewidth
$k$ is fixed parameter tractable (FPT), meaning that there are algorithms
running in time $O(f(k) g(n))$ where $f$ is a computable function, $g$ is a
polynomial function, and $n$ is the number of vertices. An analysis of Reed's
algorithm shows $f(k) = 2^{O(k \log k)}$ and $g(n) = n \log n$ for a
5-approximation. Reed simply claims time $O(n \log n)$ for bounded $k$ for his
constant factor approximation algorithm, but the bound of $2^{\Omega(k \log k)}
n \log n$ is well known. From a practical point of view, we notice that the
time of Reed's algorithm also contains a term of $O(k^2 2^{24k} n \log n)$,
which for small $k$ is much worse than the asymptotically leading term of
$2^{O(k \log k)} n \log n$. We analyze $f(k)$ more precisely, because the
purpose of this paper is to improve the running times for all reasonably small
values of $k$.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(f(k)n\log{n})$ too, but with a much
smaller dependence on $k$. In our case, $f(k) = 2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. This
algorithm is simple and fast, especially for small values of $k$. We should
mention that Bodlaender et al.\ [2016] have an asymptotically faster algorithm
running in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)} n$. It relies on a very sophisticated data
structure and does not claim to be useful for small values of $k$.

Kleene patterns to detect and aggregate arbitrarily-long event sequences,
called event trends. State-of-the-art systems process such queries in two
steps. Namely, they first construct all trends and then aggregate them. Due to
the exponential costs of trend construction, this two-step approach suffers
from both a long delays and high memory costs. To overcome these limitations,
we propose the Graph-based Real-time Event Trend Aggregation (Greta) approach
that dynamically computes event trend aggregation without first constructing
these trends. We define the Greta graph to compactly encode all trends. Our
Greta runtime incrementally maintains the graph, while dynamically propagating
aggregates along its edges. Based on the graph, the final aggregate is
incrementally updated and instantaneously returned at the end of each query
window. Our Greta runtime represents a win-win solution, reducing both the time
complexity from exponential to quadratic and the space complexity from
exponential to linear in the number of events. Our experiments demonstrate that
Greta achieves up to four orders of magnitude speed-up and up to 50--fold
memory reduction compared to the state-of-the-art two-step approaches.

database, we want to efficiently test whether there is a solution, count how
many solutions there are, or be able to enumerate the set of all solutions.
</p>
<p>Bounded and low degree are rather natural notions and both yield efficient
algorithms. For example, Berkholz, Keppeler, and Schweikardt showed in 2017
that over databases of bounded degree, not only any first order query can
efficiently be tested, counted and enumerated, but the data structure used can
be updated when the database itself is updated.
</p>
<p>This paper extends existing results in two directions. First, we show that
over classes of databases with low degree, there is a data structure that
enables us to test, count and enumerate the solutions of first order queries.
This data structure can also be efficiently recomputed when the database is
updated. Secondly, for classes of databases with bounded degree we show that,
without increasing the preprocessing time, we can compute a data structure that
does not depend on the query but only on its quantifier rank. We can therefore
perform a single preprocessing that can later be used for many queries.

nonlinear transformations}. In particular we seek embeddings that preserve the
norm of all vectors in a space $S = \{y: y = f(x)\text{ for }x \in Z\}$, where
$Z$ is a $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x)$ is a nonlinear
activation function applied entrywise to $x$. When $f$ is the identity, and so
$S$ is just a $k$-dimensional subspace, it is known that, with high
probability, a random embedding into $O(k/\epsilon^2)$ dimensions preserves the
norm of all $y \in S$ up to $(1\pm \epsilon)$ relative error. Such embeddings
are known as \emph{subspace embeddings}, and have found widespread use in
compressed sensing and approximation algorithms. We give the first
low-distortion embeddings for a wide class of nonlinear functions $f$. In
particular, we give additive $\epsilon$ error embeddings into $O(\frac{k\log
(n/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2})$ dimensions for a class of nonlinearities that
includes the popular Sigmoid SoftPlus, and Gaussian functions. We strengthen
this result to give relative error embeddings under some further restrictions,
which are satisfied e.g., by the Tanh, SoftSign, Exponential Linear Unit, and
many other `soft' step functions and rectifying units. Understanding embeddings
for subspaces under nonlinear transformations is a key step towards extending
random sketching and compressing sensing techniques for linear problems to
nonlinear ones. We discuss example applications of our results to improved
bounds for compressed sensing via generative neural networks.

We identify several genres of search problems beyond NP for which existence of solutions is guaranteed.  One class that seems especially rich in such problems is PEPP (for "polynomial empty pigeonhole principle"), which includes problems related to existence theorems proved through the union bound, such as finding a bit string that is far from all codewords, finding an explicit rigid matrix, as well as a problem we call Complexity, capturing Complexity Theory's quest.  When the union bound is generous, in that solutions constitute at least a polynomial fraction of the domain, we have a family of seemingly weaker classes $\alpha$-PEPP, which are inside FP}$^{\text{NP}}|$poly.  Higher in the hierarchy, we identify the constructive version of the Sauer-Shelah lemma and the appropriate generalization of PPP that contains it.  The resulting total function hierarchy turns out to be more stable than the polynomial hierarchy: it is known that, under oracles, total functions within FNP may be easy, but total functions a level higher may still be harder than FP$^{\text{NP}}$.</div>

The determinant is a canonical VBP-complete polynomial in the algebraic complexity setting. In this work, we introduce two variants of the determinant polynomial which we call $StackDet_n(X)$ and $CountDet_n(X)$ and show that they are VP and VNP complete respectively under $p$-projections. The definitions of the polynomials are inspired by a combinatorial characterisation of the determinant developed by Mahajan and Vinay (SODA 1997). We extend the combinatorial object in their work, namely clow sequences, by introducing additional edge labels on the edges of the underlying graph. The idea of using edge labels is inspired by the work of Mengel (MFCS 2013).</div>

<p class="justify-text">This time, in terms of applications to machine learning, no acceleration, but some interesting closed-form expansions in positive-definite kernel methods. </p>



<h2>Definition and first properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">There are many equivalent ways to define Hermite polynomials. A natural one is through the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigues%27_formula">Rodrigues’ formula</a>: $$H_k(x) = (-1)^k e^{x^2} \frac{d^k}{d x^k}\big[ e^{-x^2} \big],$$ from which we can deduce \(H_0(x) = 1\), \(H_1(x) =\   – e^{x^2} \big[ -2x e^{-x^2} \big] = 2x\), \(H_2(x) = e^{x^2} \big[ (-2x)^2e^{-x^2} -2 e^{-x^2}  \big] =  4x^2 – 2\), etc.</p>



<p class="justify-text">Other simple properties which are consequences of the definition (and can be shown by recursion) are that \(H_k\) is a polynomial of degree \(k\), with the same parity as \(k\), and with a leading coefficient equal to \(2^k\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality for Gaussian distribution.</strong> Using integration by parts, one can show (see end of the post) that for \(k \neq \ell\), we have $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}  \!\!\!H_k(x) H_\ell(x) e^{-x^2} dx =0, $$ and that for \(k=\ell\), we have $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \!\!\! H_k(x)^2 e^{-x^2}dx = \sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">In other words, the Hermite polynomials are orthogonal for the Gaussian distribution with mean \(0\) and variance \(\frac{1}{2}\). Yet in other words, defining the <em>Hermite functions</em> as \( \displaystyle \psi_k(x) = (\sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!)^{-1/2} H_k(x) e^{-x^2/2}\), we obtain an orthonormal basis of \(L_2(dx)\). As illustrated below, the Hermite functions, as the index \(k\) increases, have an increasing “support” (the support is always the entire real line, but most of the mass is concentrated in centered balls of increasing sizes, essentially at \(\sqrt{k}\)) and, like cosines and sines, an increasingly oscillatory behavior.</p>

<p class="justify-text">Among such orthonormal bases, the Hermite functions happen to be diagonalizing the Fourier tranform operator.  In other words, the Fourier transform of \(\psi_k\) (for the definition making it an isometry of \(L_2(dx)\)) is equal to $$ \mathcal{F}(\psi_k)(\omega)  =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \psi_k(x) e^{- i \omega x} dx = (-i)^k \psi_k(\omega).$$ (note that the eigenvalues are all of unit modulus as we have an isometry). See a proof at the end of the post. I am not aware of any applications of this property in machine learning or statistics (but there are probably some).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence.</strong> In order to compute Hermite polynomials, the following recurrence relation is the most useful $$ H_{k+1}(x) = 2x H_k(x) \ – 2k H_{k-1}(x). \tag{1}$$  Such recursions are always available for orthogonal polynomials (see [4]), but it takes here a particularly simple form (see a proof at the end of the post).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Generating function.</strong> The following property is central in many proofs of properties of Hermite polynomials: for all \(t \in \mathbb{R}\), we have $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k(x) =e^{ 2xt \ – \ t^2}, \tag{2}$$ with a proof at the end of the post based on the residue theorem.</p>



<h2>Further (less standard) properties</h2>



<p class="justify-text">For the later developments, we need other properties which are less standard (there are many other interesting properties, which are not useful for this post, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Mehler formula. </strong>For \(|\rho| &lt; 1\), it states: $$ \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1- \rho^2} (x-y)^2\Big) = \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\rho^k}{2^k k!} H_k(x) H_k(y) \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1+\rho} (x^2 + y^2) \Big).$$ The proof is significantly more involved; see [<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jlms/article-pdf/s1-8/3/194/2363185/s1-8-3-194.pdf">1</a>] for details (with a great last sentence: “Prof. Hardy tells me that he has not seen his proof in print, though the inevitability of the successive steps makes him think that it is unlikely to be new”). Note that we will in fact obtain a new proof from the relationship with kernel methods (see below).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation for Gaussian distributions. </strong>We will need this property for \(|\rho|&lt;1\) (see proof at the end of the post), which corresponds to the expectation of \(H_k(x)\) for \(x\) distributed as a non-centered Gaussian distribution: $$\int_{-\infty}^\infty H_k(x) \exp\Big( – \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} \Big)dx= \sqrt{\pi} \rho^k \sqrt{1-\rho^2} H_k (y). \tag{3}$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given the relationship with the Gaussian distribution, it is no surprise that Hermite polynomials pop up whenever Gaussians are used, as distributions or kernels. Before looking into it, let’s first give a brief review of kernel methods.</p>



<h2>From positive-definite kernel to Hilbert spaces</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a prediction problem with inputs in a set \(\mathcal{X}\), a traditional way of parameterizing real-valued functions on \(\mathcal{X}\) is to use <em>positive-definite kernels</em>.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A positive-definite kernel is a function \(K: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that for all sets \(\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}\) of \(n\) elements of \(\mathcal{X}\), the “kernel matrix” in \(\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\) composed of pairwise evaluations is symmetric positive semi-definite. This property happens to be equivalent to the existence of a Hilbert feature space \(\mathcal{H}\) and a feature map \(\varphi: \mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{H}\) such that $$K(x,x’) = \langle \varphi(x), \varphi(x’) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}},$$ with an elegant constructive proof [<a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1950-068-03/S0002-9947-1950-0051437-7/S0002-9947-1950-0051437-7.pdf">15</a>].</p>



<p class="justify-text">This allows to define the space of linear functions on the features, that is, functions of the form $$f(x) = \langle f, \varphi(x) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}},$$ for \(f \in \mathcal{H}\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">This space is often called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space" class="">reproducing kernel Hilbert space</a> (RKHS) associated to the kernel \(K\) (we can prove that it is indeed uniquely defined). In such a space, we can also define the squared norm of the function \(f\), namely \(\| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2\), which can be seen as a specific regularization term in kernel methods.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The space satisfies the so-called reproducing property (hence its name): \(f(x) = \langle f, K(\cdot,x) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\). In other words, the feature \(\varphi(x)\) is the kernel function evaluated at \(x\), that is,  \(\varphi(x) = K(\cdot,x)\). These spaces have been a source of many developments in statistics [5] and machine learning [6, 7].</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthonormal basis.</strong> A difficulty in working with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces of functions is that it is sometimes hard to understand what functions are actually considered. One simple way to enhance understanding of the regularization property is to have an orthonormal basis (in very much the same way as the Fourier basis), as we can then identify \(\mathcal{H}\) to the space of squared-integrable sequences.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For kernel-based Hilbert spaces, if we have an orthonormal basis \((g_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\) of the Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H}\), then, by decomposing \(\varphi(x)\) in the basis, we have $$\varphi(x) = \sum_{k =0}^\infty \langle \varphi(x), g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} g_k,$$ we get $$K(x,y) = \langle \varphi(y), \varphi(x) \rangle = \sum_{k =0}^\infty \langle \varphi(x), g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} \langle  \varphi(y), g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} =\sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k(x) g_k(y), \tag{4}$$ that is, we have an expansion of the kernel as an infinite sum (note here, that we ignore summability issues).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Among orthonormal bases, some are more interesting than others. The ones composed of eigenfunctions for particular operators are really more interesting, in particular for the covariance operator that we now present, and their use in statistical learning theory.</p>



<h2>Analyzing ridge regression through covariance operators</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The most classical problem where regularization by RKHS norms occurs is <em>ridge regression</em>, where, given some observations \((x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n) \in \mathcal{X} \times \mathbb{R}\), one minimizes with respect to \(f \in \mathcal{H}\): $$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \big( y_i \ – \langle f, \varphi(x_i) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} \big)^2 +  \lambda \| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">In finite dimensions, the convergence properties are characterized by the (non-centered) covariance matrix \(\Sigma = \mathbb{E} \big[ \varphi(x) \otimes \varphi(x) \big]\), where the expectation is taken with respect to the underlying distribution of the observations \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) (which are assumed independently and identically distributed for simplicity). If \(\mathcal{H} = \mathbb{R}^d\), then \(\Sigma\) is a \(d \times d\) matrix. </p>



<p class="justify-text">For infinite-dimensional \(\mathcal{H}\), the same expression \(\Sigma = \mathbb{E} \big[ \varphi(x) \otimes \varphi(x) \big]\) defines a linear <em>operator</em> from \(\mathcal{H}\) to  \(\mathcal{H}\), so that for \(f,g \in \mathcal{H}\), we have $$\langle f, \Sigma g \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \mathbb{E} \big[ \langle f, \varphi(x)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\langle g, \varphi(x)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}}\big] = \mathbb{E} \big[ f(x) g(x) \big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">The generalization property of ridge regression has been thoroughly studied (see, e.g., [8, 9]), and if there exists \(f_\ast \in \mathcal{H}\) such that \(y_i = \langle f_\ast, \varphi(x_i) \rangle + \varepsilon_i\) for a noise \(\varepsilon_i\) which is independent of \(x_i\), with zero mean and variance equal to \(\sigma^2\), then the expected error on unseen data is asymptotically upper-bounded by $$\sigma^2 + \lambda \| f_\ast\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 + \frac{\sigma^2}{n} {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big].$$ The first term \(\sigma^2\) is the best possible expected performance, the term \(\lambda \| f_\ast\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2\) is usually referred to as the <em>bias</em> term and characterizes the bias introduced by regularizing towards zero, while the third term \(\frac{\sigma^2}{n} {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big]\) is the <em>variance</em> term, which characterizes the loss in performance due to the observation of only \(n\) observations.</p>



<p class="justify-text">The quantity \({\rm df}(\lambda) = {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big]\) is often referred to as the degrees of freedom [10]. When \(\lambda\) tends to infinity, then \({\rm df}(\lambda)\) tends to zero; when \(\lambda\) tends to zero, then \({\rm df}(\lambda)\) tends to the number of non-zero eigenvalues of \(\Sigma\). Thus, in finite dimension, this typically leads to the underlying dimension. Given the usual variance term in \(\sigma^2 \frac{d}{n}\) for ordinary least-squares with \(d\)-dimensional features, \({\rm df}(\lambda)\) is often seen as an implicit number of parameters for kernel ridge regression.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In infinite dimensions, under mild assumptions, there are infinitely many eigenvalues for \(\Sigma\), which form a decreasing sequence \((\lambda_i)_{i \geqslant 0}\) that tends to zero (and is summable, with a sum equal to the trace of \(\Sigma\)). The rate of such a decay is key to understanding the generalization capabilities of kernel methods. With the following classical types of decays:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li><em>Polynomial decays</em>: If \(\lambda_i \leqslant \frac{C}{(i+1)^{\alpha}}\) for \(\alpha &gt; 1\), then one can upper bound the sum by an integral as $$ {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big] = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i + \lambda} \leqslant \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{1  + \lambda i^\alpha / C} \leqslant \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+\lambda t^\alpha / C} dt.$$ With the change of variable \(u = \lambda t^\alpha / C\), we get that \({\rm df}(\lambda) = O(\lambda^{-\alpha})\). We can then balance bias and variance with \(\lambda \sim n^{-\alpha/(\alpha+1)}\) and an excess risk proportional to \(n^{-\alpha/(\alpha+1)}\). This type of decay is typical of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev spaces</a>.</li><li><em>Exponential decays</em>: If \(\lambda_i \leqslant {C}e^{-\alpha i}\), for some \(\alpha &gt;0\), we have $$ {\rm tr} \big[ \Sigma ( \Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \big]  \leqslant \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{{C}e^{-\alpha i}}{  \lambda + {C}e^{-\alpha i}} \leqslant \int_{0}^\infty \frac{{C}e^{-\alpha t}}{ \lambda + {C}e^{-\alpha t}}dt.$$ With the change of variable \(u = e^{-\alpha t}\), we get an upper bound $$\int_{0}^1 \frac{C}{\alpha}\frac{1}{ \lambda + {C}u}du = \frac{1}{\alpha}\big[ \log(\lambda + C) \ – \log (\lambda) \big] = \frac{1}{\alpha} \log \big( 1+\frac{C}{\lambda} \big).$$ We can then balance bias and variance with \(\lambda \sim 1/n \) and an excess risk proportional to \((\log n) / n \), which is very close to the usual parametric (finite-dimensional) rate in \(O(1/n)\). We will see an example of this phenomenon for the Gaussian kernel.</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">In order to analyze the generalization capabilities, we consider a measure \(d \mu\) on \(\mathcal{X}\), and the following (non-centered) <em>covariance operator</em> defined above as $$\mathbb{E} \big[ \varphi(x) \otimes \varphi(x) \big],$$ which is now an self-adjoint operator from \(\mathcal{H}\) to \(\mathcal{H}\) with a finite trace. The traditional empirical estimator \(\hat\Sigma = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \varphi(x_i) \otimes \varphi(x_i)\), whose eigenvalues are the same as the eigenvalues of \(1/n\) times the \(n \times n\) kernel matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations (see simulation below).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Characterizing eigenfunctions.</strong> If \((g_k)\) is the eigenbasis associated to the eigenfunctions of \(\Sigma\), then it has to be an orthogonal family that span the entire space \(\mathcal{H}\) and such that \(\Sigma g_k = \lambda_k g_k\). Applying it to \(\varphi(y) = K(\cdot,y)\), we get $$ \langle K(\cdot,y), \Sigma g_k \rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \mathbb{E} \big[ K(x,y) g_k(x) \big] = \lambda_k \langle g_k, \varphi(y)\rangle_\mathcal{H} =  \lambda_k g_k(y),$$ which implies that the functions also have to be eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint so-called <em>integral operator</em> \(T\) defined on \(L_2(d\mu)\) as \(T f(y) = \int_{\mathcal{X}} K(x,y) f(y) d\mu(y)\). Below, we will check this property. Note that this other notion of integral operator (defined on \(L_2(d\mu)\) and not in \(\mathcal{H}\)), which has the same eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is important to deal with mis-specified models (see [9]). Note that the eigenfunctions \(g_k\) are orthogonal for both dot-products in \(L_2(d\mu)\) and \(\mathcal{H}\), but that the normalization to unit norm differs. If \(\| g_k \|_{L_2(d\mu)}=1\) for all \(k \geqslant 0\), then we have \( \| g_k \|^2_\mathcal{H}=  \lambda_k^{-1} \langle g_k, \Sigma g_k \rangle_\mathcal{H} = \lambda_k^{-1}\mathbb{E} [ g_k(x)^2] =\lambda_k^{-1}\) , and thus, \(\| \lambda_k^{1/2} g_k \|_{\mathcal{H}}=1\), and we have the kernel expansion from an orthonormal basis of \(\mathcal{H}\): $$K(x,y) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\lambda_k g_k(x) g_k(y),$$ which will lead to a new proof for Mehler formula.</p>



<h2>Orthonormal basis for the Gaussian kernel</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Hermite polynomials naturally lead to orthonormal basis of some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). For simplicity, I will focus on one-dimensional problems, but this extends to higher dimension. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Translation-invariant kernels.</strong> We consider a function \(q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) which is integrable, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> (note the different normalization than before) which is defined for all \(\omega \in \mathbb{R}\) because of the integrability: $$\hat{q}(\omega) = \int_{\mathbb{R}} q(x) e^{-i \omega x} dx.$$ We consider the kernel $$K(x,y) = q(x-y).$$ It can be check that as soon as  \(\hat{q}(\omega) \in \mathbb{R}_+\)  for all \(\omega \in \mathbb{R}\), then the kernel \(K\) is positive-definite.</p>



<p class="justify-text">For a translation-invariant kernel, we can write using the inverse Fourier transform formula: $$K(x,y) = q(x-y) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{q}(\omega) e^{i \omega ( x- y)} d \omega = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \varphi_\omega(x)^* \varphi_\omega(y) d \omega,$$ with \(\varphi_\omega(x) = \sqrt{\hat{q}(\omega) / (2\pi) } e^{i\omega x}\). Intuitively, for a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), with \(\displaystyle f(x) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \hat{f}(\omega)e^{i\omega x} d\omega = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}}\varphi_\omega(x) d\omega\), which is a “dot-product” between the family \((\varphi_\omega(x))_\omega\) and \(\Big( \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}} \Big)_\omega\), the squared norm \(\| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2\) is equal to the corresponding “squared norm” of \(\Big( \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}}\Big)_\omega\), and we thus have $$ \| f\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2 = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \Big| \frac{\hat{f}(\omega)  }{\sqrt{2 \pi \hat{q}(\omega)}} \Big|^2 d\omega =  \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \frac{ | \hat{f}(\omega) |^2}{\hat{q}(\omega)} d\omega,$$ where \(\hat{f}\) is the Fourier transform of \(f\). While the derivation above is not rigorous, the last expression is.</p>



<p class="justify-text">In this section, I will focus on the Gaussian kernel defined as \(K(x,y) = q(x-y) =  \exp \big( – \alpha ( x- y )^2 \big)\), for which \(\displaystyle \hat{q}(\omega)= \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given that \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{\hat{q}(\omega)} = \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \exp\big(  \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)= \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \sum_{k=0}^\infty  \frac{\omega^{2k}}{(4 \alpha)^k k!} \), the penalty \(\|f\|_\mathcal{H}^2\) is a linear combination of squared \(L_2\)-norm of \(\omega^k \hat{f}(\omega)\), which is the squared \(L_2\)-norm of the \(k\)-th derivative of \(f\). Thus, functions in the RKHS are infinitely differentiable, and thus very smooth (this implies that to have the fast rate \((\log n) / n \) above, the optimal regression function has to be very smooth).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthonormal basis of the RKHS</strong>. As seen in Eq. (4), an expansion in an infinite sum is necessary to obtain an orthonormal basis. We have: $$K(x,y) = e^{-\alpha x^2} e^{-\alpha y^2} e^{2 \alpha x y} = e^{-\alpha x^2} e^{-\alpha y^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{ (2\alpha)^k}{k!} x^k y^k.$$ Because of Eq. (4), with \(g_k(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{(2\alpha)^k}{k!}} x^k \exp \big( – \alpha x^2 \big)\), we have a good candidate for an orthonornal basis. Let us check that this is the case. Note that the expansion above alone cannot be used as a proof that \((g_k)\) is an orthonormal basis of \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Given the function \(f_k(x) = x^k \exp \big( – \alpha x^2 \big)\), we can compute its Fourier transform as $$ \hat{f}_k(\omega) = i^{-k} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k/2} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} H_k \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big) .$$ Indeed, we have, from Rodrigues’ formula, $$H_k \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big) =(-1)^k (4 \alpha)^{k/2} \frac{d^k}{d \omega^k}\big[ \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big) \big],$$ and thus its inverse Fourier transform is equal to \((ix)^k\) times the one of \((-1)^k (4 \alpha)^{k/2} \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)\), which is thus equal to \((-i)^k (4 \alpha)^{k/2} \sqrt{ \alpha / \pi }e^{-\alpha x^2} \), which leads to the Fourier transform formula above.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now compute the RKHS dot products, to show how to obtain the orthonormal basis described in [11]. This leads to $$ \langle f_k, f_\ell \rangle = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k/2}( 4 \alpha)^{-\ell/2}  \int_{\mathbb{R}} H_k \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) H_\ell \Big( \frac{\omega}{\sqrt{4 \alpha}} \Big) \exp\big( – \frac{\omega^2}{4 \alpha} \big)  d\omega,$$ which leads to, with a change of variable $$ \langle f_k, f_\ell \rangle = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k/2}( 4 \alpha)^{-\ell/2} \sqrt{4 \alpha} \int_{\mathbb{R}} H_k (u) H_\ell (u)  \exp(-u^2) du,$$ which is equal to zero if \(k \neq \ell\), and equal to \(\frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\alpha}} ( 4 \alpha)^{-k} \sqrt{4 \alpha} \sqrt{\pi} 2^k k!   = ( 2 \alpha)^{-k} k!\) if \(k = \ell\). Thus the sequence \((f_k)\) is an orthogonal basis of the RKHS, and the sequence \((g_k)\) defined as \(g_k(x) = \sqrt{ \frac{(2\alpha)^k}{k!}} f_k(x)\) is an orthonormal basis of the RKHS, from which, using the expansion as in Eq. (4), we recover the expansion: $$K(x,y) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty g_k(x) g_k(y) = e^{-\alpha x^2} e^{-\alpha y^2} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{ (2\alpha)^k}{k!} x^k y^k.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">This expansion can be used to approximate the Gaussian kernel by finite-dimensional explicit feature spaces, by just keeping the first basis elements (see an application to optimal transport in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10046">12</a>], with an improved behavior using an adaptive low-rank approximation through the Nyström method in [<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8693-massively-scalable-sinkhorn-distances-via-the-nystrom-method.pdf">13</a>]).</p>



<h2>Eigenfunctions for the Gaussian kernels</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to obtain explicit formulas for the eigenvalues of the covariance operator, we need more than a mere orthonormal basis, namely an eigenbasis.</p>



<p class="justify-text">An orthogonal basis will now be constructed with arguably better properties as it is also an orthonormal basis for both the RKHS and \(L_2(d\mu)\) for a Gaussian measure, that diagonalizes the integral operator associated to this probability measure, as well as the covariance operator.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As seen above, we simply need an orthogonal family \((f_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\), such that given a distribution \(d\mu\),  \((f_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\) is a family in \(L_2(d\mu)\) such that $$\int_{\mathbb{R}} f_k(x) K(x,y) d\mu(x) = \lambda_k f_k(y), \tag{5}$$ for eigenvalues \((\lambda_k)\). In the next paragraph, we will do exactly this for the Gaussian kernel \(K(x,y) = e^{-\alpha (x-y)^2}\) for \(\alpha = \frac{\rho}{1- \rho^2}\) for some \(\rho \in (0,1)\); this particular parameterization in \(\rho\) is to make the formulas below not (too) complicated.</p>



<p class="justify-text">With \(f_k(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_k}} H_k(x) \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1+\rho} x^2 \Big)\), where \(N_k = {2^k k!} \sqrt{ \frac{1-\rho}{1+\rho}}\), then \((f_k)_{k \geqslant 0}\) is an <em>orthonormal</em> basis for \(L_2(d\mu)\) for \(d\mu\) the Gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance \(\frac{1}{2} \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho}\) (this is a direct consequence of the orthogonality property of Hermite polynomials).</p>



<p class="justify-text">Moreover, the moment of the Hermite polynomial in Eq. (3) exactly leads to Eq. (5) for the chosen kernel and \(\lambda_k = (1-\rho) \rho^k\). Since the eigenvalues sum to one, and the trace of \(\Sigma\) is equal to one (as a consequence of \(K(x,x)=1\)), the family \((f_k)\) has to be a basis of \(\mathcal{H}\).</p>



<p>From properties of the eigenbasis, since \((f_k)\) is an orthonormal eigenbasis of \(L_2(d\mu)\) and the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_k = (1-\rho)\rho^k\),  we get: $$ K(x,y) = \exp \Big( – \frac{\rho}{1- \rho^2} (x-y)^2\Big) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (1-\rho)\rho^k f_k(x) f_k(y),$$ which is exactly the Mehler formula, and thus we obtain an alternative proof.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this post, I only presented applications of Hermite polynomials to the Gaussian kernel, but these polynomials appear in many other areas of applied mathematics, for other types of kernels within machine learning such as dot-product kernels [3], in random matrix theory (see <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/02/20/topics-in-random-matrix-theory/">here</a>), in statistics for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgeworth_series">Edgeworth expansions</a>, and of course for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Hermite_quadrature">Gauss-Hermite quadrature</a>.</p>

<h2>Proof of properties of Hermite polynomials</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In this small appendix, I give “simple” proofs (that sometimes require knowledge of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis">complex analysis</a>) to the properties presented above.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Generating function.</strong> We have, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residue_theorem">residue theory</a>, $$H_k(x)=(-1)^k e^{x^2} \frac{d^k}{d x^k}\big[ e^{-x^2} \big] = (-1)^k \frac{k!}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}}{(z-x)^{k+1}}dz, $$ where \(\gamma\) is a contour in the complex plane around \(x\). This leads to, for any \(t\) (here, we ignore on purpose the summability issues, for more details, see [4, Section 5.5]): $$ \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k(x) =  \frac{1}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}}{z-x} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k} {(x-z)^{k}}dz, $$ which can be simplified using the sum of the geometric series, leading to $$\frac{1}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}}{z-x} \frac{z-x}{z-x- t} dz =  \frac{1}{2i\pi} e^{x^2} \oint_\gamma \frac{e^{-z^2}} {z-x- t} dz.$$ Using the first-order residue at \(x+t\). This is thus equal to \(e^{x^2-(t+x)^2} = e^{-t^2 + 2tx}\), which is exactly the generating function statement from Eq. (2).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Orthogonality for Gaussian distribution.</strong> We can prove through integration by parts, but there is a nicer proof through the generating function. Indeed, with $$ a_{k \ell} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2} H_k(x) H_\ell(x) dx, $$ for \(k, \ell \geqslant 0\), we get $$\sum_{k,\ell = 0}^\infty a_{k \ell} \frac{t^k u^\ell}{k! \ell!} = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}e^{-x^2}\Big(  \sum_{k,\ell = 0}^\infty a_{k \ell} \frac{t^k u^\ell}{k! \ell!}  H_k(x) H_\ell(x) \Big) dx.$$ Using the generating function, this leads to $$\sum_{k,\ell = 0}^\infty a_{k \ell} \frac{t^k u^\ell}{k! \ell!} =  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2 + 2xu-u^2 + 2xt – t^2} dx= e^{2uv} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-(x-u-v)^2}dx, $$ which can be computed explicitly using normalization constants of the Gaussian distribution, as \( \sqrt{\pi} e^{2uv} = \sqrt{\pi} \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{ (2  u v)^k}{k!},\) leading to all desired orthogonality relationships using the uniqueness of all coefficients for factors \(t^k u^\ell\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Recurrence relationship.</strong> Taking the derivative of the generating function with respect to \(t\), one gets \( \displaystyle (2x-2t) e^{2tx-t^2} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} H_k(x),\) which is equal to (using again the generating function) \(\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^{k}}{k!} 2x H_k(x) \ – \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{t^{k+1}}{k!} 2 H_k(x).\) By equating the coefficients for all powers of \(t\), this leads to the desired recursion in Eq. (1).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Fourier transform.</strong> Again using the generating function, written $$ e^{-x^2/2 + 2xt – t^2} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} e^{-x^2/2} H_k(x), $$ we can take Fourier transforms and use the fact that the Fourier transform of \(e^{-x^2/2}\) is itself (for the chosen normalization), and then equate coefficients for all powers of \(t\) to conclude (see more details <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_polynomials#Hermite_functions_as_eigenfunctions_of_the_Fourier_transform">here</a>).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation for Gaussian distributions.</strong> We finish the appendix by proving Eq. (3). We consider computing for any \(t\), $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty \rho^k \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k (y) = e^{2\rho t y – \rho^2 t^2},$$ using the generating function from Eq. (2). We then compute $$A=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\Big( – \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} \Big) \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{t^k}{k!} H_k(x) dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp\Big( – \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} \Big) \exp( 2tx – t^2) dx.$$ We then use \( \frac{(x-\rho y)^2}{1-\rho^2} – 2tx + t^2 = \frac{x^2}{1-\rho^2}  – \frac{2x[ t(1-\rho^2) + \rho y]}{1-\rho^2}  + t^2 + \frac{\rho^2 y^2}{1-\rho^2}\), leading to $$A = \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{1-\rho^2} \exp\Big( -t^2 – \frac{\rho^2 y^2}{1-\rho^2} +(1-\rho^2) \big( t + \frac{\rho y}{1-\rho^2} \big)^2 \Big) = \sqrt{\pi} \sqrt{1-\rho^2} e^{2\rho t y – \rho^2 t^2}.$$ By equating powers of \(t\), this leads to Eq. (3).</p></div>

Random walks on expanders are a central and versatile tool in pseudorandomness.  If an arbitrary half of the vertices of an expander graph are marked, known Chernoff bounds for expander walks imply that the number $M$ of marked vertices visited in a long $n$-step random walk strongly concentrates around the expected $n/2$ value. Surprisingly, it was recently shown that the parity of $M$ also has exponentially small bias.

Is there a common unification of these results? What other statistics about $M$ resemble the binomial distribution (the Hamming weight of a random $n$-bit string)? To gain insight into such questions, we analyze a simpler model called the sticky random walk. This model is a natural stepping stone towards understanding expander random walks, and we also show that it is a necessary step. The sticky random walk starts with a random bit and then each subsequent bit independently equals the previous bit with probability $(1+\lambda)/2$. Here $\lambda$ is the proxy for the expander's (second largest) eigenvalue.
    
Using Krawtchouk expansion of functions, we derive several probabilistic results about the sticky random walk. We show an asymptotically tight $\Theta(\lambda)$ bound on the total variation distance between the (Hamming weight of the) sticky walk and the binomial distribution. We prove that the correlation between the majority and parity bit of the sticky walk is bounded by $O(n^{-1/4})$. This lends hope to unifying Chernoff bounds and parity concentration, as well as establishing other interesting statistical properties, of expander random walks.</div>

In certain complexity-theoretic settings, it is notoriously difficult to prove complexity separations which hold almost everywhere, i.e., for all but finitely many input lengths. For example, a classical open question is whether $\mathrm{NEXP} \subset \mathrm{i.o.-}\mathrm{NP}$; that is, it is open whether nondeterministic exponential time computations can be simulated on infinitely many input lengths by $\mathrm{NP}$ algorithms. This difficulty also applies to Williams' algorithmic method for circuit lower bounds [Williams, J. ACM 2014]. In particular, although [Murray and Williams, STOC 2018] proved $\mathrm{NTIME}[2^{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}] \not\subset \mathrm{ACC}^0$, it has remained an open problem to show that $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ ($2^{O(n)}$ time with an $\mathrm{NP}$ oracle) is not contained in $\mathrm{i.o.-}\mathrm{ACC}^0$. 
	
In this paper, we show how many infinitely-often circuit lower bounds proved by the algorithmic method can be adapted to establish almost-everywhere lower bounds. 

- We show there is a function $f \in \mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ such that for all sufficiently large input lengths $n$ and $\varepsilon \leq o(1)$, $f$ cannot be $(1/2+2^{-n^{\varepsilon}})$-approximated by $2^{n^\varepsilon}$-size $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ circuits on inputs of length $n$, improving lower bounds in [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020] and [Viola, ECCC 2020]. 

- We construct rigid matrices in $\mathrm{P}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ for all but finitely many inputs, rather than infinitely often as in [Alman and Chen, FOCS 2019] and [Bhangale et al., FOCS 2020]. 

- We show there are functions in $\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{NP}}$ requiring constant-error probabilistic degree at least $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ for all large enough $n$, improving an infinitely-often separation of [Viola, ECCC 2020].
	
Our key to proving almost-everywhere worst-case lower bounds is a new ``constructive'' proof of an NTIME hierarchy theorem proved by [Fortnow and Santhanam, CCC 2016], where we show for every ``weak'' nondeterminstic algorithm (with smaller running-time and short witness), a ``refuter algorithm'' exists that can construct ``bad'' inputs for the hard language. We use this refuter algorithm to construct an almost-everywhere hard function. To extend our lower bounds to the average case, we prove a new XOR Lemma based on approximate linear sums, and combine it with the PCP-of-proximity applications developed in [Chen and Williams, CCC 2019] and [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020]. As a byproduct of our new XOR Lemma, we obtain a nondeterministic pseudorandom generator for poly-size $\mathrm{ACC}^0$ circuits with seed length $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$, which resolves an open question in [Chen and Ren, STOC 2020].</div>

<p>I have been thinking about CH lately for two reasons</p><p>1) I reread the article</p><p>Hilbert's First Problem: The Continuum Hypothesis by Donald Martin from <b>Proceedings of Symposia </b> i<b>n Pure Mathematics: Mathematical developments arising from Hilbert Problems</b>. 1976. (For a book review of the symposia and, <b>The Honor Class</b>, also about Hilbert's problems, see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/bookrev/44-4.pdf">here</a>.)</p><p>The article takes the point of view that CH CAN have an answer. He discusses large cardinals (why assuming they exist is plausible, but alas, that assumption does not seem to resolve CH) and Projective Det.  (why assuming it is true is plausible, but alas, that assumption does not seem to resolve CH).</p><p>(A set A \subseteq {0,1}^omega is DETERMINED if either Alice or Bob has a winning strategy in the following non-fun game: they alternate picking bits a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, ... with Alice going first. If a_1 b_1 a_2 b_2... IS IN A then Alice wins, IF NOT then Bob wins. Martin showed that all Borel sets are determined. Proj Det is the statement that all projections of Borel sets are determined. AD is the axiom that ALL sets A are determined. It contradicts AC.)</p><p>But what really inspired this post is the last paragraph:</p><p><i>Throughout the latter part of my discussion, I have been assuming a naive and uncritical attitude towards CH. While this <b>is</b> in fact my attitude, I by no means wish to dismiss the opposite viewpoint.  Those that argue that the concept of set is not sufficiently clear to fix the truth-value of CH have a position that is at present difficult to assail. As long as no new axiom is found which decides CH, their case will continue to grow stronger, and our assertions that the meaning of CH is clear will sound more and more empty.</i></p><p>2) Scott Aaronson mentioned in a blog post (see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4962">here</a>) that  he has read and understood the proof that CH is independent of set theory.</p><p>SO, this seemed like a good time to revisit thoughts on CH.</p><p> I took a very short poll, just two people, about CH: Stephen Fenner (in a perfect world he would be a set theorists) and Scott Aaronson (having JUST read the proof that CH is ind.  he has thought about it recently).</p><p>Here are some thoughts of theirs and mine</p><p>1) All three of us are Platonists with regard to the Naturals (I was surprised to find recently that there are people who are not!) but not with regard to the reals.  So we would be OKAY with having CH have no answer.</p><p>2) All three of us  agree that it would be nice if SOME axiom was both</p><p>a) Intuitively appealing or aesthetically appealing ,  and</p><p>b) resolved CH.</p><p>I always thought that (a) would be the hard part-- or at least getting everyone (not sure who we are talking about) to AGREE on a new axiom. But even getting an axiom to resolve CH seems hard.  Large cardinals don't seem to do it, and various forms of Determinacy don't seem to do it.</p><p>Scott reminded me of Freiling's Axiom of Symmetry (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiling%27s_axiom_of_symmetry">here</a>) which IS intuitive and DOES resolve CH (its false) though there are problems with it--- a minor variant   of it contradicts AC (I am QUITE FINE with that since AC implies Banach-Tarski which Darling says shows `Math is broken'.)</p><p>Stephen recalled some of Hugh Woodin's opinions of CH, but Hugh seems to have changed his mind from NOT(CH): 2^{aleph_0} = aleph_2, to CH:  2^{aleph_0} = aleph_1.(See <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24569622?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a>.)</p><p>3) All three of would be okay with V=L, though note that this would put many set theorists out of work. All the math that applies to the real world would still be intact.  I wonder if in an alternative history the reaction to Russell's paradox would be a formulation of set theory where V=L. We would KNOW that CH is true, KNOW that AC is true. We would know a lot about L but less about forcing.</p><p>4) Which Geometry is true: Euclidian, Riemannian, others? This is now regarded as a silly question: Right Tool, Right Job! If you build a bridge use Euclid. If you are doing astronomy use Riemann. Might Set Theory go the same way? It would be AWESOME if Scott Aaronson found some quantum thing where assuming 2^{aleph_0} = aleph_2 was the right way to model it.</p><p>5) If I was more plugged into the set theory community I might do a poll of set theorists, about CH. Actually, someone sort-of already has. Penelope Maddy has two excellent and readable articles where she studies what set theorists believe and why.</p><p><b>Believing The Axioms I</b>: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf">here</a></p><p><b>Believing The Axioms II</b>: <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms2.pdf">here</a></p><p>Those articles were written in 1988. I wonder if they need an update.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. For a fixed graph $H$, in the list homomorphism problem,
denoted by LHom($H$), we are given a graph $G$, whose every vertex $v$ is
equipped with a list $L(v) \subseteq V(H)$. We ask if there exists a
homomorphism $f$ from $G$ to $H$, in which $f(v) \in L(v)$ for every $v \in
V(G)$. Feder, Hell, and Huang [JGT~2003] proved that LHom($H$) is polynomial
time-solvable if $H$ is a bi-arc-graph, and NP-complete otherwise.
</p>
<p>We are interested in the complexity of the LHom($H$) problem in graphs
excluding a copy of some fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. It is known
that if $F$ is connected and is not a path nor a subdivided claw, then for
every non-bi-arc graph the LHom($H$) problem is NP-complete and cannot be
solved in subexponential time, unless the ETH fails. We consider the remaining
cases for connected graphs $F$.
</p>
<p>If $F$ is a path, we exhibit a full dichotomy. We define a class called
predacious graphs and show that if $H$ is not predacious, then for every fixed
$t$ the LHom($H$) problem can be solved in quasi-polynomial time in $P_t$-free
graphs. On the other hand, if $H$ is predacious, then there exists $t$, such
that LHom($H$) cannot be solved in subexponential time in $P_t$-free graphs.
</p>
<p>If $F$ is a subdivided claw, we show a full dichotomy in two important cases:
for $H$ being irreflexive (i.e., with no loops), and for $H$ being reflexive
(i.e., where every vertex has a loop). Unless the ETH fails, for irreflexive
$H$ the LHom($H$) problem can be solved in subexponential time in graphs
excluding a fixed subdivided claw if and only if $H$ is non-predacious and
triangle-free. If $H$ is reflexive, then LHom($H$) cannot be solved in
subexponential time whenever $H$ is not a bi-arc graph.

logic with team semantics (TeamLTL). In contrast to LTL, TeamLTL is capable of
defining hyperproperties, i.e., properties which relate multiple execution
traces. Logics for hyperproperties have so far been mostly obtained by
extending temporal logics like LTL and QPTL with trace quantification,
resulting in HyperLTL and HyperQPTL. We study the expressiveness of TeamLTL
(and its extensions with downward closed generalised atoms A and connectives
such as Boolean disjunction v) in comparison to HyperLTL and HyperQPTL.
Thereby, we also obtain a number of model checking results for TeamLTL, a
question which is so far an open problem. The two types of logics follow a
fundamentally different approach to hyperproperties and are are of incomparable
expressiveness. We establish that the universally quantified fragment of
HyperLTL subsumes the so-called k-coherent fragment of TeamLTL(A,v). This also
implies that the model checking problem is decidable for the fragment. We show
decidability of model checking of the so-called "left-flat" fragment of
TeamLTL(A,v) via a translation to a decidable fragment of HyperQPTL. Finally,
we show that the model checking problem of TeamLTL with Boolean disjunction and
inclusion atom is undecidable.

<p>Apologies dear readers for the late posting. The beginning of the school year is always frenzied, and the pandemic has only added to that frenzy. We have an exciting September, with four papers on graph property testing, <s>one</s> two papers on distribution testing, and one paper that connects both topics.</p>



<p><em>(Ed: we normally scan through ECCC and arXiv, but are happy to post about papers that appear elsewhere. Thanks to the reader who pointed out a relevant COLT 2020 paper.)</em></p>



<p><strong>Estimation of Graph Isomorphism Distance in the Query World</strong> by Sourav Chakraborty, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/135/">ECCC</a>). Graph isomorphism is about as fundamental as it gets, and this papers studies approximating the graph isomorphism distance for dense graphs. There is a known graph \(G_k\) (with \(n\) vertices). The algorithm is given query access to an input graph \(G_u\) and needs to approximate the number of edge inserts/deletes required to make the graphs isomorphic. This is the tolerant testing version; the property testing version is known to be doable in \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})\) queries (<a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/070680795?journalCode=smjcat">Matsliah-Fischer</a>). The main insight of this paper is to relate the tolerant testing complexity to a distribution testing problem. Consider distributions over the \(\{0,1\}^n\) defined by multisets of \(n\) hypercube points. Our aim is to estimate the earthmover distance between a known distribution and an unknown distribution. Interestingly, the query model is different: one can sample the underlying multisets <em>without</em> replacement. It turns out that the optimal complexity of this problem is (upto polylog factors) is the same as the optimal complexity of tolerant testing of graph isomorphism. A direct corollary is that the isomorphism distance can be approximated upto additive \(\epsilon n^2\) using \(\widetilde{O}(n)\) samples. This equivalence also gives an alternate proof for lower bounds for property testing graph isomorphism.</p>



<p><strong>Robustly Self-Ordered Graphs: Constructions and Applications to Property Testing </strong>by Oded Goldreich and Avi Wigderson (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/149/">ECCC</a>). Let’s start from the application. The aim is to prove the following property testing lower bounds for the bounded-degree graph setting: an exponential separation between tolerant and vanilla testing, and finding an efficiently decidable property (in polynomial time) that cannot be property tested in sublinear time. For binary strings, results of this form are known. Can these be “ported” to the bounded-degree graph world? Can we construct graphs such that adjacency queries reduce to bit queries in strings? Naturally, one can simply represent the adjacency list as a string and treat graph queries as bit queries. But the problem is that of isomorphisms: different bit strings could represent the same graph and therefore, the different bit strings must have the same status with respect to the underlying property. The key insight in this paper is to introduce <em>robustly self-ordered graph</em>s, as a tool to port bit string property testing lower bounds to bounded-degree graphs. Such graphs essentially have a unique (identity) automorphism, even after a few edge insert/deletes. The actual definition is more technical, but that is the essence. The main result is an explicit construction of such graphs, from which the lower bound can be ported directly through a convenient lemma.</p>



<p><strong>Modifying a Graph’s Degree Sequence and the Testablity of Degree Sequence Properties </strong>by Lior Gishboliner (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12697.pdf">arXiv</a>). A sequence of numbers \(D = (d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)\) is graphic if there exists an undirected graph on \(n\) vertices whose degrees are precisely the numbers of the sequence. Graphical sequences have been characterized by classic results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem">Erdös-Gállai</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel%E2%80%93Hakimi_algorithm">Havel-Hakimi</a>. This paper first proves the following theorem. Suppose a graphic sequence \(D’\) has \(l_1\)-distance at most \(\delta\) from the degree sequence \(D\) of a graph \(G\). Then, there exists a graph \(G’\) with degree sequence \(D’\) such that the (dense graph) distance between \(G\) and \(G’\) is \(O(\sqrt{\delta})\). This theorem is used to prove an interesting property testing result. Let \(\mathcal{D}\) be a subset of graphic sequences that are closed under permutation. Let \(\mathcal{G}\) be the set of graphs that have a degree sequence in \(\mathcal{D}\). Then \(\mathcal{G}\) can be tested in \(poly(1/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Sampling an Edge Uniformly in Sublinear Time</strong> by Jakub Têtek (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11178.pdf">arXiv</a>). In the general model for sublinear algorithms on graphs, an important choice is whether one allows uniform random edge queries. A natural question is whether such queries can simulated efficiently, using only random vertex, degree, and neighbor queries. This problem appears somewhat implicitly in previous sublinear subgraph counting algorithms, and <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10628/pdf/LIPIcs-ICALP-2019-52.pdf">Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum</a> study it explicitly. They prove that one can sample from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution (over edges) using \(O(n/\sqrt{\epsilon m})\) samples. The problem of sampling from exactly the uniform distribution is left open. Until this paper. The main result shows that by modifying the Eden-Ron-Rosenbaum algorithm parameters, one can generate edge samples from an \(\epsilon\)-approximate uniform distribution using \(O((n/\sqrt{m})\log \epsilon^{-1})\) samples. The exact uniform distribution is achieved by setting \(\epsilon = 1/n\), to get a sample complexity of \(O((n\log n)/\sqrt{m})\).</p>



<p><strong>Faster Property Testers in a Variation of the Bounded Degree Model </strong>by Isolde Adler and Polly Fahey (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07770.pdf">arXiv</a>). The setting of bounded-degree graph property testing naturally extends to bounded-degree relational databases, which can be thought of as “directed” hypergraphs. This is an interesting new direction of research, that combines property testing with database theory (see <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/157699299.pdf">Adler-Harwath</a> and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3294052.3319679">Chen-Yoshida</a>). One of the main contributions of this work is to consider another notion of distance: edge and vertex inserts/deletes. This is a natural extension, and we can now compare distances between graphs/databases with different numbers of vertices. The main result is that, under this notion of distance, a large class of properties can be tested in constant running time on databases with bounded degree and treewidth. Specifically, any property expressible in Counting Monadic Second-Order Logic (CMSO) can be tested in constant time. Previous results by Alder-Harwath showed that such properties can be tested (under the standard distance notion) in constant queries, but polylogarithmic time. </p>



<p><strong>Optimal Testing of Discrete Distributions with High Probability</strong> by Ilias Diakonikolas, Themis Gouleakis, Daniel M. Kane, John Peebles, and Eric Price (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06540">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/140/">ECCC</a>). The focus of this paper is distribution testing in the “high probability” regime, where we wish the error of the tester to be \(&lt; \delta\). Typically, most results just get an error of at most \(1/3\), from which standard probabilistic boosting would tack on an extra \(O(\log 1/\delta)\) factor. In standard TCS settings, one doesn’t focus on optimizing this dependence, but in statistics, there is significant focus on the optimal sample complexity. And indeed, for practical applications, it is crucial to have sharp bounds on the right number of samples required for hypothesis testing. The paper also argues that getting the optimal sample complexity requires new algorithms, even for uniformity testing. There are optimal results given for closeness and independence testing. The optimal sample complexity only pays a multiplicative factor of \(\log^{1/3} (1/\delta)\) or \(\log^{1/2}(1/\delta)\) over the optimal bound for constant error (with other additive terms depending on \(\log(1/\delta)\)).</p>



<p><strong>Bessel Smoothing and Multi-Distribution Property Estimation</strong> by Yi Hao and Ping Li (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v125/hao20a.html">COLT 2020</a>). Let us consider some standard (tolerant) distribution testing questions, phrases as approximation algorithms. Given sample access to two distributions \(p\) and \(q\) over \([n]\), we may wish to estimate the \(l_1\)-distance, \(l_2\)-distance, relative entropy, etc. between these distributions. One can phrases this problem abstractly as estimating \(\sum_{i \in [n]} f(p_i, q_i)\), where \(f\) is some explicit function. This papers shows that for any 1-Lipschitz function \(f\) that satisfies some “regularity” property, the sum \(\sum_{i \in [n]} f(p_i, q_i)\) can be \(\epsilon\)-approximated with \(O(\epsilon^{-3}n/\sqrt{\log n})\) samples (apologies to the authors to replacing their \(k\) with the more familiar \(n\) for our readers). Thus, we can get sublinear sampling complexity for a very general class of estimation problems. Moreover, this was actually the simplest setting consider in the paper. One can deal with such functions of \(d\) distributions, not just two distributions. One of the corollaries of the theorems is a sublinear tolerant tester for the property of being a mixture of distributions.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We consider statistical inference tasks in a distributed setting where access to data samples is subjected to strict “local constraints,” through a unified framework that captures communication limitations and (local) privacy constraints as special cases. We study estimation (learning) and goodness-of-fit (testing) for both discrete and high-dimensional distributions. Our goal is to understand how the sample complexity increases under the information constraints.<br /><br />In this talk we will provide an overview of this field and a sample of some of our results. We will discuss the role of (public) randomness  and interactivity in information-constrained inference, and make a case for thinking about randomness and interactivity as resources.<br /><br />The work is part of a long-term ongoing collaboration with Clément Canonne (IBM Research) and Himanshu Tyagi (IISc), and includes works done with Cody Freitag (Cornell), Yanjun Han (Stanford), Yuhan Liu (Cornell), and Ziteng Sun (Cornell). </p></blockquote></div>

<p>The next Foundations of Data Science virtual talk will take place on Friday, Oct 09th at 10:00 AM Pacific Time (1:00 pm Eastern Time, 18:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC).  <strong>Alexandr Andoni </strong>from Columbia University will speak about “<em><strong>Approximating Edit Distance in Near-Linear Time</strong></em>”.</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Edit distance is a classic measure of similarity between strings, with applications ranging from computational biology to coding. Computing edit distance is also a classic dynamic programming problem, with a quadratic run-time solution, often taught in the “Intro to Algorithms” classes. Improving this runtime has been a decades-old challenge, now ruled likely-impossible using tools from the modern area of fine-grained complexity. We show how to approximate the edit distance between two strings in near-linear time, up to a constant factor. Our result completes a research direction set forth in the breakthrough paper of [Chakraborty, Das, Goldenberg, Koucky, Saks; FOCS’18], which showed the first constant-factor approximation algorithm with a (strongly) sub-quadratic running time.</p>

<p>
Emil Faber is the pretend founder of the pretend Faber College. The 1978 movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_House">Animal House</a> starts with a close-up of Faber’s statue, which has the inscription, <b>Knowledge Is Good</b>.</p>
<p>
Today, Ken and I thought we might talk about knowledge, science, mathematics, proofs, and more.</p>
<p>
The phrase on Faber’s pedestal is meant to be a joke, as is the subtitle we added saying the same about science. But there is some truth to both of them. From the cause of climate change to the best response to the current pandemic to sports predictions there is much interest in science. Science is good, indeed.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/faberpedestal.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/faberpedestal.jpg?w=150&amp;h=114" alt="" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-17661" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Science </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What is science and what are methods of creating knowledge via science? There is a whole world on the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">science</a>. The central questions are: What is science? What methods are used to create new science? Is science good?—just kidding. </p>
<p>
We are not experts on the philosophy of science. But there seem to be three main ways to create scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Experiments:</i> This is the classic one. Think about the testing of a candidate vaccine to stop the pandemic. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Computational Experiments:</i> This is relatively new. Think computer simulations of how climate change is effected by the methods of creating energy—for example. wind vs. coal. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>Mathematical Proofs:</i> This is the one we focus on here at GLL. Think proofs that some algorithm works or that there is no algorithm that can work unless… </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Mathematical Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We are interested in creating knowledge via proving new theorems. This is how we try to create knowledge. Our science is based not on experiments and not on simulations but mostly on the theorem-proof method. Well not exactly. We do use experiments and simulations. For example, the field of quantum algorithms uses both of these.</p>
<p>
However, math proofs are the basis of complexity theory. This means that we need to create proofs and then check that they are correct. The difficulty of checking a proof is based on who created them: </p>
<ul>
<li>
You did—checking your own work. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone else did—refereeing for a journal. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone in your class did—grading exams. <p></p>
</li><li>
Some graduate student did—mentoring. <p></p>
</li><li>
Someone on the web who claims a major result like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> did—debugging. <p></p>
</li><li>
And so on.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My Favorite Checking Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My favorite tool for checking is this trick: Suppose that we have a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> that demonstrates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+X%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies X}" class="latex" title="{A \implies X}" /> is true. Sometimes it is possible to show that there is a proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> that proves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" title="{A \implies Y}" /> where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> is based on changing the claimed proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
The proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BQ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Q}" class="latex" title="{Q}" /> demonstrates <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Cimplies+Y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A \implies Y}" class="latex" title="{A \implies Y}" />, and; <p></p>
</li><li>
The statement <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> does not follow from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />.
</li></ol>
<p>
One way this commonly arises is when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> as a proof did not use all of the assumptions in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> really proves more that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> and it proves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" />. But we note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BY%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Y}" class="latex" title="{Y}" /> is not a consequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />.</p>
<p>
For example, consider the Riemann hypothesis. Suppose that we claim that we have a proof that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%5Cneq+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} \neq 0 " /></p>
<p>follows from the usual axioms of math plus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" />. Sounds great. But suppose this is based on an argument that assumes that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5E%7Bs%7D%7D+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{s}} = 0 " /></p>
<p>and manipulates the summation, eventually yielding a contradiction, without using the condition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3E+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) &gt; 1/2}" />. This is a problem, since there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CRe%28s%29+%3D+1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" class="latex" title="{\Re(s) = 1/2}" /> so that the sum is zero. This is an example of the above method of checking. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A New Checking Method </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
From time to time claims are made of resolutions to famous conjectures. Think <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. These claims have all been wrong to date. So most researchers are reluctant to take time to check any new claims. Why would you take the effort to try and find the bug that is likely there? </p>
<p>
I wonder if there could be a method that is based on competition. For concreteness, suppose Alice and Bob are two researchers who both claim a resolution to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> problem. Alice has a lower bound argument that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> and Bob has an upper bound that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. Could we have them play a “game”? </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Give their papers to each other. Have them try to find a flaw in each other’s paper. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
They are highly motivated. Could we argue that if they cannot find any flaw then we would be slightly more motivated to look at the papers? </p>
<p>
This might work even if they both claim <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />. Ken and I, personally, have had more claims of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" /> brought to our attention. Even in this case they would be highly motivated: the awards, the prizes, the praise will go to the one who is correct. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Possible Extensions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One difference in our situation from classic empirical science is the nature of gaps in knowledge. For example, one of the big current controversies in physics is over the existence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a>. The Wikipedia article we just linked seems to date mostly to years around 2012 when dark matter was more widely accepted than <a href="https://medium.com/futuresin/doubting-dark-matter-f3e400c7dcd7">strikes</a> us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-dark-matter-real/">today</a> (see also <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/dark-matter-nightmare-what-if-we-just.html">this</a> and <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2020/03/are-dark-energy-and-dark-matter.html">this</a>). There are cases where two competing theories are incompatible yet the available data do not suffice to find a fault in either. </p>
<p>
Whereas, with claimed proofs of incompatible statements, such as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" />, at least one must have a demonstrable error. The statements themselves may have barriers all the way up to undecidability, but that does not matter to judging the proffered proofs.</p>
<p>
The method may be more applicable in life sciences where the gap is gathering sufficient field or lab observations. For a topical example, consider claims about the risk or safety of human gatherings amid the pandemic. One extreme is represented by the extraordinary <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp13670.pdf">claim</a>, which is <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-much-do-crowds-contribute-to-covid-its-complicated/">evidently</a> quite <a href="https://bgr.com/2020/09/14/sturgis-bike-rally-paper-impact-on-covid-19-coronavirus-cases/">excessive</a>, that the Sturgis motorcycle rally in August led to over 250,000 Covid-19 cases. The other extreme would be analyses used to justify gatherings with minimal precautions. The extremes cannot coexist. The means to arbitrate between them are available in principle but require costly social effort for contact tracing and testing as well as resolving mathematical issues between epidemiological models.</p>

What do you think of our new checking method? Should it be more widely employed for evaluating claims and hypotheses?</p>

<p>David Blackwell was still roaming the corridors of UC Berkeley’s stat department during my postdoc years, circa 2009. Jake Abernethy, Sasha Rakhlin, Peter Bartlett and myself were discussing his results, and his seminal contributions to prediction theory were already well known.</p>

<p>At that time, still the early days of online convex optimization, we were contemplating everything from adaptive gradient methods to bandit convex optimization. Blackwell’s famed approachability theorem was looming in the background, considered to be one of the strongest theorems in the ML-theorists toolkit. </p>



<p>I’ve recently added a new draft chapter to to V2.0 of <a href="http://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu">Introduction to Online Convex Optimization</a>, about the connection between OCO and Blackwell approachability: they are algorithmically equivalent! More precisely, an efficient algorithm for approachability gives rise to an efficient algorithm for OCO with sublinear regret, and vice versa. </p>



<p>Details are in the chapter draft, and  I recommend this music for reading it: (the song is called “together we won despite everything”, dedicated to music and science)</p>

Everything pre-covid seems at least five years ago to me, so it's hard to believe that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE</a> is a 2020 result. To remind you, consider the model where we have two powerful provers put in separate rooms where they can't communicate (think suspects of a crime put in separate interrogation rooms). An computationally efficient verifier can ask them questions based on random coins. Thirty years ago, Laszlo Babai, Carsten Lund and myself <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01200056">showed</a> that every language in nondeterministic exponential time has proofs in this model.<div><br /></div><div>Now suppose the provers have entangled quantum bits. This question has a long history that culminates in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04383">MIP* = RE paper</a> earlier this year by Zhengfeng Ji, Anand Natarajan, Thomas Vidick, John Wright, Henry Yuen showing that every proof of any length can be proven in this model. Incredible!</div><div><br /></div><div>But wait, why is there a new version 2 dated last week? Turns out the MIP* = RE paper relied on a 2016 paper by Vidick which was later discovered to have a bug. No worries, as the authors of the MIP* = RE paper got around this issue by a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12982">quantum analysis</a> of a low-degree test from that old Babai-Fortnow-Lund paper.</div><div><br /></div><div>Vidick's <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/">blog post</a> explains it all, including the angst of a major result falling apart temporarily. He has <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/01/babai-strikes-back.html">good</a> <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke">company</a>.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>[C]hildren with special abilities and skills need to be nourished and encouraged.  They are a national treasure.  Challenging programs for the “gifted” are sometimes decried as “elitism.”  Why aren’t intensive practice sessions for varsity football, baseball, and basketball players and interschool competition deemed elitism?  After all, only the most gifted athletes participate.  There is a self-defeating double standard at work here, nationwide.<br />—Carl Sagan, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Haunted-World-Science-Candle-Dark/dp/0345409469"><em>The Demon-Haunted World</em></a> (1996)</p></blockquote>



<p>I’d like you to feel about the <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">impending destruction</a> of Virginia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_High_School_for_Science_and_Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a>, the same way you might’ve felt when the Taliban threatened to blow up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan">Bamyan Buddhas</a>, and then days later actually did blow them up.  Or the way you felt when human negligence caused wildfires that incinerated half the koalas in Australia, or turned the San Francisco skyline into an orange hellscape.  For that matter, the same way most of us felt the day Trump was elected.  I’d like you to feel in the bottom of your stomach the <em>avoidability</em>, and yet the finality, of the loss.</p>



<p>For thousands of kids in the DC area, especially first- or second-generation immigrants, TJHS represented a lifeline.  Score high enough on an entrance exam—something hard but<em> totally within your control</em>—and you could attend a school where, instead of the other kids either tormenting or ignoring you, they might teach you Lisp or the surreal number system.  Where you could learn humility instead of humiliation.</p>



<p>When I visited TJHS back in 2012 to give a quantum computing talk, I toured the campus, chatted with students, fielded their questions, and thought: so <em>this</em> is the teenagerhood—the ironically <em>normal</em> teenagerhood—that I was denied by living someplace else.  I found myself wishing that a hundred more TJHS’s, large and small, would sprout up across the country.  I felt like if I could further that goal then, though the universe return to rubble, my life would’ve had a purpose.</p>



<p>Instead, of course, our sorry country is destroying the few such schools that exist.  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/nyregion/specialized-schools-nyc-deblasio.html">Stuyvesant and Bronx Science</a> in New York, and the Liberal Arts and Science Academy here in Austin, are also under mortal threat right now.  The numerous parents who moved, who arranged their lives, specifically so that these schools might later be available for “high-risk” kids were suckered.</p>



<p>Assuming you haven’t just emerged from 30 years in a Tibetan cave, you presumably know why this is happening.  As the <em>Washington Post</em>‘s Jay Matthews <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/americas-top-sat-school-makes-another-disputed-attempt-at-diversity/2020/10/03/1bef3db2-0261-11eb-897d-3a6201d6643f_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F2bf01fe%2F5f78a5d19d2fda0efb3d8031%2F5974cf76ade4e21a8497eeb1%2F42%2F62%2F2b179e7390f19bdba6f66f626ab37646">explains</a>, the Fairfax County School Board is “embarrassed” to have a school that, despite all its outreach attempts, remains only 5% Black and Latino—even though, crucially, the school <em>also</em> happens to be only 19% White (it’s now ~75% Asian).</p>



<p>You might ask: so then why doesn’t TJHS just institute affirmative action, like almost every university does?  It seems there’s an extremely interesting answer: <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2017/04/26/is-the-no-1-high-school-in-america-thomas-jefferson-fairfax-discrimination/">they did in the 1990s</a>, and Black and Hispanic enrollment surged.  But then the verdicts of court cases, brought by right-wing groups, made the school district fear that they’d be open to lawsuits if they continued with affirmative action, so they dropped it.  Now the boomerang has returned, and the School Board has decided on a more drastic remedy: namely, to eliminate the TJHS entrance exam entirely, and replace it by a lottery for anyone whose GPA exceeds 3.5.</p>



<p>The trouble is, TJHS without an entrance exam is no longer TJHS.  More likely than not, such a place would simply converge to become another of the thousands of schools across the US where success is based on sports, networking, and popularity.  And if by some miracle it avoided that fate, <em>still</em> it would no longer be available to most of the kids who‘d most need it.</p>



<p>So yes, the district is <strong>embarrassed</strong>—note that the<em> Washington Post</em> writer explains it as if that’s the most obvious, natural reaction in the world—to host a school that’s regularly ranked #1 in the US, with the highest average SATs and a distinguished list of alumni.  To avoid this embarrassment, the solution is (in effect) to burn the school to the ground.</p>



<p>In a world-historic irony, the main effect of this “solution” will be to <strong>drastically limit the number of Asian students, while drastically <em>increasing</em> (!!!) the number of White students</strong>.  The proportion of Black and Hispanic students is projected to increase a bit but remain small.  Let me say that one more time: in practice, TJHS’s move from a standardized test to a lottery will be<strong> overwhelmingly pro-White, anti-Asian, and anti-immigrant</strong>; only as a much smaller effect will it be pro-underrepresented-minority.</p>



<p>In spite of covid and everything else going on, hundreds of students and parents have been <a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/23/rallying-to-protect-admissions-standards-at-americas-best-public-high-school/">protesting in front of TJHS</a> to try to prevent the school’s tragic and pointless destruction.  But it sounds like TJHS’s fate might be sealed.  The school board tolerated excellence for 35 more years than it wanted to; now its patience is at an end.</p>



<p>Some will say: sure, the end of TJHS is unfortunate, Scott, but why do you let this stuff <em>weigh</em> on you so heavily?  This is merely another instance of friendly fire, of good people fighting the just war against racism, and in <em>one</em> case hitting a target that, yeah, OK, probably should’ve been spared.  On reflection, though, I can accept that only insofar as I accept that it was “friendly fire” when Bolsheviks targeted the kulaks, or (much more comically, less importantly, and less successfully) when Arthur Chu, Amanda Marcotte, and a thousand other woke-ists targeted me.  With friendly fire like that, who needs enemy fire?</p>



<p>If you care about the gifted Black and Hispanic kids of Fairfax County, then like me, you should demand a change in the law to allow the reinstatement of affirmative action for them.  You should acknowledge that the issue lies there and not with TJHS itself.</p>



<p>I don’t see how you reach the point of understanding all the facts and still wanting to dismantle TJHS, over the desperate pleas of the students and parents, without a decent helping of <em>resentment</em> toward the kind of student who flourishes there—without a wish to see those uppity,  “fresh off the boat” Chinese and Indian grinds get dragged down to where they belong.  And if you tell me that such magnet programs need to end even though you yourself once benefitted from them—well, isn’t that more contemptible still?  Aren’t you knowingly burning a bridge you crossed so that a younger generation can’t follow you, basically reassuring the popular crowd that if they’ll only accept <em>you</em>, then there won’t be a hundred more greasy nerds in your tow?  And if, on some level, you already know these things about yourself, then the only purpose of this post has been to remind you of them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>As for the news that dominates the wires and inevitably preempts what I’ve written: <strong>I wish for his successful recovery, followed by his losing the election and spending the rest of his life in New York State prison</strong>.  (And I look forward to seeing how woke Twitter summarizes the preceding statement—e.g., “Aaronson, his mask finally off, conveys well-wishes to Donald Trump”…)</p>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://differentialprivacy.org/open-problem-avoid-union/">Open Problem - Avoiding the Union Bound for Multiple Queries</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://differentialprivacy.org" title="Differential Privacy">DifferentialPrivacy.org</a>
<p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><strong>Background:</strong> Perhaps the best-studied problem in differential privacy is answering multiple counting queries.
The standard approach is to add independent, appropriately-calibrated (Laplace or Gaussian) noise to each query result and apply a composition theorem.
To bound the maximum error over the query answers, one takes a union bound over the independent noise samples.
However, this is <em>not</em> optimal.
The problem is to identify the optimal method (up to constant factors).</p>

<p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> Is there a randomized algorithm \(M : \{0,1\}^{n \times k} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k\) that is differentially private<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and satisfies
\[
\forall x \in \{0, 1\}^{n \times k} \quad \mathbb{E}\left[ \left\|M(x) - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \right\|_\infty \right] \leq c \sqrt{k}
\]
for some constant \( c &gt; 0\) depending only on the privacy parameters?<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Adding independent Gaussian noise to each coordinate/query yields \(c \sqrt{k \log k}\) in place of \(c \sqrt{k}\) above. 
Steinke and Ullman [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>] showed that the union bound can <em>almost</em> be avoided and obtained \(c \sqrt{k \log \log k}\) using correlated noise.
The algorithm is nonetheless based on independent Gaussian noise, with the added step of using the exponential mechanism to identify high-error answers and correct them.</p>

<p>Note that a \(\Omega(\sqrt{k})\) lower bound is known [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3158">BUV18</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095">SU17</a>]. By [<a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~bhaskara/files/privacy.pdf">BDKT12</a>] it suffices to consider mechanisms \(M\) that add <em>instance-independent noise</em>. That is, \(M(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + Z\) where \(Z\) is some fixed noise distribution over \(\mathbb{R}^k\) that is independent of \(x\).</p>

<p><strong>Reward:</strong> For a positive solution, an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner at a sushi restaurant of your choice.
If the solution is an efficiently-sampleable distribution with a closed-form density, alcohol will be included.
For a negative solution, alcohol only.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

A very recent work by Ganesh and Zhao [<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~arunganesh/papers/generalizedgaussians.pdf">GZ20</a>] improves the best upper bound from \(c\sqrt{k \log \log k}\) to \(c\sqrt{k \log \log \log k}\).</p>
