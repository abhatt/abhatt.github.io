<div class="content">
We show that, in the black-box setting, the behavior of quantum polynomial-time (${BQP}$) can be remarkably decoupled from that of classical complexity classes like ${NP}$. Specifically:

-There exists an oracle relative to which ${NP}^{{BQP}}\not \subset {BQP}^{{PH}}$, resolving a 2005 problem of Fortnow. Interpreted another way, we show that ${AC^0}$ circuits cannot perform useful homomorphic encryption on instances of the Forrelation problem. As a corollary, there exists an oracle relative to which ${P} = {NP}$ but ${BQP} \neq {QCMA}$.
-Conversely, there exists an oracle relative to which ${BQP}^{{NP}}\not \subset {PH}^{{BQP}}$.
-Relative to a random oracle, ${PP} = {PostBQP}$ is not contained in the "${QMA}$ hierarchy" ${QMA}^{{QMA}^{{QMA}^{\cdots}}}$, and more generally ${PP} \not\subset ({MIP}^*)^{({MIP}^*)^{({MIP}^*)^{\cdots}}}$ (!), despite the fact that ${MIP}^{\ast}={RE}$ in the unrelativized world. This result shows that there is no black-box quantum analogue of Stockmeyer's approximate counting algorithm.
-Relative to a random oracle, ${\Sigma}_{k+1}^{P} \not\subset {BQP}^{{\Sigma}_{k}^{P}}$ for every $k$.
-There exists an oracle relative to which ${BQP} = {P^{\# P}}$ and yet ${PH}$ is infinite. (By contrast, if ${NP}\subseteq{BPP}$, then ${PH}$ collapses relative to all oracles.)
-There exists an oracle relative to which ${P}={NP} \neq {BQP}={P}^{{\#P}}$.

To achieve these results, we build on the 2018 achievement by Raz and Tal of an oracle relative to which ${BQP}\not \subset {PH}$, and associated results about the Forrelation problem. We also introduce new tools that might be of independent interest. These include a "quantum-aware" version of the random restriction method, a concentration theorem for the block sensitivity of ${AC^0}$ circuits, and a (provable) analogue of the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture for sparse oracles.</div>

The multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma asserts that over a field, a low-degree polynomial cannot vanish with high multiplicity very often on a sufficiently large product set. Since its discovery in a work of Dvir, Kopparty, Saraf and Sudan [DKSS13], the lemma has found nu- merous applications in both math and computer science; in particular, in the definition and properties of multiplicity codes by Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [KSY14].

In this work, we show how to algorithmize the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma for ar- bitrary product sets over any field. In other words, we give an efficient algorithm for unique decoding of multivariate multiplicity codes from half their minimum distance on arbitrary product sets over all fields. Previously, such an algorithm was known either when the un- derlying product set had a nice algebraic structure (for instance, was a subfield) [Kop15] or when the underlying field had large (or zero) characteristic, the multiplicity parameter was sufficiently large and the multiplicity code had distance bounded away from 1 [BHKS21]. In particular, even unique decoding of bivariate multiplicity codes with multiplicity two from half their minimum distance was not known over arbitrary product sets over any field.

Our algorithm builds upon a result of Kim &amp; Kopparty [KK17] who gave an algorithmic version of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma (without multiplicities) or equivalently, an efficient al- gorithm for unique decoding of Reed-Muller codes over arbitrary product sets. We introduce a refined notion of distance based on the multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma and design a unique decoding algorithm for this distance measure. On the way, we give an alternate proof of Forney’s classical generalized minimum distance decoder that might be of independent interest.</div>

$\mathbb{F}$ then there are polynomials $R_1,\ldots,R_m$ such that
$R_1P_1+\cdots+R_mP_m \equiv 1$. Green and Tao [Contrib. Discrete Math. 2009,

that the degrees of the polynomials $R_i$ can be bounded independently of $n$,
though with an Ackermann-type dependence on the other parameters $m$, $d$, and
$|\mathbb{F}|$. In this note we use the polynomial method to give a proof with
a degree bound of $md(|\mathbb{F}|-1)$. We also show that the dependence on
each of the parameters is the best possible up to an absolute constant.

In this problem, each
request $i$ arrives at some point $v_i$ of an $n$-point metric space at time
$b_i$ and comes with a deadline $e_i$. One of the $k$ servers must be moved to
$v_i$ at some time in the interval $[b_i, e_i]$ to satisfy this request. We
give an online algorithm for this problem with a competitive ratio of ${\rm
polylog} (n,\Delta)$, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the metric space.
Prior to our work, the best competitive ratio known for this problem was $O(k
\cdot {\rm polylog}(n))$ given by Azar et al. (STOC 2017). Our algorithm is
based on a new covering linear program relaxation for $k$-server on HSTs. This
LP naturally corresponds to the min-cost flow formulation of $k$-server, and
easily extends to the case of time-windows. We give an online algorithm for
obtaining a feasible fractional solution for this LP, and a primal dual
analysis framework for accounting the cost of the solution. Together, they
yield a new $k$-server algorithm with poly-logarithmic competitive ratio, and
extend to the time-windows case as well. Our principal technical contribution
lies in thinking of the covering LP as yielding a {\em truncated} covering LP
at each internal node of the tree, which allows us to keep account of server
movements across subtrees. We hope that this LP relaxation and the
algorithm/analysis will be a useful tool for addressing $k$-server and related
problems.

algorithmic paradigm which captures state-of-the-art algorithmic guarantees for
a wide array of problems. In the average case setting, SoS lower bounds provide
strong evidence of algorithmic hardness or information-computation gaps. Prior
to this work, SoS lower bounds have been obtained for problems in the "dense"
input regime, where the input is a collection of independent Rademacher or
Gaussian random variables, while the sparse regime has remained out of reach.
We make the first progress in this direction by obtaining strong SoS lower
bounds for the problem of Independent Set on sparse random graphs. We prove
that with high probability over an Erdos-Renyi random graph $G\sim
G_{n,\frac{d}{n}}$ with average degree $d&gt;\log^2 n$, degree-$D_{SoS}$ SoS fails
to refute the existence of an independent set of size $k =
\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{d}(\log n)(D_{SoS})^{c_0}} \right)$ in $G$ (where
$c_0$ is an absolute constant), whereas the true size of the largest
independent set in $G$ is $O\left(\frac{n\log d}{d}\right)$.
</p>
<p>Our proof involves several significant extensions of the techniques used for
proving SoS lower bounds in the dense setting. Previous lower bounds are based
on the pseudo-calibration heuristic of Barak et al [FOCS 2016] which produces a
candidate SoS solution using a planted distribution indistinguishable from the
input distribution via low-degree tests. In the sparse case the natural planted
distribution does admit low-degree distinguishers, and we show how to adapt the
pseudo-calibration heuristic to overcome this.
</p>
<p>Another notorious technical challenge for the sparse regime is the quest for
matrix norm bounds. In this paper, we obtain new norm bounds for graph matrices
in the sparse setting.

gives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so
far, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper
we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result
by Chia, Gily\'en, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can
be efficiently "dequantized" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its
implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by
establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and
making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class
of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.
</p>
<p>We first show how to efficiently "dequantize", with arbitrarily small
constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply
this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant
precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a
central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum
chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when
given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state)
can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a
complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same
problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the
superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that
said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum
setting. We also discuss how this dequantization technique may help make
progress on the central quantum PCP conjecture.

\emph{polygon burning} (PB) problem: Given a polygonal domain $P$ with $h$
holes and $n$ vertices, find a set $S$ of $k$ vertices of $P$ that minimizes
the maximum geodesic distance from any point in $P$ to its nearest vertex in
$S$. Alternatively, viewing each vertex in $S$ as a site to start a fire, the
goal is to select $S$ such that fires burning simultaneously and uniformly from
$S$, restricted to $P$, consume $P$ entirely as quickly as possible. We prove
that PB is NP-hard when $k$ is arbitrary. We show that the discrete $k$-center
of the vertices of $P$ under the geodesic metric on $P$ provides a
$2$-approximation for PB, resulting in an $O(n^2 \log n + hkn \log n)$-time
$3$-approximation algorithm for PB. Lastly, we define and characterize a new
type of polygon, the sliceable polygon. A sliceable polygon is a convex polygon
that contains no Voronoi vertex from the Voronoi diagram of its vertices. We
give a dynamic programming algorithm to solve PB exactly on a sliceable polygon
in $O(kn^2)$ time.

that has received a growing amount of attention in recent years. We investigate
the complexity of recognizing these graphs. We show that this problem is
NP-hard even if there are only two layers or if only one change is allowed
between consecutive layers. We consider the parameterized complexity of the

from the static to the temporal setting in three different ways. Finally, we
consider a version of the problem in which we only restrict the total number of
changes throughout the lifetime of the graph. We show that this variant is
fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the number of changes.

given. The objective of Roman domination problem is to find a function
$f:V\rightarrow {\{0,1,2\}}$ such that for any vertex $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$
must be adjacent to at least one vertex $u\in V$ with $f(u)=2$ and $\sum_{u\in

that the Roman domination problem (RDP) is NP-complete for general graphs and
it remains NP-complete for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we propose a
dynamic programming based polynomial time algorithm for RDP in convex bipartite

graphics. The spectrum and eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator,
for example, are fundamental for methods in shape analysis and mesh processing.
The Subspace Iteration Method is a robust solver for these problems. In
practice, however, Lanczos schemes are often faster. In this paper, we
introduce the Hierarchical Subspace Iteration Method (HSIM), a novel solver for
sparse eigenproblems that operates on a hierarchy of nested vector spaces. The
hierarchy is constructed such that on the coarsest space all eigenpairs can be
computed with a dense eigensolver. HSIM uses these eigenpairs as initialization
and iterates from coarse to fine over the hierarchy. On each level, subspace
iterations, initialized with the solution from the previous level, are used to
approximate the eigenpairs. This approach substantially reduces the number of
iterations needed on the finest grid compared to the non-hierarchical Subspace
Iteration Method. Our experiments show that HSIM can solve Laplace--Beltrami
eigenproblems on meshes faster than state-of-the-art methods based on Lanczos
iterations, preconditioned conjugate gradients and subspace iterations.

Many
spanner constructions use a certain type of clustering at their core, where
each cluster has small diameter and there are relatively few spanner edges
between clusters. In this paper, we provide a clustering algorithm that, given
$k\geq 2$, can be used to compute a spanner of stretch $2k-1$ and expected size
$O(n^{1+1/k})$ in $k$ rounds in the CONGEST model. This improves upon the state
of the art (by Elkin, and Neiman [TALG'19]) by making the bounds on both
running time and stretch independent of the random choices of the algorithm,
whereas they only hold with high probability in previous results. Spanners are
used in certain synchronizers, thus our improvement directly carries over to
such synchronizers. Furthermore, for keeping the \emph{total} number of
inter-cluster edges small in low diameter decompositions, our clustering
algorithm provides the following guarantees. Given $\beta\in (0,1]$, we compute
a low diameter decomposition with diameter bound $O\left(\frac{\log
n}{\beta}\right)$ such that each edge $e\in E$ is an inter-cluster edge with
probability at most $\beta\cdot w(e)$ in $O\left(\frac{\log n}{\beta}\right)$
rounds in the CONGEST model. Again, this improves upon the state of the art (by
Miller, Peng, and Xu [SPAA'13]) by making the bounds on both running time and
diameter independent of the random choices of the algorithm, whereas they only
hold with high probability in previous results.

current bound on the number of registers for multiplying and dividing fast
(running in time linear in the size of the input) can be improved and whether
one can output fast the powers of two summing up to a positive integer in
subquadratic time. Both questions are answered positively. Furthermore, it is
shown that every function computed by only one register is automatic and that
automatic functions with one input can be computed with four registers in
linear time; automatic functions with a larger number of inputs can be computed
with 5 registers in linear time. There is a nonautomatic function with one

regression, namely where regret is defined with respect to an arbitrary
function class which has bounded complexity. Our contributions are two-fold:
</p>
<p>- In the realizable setting of nonparametric online regression with the
absolute loss, we propose a randomized proper learning algorithm which gets a
near-optimal mistake bound in terms of the sequential fat-shattering dimension
of the hypothesis class. In the setting of online classification with a class
of Littlestone dimension $d$, our bound reduces to $d \cdot {\rm poly} \log T$.
This result answers a question as to whether proper learners could achieve
near-optimal mistake bounds; previously, even for online classification, the
best known mistake bound was $\tilde O( \sqrt{dT})$. Further, for the
real-valued (regression) setting, the optimal mistake bound was not even known
for improper learners, prior to this work.
</p>
<p>- Using the above result, we exhibit an independent learning algorithm for
general-sum binary games of Littlestone dimension $d$, for which each player
achieves regret $\tilde O(d^{3/4} \cdot T^{1/4})$. This result generalizes
analogous results of Syrgkanis et al. (2015) who showed that in finite games
the optimal regret can be accelerated from $O(\sqrt{T})$ in the adversarial
setting to $O(T^{1/4})$ in the game setting.
</p>
<p>To establish the above results, we introduce several new techniques,
including: a hierarchical aggregation rule to achieve the optimal mistake bound
for real-valued classes, a multi-scale extension of the proper online
realizable learner of Hanneke et al. (2021), an approach to show that the
output of such nonparametric learning algorithms is stable, and a proof that
the minimax theorem holds in all online learnable games.

grid composed of elastic elements which are completely planar and straight.
Only by fixing the ends of the planar elements to appropriate locations, the 2d
grid bends and approximates the given 3d surface. Our method is based purely on
the notions from differential geometry of curves and surfaces and avoids any
physical simulations. In particular, we introduce a well-defined elastic grid
energy functional that allows identifying networks of curves that minimize the
bending energy and at the same time nestle to the provided input surface well.
Further, we generalize the concept of such grids to cases where the surface
boundary does not need to be convex, which allows for the creation of
sophisticated and visually pleasing shapes. The algorithm finally ensures that
the 2d grid is perfectly planar, making the resulting gridshells inexpensive,
easy to fabricate, transport, assemble, and finally also to deploy.
Additionally, since the whole structure is pre-strained, it also comes with
load-bearing capabilities. We evaluate our method using physical simulation and
we also provide a full fabrication pipeline for desktop-size models and present
multiple examples of surfaces with elliptic and hyperbolic curvature regions.
Our method is meant as a tool for quick prototyping for designers, architects,
and engineers since it is very fast and results can be obtained in a matter of
seconds.

Evaluation (SBFE) problem for symmetric Boolean functions. The first is an
$O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm, based on the submodular goal-value
approach of Deshpande, Hellerstein and Kletenik. Our second algorithm, which is
simple, is based on the algorithm solving the SBFE problem for $k$-of-$n$
functions, due to Salloum, Breuer, and Ben-Dov. It achieves a $(B-1)$
approximation factor, where $B$ is the number of blocks of 0's and 1's in the
standard vector representation of the symmetric Boolean function. As part of
the design of the first algorithm, we prove that the goal value of any
symmetric Boolean function is less than $n(n+1)/2$. Finally, we give an example
showing that for symmetric Boolean functions, minimum expected verification
cost and minimum expected evaluation cost are not necessarily equal. This
contrasts with a previous result, given by Das, Jafarpour, Orlitsky, Pan and
Suresh, which showed that equality holds in the unit-cost case.

appear in the stream. We focus on one of the strongest privacy guarantees for
the streaming model, namely user-level pan-privacy, which ensures that the
privacy of any user is protected, even against an adversary that observes, on
rare occasions, the internal state of the algorithm. Our proposed algorithms
employ optimally all the allocated privacy budget, are specially tailored for
the streaming model, and, hence, outperform both theoretically and
experimentally the conventional sampling-based approach.

networking. In this work we initiate the formal study of oblivious routing in
the context of reconfigurable networks, a new architecture that has recently
come to the fore in datacenter networking. These networks allow a rapidly
changing bounded-degree pattern of interconnections between nodes, but the
network topology and the selection of routing paths must both be oblivious to
the traffic demand matrix. Our focus is on the trade-off between maximizing
throughput and minimizing latency in these networks. For every constant
throughput rate, we characterize (up to a constant factor) the minimum latency
achievable by an oblivious reconfigurable network design that satisfies the
given throughput guarantee. The trade-off between these two objectives turns
out to be surprisingly subtle: the curve depicting it has an unexpected
scalloped shape reflecting the fact that load-balancing becomes more difficult
when the average length of routing paths is not an integer because equalizing
all the path lengths is not possible. The proof of our lower bound uses LP
duality to verify that Valiant load balancing is the most efficient oblivious
routing scheme when used in combination with an optimally-designed
reconfigurable network topology. The proof of our upper bound uses an algebraic
construction in which the network nodes are identified with vectors over a
finite field, the network topology is described by either the elementary basis
or a sequence of Vandermonde matrices, and routing paths are constructed by
selecting columns of these matrices to yield the appropriate mixture of path
lengths within the shortest possible time interval.

<div class="content">
Multipoint evaluation is the computational task of evaluating a polynomial given as a list of coefficients at a given set of inputs. Besides being a natural and fundamental question in computer algebra on its own, fast algorithms for this problem is also closely related to fast algorithms for other natural algebraic questions like polynomial factorization and modular composition. And while \emph{nearly linear time} algorithms have been known for the univariate instance of multipoint evaluation  for close to five decades due to a work of Borodin and Moenck \cite{BM74}, fast algorithms for the multivariate version have been much harder to come by. In a significant improvement to the state of art for this problem, Umans \cite{Umans08} and Kedlaya \&amp; Umans \cite{Kedlaya11} gave nearly linear time algorithms for this problem over field of small characteristic and over all finite fields respectively, provided that the number of variables $n$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$ where the degree of the input polynomial in every variable is less than $d$. They also stated the question of designing fast algorithms for the large variable case (i.e. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$) as an open problem. 

In this work, we show that there is a deterministic algorithm for multivariate multipoint evaluation over a field $\F_{q}$ of characteristic $p$ which evaluates an $n$-variate polynomial of degree less than $d$ in each variable on $N$ inputs in time $$\left((N + d^n)^{1 + o(1)}\poly(\log q, d, p, n)\right) \, ,$$ provided that $p$ is at most $d^{o(1)}$, and $q$ is at most $(\exp(\exp(\exp(\cdots (\exp(d)))))$, where the height of this tower of exponentials is fixed. When the number of variables is large (e.g. $n \notin d^{o(1)}$), this is the first {nearly linear} time algorithm for this problem over any (large enough) field.

Our algorithm is based on elementary algebraic ideas and this algebraic structure naturally leads to the following two independently interesting applications.

\begin{itemize}
\item We  show that there is an \emph{algebraic} data structure for univariate polynomial evaluation with nearly linear space complexity and sublinear time complexity over finite fields of small characteristic and quasipolynomially bounded size. This  provides a counterexample to a conjecture of Milterson \cite{M95} who conjectured that over small finite fields, any algebraic data structure for polynomial evaluation using  polynomial space must have linear query complexity. 

 \item We also show that over finite fields of small characteristic and quasipolynomially bounded size,  Vandermonde matrices are not rigid enough to  yield size-depth tradeoffs for linear circuits via the current quantitative bounds in Valiant's program \cite{Valiant1977}. More precisely, for every fixed prime $p$, we show that for every constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, and large enough $n$, the rank of any $n \times n$ Vandermonde matrix $V$ over the field $\F_{p^a}$ can be reduced to $
   \left(n/\exp(\Omega(\poly(\epsilon)\sqrt{\log n}))\right) $ by changing at most $n^{\Theta(\epsilon)}$ entries in every row of $V$, provided $a \leq \poly(\log n)$. Prior to this work, similar upper bounds on rigidity were known only for special Vandermonde matrices. For instance, the Discrete Fourier Transform matrices and Vandermonde matrices with generators in a geometric progression \cite{DL20}.

<p>Back in March of 2019 <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/03/scooped.html">I wrote</a></p><blockquote><p>I was also going to post about Yann LeCun's Facebook rant about stodgy CS departments but then Yann goes ahead and wins a Turing award with Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for their work on machine learning. I knew Yann from when we worked together at NEC Research in the early 2000's and let's just congratulate him and the others and let them bask in glory for truly transforming how we think of computing today. I'll get back to his post soon enough.</p></blockquote><p>So not that soon. Yann's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152719972317143&amp;id=722677142">post</a> was from 2015 where he went after "stodgy" CS departments naming Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Chicago.</p><blockquote><p>CS is a quickly evolving field.  Because of excess conservatism, these departments have repeatedly missed important trends in CS and related field, such as Data Science. They seem to view CS as meaning strictly theory, crypto, systems and programming  languages, what some have called "core CS", paying lip service to graphics, vision, machine learning, AI, HCI, robotics, etc. But these areas are the ones that have been expanding the fastest in the last decades, particularly machine learning and computer vision in the last decade....It is quite common, and somewhat natural, that newer areas (eg ML) be looked down upon by members of older, more established areas (eg Theory and Systems). After all, scientists are professional skeptics. But in a fast evolving disciplines like CS and now Data Science, an excessive aversion to risk and change is a recipe for failure.</p></blockquote><p>We've seen some changes since. Yale's Statistics Department is now <a href="https://statistics.yale.edu/">Statistics and Data Science</a>. The University of Chicago has a new Data Science <a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/new-college-data-science-major-foundations-insight-impact">undergrad major</a> and <a href="https://cdac.uchicago.edu/insights/introducing-the-uchicago-data-science-institute/">institute</a>.</p><p>I wonder if that's the future. CS doesn't really change that much, at least not quickly. Data science, and perhaps cybersecurity, evolve as separate fields which only have limited intersection with traditional CS. The CS degree itself just focuses on those interested in how the machines work and the theory behind them. We're busy trying to figure this out at Illinois Tech as are most other schools. And what about augmented/virtual reality and the metaverse, quantum computing, fintech, social networks, human and social factors and so on? How do you choose which bets to make? </p><p>Most of all, universities, traditionally slowly moving machines, need to far more agile even in fields outside computing since the digital transformation is affecting everything. How do you plan degrees when the computing landscape when students graduate is different from when they start? </p></div>

<p><strong>About IBM’s new <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/127-qubit-quantum-processor-eagle">127-qubit superconducting chip</a>:</strong> As I <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297583-ibm-creates-largest-ever-superconducting-quantum-computer/">told <em>New Scientist</em></a>, I look forward to seeing the actual details!  As far as I could see, the marketing materials that IBM released yesterday take a lot of words to say absolutely nothing about what, to experts, is the single most important piece of information: namely, <em>what are the gate fidelities?</em>  How deep of a quantum circuit can they apply?  How have they benchmarked the chip?  Right now, all I have to go on is a <a href="https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services?services=systems&amp;order=qubits%20DESC&amp;view=table&amp;system=ibm_washington">stats page</a> for the new chip, <s>which reports its average CNOT error as 0.9388—in other words, close to 1, or terrible! (But see also a <a href="https://twitter.com/decodoku/status/1460622008916627456?s=21">tweet by James Wootton</a>, which explains that such numbers are often highly misleading when a new chip is first rolled out.)  Does anyone here have more information?</s>  <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (11/17):</span></strong> As of this morning, the average CNOT error has been updated to 2%.  Thanks to multiple commenters for letting me know!</p>



<p><strong>About the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14502">new simulation</a> of Google’s 53-qubit Sycamore chip in 5 minutes on a Sunway supercomputer (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01066">here</a>):</strong> This is an exciting step forward on the classical validation of quantum supremacy experiments, and—ironically, what currently amounts to almost the same thing—on the classical <em>spoofing</em> of those experiments.  Congratulations to the team in China that achieved this!  But there are two crucial things to understand.  First, “5 minutes” refers to the time needed to calculate a <em>single</em> amplitude (or perhaps, several correlated amplitudes) using tensor network contraction.  It doesn’t refer to the time needed to generate millions of <em>independent</em> noisy samples, which is what Google’s Sycamore chip does in 3 minutes.  For the latter task, more like a week still seems to be needed on the supercomputer.  (I’m grateful to Chu Guo, a coauthor of the new work who spoke in UT Austin’s weekly quantum Zoom meeting, for clarifying this point.)  Second, the Sunway supercomputer has parallel processing power equivalent to approximately ten million of your laptop.  Thus, even if we agreed that Google no longer had quantum supremacy as measured by time, it would still have quantum supremacy as measured by carbon footprint!  (And this despite the fact that the quantum computer itself requires a noisy, closet-sized dilution fridge.)  Even so, for me the new work underscores the point that quantum supremacy is not yet a done deal.  Over the next few years, I hope that Google and USTC, as well as any new entrants to this race (IBM? IonQ? Harvard? Rigetti?), will push forward with more qubits and, even more importantly, better gate fidelities leading to higher Linear Cross-Entropy scores.  Meanwhile, we theorists should try to do our part by inventing new and better protocols with which to demonstrate near-term quantum supremacy—<em>especially</em> protocols for which the classical verification is easier.</p>



<p><strong>About the new anti-woke <a href="https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/we-cant-wait-for-universities-to">University of Austin</a> (UATX):</strong> In general, I’m extremely happy for people to experiment with new and different institutions, and of course I’m happy for more intellectual activity in my adopted city of Austin.  And, as <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers will know, I’m probably more sympathetic than most to the reality of the problem that UATX is trying to solve—living, as we do, in an era when one academic after another has been cancelled for ideas that a mere decade ago would’ve been considered unexceptional, moderate, center-left.  Having said all that, I wish I could feel more optimistic about UATX’s prospects.  I found its <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/">website</a> heavy on free-speech rhetoric but frustratingly light on what the new university is actually going to <em>do</em>: what courses it will offer, who will teach them, where the campus will be, etc. etc.  Arguably this is all excusable for a university still in ramp-up mode, but had I been in their shoes, I might have held off on the public launch until I had at least some sample content to offer.  Certainly, the fact that Steven Pinker has <a href="https://www.uaustin.org/news/uatx-statement-about-robert-zimmer-and-steven-pinker">quit UATX’s advisory board</a> is a discouraging sign.  If UATX asks me to get involved—to lecture there, to give them advice about their CS program, etc.—I’ll consider it as I would any other request.  So far, though, they haven’t.</p>



<p><strong>About the Association for Mathematical Research:</strong> Last month, some colleagues invited me to join a brand-new society called the <a href="https://amathr.org/">Association for Mathematical Research</a>.  Many of the other founders (Joel Hass, Abigail Thompson, Colin Adams, Richard Borcherds, Jeff Cheeger, Pavel Etingof, Tom Hales, Jeff Lagarias, Mark Lackenby, Cliff Taubes, …) were brilliant mathematicians who I admired, they seemed like they could use a bit of theoretical computer science representation, there was no time commitment, maybe they’d eventually do something good, so I figured why not?  Alas, to say that AMR has proved unpopular on Twitter would be an understatement: it’s received the same contemptuous reception that UATX has.  The argument seems to be: starting a new mathematical society, even an avowedly diverse and apolitical one, is really just an implicit claim that the existing societies, like the <a href="https://www.maa.org/">Mathematical Association of America (MAA)</a>  and the <a href="https://www.ams.org/home/page">American Mathematical Society (AMS)</a>, have been co-opted by woke true-believers.  But that’s paranoid and insane!  I mean, it’s not as if an <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/">AMS blog</a> has called for the <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/inclusionexclusion/2017/05/11/get-out-the-way/#more-772">mass resignation</a> of white male mathematicians to make room for the marginalized, or the boycott of Israeli universities, or the abolition of the criminal justice system <font size="-3"><em>(what to do about Kyle Rittenhouse though?)</em></font>.  Still, even though claims of that sort of co-option are obviously far-out, rabid fantasies, yeah, I did decide to give a new organization the benefit of the doubt.  AMR might well fail or languish in obscurity, just like UATX might.  On the other hand, the barriers to making a positive difference for the intellectual world, the world I love, the world under constant threat from the self-certain ideologues of every side, do strike me as orders of magnitude smaller for a new professional society than they do for a new university.</p></div>

<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>: Classic models of communication in economics typically assume agents can communicate any message.  However, many important communications, such as those in newspapers or politicians’ speeches, use data to convey information.  In this talk, we explore how the reliance on data impacts communication.  In our model, there are two Bayesian agents (a sender and a receiver) who wish to communicate. The receiver must take an action whose payoff depends on their personal preferences and an unknown state of the world. The sender has access to a collection of data points correlated with the state of the world and can send exactly one of these to the receiver in order to influence her choice of action. Importantly, the sender’s personal preferences may differ from the receiver’s, which affects the sender’s strategic choice of what to send. We show that in a Nash equilibrium even a small difference in preferences can lead to a significant bias in the communicated datum. This can significantly reduce informativeness of the communication, leading to substantial utility loss for both sides. One implication is informational homophily: a receiver can rationally prefer to obtain data from a poorly-informed sender with aligned preferences, rather than a knowledgeable expert whose preferences may differ from her own.  </p>

A PAC learning model involves two worst-case requirements: a learner must learn all functions in a class on all example distributions. However, basing the hardness of learning on NP-hardness has remained a key challenge for decades. In fact, recent progress in computational complexity suggests the possibility that a weaker assumption might be sufficient for worst-case learning than the feasibility of worst-case algorithms for NP problems.

In this study, we investigate whether these worst-case requirements for learning are satisfied on the basis of only average-case assumptions in order to understand the nature of learning. First, we construct a strong worst-case learner based on the assumption that DistNP $\subseteq$ AvgP, i.e., in Heuristica. Our learner agnostically learns all polynomial-size circuits on all unknown P/poly-samplable distributions in polynomial time, where the complexity of learning depends on the complexity of sampling examples. Second, we study the limitation of relativizing constructions of learners based on average-case heuristic algorithms. Specifically, we construct a powerful oracle such that DistPH $\subseteq$ AvgP, i.e., every problem in PH is easy on average, whereas UP $\cap$ coUP and PAC learning on almost-uniform distributions are hard even for $2^{n/\omega(\log n)}$-time algorithms in the relativized world, which improves the oracle separation presented by Impagliazzo (CCC 2011). The core concept of our improvements is the consideration of a switching lemma on a large alphabet, which may be of independent interest. The lower bound on the time complexity is nearly optimal because Hirahara (STOC 2021) showed that DistPH $\subseteq$ AvgP implies that PH can be solved in time $2^{O(n / \log n)}$ under any relativized world.</div>

Let $\Pi$ be a protocol over the $n$-party broadcast channel, where in each round, a pre-specified party broadcasts a symbol to all other parties. We wish to design a scheme that takes such a protocol $\Pi$ as input and outputs a noise resilient protocol $\Pi'$ that simulates $\Pi$ over the noisy broadcast channel, where each received symbol is flipped with a fixed constant probability, independently. What is the minimum overhead in the number of rounds that is incurred by any such simulation scheme?

A classical result by Gallager from the 80's shows that non-interactive $T$-round protocols, where the bit communicated in every round is independent of the communication history, can be converted to noise resilient ones with only an $\mathcal{O}(\log \log T)$ multiplicative overhead in the number of rounds. Can the same be proved for any protocol? Or, are there protocols whose simulation requires an $\Omega(\log T)$ overhead (which always suffices)? 

We answer both the above questions in the negative: We give a simulation scheme with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log T})$ overhead for every protocol and channel alphabet. We also prove an (almost) matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log T})$ on the overhead required to simulate the pointer chasing protocol with $T=n$ and polynomial alphabet.</div>

<div class="content">
For a complexity class $C$ and language $L$, a constructive separation of $L \notin C$ gives an efficient algorithm (also called a refuter) to find counterexamples (bad inputs) for every $C$-algorithm attempting to decide $L$. We study the questions: Which lower bounds can be made constructive? What are the consequences of constructive separations? We build a case that  ``constructiveness'' serves as a dividing line between many weak lower bounds we know how to prove, and strong lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$. Put another way, constructiveness is the opposite of a complexity barrier: it is a property we want lower bounds to have. Our results fall into three broad categories.
		
1. For many separations, making them constructive would imply breakthrough lower bounds. Our first set of results shows that, for many well-known lower bounds against streaming algorithms, one-tape Turing machines, and query complexity, as well as lower bounds for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem, making these lower bounds constructive would imply breakthrough separations ranging from $EXP \neq BPP$ to even $P \neq NP$. 

2. Most conjectured uniform separations can be made constructive. Our second set of results shows that for most major open problems in lower bounds against $P$, $ZPP$, and $BPP$, including $P \neq NP$, $P \neq PSPACE$, $P \neq PP$, $ZPP \neq EXP$, and $BPP \neq NEXP$, any proof of the separation would further imply a constructive separation. Our results generalize earlier results for $P \neq NP$ [Gutfreund, Shaltiel, and Ta-Shma, CCC 2005] and $BPP \neq NEXP$ [Dolev, Fandina and Gutfreund, CIAC 2013]. Thus any proof of these strong lower bounds must also yield a constructive version, compared to many weak lower bounds we currently know.
		
3. Some separations cannot be made constructive. Our third set of results shows that certain complexity separations cannot be made constructive. We observe that for all super-polynomially growing functions $t$, there are no constructive separations for detecting high $t$-time Kolmogorov complexity (a task which is known to be not in $P$) from any complexity class, unconditionally. We also show that under plausible conjectures, there are languages in $NP - P$ for which there are no constructive separations from any complexity class.</div>

<p> I posted on <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/when-did-math-get-so-hard.html">When did Math get so hard?</a> a commenter pointed out that one can also ask </p><p><br /></p><p><i>When did Computer Science Theory Get so Hard?</i></p><p>For the Math-question I could only speculate. For CS- I WAS THERE! When I was in Grad School one could learn all of Complexity theory in a year-long course (a hard one, but still!). The main tools were logic and combinatorics. No Fourier Transforms over finite fields. I am NOT going to say</p><p><i>Those were the good old days.</i></p><p>I will say that it was easier to make a contribution without knowing much. Oddly enough, it is MORE common for ugrads and grad students to publish NOW then it was THEN, so that may be a pair of ducks.</p><p><b>Random Thoughts on This Question</b></p><p>1) The Graph Minor Theorem was when P lost its innocence. Before the GMT most (though not all)  problems in P had easy-to-understand  algorithms using algorithmic paradigms (e.g., Dynamic  Programming) and maybe some combinatorics. Computational Number Theory used.... Number Theory (duh), but I don't think it was hard number theory. One exception was Miller's Primality test which needed to assume the Extended Riemann Hypothesis- but you didn't have to understand ERH to use it. </p><p>1.5) GMT again. This did not only give hard-deep-math algorithms to get problems in P. It  also pointed to  how hard proving P NE NP would be--- to rule out something like a GMT-type result to get SAT in P seems rather hard. </p><p>2) Oracle Constructions were fairly easy diagonalizations. It was bummed out that I never had to use an infinite injury priority argument. That is, I knew some complicated recursion theory, but it was never used. </p><p>2.5) Oracles again. Dana Angluin had a paper which used some complicated combinatorics to construct an oracle, see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397580900274?via%3Dihub">here</a>. Later Andy Yao showed that there is an oracle A such that  PH^A NE  PSPACE^A. You might know that result better as</p><p><i>Constant depth circuits for parity must have exponential size. </i></p><p>I think we now care about circuits more than oracles, see my post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/04/the-new-oracle-result-new-circuit.html">here</a> about that issue. Anyway, oracle results since then have used hard combinatorial and other math arguments. </p><p>3) The PCP result was a leap forward for difficulty. I don't know which paper to pick as THE Leap since there were several. And papers after that were also rather difficult.  </p><p>4) I had a blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/04/do-any-np-reductions-use-deep.html#comment-form">here</a> where I asked if REDUCTIONS ever use hard math. Some of the comments are relevant here:</p><p>Stella Biderman: The deepest part of the original PCP theorem is the invention of the VC paradigm in the 1990's.</p><p>Eldar: Fourier Theory was introduced to CS with Hastad's Optimal Approximation results. Today it might not be considered deep, but I recall when it was.</p><p>Also there are Algebraic Geometry codes which use downright arcane mathematics...</p><p>Hermann Gruber refers to Comp Topology and Comp Geometry and points to the result that 3-manifold knot genus is NP-complete, see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/509907.510016">here</a>.</p><p>Anonymous (they leave many comments) points to the deep math reductions in arithmetic versions of P/NP classes, and Mulmuley's work (Geometric Complexity Theory).</p><p>Timothy Chow points out that `deep' could mean several things and points to a math overflow post on the issue of depth, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/139607/what-are-some-deep-theorems-and-why-are-they-considered-deep">here</a>.</p><p>Marzio De Biasi points out that even back in 1978 there was a poly reduction that required a good amount of number theory: the NPC of the Diophantine binary quad equation</p><p>ax^2 + by + c = 0 </p><p>by Manders and Adelman, see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000078900442?via%3Dihub">here</a>.</p><p>(Bill Comment) I tend to think this is an outlier- for the most part, CS theory back in the 1970's did not hard math. </p><p>4) Private Info Retrieval (PIR). k databases each have the same n-bit string and cannot talk to each other. a server wants the ith bit and (in the info-theoretic case) wants the DBs to know NOTHING about the question i. </p><p>Easy results (to understand) 2-server, n^{1/3}. <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/pir/first.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Hard results: 2-server n^{O(\sqrt{loglogn/log n)},  <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zdvir/papers/DvirGopi14.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>(I have a website on PIR, not maintained,  <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/TOPICS/pir/pir.html">here</a>.)</p><p>5) Babai's algorithm for GI in quasi-poly time used hard math. </p><p>6) If I knew more CS theory I am sure I would have more papers listed.</p><p>But now its your turn: </p><p>When did you realize Gee, <b>CS theory is harder than (a) you thought, (b) it used to be.</b></p><p><b><br /></b></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>This week my student Daniel Frishberg posted our new preprint “Rapid mixing of the hardcore Glauber dynamics and other Markov chains in bounded-treewidth graphs”, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03898">arXiv:2111.03898</a>. Despite the somewhat-technical title and content, it’s on an easy-to-explain problem, of generating random combinatorial objects (like independent sets in graphs) using random walks. Start with an undirected graph and an empty subset of its vertices, and then repeatedly choose a random vertex, flipping whether it is in or out of the subset whenever the resulting subset remains independent. How many of these steps does it take until the resulting random distribution on independent sets is nearly uniform?</p>

<p>In general, this can take exponentially many steps, but our paper proves that in graphs of bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth">treewidth</a> it is only polynomial. Our proof’s exponent depends on the treewidth, but maybe a better proof can get the dependence on treewidth out of the exponent and into the constant factor of the polynomial instead. However, if all you want to do is generate random independent sets, this is not the right way to do it. The point of the paper is less about fast algorithms and more about the connectivity of the space of independent sets. So if you do want a fast algorithm for random generation, what should you do?</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, an area where some care is required and much of the literature does not take the required care. Problematic issues include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the model of computation for arithmetic operations? Much of the literature for the design and analysis of graph algorithms assumes without much attention that all arithmetic operations take unit time. This is a reasonable assumption for small numbers (of at most polynomial magnitude), as occur in many algorithms including the random walk above. In those cases it is a close match to the kind of operation that can be done in a single instruction on a modern CPU. It is not a reasonable assumption for counting algorithms dealing with numbers of exponential magnitude. Counting is an important subproblem for exact random generation, so we need large numbers. Typically, the number of independent sets is linear in the input size, the number of bits required to store this number is linear, and the amount of time needed to perform a single operation on a number this large should again be assumed to involve a bignum-package subroutine. The slow steps are multiplications, which can by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.4007/annals.2021.193.2.4">recent results of Harvey and van der Hoeven</a> be assumed to take \(O(n\log n)\) time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the model for generating random numbers? If random numbers are generated as bits, this only allows the direct generation of random choices with probabilities that are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational">dyadic rational</a>. For independent sets, we need other probabilities. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling">Rejection sampling</a> leads to an algorithm whose running time is itself a random variable, so we need to use expected time or high-probability bounds instead of worst-case time analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How is the input presented? For the random-walk method, it is just a graph, but for other algorithms taking advantage of low treewidth we need a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition">tree decomposition</a>, and finding one is nontrivial. We should either state explicitly that a tree decomposition is given and that its width rather than the graph width controls the algorithm’s runtime, or factor in the time to find a decomposition and the width of decomposition that we find.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With that all said, how might we go about computing a random independent set for a given \(n\)-vertex graph of treewidth \(w\), achieving the best theoretical performance?</p>

<p>First, we should find an approximate tree decomposition. There are many known algorithms for this problem, but I think the right choice is the one from the recent paper “An improvement of Reed’s treewidth approximation”, Belbasi and Fürer, WALCOM 2021, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03105">arXiv:2010.03105</a>. It finds a tree decomposition of width at most \(5w\), in time \(O(2^{8.8w}n\log n)\). There are other algorithms with a linear dependence on \(n\), but much worse dependence on \(w\), and the \(n\log n\) part of the bound will be dominated by later steps. We can also bootstrap this decomposition, using dynamic programming on it to find a better decomposition, but I think this is too expensive for the savings it produces.</p>

<p>Second, we should count independent sets. Root the tree decomposition, so that we can talk about the subtree descending from any bag and the subgraph of the given graph that it corresponds to. Then for each bag of the decomposition (in bottom-up order), and each independent subset of the bag, we want to count the number of independent sets in the corresponding subgraph that intersect the bag in the given subset. These independent sets are formed by combining choices of independent sets in child nodes. Therefore, we need to find the numbers of independent sets in each child node that are consistent with the choice of subset at the parent, and multiply them together. Each subset of a bag contributes to exactly one such computation at its parent, so the total number of arithmetic operations for this computation is the product of the number of bags and the number of subsets per bag. With bignum arithmetic, the total time for computing all of these counts is \(O(2^{5w}n^2\log n)\). Our new preprint cites a paper for this subproblem that isn’t sufficiently careful about bignum arithmetic, but still somehow ends up with a slower cubic total time bound; I think they’re just being sloppy and overcounting somehow.</p>

<p>Third, we can then reverse the counting process and step downward through the tree decomposition choosing how the random independent set intersects each bag. When we do this for a bag, we already know the intersection of the independent set with the parent bag. Therefore, all we have to do is choose among the subsets of the child bag that are consistent with that already-made choice, using probabilities that are proportional to the numbers of independent sets that can be formed for each consistent subset. We know these numbers because we already computed them in the second stage. So it’s just a single random choice per bag, which (because it involves bignum probabilities that are not dyadic rational) can reasonably be assumed to take a random amount of time whose expectation is linear. For the overall algorithm, the total expected time is \(O(n^2)\). Also, this stage of the algorithm can be repeated over and over, generating new random independent sets, without having to generate new tree decompositions or new counts.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, it appears that the total time for randomly generating independent sets, using dynamic programming on the tree decomposition to count these sets, and assuming fast bignum arithmetic, is \(O(2^{O(w)}n^2\log n)\) for the preprocessing stages of the algorithm, and then \(O(n^2)\) for each successive generated set.</p>

<p>Where are we today?  (Official communication.)</p>



<ul><li>Union Twist, 1158 Beacon Street in Newton Centre/Four Corners, has been unanimously approved by the City Council for its Special Permit. Union Twist plans to demolish the current building on the site consisting of a dry cleaner and restaurant and build a new 2,300-square foot, one story retail building with 22 on-site parking spaces. For at least the first six months of operation, there will be an appointment only requirement for customers at the store. As their Special Permit has been approved, they can move forward with their state Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) licensing approval process.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Garden Remedies, Newton’s first adult-use retail marijuana store, opened at 697 Washington Street in Newtonville more than two years ago in May 2019. Since opening, Garden Remedies has sold to customers by appointment only. The request from Garden Remedies to amend its current Special Permit to remove the appointment only condition for their retail shop was approved by the City Council Land Use Committee. (The vote was 5-0, with three abstentions.) The full City Council will vote on lifting the appointment only condition at their meeting this Monday, Nov. 15.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Redi, Newton’s second adult-use retail marijuana establishment (formerly known as Cypress Tree) opened in July 2021 at 24 Eliot Street at the intersection with Boylston Street/Route 9 in Upper Falls. (It was (formerly known as Cypress Tree.) The Special Permit approved by the City Council requires that Redi’s retail customers must have an appointment to shop or pick-up products for at least the first six months of operation. </li></ul>



<ul><li>Ascend, 1089 Washington Street/58 Cross Street just outside West Newton Square, has a signed provisional HCA and an approved Special Permit. Construction is nearing completion and they are awaiting licensing approval by the CCC to open.</li></ul>



<ul><li>MedMen, 232 Boylston Street/ Rte. 9 in Chestnut Hill (at the former Shreve, Crump &amp; Low location), has a signed provisional Host Community Agreement (HCA) and an approved Special Permit. They are both awaiting licensing approval by the CCC to open as well as a building permit from the City of Newton to begin work on the building.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Green Lady, 740 Beacon Street in Newton Centre, a woman and minority owned business, has a signed provisional HCA and the City Council Land Use Committee is currently hearing its Special Permit application. If their Special Permit is approved, they can then move forward with their CCC licensing approval process </li></ul>



<ul><li>Verilife, 131 Rumford Avenue in Auburndale, has a signed provisional HCA and the City Council Land Use Committee is currently hearing its Special Permit application. If their Special Permit is approved, they can then move forward with their CCC licensing approval process.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Nuestra, 1185 Chestnut Street in Newton Upper Falls, has a signed provisional HCA. Nuestra is a Cannabis Control Commission certified Economic Empowerment Applicant. They have not yet started the City Council Special Permit approval process which they need to do before moving forward in the state licensing approval process.</li></ul>
