<div class="content">
The Merge Resolution proof system (M-Res) for QBFs, proposed by Beyersdorff et al. in 2019, explicitly builds partial strategies inside refutations. The original motivation for this approach was to overcome the limitations encountered in long-distance Q-Resolution proof system (LD-Q-Res), where the syntactic side-conditions, while prohibiting all unsound resolutions, also end up prohibiting some sound resolutions. However, while the advantage of M-Res over many other resolution-based QBF proof systems was already demonstrated, a comparison with LD-Q-Res itself had remained open. In this paper, we settle this question. We show that M-Res has an exponential advantage over not only LD-Q-Res, but even over LQU$^+$-Res and IRM, the most powerful among currently known resolution-based QBF proof systems. Combining this with results from Beyersdorff et al. 2020, we conclude that M-Res is incomparable with LQU-Res and LQU$^+$-Res.

Our proof method reveals two additional and curious features about M-Res: (i) MRes is not closed under restrictions, and is hence not a natural proof system, and (ii) weakening axiom clauses with existential variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. We further show that in the context of regular derivations, weakening axiom clauses with universal variables provably yields an exponential advantage over M-Res without weakening. These results suggest that MRes is better used with weakening, though whether M-Res with weakening is closed under restrictions remains open. We note that even with weakening, M-Res continues to be simulated by eFrege $+ $ $\forall$red (the simulation of ordinary M-Res was shown recently by Chew and Slivovsky).</div>

<p>Abstract: Algorithms increasingly interact with strategic, self-interested players; their design must take player incentives into account or risk being “gamed” and failing miserably. The algorithmic game theory literature traditionally focused on “mechanisms” – algorithms that incentivize players to truthfully report the <strong>input</strong>. In this talk we shift focus from mechanisms to “contracts”, which are concerned with the algorithm’s <strong>output</strong> and players’ incentives to carry it out. The goal of this talk is to describe where we’re at in forming a new algorithmic theory of contract design.</p>
<p>I will demonstrate how algorithmic approaches – in particular the approach of <strong>beyond worst-case analysis</strong> – can shed light on a classic economic puzzle regarding simple contracts. Within the realm of <strong>incentives and learning</strong>, I will discuss how classifiers induce incentives and show a formal relation to contracts.</p>
<p>Based on joint works with Tal Alon, Magdalen Dobson, Paul Duetting, Ron Lavi, Ariel Procaccia, Tim Roughgarden, Elisheva Shamash and Jamie Tucker-Foltz.</p>

The sign-rank of a matrix $A$ with $\pm 1$ entries is the smallest rank of a real matrix with the same sign pattern as $A$. To the best of our knowledge, there are only three known methods for proving lower bounds on the sign-rank of explicit matrices:  (i) Sign-rank is at least the VC-dimension; (ii) Forster's method, which states that sign-rank is at least the inverse of the largest possible average margin among the representations of the matrix by points and half-spaces; (iii) Sign-rank is at least a logarithmic function of the density of the largest monochromatic rectangle. 
 

We prove several results regarding the limitations of these methods. 


$\bullet$ We prove that, qualitatively,  the monochromatic rectangle density is the strongest of these three lower bounds. If it fails to provide a super-constant lower bound for the sign-rank of a  matrix, then the other two methods will fail as well.   
$\bullet$ We show that there exist $n \times n$ matrices with sign-rank $n^{\Omega(1)}$ for which none of these methods can provide a super-constant lower bound.   
$\bullet$ We show that sign-rank is at most an exponential function of the deterministic communication complexity with access to an equality oracle. We combine this result with Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem to show that for a large class of sign matrices (e.g., XOR-lifts), sign-rank is at most an exponential function of the $\gamma_2$ norm of the matrix. We conjecture that this holds for all sign matrices. 
$\bullet$ Towards answering a question of Linial,  Mendelson,   Schechtman, and  Shraibman regarding the relation between sign-rank and discrepancy, we conjecture that sign-ranks of the $\pm1$ adjacency matrices of hypercube graphs can be arbitrarily large. We prove that none of the three lower bound techniques can resolve this conjecture in the affirmative.</div>

Multiplicity codes are a generalization of Reed-Muller codes which include derivatives as well as the values of low degree polynomials, evaluated in every point in $\mathbb{F}_p^m$. 
Similarly to Reed-Muller codes, multiplicity codes have a local nature that allows for local correction and local testing. 
Recently, the authors and Salama showed that the plane test, which tests the degree of the codeword on a random plane, is a good local tester for small enough degrees.
In this work we simplify and extend the analysis of local testing for multiplicity codes, giving a more general and tighter analysis. In particular, we show that multiplicity codes $\mathrm{MRM}_{p}(m, d, s)$ over prime fields with arbitrary $d$ are locally testable by an appropriate $k$-flat test, which tests the degree of the codeword on a random $k$-dimensional affine subspace. The relationship between the degree parameter $d$ and the required dimension $k$ is shown to be nearly optimal, and improves on the degree previously known in the case of planes.

Our analysis relies on a generalization of the technique of canonincal monomials introduced by Haramaty, Shpilka and Sudan (FOCS 2011). Generalizing canonical monomials to the multiplicity case requires substantially different proofs which exploit the algebraic structure of multiplicity codes.</div>

We construct an explicit family of 3-XOR instances hard for $\Omega(n)$-levels of the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) semi-definite programming hierarchy. Not only is this the first explicit construction to beat brute force search (beyond low-order improvements (Tulsiani 2021, Pratt 2021)), combined with standard gap amplification techniques it also matches the (optimal) hardness of random instances up to imperfect completeness (Grigoriev TCS 2001, Schoenebeck FOCS 2008). 

Our result is based on a new form of small-set high dimensional expansion (SS-HDX) inspired by recent breakthroughs in locally testable and quantum LDPC codes. Adapting the recent framework of Dinur, Filmus, Harsha, and Tulsiani (ITCS 2021) for SoS lower bounds from the Ramanujan complex to this setting, we show any (bounded-degree) SS-HDX can be transformed into a highly unsatisfiable 3-XOR instance that cannot be refuted by $\Omega(n)$-levels of SoS. We then show Leverrier and Z\'emor's (Arxiv 2022) recent qLDPC construction gives the desired explicit family of bounded-degree SS-HDX. Incidentally, this gives the strongest known form of bi-directional high dimensional expansion to date.</div>

in which fetching (or evicting) pages from the same block incurs the same cost
as fetching (or evicting) just one page from the block. Given a cache of size
$k$, and a sequence of requests from $n$ pages partitioned into given blocks of
size $\beta\leq k$, the goal is to minimize the total cost of fetching to (or
evicting from) cache. We show the following results:
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ For the eviction cost model, we show an $O(\log k)$-approximate
offline algorithm, a $k$-competitive deterministic online algorithm, and an
$O(\log^2 k)$-competitive randomized online algorithm.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ For the fetching cost model, we show an integrality gap of
$\Omega(\beta)$ for the natural LP relaxation of the problem, and an
$\Omega(\beta + \log k)$ lower bound for randomized online algorithms. The
strategy of ignoring the block-structure and running a classical paging
algorithm trivially achieves an $O(\beta)$ approximation and an $O(\beta \log
k)$ competitive ratio respectively for the offline and online-randomized
setting.
</p>
<p>$\bullet$ For both fetching and eviction models, we show improved bounds for
the $(h,k)$-bicriteria version of the problem. In particular, when $k=2h$, we
match the performance of classical caching algorithms up to constant factors.
</p>
<p>Our results establish a separation between the tractability of the fetching
and eviction cost models, which is interesting since fetching/evictions costs
are the same up to an additive term for classic caching. Previous work only
studied online deterministic algorithms for the fetching cost model when $k &gt;
h$. Our insight is to relax the block-aware caching problem to a submodular
covering LP. The main technical challenge is to maintain a competitive
fractional solution, and to round it with bounded loss, as the constraints of
this LP are revealed online.

classical cloud-based machine learning. In FL, the sensitive data remains in
data silos and only aggregated parameters are exchanged. Hospitals and research
institutions which are not willing to share their data can join a federated
study without breaching confidentiality. In addition to the extreme sensitivity
of biomedical data, the high dimensionality poses a challenge in the context of
federated genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this article, we present a
federated singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm, suitable for the
privacy-related and computational requirements of GWAS. Notably, the algorithm
has a transmission cost independent of the number of samples and is only weakly
dependent on the number of features, because the singular vectors associated
with the samples are never exchanged and the vectors associated with the
features only for a fixed number of iterations. Although motivated by GWAS, the
algorithm is generically applicable for both horizontally and vertically
partitioned data.

manufacturing (AM/SM) capabilities in multi-modal process plans that leverage
the strengths of each. Despite the growing interest in HM technologies,
software tools for process planning have not caught up with advances in
hardware and typically impose restrictions that limit the design and
manufacturing engineers' ability to systematically explore the full design and
process planning spaces. We present a general framework for identifying AM/SM
actions that make up an HM process plan based on accessibility and support
requirements, using morphological operations that allow for arbitrary part and
tool geometries to be considered. To take advantage of multi-modality, we
define the actions to allow for temporary excessive material deposition or
removal, with an understanding that subsequent actions can correct for them,
unlike the case in unimodal (AM-only or SM-only) process plans that are
monotonic. We use this framework to generate a combinatorial space of valid,
potentially non-monotonic, process plans for a given part of arbitrary shape, a
collection of AM/SM tools of arbitrary shapes, and a set of relative rotations
(fixed for each action) between them, representing build/fixturing directions
on $3-$axis machines. Finally, we use define a simple objective function
quantifying the cost of materials and operating time in terms of
deposition/removal volumes and use a search algorithm to explore the
exponentially large space of valid process plans to find "cost-optimal"
solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D examples.

<p>I will also ignore most of the historical details, but it is worth mentioning that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> is not the first paper on this “amplification by shuffling,” (which, for local reasons, I’ll just call a <em>privacy <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/doona">doona</a></em>) but rather is the culmination of a rather long line of work involving many cool ideas and papers, starting with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.01394" title="Albert Cheu, Adam D. Smith, Jonathan Ullman, David Zeber, Maxim Zhilyaev. Distributed Differential Privacy via Shuffling.

Amplification by Shuffling: From Local to Central Differential Privacy via Anonymity.

Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> for an overview.</p>

<p>Alright, now that the caveats are behind us, what <em>is</em> “amplification by shuffling”? In a nutshell, it is capturing the (false!) intuition that “anonymization provides privacy” (which, again, is false! Don’t do this!) and making it… less false. The idea is that while <em>anonymization does not provide in itself any meaningful privacy guarantee</em>, it can <em>amplify existing, rigorous privacy guarantee</em>. So if I start with a somewhat lousy LDP guarantee, but then all the messages sent by all users are completely anonymized, then my lousy LDP guarantee suddenly gets <em>much</em> stronger (roughly speaking, the \(\varepsilon\) parameter goes down with the square root of of the number of users involved). Which is wonderful! Let’s see what this means, quantitatively.</p>

<h3 id="the-result-of-feldman-mcmillan-and-talwar">The result of Feldman, McMillan, and Talwar.</h3>
<p>Here, we will focus on the simpler case of <em>noninteractive</em> protocols (one-shot messages from the users to the central server, no funny business with messages going back and forth); which is conceptually simpler to state and parse, still very rich and interesting, and, well, very relevant in practice (being the easiest and cheapest to deploy). If you want the results in their full glorious generality, though, they are in the paper.</p>

<p>What the main theorem of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803" title="Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Kunal Talwar. Hiding Among the Clones: A Simple and Nearly Optimal Analysis of Privacy Amplification by Shuffling. FOCS 2021"><strong>[FMT21]</strong></a> is saying for this noninteractive setting can then be stated as follows: if I have an <em>\(\varepsilon_L\)-locally private</em> (LDP) protocol for a task, where all \(n\) users pass their data through the same randomizer (algorithm) \(R\) and send the resulting message \(y_i \gets R(x_i)\), then just permuting the messages \(y_1\dots,y_n\) immediately gives an \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-<em>shuffle</em> private protocol for the same task, for any pair \((\varepsilon,\delta)\) which satisfies
<a name="eq:eps:epsL"></a>
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \leq \log\left( 1+ 16\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}-1}{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}+1}\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}\right) \tag{1}
\end{equation}
as long as \(n \gg e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log(1/\delta)\). That is quite a lot to parse, though: what does this actually <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, the assumption that all users have the same randomizer (or at least cannot be distinguished by their randomizer) is quite natural: if they didn’t, then we wouldn’t be able to say anything in general, since the randomizer they use could just give away their identity completely. For instance, as an extreme case, the randomizer of user \(i\) could just append \(i\) to the message (it’s OK, still LDP!), and then shuffling achieves exactly nothing: we know who sent what. So OK, asking for all randomizers to be the same is not really a restriction.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, each user only sends one message, and this preserves its length (we just shuffled the messages, didn’t modify them!). So if you start with an LDP protocol with amazing features XYZ (e.g., the messages are \(1\)-bit long, or users don’t share a random seed, or the randomizers run in time \(O(1)\)), then the shuffle protocol enjoys exactly the same properties. (It only enjoys naturally some <em>robustness</em>, in the sense that if \(10\%\) if the \(n\) users maliciously deviate from the protocol, they can’t really jeopardize the privacy of the remaining \(90\%\) of users.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Which is… good.)</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, this is inherently approximate DP. Here we started with pure LDP (you can also extend that to approximate LDP) and ended up with approximate Shuffle DP: this is not a mistake, that’s how it is. I am not a purist (erm) myself, and that looks more than good enough to me; but if you seek pure Shuffle DP, then this result is not the droid you’re looking for.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" alt="This is not the pure DP guarantee you are looking for." src="https://differentialprivacy.org/../images/droids-looking.png" />
</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Alright, <em>what</em> is this guarantee stated in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:eps:epsL">(1)</a> giving us? Let’s interpret the expression in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:eps:epsL">(1)</a> in two parameter regimes, focusing on \(\varepsilon\) (fixing some small \(\delta&gt;0\)). If we start with \(\varepsilon_{L} \ll 1\) for our LDP randomizers \(R\), then a first-order Taylor expansion shows that we get
\[
		\varepsilon \approx \varepsilon_{L}\cdot 8\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}
\]
so that <em>shuffling improved our privacy parameter by a factor \(\sqrt{n}\)</em>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> 😲 This is great! With more users, comes more privacy!</p>

<p>But that was starting with small \(\varepsilon_{L}\), that is, already pretty good privacy guarantees for our LDP “building block” \(R\). What happens if we start with “somewhat lousy” privacy guarantees, that is, \(\varepsilon_{L} \gg 1\)? Do we get anything interesting then?
Another Taylor expansion (everything is a Taylor expansion) shows us that, then,
<a name="eq:epsL:ll:one"></a>
\[
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \approx \log\left( 1+ 8\sqrt{\frac{e^{\varepsilon_{L}}\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}}\right) \tag{2}
\end{equation}
\]
or, put differently,
<a name="eq:epsL:gg:one"></a>
\[
\begin{equation}
		\varepsilon \approx 8e^{\varepsilon_{L}/2}\sqrt{\frac{\log\frac{4}{\delta}}{n}} \tag{3}
\end{equation}
\]
That’s a bit harder to interpret, but that seems… useful? It is: let us see how much, with a couple examples.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning.</h4>
<p>The first one is distribution learning, a.k.a. density estimation: you have \(n\) i.i.d. samples (one per user) from an unknown probability distribution \(\mathbf{p}\) over a discrete domain of size \(k\), and your goal is to output an estimate \(\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\) such that, with high (say, constant) probability, \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\) are close in <em>total variation distance</em>:
\[
		\operatorname{TV}(\mathbf{p},\widehat{\mathbf{p}}) = \sup_{S\subseteq [k]} (\mathbf{p}(S) - \widehat{\mathbf{p}}(S) ) \leq \alpha
\]
(if total variation distance seems a bit mysterious, it’s exactly half the \(\ell_1\) distance between the probability mass functions). We know how to solve this problem in the non-private setting: \(n=\Theta\left( \frac{k}{\alpha^2} \right)\) samples are necessary and sufficient. We know how to solve this problem in the (central) DP setting: \(n=\Theta\left( \frac{k}{\alpha^2} + \frac{k}{\alpha\varepsilon} \right)\) samples are necessary and sufficient <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/hash/2b3bf3eee2475e03885a110e9acaab61-Abstract.html" title="Ilias Diakonikolas, Moritz Hardt, Ludwig Schmidt. Differentially Private Learning of Structured Discrete Distributions. NeurIPS 2015"><strong>[DHS15]</strong></a>. We know how to solve this problem in the LDP setting: 
<a name="eq:learning:ldp"></a>
\begin{equation}
n=\Theta\left(\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2(e^\varepsilon-1)^2}+\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2e^\varepsilon}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}\right) \tag{4}
\end{equation}
samples are necessary and sufficient <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/acharya19a.html" title="Jayadev Acharya, Ziteng Sun, Huanyu Zhang. Hadamard Response: Estimating Distributions Privately, Efficiently, and with Little Communication. AISTATS 2019"><strong>[ASZ19]</strong></a> (note that the first term is just \(k/(\alpha^2\varepsilon^2)\) for small \(\varepsilon\)). Now, as they say in Mulan: <em>let’s make a shuffle DP algo out of you.</em></p>

<p>If we want to achieve \((\varepsilon,\delta)\)-shuffle DP, we need to select \(\varepsilon_L\). Based on <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:ll:one">(2)</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:gg:one">(3)</a>, and ignoring pesky constants we will choose it so that
<a name="eq:choice:epsL"></a>
\begin{equation}
	 \varepsilon_{L} \approx \varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}}  \quad\text{ or }\quad e^{\varepsilon_{L}} \approx \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}\,. \tag{5}
\end{equation}
depending on whether \(\frac{\varepsilon^2 n}{\log(1/\delta)}\geq 1\). Plugging that back in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:learning:ldp">(4)</a>, we see that the first case corresponds to the first term (small \(\varepsilon_{L}\)) and the second to the second term (\(\varepsilon_{L} \geq 1\)), and overall the condition on \(n\) for the original LDP algorithm to 
successful learn the distribution becomes
\[
	n \gtrsim 
	\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2(e^{\varepsilon_{L}}-1)^2}+\frac{k^2}{\alpha^2e^{\varepsilon_{L}}}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
	\approx \frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2} 
	 \approx \frac{k^2\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
\]
(where \(\gtrsim\) means “let’s ignore constants”). There is an \(n\) in the RHS as well, so reorganizing and handling the two terms separately the condition on \(n\) becomes
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+\frac{k}{\alpha^2}
\]
which… is great? We immediately get a sample complexity \(O\left(\frac{k}{\alpha^2}+\frac{k \sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}\right)\) in the shuffle DP model, which (ignoring the \(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}\)) matches the one in the <em>central</em> DP setting!</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Taking an optimal LDP algorithm and just shuffling the messages <em>immediately</em> gives an optimal shuffle DP algorithm, no extra work needed.</p>

<h4 id="uniformity-testing">(Uniformity) Testing.</h4>
<p>Alright, maybe it was a fluke? Let’s look at another “basic” problem close to my heart: we don’t want to learn the probability distribution \(\mathbf{p}\), just test whether it is actually <em>the</em> uniform distribution<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> \(\mathbf{u}\) on the domain \([k]={1,2,\dots,k}\). So if \(\mathbf{p} =\mathbf{u}\), you’ve got to say “yes” with probability at least \(2/3\), and if \(\operatorname{TV}(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{u})&gt;\alpha\), then you need to say “no” with probability at least \(2/3\).</p>

<p>This is also well understood in the non-private setting (\(n=\Theta(\sqrt{k}/\alpha^2)\)) <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4626074" title="Liam Paninski.

Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster. SOSA 2022"><strong>CL22]</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Now, say you want an (\(\varepsilon,\delta)\)-shuffle DP algorithm for uniformity testing, but don’t want to design one from scratch (though it <em>is</em> possible to do so, and some did <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09481" title="Victor Balcer, Albert Cheu, Matthew Joseph, Jieming Mao. Connecting Robust Shuffle Privacy and Pan-Privacy. SODA 2021"><strong>[BCJM21</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08987" title="Clément L. Canonne, Hongyi Lyu. Uniformity Testing in the Shuffle Model: Simpler, Better, Faster. SOSA 2022"><strong>CL22</strong></a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10032" title="Albert Cheu, Chao Yan. Pure Differential Privacy from Secure Intermediaries. arXiv 2021"><strong>CY21]</strong></a>). Let’s say you want to look at the “no-common-random-seed-shared-by-users” model (a.k.a. <em>private-coin</em> setting): so you stare at the corresponding LDP communication complexity, <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:privatecoin">(7)</a>, and try to choose \(\varepsilon_L\) to start with before shuffling. This will be the same as in the learning example (i.e., <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:choice:epsL">(5)</a>): based on <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:ll:one">(2)</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:epsL:gg:one">(3)</a>, we will set
\begin{equation}
	 \varepsilon_{L} \approx \varepsilon \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}}  \quad\text{ or }\quad e^{\varepsilon_{L}} \approx \varepsilon^2 \cdot \frac{n}{\log(1/\delta)}\,.
\end{equation}
depending on whether \(\frac{\varepsilon^2 n}{\log(1/\delta)}\geq 1\). Plugging this back in <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:privatecoin">(7)</a> and quickly checking which case corresponds to each term, we then easily get that for our algorithm to correctly solve the uniformity testing problem, it suffices that the sample complexity (number of users) \(n\) satisfies
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k^{3/2}}{\alpha^2(e^{\varepsilon_L}-1)^2} + \frac{k^{3/2}}{\alpha^2e^{\varepsilon_L}} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}
	 \approx \frac{k^{3/2}\log(1/\delta)}{\alpha^2\varepsilon^2 n } + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}
\]
which, reorganizing and solving for \(n\), means that it suffices to have 
\[
	n \gtrsim \frac{k^{3/4}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon} + \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\,.
\]
And, <em>voilà</em>! Even better, we also have strong evidence to suspect that this sample complexity \(O\Big(\frac{k^{3/4}\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+ \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\Big)\) is tight among all private-coin algorithms.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Now, if you wanted to look at <em>public-coin</em> shuffle DP protocols (with a common random seed available), then you would start with an optimal public-coin LDP algorithm (and look at <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#eq:testing:ldp:publiccoin">(6)</a>), and setting \(\varepsilon_L\) the same way you’d get a shuffle DP algorithm with sample complexity
\[
n=O\Big(\frac{k^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(1/\delta)}{\alpha^{4/3}\varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{\sqrt{k\log(1/\delta)}}{\alpha\varepsilon}+ \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\alpha^2}\Big)
\]
which, well, is <em>also</em> strongly believed to be optimal!</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Here again, taking an optimal off-the-shelf LDP algorithm and just shuffling the messages <em>immediately</em> gives an optimal shuffle DP algorithm, no extra work needed.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion.</h3>
<p>I hope the above convinced you of how useful this privacy amplification can be: from an optimal LDP algorithm, featuring any extra appealing characteristics you like, <em>just adding an extra shuffling step as postprocessing</em> yields an (often optimal? At least good) shuffle DP algorithm, <em>with the same characteristics</em> and built-in robustness against malicious users.</p>

<p>All you need is to make sure that your starting point, the LDP algorithm satisfies a couple things: (1) all users have the same randomizer,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and (2) it works in all regimes of \(\varepsilon\) (both high-privacy, \(\varepsilon \leq 1\), <em>and</em> low-privacy, \(\varepsilon \gg 1\)). Once you’ve got this, Bob’s your uncle! You get shuffle DP algorithms for free.</p>

<p>It is not only appealing from a theoretical point of view, by the way! The authors of the paper worked hard to make their empirical analysis compelling as well, and their code is available <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-shuffling-amplification">on GitHub</a> 📝. But more importantly, from a practitioner’s point of view, this means it is enough to design, implement, and test <em>one</em> algorithm (the LDP one we start with) to automatically get a trusted one in the shuffle DP model as well: this reduces the risks of bugs, security failures, the amount of work spending tuning, testing…</p>

<p>So yes, whenever possible, we <em>should</em> hide among the clones!</p>

But the shuffling then hides the informative messages (drawn from the second part of the mixture) among the non-informative (noise) ones: so the noise messages end up providing a “privacy blanket” in which sensitive information is safely and soundly wrapped. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

<p><em>[Apologies for yet another <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/category/philosophizing/">“philosophizing” </a>blog post, hope to get back to posts with more equations soon… Should also mention that one response to this piece was that “anyone who writes a piece called “Why I am not a longtermist” is probably more of a longtermist than 90% of the population</em>” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /> <em>–Boaz]</em></p>



<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism">Longtermism</a>” is a moral philosophy that places much more weight on the well-being of all future generations than on the current one. It <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism">holds</a> that “positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority of our time,” where “long term” can be <em>really</em> long term, e.g., “many thousands of years in the future, or much further still.”   At its core is the belief that each one of the potential quadrillion or more people that may exist in the future is as important as any single person today.</p>

<p>Longtermism has recently attracted attention, some of it in <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk">alarming tones</a>. The reasoning behind longtermism is natural: if we assume that human society will continue to exist for at least a few millennia, many more people will be born in the future than are alive today. However, since predictions are famously hard to make, especially about the future, longtermism invariably gets wrapped up with probabilities. Once you do these calculations, preventing an infinitely bad outcome, even if it would only happen with tiny probability, will have infinite utility. Hence longtermism tends to focus on so-called “existential risk”:  The risk that humanity will go through in an extinction event, like the one suffered by the Neanderthals or Dinosaurs, or another type of irreversible humanity-wise calamity.<br /></p>



<p>This post explains why I do not subscribe to this philosophy. Let me clarify that I am not saying that all longtermists are bad people. Many “longtermists” have given generously to improve people’s lives worldwide, particularly in developing countries. For example, none of the top charities of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/">Givewell</a> (an organization associated with the effective altruism movement, in which many prominent longtermists are members) focus on hypothetical future risks. Instead, they all deal with current pressing issues, including Malaria, childhood vaccinations, and extreme poverty. Overall the effective altruism movement has done much to benefit currently living people. Some of its members <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17962134/future-perfect-podcast-kidney-donation">donated their kidneys to strangers</a>: These are good people- morally better than me. It is hardly fair to fault people that are already contributing more than most others for caring about issues that I think are less significant.</p>

<p>This post critiques the philosophy of longtermism rather than the particular actions or beliefs of “longtermists.” In particular, the following are often highly correlated with one another:</p>



<ol><li>Belief in the philosophy of longtermism.</li><li>A belief that existential risk is not just a concern for the far-off future and a low-probability event, but there is a very significant chance of it happening in the near future (next few decades or at most a century).</li><li>A belief that the most significant existential risk could arise from artificial intelligence and that this is a real risk in the near future.</li></ol>



<p>Here I focus on (1) and explain why I disagree with this philosophy. While I might disagree on specific calculations of (2) and (3), I fully agree with the need to think and act regarding near-term risks.  Society tends to err on the side of being too myopic. We prepare too little even for risks that are not just predictable but are also predicted, including climate change, pandemics, nuclear conflict, and even software hacks. It is hard to motivate people to spend resources for safety when the outcome (bad event not happening) is invisible. It is also true that over the last decades, humanity’s technological capacities have grown so much that for the first time in history, we are capable of doing irreversible damage to our planet. </p>



<p>In addition to the above, I agree that we need to think carefully about the risks of any new technology, particularly one that, like artificial intelligence, can be very powerful but not fully understood.  Some AI risks are relevant to the shorter term: they are likely over the next decade or are already happening. There <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815">are</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ethical-Algorithm-Science-Socially-Design/dp/0190948205">several</a> <a href="https://fairmlbook.org/">books</a> on these challenges. None of my critiques apply to such issues. At some point, I might write a separate blog post about artificial intelligence and its short and long-term risks. </p>



<p>My reasons for not personally being a “longtermist” are the following:</p>



<p><strong>The probabilities are too small to reason about.</strong></p>



<p>Physicists know that there is no point in writing a measurement up to 3 significant digits if your measurement device has only one-digit accuracy. Our ability to reason about events that are decades or more into the future is severely limited. At best, we could estimate probabilities up to an order of magnitude, and even that may be optimistic. Thus, claims such as <a href="https://www.existential-risk.org/concept.html">Nick Bostrom’s</a>, that <em>“the expected value of reducing existential risk by a mere one billionth of one billionth of one percentage point is worth a hundred billion times as much as a billion human lives”</em> make no sense to me.  This is especially the case since these “probabilities” are Bayesian, i.e., correspond to degrees of belief. If, for example, you evaluate the existential-risk probability by aggregating the responses of 1000 experts, then what one of these experts had for breakfast is likely to have an impact larger than 0.001 percent (which, according to Bostrom, would correspond to much more than 10²⁰ human lives). To the extent we can quantify existential risks in the far future, we can only say something like “extremely likely,” “possible,” or “can’t be ruled out.” Assigning numbers to such qualitative assessments is an exercise in futility. </p>



<p><strong>I cannot justify sacrificing current living humans for abstract probabilities.</strong></p>



<p>Related to the above, rather than focusing on specific, measurable risks (e.g., earthquakes, climate change), longtermism is often concerned with extremely hard to quantify risks. In truth, we cannot know what will happen 100 years into the future and what would be the impact of any particular technology. Even if our actions will have drastic consequences for future generations, the dependence of the impact on our choices is likely to be chaotic and unpredictable. To put things in perspective, many of the risks we are worried about today, including nuclear war, climate change, and AI safety, only emerged in the last century or decades. It is hard to underestimate our ability to predict even a decade into the future, let alone a century or more.</p>



<p>Given that there is so much suffering and need in the world right now, I cannot accept a philosophy that prioritizes abstract armchair calculations over actual living humans. (This concern is not entirely hypothetical: <a href="https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/">Greaves and MacAskill</a> estimate that $100 spent on AI safety would, in expectation, correspond to saving a <em>trillion lives</em> and hence would be “far more than the near-future benefits of bednet distribution [for preventing Malaria],” and recommend that it is better that individuals “fund AI safety rather than developing world poverty reduction.”)</p>



<p><a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/longtermism">Moorhouse</a> compares future humans to ones living far away from us. He says that just like “something happening far away from us in space isn’t less intrinsically bad just because it’s far away,” we should care about humans in the far-off future as much as we care about present ones. But I think that we <em>should</em> care less about very far away events, especially if it’s so far away that we cannot observe them. E.g., as far as we know, there may well be trillions of sentient beings in the universe right now whose welfare can somehow be impacted by our actions. </p>



<p><strong>We cannot improve what we cannot measure.</strong></p>



<p>An inherent disadvantage of probabilities is that they are invisible until they occur. We have no direct way to measure whether a probability of an event X has increased or decreased. So, we cannot tell whether our efforts are working or not. The <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">scientific revolution</a> involved moving from armchair philosophizing to making measurable predictions. I do not believe we can make meaningful progress without concrete goals. For some risks, we do have quantifiable goals (Carbon emissions, number of nuclear warheads). Still, there are significant challenges to finding a measurable proxy for very low-probability and far-off events. Hence, even if we accept that the risks are real and vital, I do not think we can directly do anything about them before finding such proxies. </p>



<p>Proxies do not have to be perfect: Theoretical computer science made much progress using the imperfect measure of worst-case asymptotic complexity. The same holds for machine learning and artificial benchmarks. It is enough that proxies encourage the generation of new ideas or technologies and achieve gradual improvement. One lesson from modern machine learning is that the objective (aka loss function) doesn’t have to perfectly match the task for it to be useful.</p>



<p><strong>Long-term risk mitigation can only succeed through short-term progress.</strong></p>



<p>Related to the above, I believe that addressing long-term risks can only be successful if it’s tied to shorter-term advances that have clear utility. For example, consider the following two extinction scenarios:</p>



<p>1. The actual Neanderthal extinction.<br />2. A potential human extinction 50 years from now due to total nuclear war.</p>



<p>I argue that the only realistic scenario to avoid extinction in both cases is a sequence of actions that improve some measurable outcome. While sometimes extinction could theoretically be avoided by a society making a huge sacrifice to eliminate a hypothetical scenario, this could never actually happen.</p>



<p>While the reasons for the Neanderthal extinction are not fully known, most researchers believe that Neanderthals were out-competed by our ancestors – modern humans – who had better tools and ways to organize society. The crucial point is that the approaches to prevent extinction for Neanderthal were the same ones to improve their lives in their current environment. They may not have been capable of doing so, but it wasn’t because they were working on the wrong problems.</p>



<p>Contrast this with the scenario of human extinction through total nuclear war. In such a case, our conventional approaches for keeping nuclear arms in check, such as international treaties and sanctions, have failed. Perhaps in hindsight, humanity’s optimum course of action would have been a permanent extension of the middle ages, stopping the scientific revolution from happening through restricting education, religious oppression, and vigorous burning-at-stake of scientists.  Or perhaps humanity could even now make a collective decision to go back and delete all traces of post 17th-century science and technology.</p>



<p>I cannot rule out the possibility that, in hindsight, one of those outcomes would have had more aggregate utility than our current trajectory. But even if this is the case, such an outcome is simply not possible. Humanity can not and will not halt its progress, and solutions to significant long-term problems have to arise as a sequence of solutions to shorter-range measurable ones, each of which shows positive progress. Our only hope to avoid a total nuclear war is through piecemeal quantifiable progress.  We need to use diplomacy, international cooperation, and monitoring technologies to reduce the world’s nuclear arsenal one warhead at a time. This piecemeal, incremental approach may or may not work, but it’s the only one we have. </p>



<p><strong>Summary: think of the long term, but act and measure in the short term.</strong></p>



<p>It is appropriate for philosophers to speculate on hypothetical scenarios centuries into the future and wonder whether actions we take today could influence them. However, I do not believe such an approach will, in practice, lead to a positive impact on humanity and, if taken to the extreme, may even have negative repercussions. We should maintain epistemic humility. Statements about probabilities involving fractions of percentage points, or human lives in the trillions, should raise alarm bells. Such calculations can be particularly problematic since they can lead to a “the end justifies the means” attitude, which can accept any harm to currently living people in the name of the practically infinite multitudes of future hypothetical beings. </p>



<p>We need to maintain the invariant that, even if motivated by the far-off future, our actions “first do no harm” to living, breathing humans. Indeed, as I mentioned, even longtermists don’t wake up every morning thinking about how to reduce the chance that something terrible happens in the year 1,000,000 AD by 0.001%. Instead, many longtermists care about particular risks because they believe these risks are likely in the near-term future. If you manage to make a convincing case that humanity faces a real chance of near-term total destruction, then most people would agree that this is very very bad, and we should act to prevent it. It doesn’t matter whether humanity’s extinction is two times or a zillion times worse than the death of half the world’s population. Talking about trillions of hypothetical beings thousands of years into the future only turns people off. There is a reason that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager">Pascal’s Wager</a> is not such a winning argument, and I have yet to meet someone who converted to a particular religion because it had the grisliest version of hell.</p>



<p>This does not mean that thinking and preparing for longer-term risks is pointless. Maintaining seed banks, monitoring asteroids, researching pathogens, designing vaccine platforms, and working toward nuclear disarmament, are all essential activities that society should take. Whenever a new technology emerges, artificial intelligence included, it is crucial to consider how it can be misused or lead to unintended consequences. By no means do I argue that humanity should spend all of its resources only on actions that have a direct economic benefit. Indeed, the whole enterprise of basic science is built on pursuing directions that, in the short term, increase our knowledge but do not have practical utility. Progress is not measured only in dollars, but it should be measured somehow. Epistemic humility also means that we should be content with working on direct, measurable proxies, even if they are not perfect matches for the risk at hand. For example, the probability of extinction via total nuclear war might not be a direct function of the number of deployed nuclear warheads. However, the latter is still a pretty good proxy for it.</p>



<p>Similarly, even if you are genuinely worried about long-term risk, I suggest you spend most of your time in the present. Try to think of short-term problems whose solutions can be verified, which might advance the long-term goal. A “problem” does not have to be practical: it can be a mathematical question, a computational challenge, or an empirically verifiable prediction. The advantage is that even if the long-term risk stays hypothetical or the short-term problem turns out to be irrelevant to it, you have still made measurable progress. As <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2022/05/03/philosophy-of-science-and-the-blockchain-a-book-review/">has happened before</a>, to make actual progress on solving existential risk, the topic needs to move from philosophy books and blog discussions into empirical experiments and concrete measures.</p>

<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/285px-david_hilbert_1886/" rel="attachment wp-att-20070"><img width="130" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/285px-David_Hilbert_1886.jpg?resize=130%2C170&amp;ssl=1" class="alignright wp-image-20070" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>
David Hilbert famously presented 23 important open mathematical problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. He intended to include a 24th on the simplicity of proofs.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss this problem, which was “lost” until the historian Rüdiger Thiele discovered it in Hilbert’s papers in 2000 and brought it to light in a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=C970003BC10AB452B346D45B8AAE14B6?doi=10.1.1.97.7633&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">paper</a> for the American Mathematical Monthly.</p>
<p>
I (Ken) have long wondered why Hilbert targeted the number 23 for his list. That some of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_problems">problems</a> have broad, vague statements tells me he could have altered their number. To be sure, he discussed only 10 in his actual 1900 lecture; the rest appeared in his long <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1902-08-10/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3/S0002-9904-1902-00923-3.pdf">article</a> that year. Until Dick drafted this post and I found Thiele’s article, I had not known about a No. 24—a nice factorial number. </p>
<p>
As <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsta.2018.0040">discussed</a> by Inês Hipolito and Reinhard Kahle, in a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rsta/2019/377/2140">special issue</a> of the UK Royal Society <em>Philosophical Transactions A</em> devoted to Hilbert’s 24th, there were only faint traces of it until Thiele’s discovery. They decline to guess Hilbert’s motives for leaving it out, but I venture this: Hilbert could not agree with himself on the terms by which to state it, even broadly. How to quantify simplicity was already the subject of Dick’s draft, into which we blend.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Pólya on Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One simple question is whether a human notion of simpler proof would accord with, say, that of a Martian. George Pólya was one of a vanguard of Hungarian emigré scientists who came to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martians_(scientists)">The Martians</a> after another of them, the physicist Leo Szilard, gave this answer to Enrico Fermi’s question of why aliens had not been detected when life in the universe should be plentiful:</p>
<blockquote><p>
“They are among us, but they call themselves Hungarians.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Kidding aside, this could set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir-Whorf</a> type hypothesis that humans from disparate linguistic groups and mathematical cultures could have different values for proofs. Even if so, the joke would be on non-Hungarians, because Paul Erdős, whose idea of “Proofs from The Book” set the internationally recognized standard of proof elegance, was also a “Martian.”</p>
<p>
Pólya’s quote above hits the nail on the head. For an example, consider the <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/math/q1.html">theorem</a> that: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 1</b> <em> The square root of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> is irrational. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>
The well-known proof begins by supposing not: </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/23/hilberts-lost-problem/proof-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-20055"><img width="450" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/proof.png?resize=450%2C460&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-20055" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>
One might claim that this famous proof is not obvious—do you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Measure </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Now consider the general task of proving statements of this form:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem 2</b> <em><a name="pos"></a> For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />, 	</em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f%28n%29+%3E+0.+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  f(n) &gt; 0. " class="latex" /></p>
</em><p><em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Think this as an encoding of an interesting property: For example, for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> there is a prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%3En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{p&gt;n}" class="latex" />. Or for each planar graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> there is some four coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" />. Or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" /></p>
<p>
To make this more concrete, let us base proofs on the Peano axioms for arithmetic, and suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" /> is well-defined in this system. Note that proving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f}" class="latex" /> to be total computable is not the same as proving that all its values are <em>positive</em> as Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a> asserts. In case Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a> is provable, we have two key parameters:</p>
<li>D: The length of the definition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{f(n)}" class="latex" />.
</li><li>P: The length of the full proof of Theorem <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#pos">2</a>.
<p></p><p><br />
Our proof simplicity measure is then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++M%3D%5Cfrac%7BP%7D%7BD%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  M=\frac{P}{D} " class="latex" /></p>

Here are some keys to understanding the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> intuitively:</p>
<ol>
<li> For known provable problems we might have that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> is not too large
</li><li> For classic problems like the Four-Color problem we might have that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> is huge. Think of the proof that arises in this case.
</li><li> For many chess positions where one side can win, say checkmate in 30 moves, the proof of that is likewise huge. Crafting chess problems where the proof is both crisp and hard to find is a centuries-old art.
</li><li> For open problems, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> is currently infinite.
</li><li> But for practical software we get something bounded. The trouble here is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" /> is potentially huge and could be the size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" />.

<p>
Consider for the last case a program that calculates your tax payment based on the US tax code, for example. The code has wording like:  </p>
<blockquote><p>
An apparently insignificant discrepancy between the wording in the Statutes at Large and the wording in some editions of the U.S. Code with respect to a provision of the Internal Revenue Code (specifically, the words “any papers” in the first sentence of 6104(a)(1)(A) is described by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the case of Tax Analysts v. Internal Revenue Serv., 214 F.3d 179 (D.C. Cir. 2000), in footnote 1. According to the Court, some versions of the U.S. Code show the text as “any paper” while the Statutes at Large version shows the text as “any papers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus the proof <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P}" class="latex" /> could be the same size of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BD%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{D}" class="latex" />. Thus,</p>
<p>
Case: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%3E%3E+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P &gt;&gt; D}" class="latex" />. This is the usual proof of a classic problem like the four-color problem. Huge proof. </p>
<p>
Case: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP+%5Capprox+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{P \approx D}" class="latex" />. This is like a simple problem or like a proof of a complex program with tons of bits in its description. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Proofs and Software </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My famous—infamous?—<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">paper</a> with Alan Perlis and Rich de Millo raised the related issue in the first sentence of our abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is argued that formal verifications of programs, no matter how obtained, will not play the same key role in the development of computer science and software engineering as proofs do in mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This argument made over four decades ago has been argued by critics as being wrong. Take a look at <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">this</a> for comments about the recent <a href="https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/2021/05/26/debate-that-changed-programming-living-history/">debate</a> on the paper moderated by Harry Lewis.</p>
<p>
We claim that we were correct but for a different reason that we made in the original paper. We got it <b>right</b> but for the wrong reason. The real reason is alluded to in this <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication8316-abstract.html">statement</a> by Tony Hoare, whose programme of proofs for programs partly spurred our paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Ten years ago, researchers into formal methods (and I was the most mistaken among them) predicted that the programming world would embrace with gratitude every assistance promised by formalisation to solve the problems of reliability that arise when programs get large and more safety-critical. Programs have now got very large and very critical—well beyond the scale which can be comfortably tackled by formal methods. … It has turned out that the world just does not suffer significantly from the kind of problem that our research was originally intended to solve.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
See also his 1996 <a href="http://176.9.41.242/docs/math/1996-hoare.pdf">position paper</a>, “How Did Software Get So Reliable Without Proof?”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Does this measure <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> shed some light on the problems of program verification? Is it useful? Would it have satisfied Hilbert? Hilbert’s handwritten note discovered by Thiele showed him thinking in terms of proofs via polynomial invariants and equations—hence maybe not at a brute level of counting symbols.</p>

<div class="content">
<p> I was at SUNY Stonybrook for college 1976-1980. </p><p>I remember one student protest about a change to the calendar that (I think) would have us go home for winter break and then come back for finals.  I don't recall how that turned out. </p><p>However I had heard about the protests in the 1960's over the Vietnam war. Recall that there was a draft back then so college students were directly affected. </p><p>I was reading a book `<i>Everything you know is wrong'</i> which noted that some people thought the first time there were student protests was in the 1960's but this is not true. (Not quite as startling as finding out that a ships captain cannot perform weddings.) </p><p>It pointed to <i>The 1830 Conic Section Rebellion. </i>I quote Wikipedia (full entry is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_Sections_Rebellion">here</a>)</p><p><i>Prior to the introduction of blackboards, Yale students had been allowed to consult diagrams in their textbooks when solving geometry problems pertaining to conic sections – even on exams. When the students were no longer allowed to consult the text, but were instead required to draw their own diagrams on the blackboard, they refused to take the final exam. As a result forty-three of the ninety-six students – among them, Alfred Stille, and Andrew Calhoun, the son of John C. Calhoun (Vice Pres a the time) – were summarily expelled, and Yale authorities warned neighboring universities against admitting them.</i></p><p>Random Thoughts</p><p>1) From my 21st century prospective I am on the students side. It seems analogous to allowing students to use calculators-- which I do allow. </p><p>2) From my 21st century prospective the punishment seems unfair. </p><p>3) The notion of a school telling other schools to not admit student- I do not think this would happen now, and might even be illegal (anti-trust).</p><p>4) I am assuming  the students wanted to be able to consult their text out of some principle: we want to learn concepts not busy work.  And again, from my prospective I agree that it was busy work. </p><p>5) Since all of my thoughts are from a 21st century prospective, they may be incorrect, or at least not as transferable to the 1830 as I think. (Paradox: My ideas may not be as true as I think. But if I think that...) </p><p>6) I try to avoid giving busy work. When I teach Decidability and Undecidability I NEVER have the students actually write a Turing Machine that does something. In other cases I also try to make sure they never have to do drudge work.  And I might not even be right in the 21st century- some of my colleagues tell me its good for the students to get their hands dirty (perhaps just a little) with real TM to get a feel for the fact that they can do anything. </p><p>7) The only student protests I hear about nowadays are on political issues. Do you know of any student protests on issues of how they are tested or what the course requirements are, or something of that ilk? I can imagine my discrete math students marching with signs that say: </p><p>DOWN WITH INDUCTION!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="content">
We consolidate two widely believed conjectures about tautologies---no optimal proof system exists, and most require superpolynomial size proofs in any system---into a $p$-isomorphism-invariant condition satisfied by all paddable $\textbf{coNP}$-complete languages or none. The condition is: for any Turing machine (TM) $M$ accepting the language, $\textbf{P}$-uniform input families requiring superpolynomial time by $M$ exist (equivalent to the first conjecture) and appear with positive upper density in an enumeration of input families (implies the second). In that case, no such language is easy on average (in $\textbf{AvgP}$) for a distribution applying non-negligible weight to the hard families.

The hardness of proving tautologies and theorems is likely related. Motivated by the fact that arithmetic sentences encoding "string $x$ is Kolmogorov random" are true but unprovable with positive density in a finitely axiomatized theory $\mathcal{T}$ (Calude and Jürgensen), we conjecture that any propositional proof system requires superpolynomial size proofs for a dense set of $\textbf{P}$-uniform families of tautologies encoding "there is no $\mathcal{T}$ proof of size $\leq t$ showing that string $x$ is Kolmogorov random". This implies the above condition.

The conjecture suggests that there is no optimal proof system because undecidable theories help prove tautologies and do so more efficiently as axioms are added, and that constructing hard tautologies seems difficult because it is impossible to construct Kolmogorov random strings. Similar conjectures that computational blind spots are manifestations of noncomputability would resolve other open problems.</div>

We study the following natural question on random sets of points in $\mathbb{F}_2^m$:
    

Given a random set of $k$ points $Z=\{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_k\} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^m$, what is the dimension of the space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials that vanish on all points in $Z$?


We show that, for $r \leq \gamma m$ (where $\gamma &gt; 0$ is a small, absolute constant) and $k = (1-\epsilon) \cdot {m \choose {\leq r}}$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials vanishing on a random set $Z = \{z_1,\ldots, z_k\}$ has dimension exactly ${m \choose {\leq r}} - k$ with probability $1 - o(1)$. This bound shows that random sets have a much smaller space of degree at most $r$ multilinear polynomials vanishing on them, compared to the worst-case bound (due to Wei (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 1991)) of ${m \choose{\leq r}} - {{\log_2 k}\choose {\leq r}} \gg {m\choose{\leq r}} - k$. 

    Using this bound, we show that high-degree Reed-Muller codes ($\text{RM}(m,d)$ with $d &gt; (1-\gamma) m$) ``achieve capacity'' under the Binary Erasure Channel in the sense that, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we can recover from $(1 - \epsilon) \cdot {m\choose {\leq m-d-1}}$ random erasures with probability $1 - o(1)$. This also implies that $\text{RM}(m,d)$ is also efficiently decodable from $\approx {m\choose {\leq m-(d/2)}}$ random errors for the same range of parameters.</div>

<p>Martha Osegueda, one of Mike Goodrich’s students at UC Irvine, successfully defended her doctoral dissertation yesterday. Martha is originally Salvadorean, and came to UCI from an undergraduate degree at the University of Texas El Paso. Her research at UCI has spanned a wide variety of topics in graph drawing, phylogeny, computational geometry, and parallel query complexity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Minimum-width drawings of phylogenetic trees” from <em>COCOA</em> 2019 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-36412-0_4">doi:10.1007/978-3-030-36412-0_4</a>) is about drawing evolutionary trees compactly. For the version of tree drawing they study, it turns out to be NP-hard when the order of the leaves is unconstrained but linear-time solvable for fixed leaf orderings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Reconstructing binary trees in parallel” from <em>SPAA</em> 2020 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15259">arXiv:2006.15259</a>) involved the reconstruction of evolutionary trees from queries asking which pair of a triple of species is closest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Concatenation arguments and their applications to polyominoes and polycubes”, in <em>CGTA</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2021.101790">doi:10.1016/j.comgeo.2021.101790</a>) and “On the number of compositions of two polycubes” from <em>EuroComb</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-83823-2_12">doi:10.1007/978-3-030-83823-2_12</a>) strengthen the known lower bounds on the growth rates of polyominoes and polycubes, using arguments based on counting ways of gluing pairs of smaller polyforms into larger ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Angles of arc-polygons and Lombardi drawings of cacti”, from <em>CCCG</em> 2021 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03615">arXiv:2107.03615</a>) is my only collaboration with Martha and one <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/07/10/angles-arc-triangles.html">I have posted about here</a>. It characterizes the vertex angles that are possible in triangles with circular-arc sides, and uses that characterization to prove the existence of a Lombardi drawing for any cactus graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Parallel network mapping algorithms” from <em>SPAA</em> 2021 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3409964.3461822">doi:10.1145/3409964.3461822</a>) and “Mapping Networks via parallel \(k\)th-hop traceroute queries” from <em>STACS</em> 2022 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.4">doi:10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.4</a>) are on traceroute-like problems: mapping the structure of a computer communication network using a small number of parallel rounds of pings to determine distances from nodes on the network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Taming the knight’s tour: Minimizing turns and crossings” from <em>FUN</em> 2021 and <em>TCS</em> 2022 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2021.12.002">doi:10.1016/j.tcs.2021.12.002</a>) shows how to move a chess knight around all of the squares of a chessboard, touching each square once, so that the number of times the knight’s path crosses itself or deviates from a straight path are both simultaneously approximately minimized.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Diamonds are forever in the blockchain: Geometric polyhedral point-set pattern matching” is her newest work, in submission. It studies problems of aligning a polyhedron to sample points from a similarly-shaped surface, motivated by an application in tracing the provenance of ethically sourced diamonds.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Despite all of these good publications, Mike tells me that it was difficult to persuade Martha that she had done enough for a doctorate. But she had, easily, and now she’s moving on to a position at Meta. Congratulations, Martha!</p>

<h3>The history of the <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2204.12455v1-abstract-full">Erdős -Sauer</span> problem 1975-2022</h3>
<p>Erdos and Sauer asked in 1975 how many edges (let’s denote the minimum number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f_k%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f_k(n)" class="latex" />) for an <em>n</em>-vertex graph guarantee a <em>k</em>-regular subgraph. In 1985 Laszlo Pyber proved that for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C_k" class="latex" /> every graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> edges and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C_kn+%5Clog+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C_kn \log n" class="latex" /> edges contains a <em>k</em>-regular graph. A few years later Pyber, Rodl and Szemeredi found a construction of a graph with<em> n</em> vertices and  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+n+%5Clog+%5Clog+n+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c n \log \log n " class="latex" /> edges that contains no k-regular subgraph for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cge+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k \ge 3" class="latex" />. (The paper appeared in 1995 but the result is from the late 80s.)</p>
<p>Paul <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2204.12455v1-abstract-full">Erdős  mentioned the problem among his favorites in a famous paper in 1980 (Vol 1. Issue 1. of Combinatorica) and mentioned the results of Pyber and of Pyber, Rodl and Szemeredi in his 1989 paper.</span></p>
<p>Oliver and Benny proved an upper bound on the number of edges of k-regular free graphs that matches the Pyber, Rodl and Szemeredi lower bound. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Congratulations!</strong></span></p>
<h3>AFK84 and the Berge-Sauer problem</h3>
<p><strong>Theorem: </strong>Every graph (or hypergraph) <em>G</em> with <em>n</em> vertices and <em>2n+1</em> edges contains a nontrivial subgraph <em>H</em> with all vertex-degrees divisible by 3.</p>
<p>This is a theorem of Noga Alon,  Shmuel Friedland, and me (AFK) from 1984.)</p>
<p><strong>Before the proof</strong>: If we want to get a subgraph with all vertex degrees even then we need<em> n</em> edges (or <em>n+1</em> edges for hypergraphs). This has a simple linear algebra proof which also gives an efficient algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>From-scratch proof scatch: </strong>Associate to every edge <em>e</em> of the graph a variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_e&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x_e" class="latex" />. Consider the two polynomial</p>
<p><em>P=</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cprod_%7Bv+%5Cin+V%28G%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\prod_{v \in V(G)}" class="latex" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28%5Csum_%7Be%3A+v+%5Cin+e%7Dx%5E2_e%29%5E2-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="((\sum_{e: v \in e}x^2_e)^2-1)" class="latex" />, and</p>
<p>Q=<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cprod_%7Be%5Cin+E%28G%29%7D%28x_e%5E2-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\prod_{e\in E(G)}(x_e^2-1)" class="latex" /></p>
<p>If the theorem is false then <em>P-Q=0, </em>as polynomials over the field with three elements. This is impossible since P is a polynomial of degree <em>4n</em> while Q is a polynomial which has a monomial of degree <em>4n+2</em> with nonzero coefficient.</p>
<p>The theorem follows more directly from a theorem of Chevallay and even more directly from a theorem of Olson.</p>
<p>AFK84 was a necessary ingredients of Pyber 1985 upper bound as well as the Janzer-Sudakov new upper bound. It will be very nice to get rid of this ingredient. AFK84 came a little short of proving the Berge-Sauer conjecture that every 4-regular graph contains a 3-regular subgraph.  This conjecture was proved in a 1982 paper by Taskinov.</p>
<h3>Three problems</h3>
<p>A) Is it true that every graph with n vertices and 2n+1 edges with maximum degree 5 contains a 3-regular graph of type I? (Namely a 3-regular 3-edge colorable subgraph.)</p>
<p>B) How many edges for a 3-uniform hypergraph on n vertices guarantees a k-regular sub-hypergraph? (Here we refer to “3-regular hypergraph as a hypergraph so that every vertex belongs to three (or zero) edges. You can also demand that every pair of vertices belongs to three or zero edges.)</p>
<p>C) Is there a polynomial-time algorithm to find a<em> r</em>-regular subgraph for a graph with n vertices and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{1.01}" class="latex" /> edges.</p>
<h3>Climbing the Turan ladder</h3>
<p>Climbing the Turan ladder refers to unavoidable subgraphs of a graph of n vertices and m edges as m grows. (The Erdos-Renyi ladder is a similar notion for random graphs.)</p>
<p>Problem A) is related to the following:</p>
<p>When <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> is roughly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="2n" class="latex" /></p>
<p><strong>a)</strong> (for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2n-2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m=2n-2" class="latex" />) you must have a subgraph with all degrees larger than 2</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong> (for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D+2n%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m= 2n+1" class="latex" />) you must have a subgraph with all degrees divisible by 3 (AFK84), and</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong> (for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m%3D2n%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m=2n+1" class="latex" />) you also must have a subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> such that you can color its edges with three colors so that every (non-isolated) vertex have neighbors of the all color.</p>
<p>We don’t know what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="m" class="latex" /> guarantees</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong> such an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="H" class="latex" /> so that for every vertex the number of edges of each color is the same modulo three.</p>
<p>Condition<strong> d)</strong> is stronger than both <strong>b)</strong> and <strong>c)</strong> and each of them is stronger than<strong> a)</strong>. Both<strong> a), b)</strong> and <strong>c)</strong> extend to hypergraphs.</p>
<h3>The relevance of Christos’s classes and the PME-conjecture.</h3>
<p>The <strong>Probabilistic Method is Efficient (PME)</strong> <strong>Conjecture</strong> asserts: Every mathematical proof based on the probabilistic method can be transformed into an efficient (randomized) algorithm.</p>
<p>This is a vague and controversial conjecture that I mentioned in the post <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2013/08/08/poznan-random-structures-and-algorithms-2013/" rel="bookmark">Poznań: Random Structures and Algorithms 2013</a>. (There I  referred to it as the Kalai-Spencer conjecture.) Now, if we can get rid of AFK84 and find a purely combinatorial/probabilistic  proof even just for the fact that every graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" /> vertices and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{1.01}" class="latex" /> edges contains a 3-regular subgraph, this would be nice on its own and may lead (especially for PME-believers) to an efficient algorithm. AFK84 is not supported by an efficient algorithm and, in fact it is related to one of Christos Papadimitriou’s classes describing the algorithmic difficulty for finding objects guarantees by mathematical proofs. See Papadimitriou’s  1994 paper: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000005800637" id="OT-8y8wGxeEJ"><span dir="ltr">On the complexity of the parity argument and other inefficient proofs of existence</span>‏.</a></p></div>

We study the power of randomized polynomial-time non-adaptive reductions to the problem of approximating Kolmogorov complexity and its polynomial-time bounded variants.

As our first main result, we give a sharp dichotomy for randomized non-adaptive reducibility to approximating Kolmogorov complexity. We show that any computable language $L$ that has a randomized polynomial-time non-adaptive reduction (satisfying a natural honesty condition) to $\omega(\log(n))$-approximating the Kolmogorov complexity is in AM $\cap$ coAM. On the other hand, using results of Hirahara [H20], it follows that every language in NEXP has a randomized polynomial-time non-adaptive reduction (satisfying the same honesty condition as before) to $O(\log(n))$-approximating the Kolmogorov complexity.

As our second main result, we give the first negative evidence against the NP-hardness of polynomial-time bounded Kolmogorov complexity with respect to randomized reductions. We show that for every polynomial t', there is a polynomial t such that if there is a randomized time t' non-adaptive reduction (satisfying a natural honesty condition) from SAT to $\omega(\log(n))$-approximating $K^t$ complexity, then either NE = coNE or E has sub-exponential size non-deterministic circuits infinitely often.</div>

In 2007 Guruswami, Umans and Vadhan gave an explicit construction of a lossless condenser based on Parvaresh-Vardy codes. This lossless condenser is a basic building block in many constructions, and, in particular, is behind the state of the art extractor constructions.

We give an alternative construction that is based on Multiplicity codes. While the bottom-line result is similar to the GUV result, the analysis is very different. In GUV (and Parvaresh-Vardy codes) the polynomial ring is closed to a finite field, and every polynomial is associated with related elements in the finite field. In our construction a polynomial from the polynomial ring is associated with its iterated derivatives. Our analysis boils down to solving a differential equation over a finite field, and uses previous techniques, introduced by Kopparty for the list-decoding setting.
We also observe that these (and more general) questions were studied in differential algebra, and we use the terminology and result developed there.

We believe these techniques have the potential of getting better constructions and solving the current bottlenecks in the area.</div>

<ol><li>What led you to academia?</li></ol>



<p>Much to the shock of my fellow students, I have wanted to be a professor since my freshman year in Italy. The pursuit of knowledge and the lifestyle freedom really appealed to me. Naturally, I did not have a clue; but I would do it all over again, changing nothing… alright, almost nothing.</p>



<ol start="2"><li>How did you become interested in theoretical computer science?</li></ol>



<p>I was totally hooked to computers since I was eight, and also worked on videogames in my early teens. In high school I didn’t mind math, but it was not my passion: It was mostly calculus which I thought was “only good for physics.” In college I had a first glimpse of theoretical computer science, and I was struck. The field was asking the right questions: What is a proof, what is knowledge, what is randomness, <em>when you are short on time?</em></p>



<ol start="3"><li>What are you currently working on?</li></ol>



<p>The most famous open problem in the field is the P vs. NP problem which can be phrased as asking to prove that <em>Super Mario</em> levels, properly constructed, are hard to beat. The general challenge is to exhibit problems that require a lot of time on computers. Much of my research concerns proving such limitations for restricted models of computers, for example computers with no memory. Even understanding such restricted models has proved enormously difficult, and a good reason for that is that they are extremely powerful, much more so than anyone anticipated.</p></div>

<p>Mohit Singh and I are organizing a two-day virtual DIMACS Workshop on <strong>Entropy and Optimization</strong> that starts tomorrow — May 18, 19, 2022. </p>



<p>We have a stellar lineup of speakers:  </p>



<p><em>Nima Anari (Stanford University), Alexander Barvinok (Michigan), Mark Braverman (Princeton), Sebastien Bubeck (Microsoft Research), Péter Csikvári (Alfred Renyi Institute of Mathematics), Zongchen Chen (MIT), Ronen Eldan (Weizmann), Tali Kaufman (Bar-Ilan University), Jon Lee (Michigan), Shayan Oveis-Gharan (U Washington)</em></p>



<p>The goal of this workshop is to explore various connections between entropy, optimization, and sampling. Entropy-maximizing probability distributions have been recently used in interesting ways in applications such as algorithms for counting problems, algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems, and interior-point methods for convex programming</p>



<p>Attendance to the workshop is free but <strong>registration is required</strong>. To see the program of the workshop and register, visit <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/events/details?eID=318">here</a>.</p>



<p>Looking forward to seeing many of you there!</p>

<p>
Sixteen years ago she wrote a short <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/publications/Wing06.pdf">position</a> paper for <em>Communications of the ACM</em> titled “Computational Thinking.” It begins:</p>
<p>
<em><br />
 Computational thinking builds on the power and limits of computing processes, whether they are executed by a human or by a machine.<br />
</em></p>
<p>
This is the first of sixteen sentences of the form “Computational thinking [verb]…,” plus one that follows a semicolon. The thirteenth prefaces six bulleted paragraphs giving characteristics of computational thinking. They fill page 3 of 3—the paper is shorter to read than this post. </p>
<p>
Her 2007 <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/usr/wing/www/Computational_Thinking.pdf">talk</a> on “Computational Thinking” has oodles of things that aren’t in the paper: <em>pictures</em>. It also concludes by posing five questions that she put into another famous CACM paper.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Five Questions </b></p>
<p></p><p>
This second <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2008/1/5481-five-deep-questions-in-computing/fulltext">paper</a> appeared in 2008 with the title “Five Deep Questions in Computing.” They are: </p>
<ol>
<li> P = NP?
</li><li> What is computable?
</li><li> What is intelligence?
</li><li> What is information?
</li><li> (How) can we build complex systems simply?
</li></ol>
<p>
The first is one of the basic questions of theory, of course. </p>
<p>
The next is about what are computations? This question complicates when one includes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing">DNA</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing">quantum</a> computers? Also what about man-machine joint computations? Given that humans and machines have different computing capability, now ask: What is computable? Pretty complex.</p>
<p>
Let’s skip what is intelligence for now.</p>
<p>
What is information? This is a perfect question: Information is not just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />‘s and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" />‘s. DNA encodes information in a different way and with quantum computing, it’s not bits but qubits. Amazing. </p>
<p>
Finally we will also skip the last question. </p>
<p>
She ends with:<br />
<em><br />
I pose these questions to stimulate deep thinking and further discussion. What deep questions about computing would you want answered? In 50 years, how different will they and their answers be from what we ask and are able to answer today?<br />
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Data Science </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Wing is a leading expert of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">data science</a>. This field is traceable back to 1962 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey">John Tukey</a> described an area he called “data analysis”. That is Tukey of Fast Fourier transform fame, who I knew when I was at Princeton. </p>
<p>
Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data.</p>
<p>
Her current research interests are in trustworthy AI. Her areas of research expertise include security and privacy, formal methods, programming languages, and distributed and concurrent systems. She is widely recognized for her intellectual leadership in computer science, and more recently in data science. Wing’s seminal essay, titled “Computational Thinking,” was published more than a fifteen years ago and is credited with helping to establish the centrality of computer science to problem-solving in all other disciplines.</p>
<p>
Data can be precious for one of three reasons: the data set is expensive to collect; the data set contains a rare event (low signal-to-noise ratio); or the data set is artisanal—small, task-specific, and/or targets a limited audience. </p>
<ul>
<li> A good example of expensive data comes from large, one-off, expensive scientific instruments, for example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the Large Hadron Collider, and the IceCube Neutrino Detector at the South Pole.
</li><li> A good example of rare event data is data from sensors on physical infrastructure, such as bridges and tunnels; sensors produce a lot of raw data, but the disastrous event they are used to predict is (thankfully) rare. Rare data can also be expensive to collect.
</li><li> A good example of artisanal data is the tens of millions of court judgments that China has released online to the public since 2014.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s take a cue from Wing: What other major aspects and objectives of computer science shall we put into crisp bullet points?</p>

Understanding the relationship between the worst-case and average-case complexities of $\mathrm{NP}$ and of other subclasses of $\mathrm{PH}$ is a long-standing problem in complexity theory. Over the last few years, much progress has been achieved in this front through the investigation of meta-complexity: the complexity of problems that refer to the complexity of the input string $x$ (e.g., given a string $x$, estimate its time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity). In particular, [Hir21] employed techniques from meta-complexity to show that if $\mathrm{DistNP} \subseteq \mathrm{AvgP}$ then $\mathrm{UP} \subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}[2^{O(n/\log n)}]$. While this and related results [HN21, CHV22] offer exciting progress after a long gap, they do not survive in the setting of ramdonmized computations: roughly speaking, "randomness" is the opposite of "structure", and upper bounding the amount of structure (time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity) of different objects is crucial in recent applications of meta-complexity. This limitation is significant, since randomized computations are ubiquitous in algorithm design and give rise to a more robust theory of average-case complexity [IL90].

In this work, we develop a probabilistic theory of meta-complexity, by incorporating randomness into the notion of complexity of a string $x$. This is achieved through a new probabilistic variant of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity that we call $\mathrm{pK}^t$ complexity. Informally, $\mathrm{pK}^t(x)$ measures the complexity of $x$ when shared randomness is available to all parties involved in a computation. By porting key results from meta-complexity to the probabilistic domain of $\mathrm{pK}^t$ complexity and its variants, we are able to establish new connections between worst-case and average-case complexity in the important setting of probabilistic computations:

-  If $\mathrm{DistNP} \subseteq \mathrm{AvgBPP}$, then $\mathrm{UP}\subseteq\mathrm{RTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$. 

-  If $\mathrm{Dist\Sigma}^{\mathrm{P}}_{2} \subseteq \mathrm{AvgBPP}$, then $\mathrm{AM} \subseteq \mathrm{BPTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$. 

- In the fine-grained setting [CHV22], we get $\mathrm{UTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}]\subseteq \mathrm{RTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}]$ and $\mathrm{AMTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}] \subseteq \mathrm{BPTIME}[2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}]$ from stronger average-case assumptions. 

- If $\mathrm{DistPH}\subseteq\mathrm{AvgBPP}$, then $\mathrm{PH}\subseteq\mathrm{BPTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$. Specifically, for any $\ell \geq 0$, if $\mathrm{Dist\Sigma}_{\ell+2}^{\mathrm{P}}\subseteq\mathrm{AvgBPP}$ then $\mathrm{\Sigma}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{P}}\subseteq\mathrm{BPTIME}\!\left[2^{O(n/\log n)}\right]$.

- Strengthening a result from [HN21], we show that if $\mathrm{DistNP}\subseteq\mathrm{AvgBPP}$ then polynomial size Boolean circuits can be agnostically PAC learned under any unknown $\mathrm{P}/\mathrm{poly}$-samplable distribution in polynomial time.

In some cases, our framework allows us to significantly simplify existing proofs, or to extend results to the more challenging probabilistic setting with little to no extra effort.</div>

<p>Some time ago, I received a message to the effect that I was being considered for membership in the “Academy of the XL”, to which my reaction was, hey, we have all gone out of shape during the pandemic, and body-shaming is never… then it was explained to me that, in this context, “XL” means “forty” and that the Academy of the Forty is Italy’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_nazionale_delle_scienze">National Academy of Science</a>.</p>
<p>Italy has a wonderfully named, and well-known within the country, National Academy of Arts and Science, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_dei_Lincei">Accademia dei Lincei</a>, which means something like academy of the “eagle-eyed” (literally, lynx-eyed), that is, people that can see far. The Accademia dei XL is much less well known, although it has a distinguished 240-year history, during which people like Guglielmo Marconi and Enrico Fermi were members. More recently, the much beloved Rita Levi-Montalcini, Holocaust survivor, Nobel Laureate, and Senator-for-life, was a member. Current members include Nobel Laureates Carlo Rubbia and Giorgio Parisi. Noted algebraist Corrado De Concini is the current president.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the academicians did vote to make me a member, their first computer scientist ever. Next week, at the inauguration of their 240th academic year, I will speak to the other members about randomness and pseudorandomness in computation.</p></div>

<i>Never say anything in an electronic message that you wouldn’t want appearing, and attributed to you, in tomorrow morning’s front-page headline in the New York Times—Colonel David Russell.</i></p>
<p>
Rafail Ostrovsky is a professor of computer science at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering. Ken and I have been friends with him for many years, long before he moved to UCLA. He is one of the world experts in security theory and practice. And he is especially strong at seeing new attacks and then finding defenses for them. See his web <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/">home</a> site for some details. </p>
<p>
Rafail was just awarded the 2022 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Wallace_McDowell_Award">McDowell award</a>.  For visionary contributions to computer security theory and practice, including foreseeing new cloud vulnerabilities and then pioneering corresponding novel solutions. </p>
<p>
Again first seeing attacks, then inventing defenses. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/14/rafail-is-no-secret/ro/" rel="attachment wp-att-20016"><img width="208" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ro.jpg?resize=208%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-20016" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> A Key Result </b></p>
<p></p><p>
One of Rafail’s neat results is how to create strong keys from biological data. This is joint work with Yevgeniy Dodis, Leonid Reyzin, and Adam Smith and is <a href="http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rafail/PUBLIC/89.pdf">Fuzzy Extractors:</a> How to Generate Strong Keys from Biometrics and Other Noisy Data. </p>
<p>
Rather than try and generate keys from silly to generate patterns such as: 	 	my name + 3.14159 	 the idea is to use your own biological data. This paper unlike traditional cryptographic keys, is (1) not reproducible precisely and (2) not distributed uniformly. Yet it allows strong keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> A Non-Typical Result </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Rafail has a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/997.pdf">paper</a> that is titled Alibi: A Flaw in Cuckoo-Hashing based Hierarchical ORAM Schemes and a Solution and is joint with Brett Hemenway Falk and Daniel Noble both of University of Pennsylvania. Their paper solves a nice problem, but we believe is unique for its abstract:  </p>
<p>
There once was a table of hashes <br />
 That held extra items in stashes <br />
 It all seemed like bliss <br />
 But things went amiss <br />
 When the stashes were stored in the caches </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> More Results </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is another of Rafail’s results that demonstrates his many abilities. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-24676-3_30.pdf">paper</a> is titled Public Key Encryption with Keyword Search and is joint with Dan Boneh, Giovanni Di Crescenzo, and Giuseppe Persiano.  Consider a mail server that stores various messages publicly encrypted for Alice by others. Using our mechanism Alice can send the mail server a key that will enable the server to identify all messages containing some specific keyword, but learn nothing else. We define the concept of public key encryption with keyword search and give several constructions. </p>
<p>
This result is interesting in that Rafail creates a problem that allows security to be partial. The full text is safe but it is still possible to search the text for certain keywords. This allows the security to be weaken, but not to be weaken all the way. </p>
<p>
It is surprising that security can be weaken partially, but not all the way. It might seem likely that this weaken notation of security could be too dangerous. One of the advantages of precise security models is that such results can be safely defined and shown to be safe. This is the fundamental advantage of modern formal definitions for security. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Rafail is one of the top researchers in security in the broadest sense. He is one of the best at defining new types of security and then showing that such notions are actually safe.</p>
<p>
Congrats to him for the McDowell award.</p>

<div class="content">
We establish an $\epsilon$-sensitive hierarchy separation for monotone arithmetic computations. The notion of $\epsilon$-sensitive monotone lower bounds was recently introduced by Hrubes [Computational Complexity'20]. We show the following:
   
(1) There exists a monotone polynomial over $n$ variables in VNP that cannot be computed by $2^{o(n)}$ size monotone circuits in an $\epsilon$-sensitive way as long as $\epsilon \ge 2^{-\Omega(n)}$.

(2) There exists a polynomial over $n$ variables that can be computed by polynomial size monotone circuits but cannot be computed by any monotone arithmetic branching program (ABP) of $n^{o(\log n)}$ size, even in an $\epsilon$-sensitive fashion as long as $\epsilon \ge n^{-\Omega(\log n)}$.

(3) There exists a polynomial over $n$ variables that can be computed by polynomial size monotone ABP but cannot be computed in $n^{o(\log n)}$ size by monotone formulas even in an $\epsilon$-sensitive way, when $\epsilon \ge n^{-\Omega(\log n)}$.

(4) There exists a polynomial over $n$ variables that can be computed by width-$4$  polynomial size monotone arithmetic branching programs (ABPs) but cannot be computed in $2^{o(n^{1/d})}$ size by monotone, unbounded fan-in formulas of product depth $d$ even in an $\epsilon$-sensitive way, when $\epsilon \ge 2^{-\Omega(n^{1/d})}$. This yields an $\epsilon$-sensitive separation of constant-depth monotone formulas and constant-width monotone ABPs. It seems that even an ordinary separation of the two classes was not known.   

An interesting feature of our separations is that in each case the polynomial exhibited is obtained from a graph inner-product polynomial by choosing an appropriate graph topology. The closely related graph inner-product Boolean function for expander graphs was invented by Hayes [DM &amp; TCS'11], also independently by Pitassi [2009], in the context of best-partition multiparty communication complexity.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We recently showed an algorithm for computing all-pairs minimum cuts (or, more precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree) in ~O(n^2) time in weighted graphs and even almost-linear time in unweighted graphs. For weighted graphs, this is the first improvement over the 60-year-old algorithm by Gomory and Hu. Thus, surprisingly, computing all-pairs minimum cuts seems to be strictly easier than computing all-pairs shortest paths, which is conjectured to require n^{3-o(1)} time.</p>
<p>I will give a tutorial on the techniques behind our new result, one of which is called “isolating cuts”. Then, I will survey recent progress in fast minimum cut algorithms and discuss open problems.</p>

<i>I’m low-key. I like my privacy—Kemba Walker.</i></p>
<p>
Avrim Blum, Irit Dinur, Cynthia Dwork, Frank McSherry, Kobbi Nissim, and Adam Smith, received the ACM 2021 Paris Kanellakis Theory and Practice <a href="https://awards.acm.org/kanellakis">Award</a>. They worked on and studied the notion of <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy">differential privacy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/05/11/differential-privacy/all-12/" rel="attachment wp-att-20004"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/all.png?resize=600%2C338&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20004" height="338" /></a></p>
<p><b> Privacy </b></p>
<p></p><p>
One of the key advances of modern cryptography is its ability to define new types of security. One can be pretty naive in defining simple notions of security. For example, it is not too hard to get correct the notion: Given the encrypted message <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_K%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{E_K(M)}" class="latex" /> one cannot easily determine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{M}" class="latex" /> without knowing the key <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K}" class="latex" />. However, things are much more complex when we wish to define more complex notions. </p>
<p>
This happens with notions of privacy. Differential privacy is a framework for reasoning about statistical databases. Imagine you have two otherwise identical databases, one with your personal information in it, and one without it. Differential Privacy ensures that the probability that a statistical query will produce a given result is (nearly) the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second database. </p>
<p>
Perhaps a concrete question will help: <i>How can we use data to learn about a population, without learning about specific individuals within the population?</i> Consider these two questions: </p>
<ol>
<li> “How many people live in Vermont?”
</li><li> “How many people named Joe Smith live in Vermont?”
</li></ol>
<p>
The first reveals a property of the whole population, while the second reveals information about one person. We need to be able to learn about trends in the population while preventing the ability to learn anything new about a particular individual. This is the goal of many statistical analyses of data, such as the statistics published by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is what differential privacy is all about. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Award </b></p>
<p></p><p>
From the award citation:</p>
<p>
<em><br />
Differential privacy is a definition and framework for reasoning about privacy in statistical databases. While the privacy of individuals contributing to a dataset has been a long-standing concern, prior to the Kanellakis recipients’ work, computer scientists only knew how to mitigate several specific privacy attacks via a disparate set of techniques. The foundation for differential privacy emerged in the early 2000’s from several key papers. At the ACM Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2003) Dinur and Nissim presented a paper which showed that any technique that allows reasonably accurate answers to a large number of queries is inherently non-private.</em></p><em>
</em><p><em>
Later, a sequence of papers by Dwork and Nissim at the International Conference on Cryptology (Crypto 2004); as well as Blum, Dwork, McSherry, and Nissim at the ACM Symposium on the Principles of Database Systems (PODS 2005); and Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith at the Theory of Cryptology Conference (TCC 2006) further defined and studied the notion of differential privacy.</em> </p>
<p>

We wish Avrim, Irit, Cynthia, Frank, Kobbi, and Adam congrats on their well deserved award. </p>

<p> A few days ago Queen Elizabeth passed Johann II of Liechtenstein to be the third longest reigning monarch (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest-reigning_monarchs">here</a>). </p><p>A summary of the top 4:</p><p><br /></p><p>4) Johann II, Liechtenstein ruled from Nov 12 1858 until his death on Feb 11, 1929. When he became King he was 18. He was king for 70 years, 91 days. </p><p>3) Queen Elizabeth II (thats a two, not an eleven) ruled from Feb 2, 1952 until now. When she became Queen she was  25. I am writing this on May 10 at which time she ruled 70 years, 94 days. </p><p>2) Bhumibol Adulyadej (Thailand) ruled from June 9, 1946 until Oct 13, 2016. When he became King he was 19. He was king for 70 years, 126 days. </p><p>1) Louis XIV ruled from May 14, 1643 until Sept 1, 1715. When he became King he was 4 years and 8 months. He was king for 72 years, 110 days. </p><p><br /></p><p>Johann, Elizabeth, and Bhumibol started their reigns a bit young (they would have to to have ruled so long) but their first day of their reign they knew what the job was, what they are supposed to do etc. </p><p>Here is my complaint: Louis XIV being king at the age of 4 years 8 months should not count (someone who proofread this post wondered if 4 years 9 months would count. No.) Shouldn't we define the reign of a king as the point at which he can make real decisions as king? Or something like that. </p><p>For the record of the longest marriage there is a similar problem. The three longest marriages are legit in that the people got married at a reasonable age (I think all were married after they were 17). The fourth longest marriage of all time involved two people that were married when they were 5.

<p>In this blog post we use datamodels to identify and study a new form of model <em>brittleness.</em></p>

<h2 id="recap-datamodels">Recap: Datamodels</h2>

<p>In our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">last post</a>, we introduced datamodels: a framework for studying how models use training data to make predictions. While we summarize datamodels in short below, if you haven’t yet read about datamodels we recommend reading our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">last post</a> for the full picture.</p>

<p>Consider a training set $S$ (e.g., a set of images and labels from a computer vision dataset), a learning algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ (e.g., training a deep neural network from scratch with SGD), and a target example $x$ (e.g., a test image and label from the same dataset). A <em>datamodel</em> for the target example $x$ is a parameterized function that takes as input a subset $S’$ of the original training set $S$, and predicts the outcome of training a model on $S’$ (using $\mathcal{A}$) and evaluating on $x$. In other words, a datamodel predicts how the choice of a specific training subset changes the final model prediction.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/datamodel_blogpost_figures.001.png" alt="A graphic showing a test image and a training set. Some of the training images are greyed out to indicate a subset S-prime of the training set. There is an arrow from the training set to a question asking, &quot;if i train a model on examples # 1, 3, 5, etc., how will the model behave on the given target example?&quot; This question is fed to the datamodel, which returns an estimate of what the output (e.g. loss) of a model trained on S-prime and evaluated on x would be." /></p>

<p>Our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">last post</a> focused on constructing <em>linear</em> datamodels (one for each CIFAR-10 test image) that accurately predict the outcome of training a deep neural network from scratch on subsets of the CIFAR-10 training set.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll use datamodels to investigate deep neural networks’ predictions. Specifically, we’ll introduce and measure <em>data-level brittleness</em>: how sensitive are model predictions to removing a small number of training set points?</p>

<h2 id="data-level-brittleness-a-motivating-example">Data-level brittleness: a motivating example</h2>

<p>Consider this image of a boat from the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10</a> test set:</p>

<p><img width="120px" alt="An image of a boat from the CIFAR-10 test set" src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/Untitled.png" /></p>

<p>A deep neural network (ResNet-9) trained on CIFAR-10 correctly classifies this example as a boat with <strong>71%</strong> (softmax) confidence. The classification is also “robust” in the sense that over different training runs (each with a different random initialization of the network, batch ordering, data augmentation, etc.), the trained model classifies this example correctly <strong>84%</strong> of the time.</p>

<p>It turns out, however, that if we remove just the following nine images from the CIFAR-10 training set…</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/datamodel_blogpost_figures.001%201.png" alt="Nine images from the CIFAR-10 training set that, when removed, induce misclassification of the boat example above." /></p>

<p>…models trained with the exact same training procedure (applied to the remaining 49,991 images in the training set) correctly classify the boat only <strong>35%</strong> of the time! Furthermore, when we remove only 11 additional training images, the probability of correct classification decreases to merely <strong>10%</strong> (the accuracy of a <em>random</em> classifier!).</p>

<p>Model behavior on this boat image exemplifies <em>data-level brittleness.</em> Models confidently and consistently output correct predictions, but these predictions hinge on a very small set of training examples. (One might hypothesize that in this case, brittleness stems from the fact that there are very few training examples of boats on land or grass.)</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-brittleness-with-datamodels">Quantifying brittleness with datamodels</h2>

<p>How do we actually measure data-level brittleness? In the example above, models misclassified the boat after we removed nine images. These were nine <em>specifically chosen</em> images, however: removing nine <em>randomly chosen</em> training images of boats does not at all degrade models’ probability of correctly classifying the boat image. Even removing the nine most <em>similar</em> training examples to the boat image (e.g., in terms of representation space distance) degrades this probability by only 4%.</p>

<p>So, how do we find the “right” images to remove? Specifically, what we’re looking for is the smallest subset of the training set whose removal induces misclassification on average, i.e.,</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\tag{1}
\label{eq:origobj}
\min_{R \subset S} |R’|, \text{ such that }\mathbb{E}[\text{margin of a model
trained on } S \setminus R \text{ on } x] \leq 0.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Unfortunately, problems like this (optimizing a black-box function over the space of all possible subsets of a large set) are computationally challenging to solve. In the worst case, to find the smallest set satisfying the above condition we would have to train several models for each possible training subset.</p>

<p>This is where datamodels come in. Recall that for a target example $x$ (e.g., our  boat example from before), we can construct (read our <a href="https://gradientscience.org/datamodels-1/">previous post</a> to see how) a <em>datamodel</em> $g$ that, for any subset of the training set $S’$, returns an estimate:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
g(S’) \approx \mathbb{E}[\text{margin of a classifier trained on $S’$ when
evaluated on $x$}].
\end{align}</p>

<p>(Here, the expectation is taken over training non-determinism.) Datamodel estimates can be highly accurate. For example, see the following graph of predicted average margin $g(S’)$ against true average margin (the RHS above) from our last post:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/Untitled%201.png" alt="A graph comparing true and datamodel-predicted outcomes of model training." /></p>

<p>Datamodel predictiveness means we can (approximately) solve our earlier optimization problem (\eqref{eq:origobj}) by optimizing instead the <em>surrogate objective</em>:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\tag{2}
\label{eq:surrogate1}
\min_{R \subset S} \vert R \vert \text{ such that } g(S \backslash R) \leq 0
\end{align}</p>

<p>Since $g(\cdot)$ is a simple (linear) function (see the drop-down below for more details), this new optimization problem is computationally easy to solve (and doesn’t involve training additional models).</p>

<article class="small">
In our last post, we showed that for deep neural networks, datamodels that are linear with respect to the <em>presence</em> of each training image can suffice to accurately predict model behavior. In the linear datamodel regime, we parameterize our datamodel $g(\cdot)$ for a target example $x$ with a weight vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^{50,000}$ (where $50,000$ is the size of the training set), and the datamodel prediction $g(S’)$ is precisely:
    
\begin{align}
    g(S’) = \mathbf{1}_{S’}^\top w,
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{1}_{S'}$ is a 50,000-dimensional indicator vector of $S'$ (i.e., taking on a value of one at index $i$ if the $i$-th training image is in $S'$, and zero otherwise).

Here, solving the optimization problem \(\eqref{eq:surrogate1}\) corresponds to choosing $R$ as the training images that correspond to the largest indices of $w_i$.

</section>
<p><br /></p>

<p>After finding a subset $R$ that minimizes the surrogate objective above, we can verify that $R$ is an upper bound on the objective above by training a collection of models on the remaining training images $S \setminus R$, and checking to see that the target example is misclassified on average. We can <em>ensure</em> we actually get an upper bound on the size of the minimum $R$ by solving</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\min_{R \subset S} \vert R \vert \text{ such that } g(S \setminus R) \leq C,
\end{align}</p>

<p>where $C&lt;0$ is a threshold that we (very coarsely) search for using the verification procedure—if the image isn’t misclassified on average, we can decrease $C$.</p>

<h2 id="looking-at-brittleness-in-aggregate">Looking at brittleness in aggregate</h2>

<p>So far in this post, we’ve seen an example of data-level brittleness, and provided a datamodel-based method for estimating the brittleness of any given prediction. How brittle are model predictions as a whole?</p>

<p>We use our datamodel-based approach to estimate the data-level brittleness of each image in (a random sample of) the CIFAR-10 test set. Specifically, for each test image, we estimate (and bound) the number of training images one would need to remove in order to flip models’ predictions on the test image. We plot the <em>cumulative distribution</em> of these estimates below: a point $(x, y)$ on the blue line below indicates that a $y$ fraction of test set predictions are brittle to the removal of at most $x$ training images.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/cifar_brittleness_combined_withflips_False.svg" alt="CDF of data-level brittleness" /></p>

<p>It turns out that our motivating boat example is not so unusual. In fact, for around 20% of the CIFAR-10 test images it suffices to remove fewer than 60 training images to induce misclassification! Also, for around half of the test examples, it suffices to remove fewer than 250 training images (still only 0.5% of the training set).</p>

<p>The other lines in the graph above illustrate just how hard it is to identify prediction brittleness via other means. Each one represents a different heuristic: a point $(x, y)$ on the line indicates that for a $y$-fraction of the test set, removing the $x$ most similar images to the target example (according to the corresponding heuristic) is necessary to flip models’ predictions. (See Appendix F.2 in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00622">paper</a> for more details on these baselines!)</p>

<h2 id="bonus-label-flipping-attacks">Bonus: Label-flipping attacks</h2>

<p>One immediate consequence of the techniques we discovered in this blog post is the existence of strong <em>label-flipping</em> attacks. So far, we’ve looked exclusively at the result of removing training images—if we use the exact same technique but instead just flip the labels of the images we would have removed, we find more severe brittleness:</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/images/datamodels/cifar_brittleness_combined_withflips_True_True.svg" alt="flipping.png" /></p>

<p>The dashed line above is the same as the blue line from earlier—the new solid blue line shows that for over half of the CIFAR-10 test images, we are able to induce misclassification by relabeling just 35 (target-specific) images!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we introduced a new notion of model brittleness, examined how to quantify it with datamodels, and demonstrated that a large fraction of predictions on the CIFAR-10 test set are quite brittle.</p>

<p>Our results demonstrate one of many ways in which datamodels can be a useful proxy for end-to-end training. More broadly (and as we’ll see in our upcoming posts!), datamodels open the door to many other fine-grained analyses of model predictions.</p></div>
