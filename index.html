The prototypical construction of error correcting codes is based on linear codes over finite fields. In this work, we make first steps in the study of codes defined over integers. We focus on Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes, and show that MDS codes with linear rate and distance can be realized over the integers with a constant alphabet size. This is in contrast to the situation over finite fields, where a linear size finite field is needed.

The core of this paper is a new result on the singularity probability of random matrices. We show that for a random $n \times n$ matrix with entries chosen independently from the range $\{-m,\ldots,m\}$, the probability that it is singular is at most $m^{-cn}$ for some absolute constant $c&gt;0$.</div>

if no criterion can be improved without deteriorating at least one of the other
criteria. Computing the set of all Pareto-optimal solutions is a common task in
multiobjective optimization to filter out unreasonable trade-offs.
</p>
<p>For most problems the number of Pareto-optimal solutions increases only
moderately with the input size in applications. However, for virtually every
multiobjective optimization problem there exist worst-case instances with an
exponential number of Pareto-optimal solutions. In order to explain this
discrepancy, we analyze a large class of multiobjective optimization problems
in the model of smoothed analysis and prove a polynomial bound on the expected
number of Pareto-optimal solutions.
</p>
<p>We also present algorithms for computing the set of Pareto-optimal solutions
for different optimization problems and discuss related results on the smoothed
complexity of optimization problems.

of $F$, in the sense of Smale, with probability at least $1-\epsilon$. When
applying this algorithm to $u \cdot F$, where $u$ is uniformly random in the
product of unitary groups, the algorithm performs $\operatorname{poly}(n,
\delta) \cdot L(F) \cdot \left( \Gamma(F) \log \Gamma(F) + \log \log

$F$, and $\Gamma(F)$ reflects an aspect of the numerical condition of $F$.
Moreover, we prove that for inputs given by random Gaussian algebraic branching

on individual subjects. To preserve her privacy and, more generally, her
informational self-determination, the individual has to be empowered by giving
her agency on her own data. Maximum agency is afforded by local anonymization,
that allows each individual to anonymize her own data before handing them to
the data controller. Randomized response (RR) is a local anonymization approach
able to yield multi-dimensional full sets of anonymized microdata that are
valid for exploratory analysis and machine learning. This is so because an
unbiased estimate of the distribution of the true data of individuals can be
obtained from their pooled randomized data. Furthermore, RR offers rigorous
privacy guarantees. The main weakness of RR is the curse of dimensionality when
applied to several attributes: as the number of attributes grows, the accuracy
of the estimated true data distribution quickly degrades. We propose several
complementary approaches to mitigate the dimensionality problem. First, we
present two basic protocols, separate RR on each attribute and joint RR for all
attributes, and discuss their limitations. Then we introduce an algorithm to
form clusters of attributes so that attributes in different clusters can be
viewed as independent and joint RR can be performed within each cluster. After
that, we introduce an adjustment algorithm for the randomized data set that
repairs some of the accuracy loss due to assuming independence between
attributes when using RR separately on each attribute or due to assuming
independence between clusters in cluster-wise RR. We also present empirical
work to illustrate the proposed methods.

deepest-descent circuit steps, each step following a circuit direction to a new
feasible solution of most-improved objective function value. A computation of
deepest-descent steps has recently been shown to be NP-hard [De Loera et al.,
arXiv, 2019]. This is a consequence of the hardness of what we call the optimal
circuit-neighbor problem (OCNP) for LPs with non-unique optima. However, the
non-uniqueness assumption is crucial to the hardness of OCNP, because we show
that OCNP for LPs with a unique optimum is solvable in polynomial time.
Moreover, in practical applications one is usually only interested in finding
some optimum of an LP, in which case a simple perturbation of the objective
yields an instance with a unique optimum. It is thus natural to ask whether
deepest-descent steps are also easy to compute for LPs with unique optima, or
whether this problem is hard despite OCNP being easy.
</p>
<p>We show that deepest-descent steps can be efficiently approximated within a
factor of $n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the polyhedron at hand, but not
within a factor of $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. While we prove
that OCNP can be solved efficiently for LPs with a unique optimum, our
different hardness approach allows us to show strong negative results:
computing deepest-descent steps is NP-hard and inapproximable even for 0/1
linear programs with a unique optimum which are defined by a totally unimodular
constraint matrix.

exploited in computer graphics rendering, computer gaming, path planning for
robots, and finite element simulations. B\'ezier curves (which use the
Bernstein basis) or B-Splines are a very common choice for these polyhedral
representations because their non-negativity and partition-of-unity properties
guarantee that each interval of the curve is contained inside the convex hull
of its control points. However, the convex hull provided by these bases is not
the one with smallest volume, producing therefore undesirable levels of
conservatism in all of the applications mentioned above. This paper presents
the MINVO basis, a polynomial basis that generates the smallest $n$-simplex
that encloses any given $n^\text{th}$-order polynomial curve. The results
obtained for $n=3$ show that, for any given $3^{\text{rd}}$-order polynomial
curve, the MINVO basis is able to obtain an enclosing simplex whose volume is
$2.36$ and $254.9$ times smaller than the ones obtained by the Bernstein and
B-Spline bases, respectively. When $n=7$, these ratios increase to $902.7$ and
$2.997\cdot10^{21}$, respectively.

long time and has applications in different areas of Mathematics and Computer
Science. One of the well-known measures to evaluate the uniformity of a given
distribution is Discrepancy, which assesses the difference between the Uniform
distribution and the empirical distribution given by putting mass points at the
points of the given set. While Discrepancy is very useful to measure
uniformity, it is computationally challenging to be calculated accurately. We
introduce the concept of directed Discrepancy based on which we have developed
an algorithm, called Directional Discrepancy, that can offer accurate
approximation for the cap Discrepancy of a finite set distributed on the unit
Sphere, $\mathbb{S}^2.$ We also analyze the time complexity of the Directional
Discrepancy algorithm precisely; and practically evaluate its capacity by
calculating the Cap Discrepancy of a specific distribution, Polar Coordinates,
which aims to distribute points uniformly on the Sphere.

GAMesh, which uses a mesh prior to generate a surface for the output points of
a point network. By projecting the output points onto this prior and
simplifying the resulting mesh, GAMesh ensures a surface with the same topology
as the mesh prior but whose geometric fidelity is controlled by the point
network. This makes GAMesh independent of both the density and distribution of
the output points, a common artifact in traditional surface reconstruction
algorithms. We show that such a separation of geometry from topology can have
several advantages especially in single-view shape prediction, fair evaluation
of point networks and reconstructing surfaces for networks which output sparse
point clouds. We further show that by training point networks with GAMesh, we
can directly optimize the vertex positions to generate adaptive meshes with
arbitrary topologies.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>You may remember our <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2020/04/24/ExpLR1/">previous blog post</a> showing that it is possible to do state-of-the-art deep learning with learning rate that increases exponentially during training.  It was meant to be a dramatic illustration that what we learned in optimization classes and books isn’t always a good fit for modern deep learning, specifically, <em>normalized nets</em>, which is our term for nets that use any one of popular normalization schemes,e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167">BatchNorm (BN)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08494">GroupNorm (GN)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07868">WeightNorm (WN)</a>. Today’s post (based upon <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02916">our paper</a> with Kaifeng Lyu at NeurIPS20)  identifies other surprising incompatibilities between normalized nets and traditional analyses. We hope this will change the way you teach and think about deep learning!</p>

<p>Before diving into the results, we recall that normalized nets  are typically trained with weight decay (aka $\ell_2$ regularization). Thus the $t$th iteration of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is:</p>

\[w_{t+1} \gets (1-\eta_t\lambda)w_t - \eta_t \nabla \mathcal{L}(w_t; \mathcal{B}_t),\]

<p>where $\lambda$ is the weight decay (WD) factor (or $\ell_2$-regularization coefficient),  $\eta_t$ the learning rate, $\mathcal{B}_t$ the batch, and $\nabla \mathcal{L}(w_t,\mathcal{B}_t)$ the batch gradient.</p>

<p>As sketched in our previous blog post, under fairly mild assumptions (namely, fixing the top layer during random initialization —which empirically does not hurt final accuracy) the loss function for training such normalized nets is <em>scale invariant</em>, which means $\mathcal{L}(w _ t; \mathcal{B}_ t)=\mathcal{L}(cw _ t; \mathcal{B} _ t)$, $\forall c&gt;0$.</p>

<p>A consequence of scale invariance is that the $ \nabla _ w \mathcal{L} \vert _ {w = w _ 0} = c \nabla _ w \mathcal{L}\vert _  {w = cw _ 0}$ and $\nabla ^ 2 _ w \mathcal{L} \vert _ {w = w _ 0} = c ^ 2 \nabla ^ 2 _ w \mathcal{L} \vert _  {w = cw _ 0}$, for any $c&gt;0$.</p>

<h2 id="some-conventional-wisdoms-cws">Some Conventional Wisdoms (CWs)</h2>

<p>Now we briefly describe some conventional wisdoms. Needless to say, by the end of this post these will turn out to be very very suspect! Possibly they were OK in earlier days of deep learning, and with shallower nets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CW 1) As we reduce LR to zero, optimization dynamic converges to a deterministic path (Gradient Flow) along which training loss strictly decreases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recall that in traditional explanation of (deterministic) gradient descent, if LR is smaller than roughly the inverse of the smoothness of the loss function, then each step reduces the loss. SGD, being stochastic, has a distribution over possible paths. But very tiny LR can be thought of as full-batch Gradient Descent (GD), which in the limit of infinitesimal step size approaches Gradient Flow (GF).</p>

<p>The above reasoning shows very small LR is guaranteed to decrease the loss at least, as well as any higher LR, can. Of course, in deep learning, we care not only about optimization but also generalization. Here small LR is believed to hurt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CW 2) To achieve the best generalization the LR must be large initially for quite a few epochs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is primarily an empirical finding: using too-small learning rates or too-large batch sizes from the start (all other hyper-parameters being fixed) is known to lead to worse generalization (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5533.pdf">Bengio, 2012</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836">Keskar et al., 2017</a>).</p>

<p>A popular explanation for this phenomenon is  that the noise in gradient estimation during SGD is beneficial for generalization. (As noted, this noise tends to average out when LR is very small.)  Many authors have suggested that the noise helps becauses it keeps the trajectory away from sharp minima which are believed to generalize worse, although there is some difference of opinion here (<a href="http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/older/3304.pdf">Hochreiter&amp;Schmidhuber, 1997</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836">Keskar et al., 2017</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913">Li et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407">Izmailov et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00744.pdf">He et al., 2019</a>). <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04595">Li et al., 2019</a> also gave an example (a simple two-layer net) where this observation of worse generalization due to small LR is mathematically proved and also experimentally verified.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CW 3) Modeling SGD via a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) in the continuous-time limit with a fixed Gaussian noise. Namely, think of SGD as a diffusion process that <strong>mixes</strong>  to some Gibbs-like distribution on trained nets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the usual approach to  formal understanding of CW 2 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06451">Smith&amp;Le, 2018</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11029">Chaudhari&amp;Soatto, 2018</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06977">Shi et al., 2020</a>). The idea is that SGD is gradient descent with a noise term, which has a continuous-time approximation as a diffusion process described as</p>

\[dW_t = - \eta_t \lambda W_t dt - \eta_t \nabla \mathcal{L}(W_t) dt + \eta_t \Sigma_{W_t}^{1/2} dB_t,\]

<p>where �$\sigma_{W_t}$ is the covariance of stochastic gradient $ \nabla \mathcal{L}(w_t; \mathcal{B}_t)$,  and $B_t$ denotes Brownian motion of the appropriate dimension. Several works have adopted this SDE view and given some rigorous analysis of the effect of noise.</p>

<p>In this story, SGD turns into a geometric random walk in the landscape, which can in principle explore the landscape more thoroughly, for instance by occasionally making loss-increasing steps. While an appealing view, rigorous analysis is difficult because we lack a mathematical description of the loss landscape.  Various papers assume the noise in SDE is isotropic Gaussian, and then derive an expression for the stationary distribution of the random walk in terms of the familiar Gibbs distribution. This view gives intuitively appealing explanation of some deep learning phenomena since the magnitude of noise (which is related to LR and batch size) controls the convergence speed and other properties. For instance it’s well-known that this SDE approximation implies the well-known <em>linear scaling rule</em> (Goyal et. al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf)).</p>

<p>Which raises the question: <em>does SGD really behave like a diffusion process that mixes in the loss landscape?</em></p>

<p>We now describe the actual discoveries for normalized nets, which show that the above CW’s are quite off.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Against CW1): Full batch gradient descent $\neq$ gradient flow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s well known that if LR is smaller than the inverse of the smoothness, then the trajectory of gradient descent will be close to that of gradient flow. But for normalized networks, the loss function is scale-invariant and thus provably non-smooth (i.e., smoothness becomes unbounded)  around the origin (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07454">Li&amp;Arora, 2019</a>). We show that this non-smoothness issue is very real and makes training unstable and even chaotic for full batch SGD with any nonzero learning rate. This occurs both empirically and provably so with some toy losses.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> WD makes GD on scale-invariant loss unstable and chaotic.
(a) Toy model with scale-invariant loss $L(x,y) = \frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2}$  (b)(c) Convergence never truly happens for  ResNet trained on sub-sampled
CIFAR10 containing 1000 images with full-batch GD (without momentum).  ResNet
can easily get to 100% training accuracy but then veers off.  When WD is turned off at epoch 30000 it converges.</p>

<p>Note that WD plays a crucial role in this effect since without WD the parameter norm increases monotonically 
 (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03981">Arora et al., 2018</a>) which implies SGD moves away from the origin at all times.</p>

<p>Savvy readers might wonder whether using a smaller LR could fix this issue. Unfortunately, getting close to the origin is unavoidable because once the gradient gets small,  WD will dominate the dynamics and decrease the norm at a geometric rate, causing the gradient to rise again due to the scale invariance! (This happens so long as the gradient gets arbitrarily small, but not actually zero, as is the case in practice.)</p>

<p>In fact, this is an excellent (and rare) place where early stopping is necessary even for correct optimization of the loss.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Against CW 2) Small LR can generalize equally well as large LR.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This actually was a prediction of the new theoretical analysis we came up with. We ran extensive experiments to test this prediction and found that initial large LR is <strong>not necessary</strong> to match the best performance, even when <em>all the other hyperparameters are fixed</em>. See Figure 2.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>. ResNet trained on CIFAR10 with SGD with normal LR schedule (baseline) as well as a schedule with 100 times smaller initial LR.  The latter matches performance of baseline after one more LR decay!  Note it needs  5000 epochs which is 10x higher! See our paper for details. (Batch size is 128, WD is 0.0005, and LR is divided by 10 for each decay.)</p>

<p>Note the  surprise here is that generalization was not hurt from drastically smaller LR even  <em>when no other hyperparameter changes</em>.  It is known empirically as well as rigorously (Lemma 2.4 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07454">Li&amp;Arora, 2019</a>)  that it is possible to compensate for small LR by other hyperparameter changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Against Wisdom 3) Random walk/SDE view of SGD is way off. There is no evidence of mixing as  traditionally understood, at least within normal training times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually the evidence against global mixing exists already via the phenomenon of Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407">Izmailov et al., 2018</a>). Along the trajectory of SGD, if  the network parameters from two different epochs are averaged, then the average has test loss lower than either.  Improvement via averaging continues to  work for run times 10X longer  than usual as shown in Figure 3. However, the accuracy improvement doesn’t happen for SWA between two solutions obtained from different initialization.  Thus checking whether SWA holds distinguishes between  pairs of solutions drawn from the same trajectory and pairs drawn from different trajectories, which  shows the diffusion process hasn’t mixed to stationary distribution within normal training times. (This is not surprising, since the theoretical analysis of mixing does not suggest it happens rapidly at all.)</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Figure 3</strong>. Stochastic Weight Averaging improves the test accuracy of ResNet trained with
SGD on CIFAR10. <strong>Left:</strong> Test accuracy. <strong>Right:</strong> Pairwise distance between parameters from different epochs.</p>

<p>Actually <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407">Izmailov et al., 2018</a> already noticed the implication that SWA rules out that SGD is a diffusion process which mixes to a unique global equilibrium. They suggested instead that perhaps the trajectory of SGD could be well-approximated by a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process around the <em>local minimizer</em> $W^ * $, assuming the loss surface is locally strongly convex. As the corresponding stationary is multi-dimensional Gaussian, $N(W^ *, \Sigma)$, around the local minimizer, $W^ *$, this explains why SWA helps to reduce the training loss.</p>

<p>However, we note that (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05407">Izmailov et al., 2018</a>)’s suggestion is also refuted by the fact that we can show $\ell_2$ distance between weights from epochs $T$ and $T+\Delta$ monotonically increases with $\Delta$ for every $T$ (See Figure 3), while $ \mathbf{E} [ | W_ T-W_ {T+\Delta} |^2]$ should converge to the constant $2Tr[\Sigma]$ as $T, \Delta \to +\infty$ in the OU process. This suggests that all these weights are correlated, unlike the hypothesized OU process.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-really-going-on">So what’s really going on?</h2>

<p>We develop a new theory (some parts rigorously proved and others supported by experiments) suggesting that <strong>LR doesn’t play the role assumed in most discussions.</strong></p>

<p>It’s widely believed that LR $\eta$ controls the convergence rate of SGD and affects the generalization via changing the magnitude of noise because LR $\eta$ adjusts the magnitude of gradient update per step. 
 
 However, for normalized networks trained with SGD + WD, the effect of LR is more subtle as now it has two roles: (1). the multiplier before the gradient of the loss. (2). the multiplier before WD. Intuitively, one imagines the WD part is  useless since the loss function is scale-invariant, and thus the first role must be more important. But surprisingly, this intuition is completely wrong and it turns out that the second role is way more important than the first one. 
Further analysis shows that a better measure of speed of learning is   $\eta \lambda$, which we call the <em>intrinsic learning rate</em> or <em>intrinsic LR</em>, denoted $\lambda_e$.</p>

<p>While previous papers have noticed qualitatively that LR and WD have a close interaction, our ExpLR paper   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07454">Li&amp;Arora, 2019</a>)  gave mathematical proof that <em>if WD* LR, i.e., $\lambda\eta$ is fixed, then the effect of changing LR on the dynamics is equivalent to rescaling the initial parameters</em>.  As far as we can tell, performance of SGD on modern architectures is quite robust to (indeed usually independent of) scale of the initialization, so the effect of changing initial LR while keeping intrinsic LR fixed is also negligible.</p>

<p>Our paper gives insight into the role of intrinsic LR $\lambda_e$ by giving a new SDE-style analysis of SGD for normalized nets, leading to the following conclusion (which rests in part on experiments):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In normalized nets SGD does indeed lead to rapid mixing, but in <strong>function space</strong> (i.e., input-output behavior of the net). Mixing happens after $O(1/\lambda_e)$ iterations, in contrast to the exponentially slow mixing guaranteed in the parameter space by traditional analysis of diffusion walks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To explain the meaning of mixing in function space, let’s view SGD (carried out for a fixed number of steps) as a way to sample a trained net from a  distribution over trained nets. Thus the end result of SGD from a fixed initialization can be viewed as a probabilistic classifier whose output on any datapoint is the $K$-dimenstional vector whose $i$th coordinate is the probability of outputting label $i$. (Here $K$ is the total number of labels.) Now if two different initializations both cause SGD to produce classifiers with error $5$ percent on heldout datapoints, then  <em>a priori</em> one would imagine that  on a given held-out datapoint the classifier from the first distribution <strong>disagrees</strong>  with the classifier from the second distribution with roughly $2 * 5 =10$ percent probability. (More precisely, $2 * 5 * (1-0.05) = 9.5$ percent.) However, convergence to an equilibrium distribution in function space means that the probability of disagreement is almost $0$, i.e., the distribution is almost the same regardless of the initialization! This is indeed what we experimentally find, to our big surprise. Our theory is built around this new phenomenon.</p>

<p>In the next post, we will explain our new theory and the partial new analysis of SDEs arising from SGD in normalized nets.</p></div>

<p>We often see people asking whether or not differential privacy might be overkill.  Why do we need strong privacy protections like differential privacy when we’re only releasing approximate, aggregate statistical information about a dataset?  Is it really possible to extract information about specific users from releasing these statistics?  The answer turns out to be a resounding yes!  The textbook by Dwork and Roth <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/privacybook.html">[DR14]</a> calls this phenomenon the Fundamental Law of Information Recovery:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Giving overly accurate answers to too many questions will inevitably destroy privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what exactly does this fundamental law mean precisely, and how can we prove it?  We can formalize and prove the law via <em>reconstruction attacks</em>, where an attacker can recover secret information from nearly every user in the dataset, simply by observing noisy answers to a modestly large number of (surprisingly simple) queries on the dataset. Reconstruction attacks were introduced in a seminal paper by Dinur and Nissim in 2003 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/773153.773173">[DN03]</a>.  Although this paper predates differential privacy by a few years, the discovery of reconstruction attacks directly led to the definition of differential privacy, and shaped a lot of the early research on the topic. We now know that differentially private algorithms can, in some cases, match the limitations on accuracy implied by reconstruction attacks. When this is the case, we have a remarkably sharp transition from a blatant privacy violation when the accuracy is high enough to enable a reconstruction attack, to the strong protection given by differential privacy at the cost of only slightly lower accuracy.</p>

<p>Aside from the theoretical importance of reconstruction attacks, one may wonder if they can be carried out in practice, or if the attack model is unrealistic and can be avoided with some simple workarounds?  In this series of posts, we argue that reconstruction attacks can be quite practical.  In particular, we describe successful attacks by some of this post’s authors on a family of systems called <em>Diffix</em>, that attempt to prevent reconstruction without introducing as much noise as the reconstruction attacks suggest is necessary. To the best of our knowledge, these attacks represent the first successful attempt to reconstruct data from a commercial statistical-database system that is specifically designed to protect the privacy of the underlying data.  A larger and much more significant demonstration of the practical power of reconstruction attacks was carried out by the US Census Bureau in 2018, motivating the Bureau’s adoption of differential privacy for data products derived from the 2020 decennial census <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&amp;id=3295691">[GAM18]</a>.</p>

<p>This series will come in two parts: In this post, we will review the theory of reconstruction attacks, and present a model for reconstruction attacks that corresponds more directly to real attacks than the one that is typically presented.  In the second post, we will describe attacks that were launched against various iterations of the <em>Diffix</em> system. \(

<h3 id="a-model-of-reconstruction-attacks">A Model of Reconstruction Attacks</h3>

<p>This part presents the basic theory of reconstruction attacks.  We’ll introduce a model of reconstruction attacks that is a little different from what you would see if you read the papers, and then describe the main results of Dinur and Nissim.  At the end we will briefly mention some variations that have been considered in the nearly two decades since.</p>

<p>Let us fix a dataset model, so that we can describe the attack precisely. (These attacks are very flexible and the ideas can usually be adapted to new models, as we’ll see at the end of this part.) We take the dataset to be a collection of \(\dsize\) records \(\ds = \{\elem_1,\dots,\elem_n\}\), each corresponding to the data of a single person.  The attacker’s goal is to learn some piece of secret information about as many individuals as possible, so we think of each record as having the form \(\elem_i = (\pbs_i,\sb_i)\) where \(\pbs_i\) is some identifying information, and \(\sb_i \in \zo\) is some secret. We assume that the secret is binary, although this aspect of the model can be generalized. We can visualize such a dataset as a matrix \([\pds \mid \sb]\) with two blocks as follows:
\[ \left[ \begin{array}{c|c} \pbs_1 &amp; \sb_1 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ \pbs_n &amp; \sb_n \end{array} \right] \]
For a concrete example, suppose each element in the dataset contains \(d\) binary attributes, and the attacker’s goal is to learn the last attribute of each user.  In this case we would write each element as a pair \((\pbs_i, \sb_i)\) where \(\pbs_i \in \zo^{d-1}\) and \(\sb_i \in \zo\).</p>

<p>Note that this distinction between \(\pbs_i\) and \(\sb_i\) is only in the mind of the attacker, who has some prior information about the users, but is trying to learn some specific secret information.  In order to make the attack simpler to describe, we will also assume that the attacker knows \(\pbs_1,\dots,\pbs_\dsize\), which is everything about the dataset except the secret bits, although this assumption can also be relaxed to a large extent. As a shorthand, we will refer to \(\pbs_1, \ldots, \pbs_\dsize\) as the prior information, and to \(\sb_1, \ldots,\sb_\dsize\) as the secret bits.</p>

<p>Our goal is to understand whether asking aggregate queries defined by the prior information can allow an attacker to learn non-trivial information about the secret bits.  Perhaps the most basic type of aggregate query we can ask is a <em>counting query</em>, which is a query that asks what number of the data points satisfy a given property. The Dinur-Nissim attacks assume that the attacker can get approximate answers to a type of counting queries that ask how many data points satisfy some property defined in terms of the prior information, and also have the sensitive bit set to \(1\).  Let us use the notation \(\pbsuni\) for the set of all possible values that the prior information can take. For the purposes of the attack, each query \(\query\) will be specified by a function \(\queryfunc \from \pbsuni \to \zo\) and have the specific form
\[
\query(\ds) = \sum_{j=1}^{\dsize} \queryfunc(\pbs_j) \cdot \sb_j.
\]
This is a good time to make one absolutely crucial point about this model, which is that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>all the users are treated completely symmetrically by the queries, and the attacker cannot issue a query that targets a specific user \(x_i\) by name or a specific subset of users.  The different users are distinguished only by their data.  Nonetheless, we will see how to learn information about specific users from the answers to these queries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Returning to our example with binary attributes, consider the very natural set of queries that asks for the inner product of the secret bits with each attribute in the prior information, which is a measure of the correlation between these two attributes.  Then each query takes the form \(\query_i(\ds) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} \pbs_{j,i} \cdot \sb_{j}\).</p>

<p>The nice thing about this type of query is that we can express the answers to a set of queries \({\query_1,\dots,\query_\qsize}\) defined by \(\queryfunc_1, \ldots, \queryfunc_\qsize\) as the following matrix-vector product \(\qmat_{\pds}\cdot \mat{b}\):
\[ \left[ \begin{array}{c}\query_1(\ds) \\ \vdots  \\ \query_\qsize(\ds) \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} \queryfunc_1(\pbs_1) &amp; \dots &amp; \queryfunc_1(\pbs_\dsize) \\ \vdots &amp;  \ddots  &amp; \vdots \\ \queryfunc_\qsize(\pbs_1) &amp;   \dots &amp; \queryfunc_k(\pbs_\dsize)  \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} \sb_1 \\ \vdots  \\ \sb_n  \end{array} \right]
\]
so we can study this model using tools from linear algebra.</p>

<h3 id="an-inefficient-attack">An Inefficient Attack</h3>

<p>Exact answers to such queries are clearly revealing, because, the attacker can use the predicates \[ \queryfunc_i(z) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \textrm{if } \pbs = \pbs_i  \\ 0 &amp;  \textrm{otherwise} \end{cases} \] to single out a specific user and receive their bit \(\sb_i\).  It is less obvious, however, that an attacker can learn a lot about the private bits even given noisy answers to the queries.</p>

<p>The first Dinur-Nissim attack shows that this is indeed possible—if the attacker can ask an unbounded number of counting queries, and each query is answered with, for example, 5% error, then the attacker can reconstruct 80% of the secret bits.  This attack requires exponentially many queries to run, making it somewhat impractical, but it is a proof of concept that an attack can reconstruct a large amount of private information even from very noisy statistics. Later we will see how to scale down the attack to use fewer queries at the cost of requiring more accurate answers.</p>

<p>The attack itself is quite simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For simplicity, assume all the \(\pbs_1, \ldots, \pbs_\dsize\) are distinct so that each user is uniquely identified by the prior information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attacker chooses the queries \(\query_1, \ldots, \query_\qsize\) so that the matrix \(\qmat_\pds\) has as its rows all of \(\zo^\dsize\). Namely, \(\qsize=2^\dsize\) and the functions \(\queryfunc_1, \ldots, \queryfunc_\qsize\) defining the queries take all possible values on \(\pbs_1, \ldots, \pbs_\dsize\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The attacker receives a vector \(\ans\) of noisy answers to the queries, where \( |\query_{i}(\ds) - \ans_{i}| &lt; \acc \dsize \) for each query \( \query_i \).  In matrix notation, this means \[ \max_{i = 1}^\qsize  |(\qmat_\pds\cdot {\sb})_i -\ans_i|= \| \qmat_\pds \cdot \sb -\ans\|_\infty  \leq \alpha \dsize. \]
  Note that, for \(\{0,1\}\)-valued queries, the answers range from \(0\) to \(\dsize\), so answers with additive error \(\pm 5\%\) corresponds to \(\acc = 0.05\).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, the attacker outputs any guess \(\hat{\sb} = (\hat{\sb}_{1}, \ldots, \hat{\sb}_{n})\) of the private bits vector that is consistent with the answers and the additive error bound \(\acc\). In other words, \(\hat{\sb}\) just needs to satisfy \[\max_{i = 1}^\qsize |\ans_i - (\qmat_\pds\cdot \hat{\sb})_i|= \| \qmat_\pds \cdot \hat\sb - a \|_{\infty} \leq \alpha \dsize \]
  Note that a solution always exists, since the true private bits \(\sb\) will do.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Our claim is that any such guess \(\hat{b}\) in fact agrees with the true private bits \(b\) for all but \(4\acc \dsize\) of the users. The reason is that if \(\hat{\sb}\) disagreed with more than \(4\acc \dsize\) of the secret bits, then the answer to some query would have eliminated \(\hat{\sb}\) from contention.  To see this, fix some \(\hat{\sb}\in \zo^\dsize\), and let \[ S_{01} = \{j: \hat{\sb}_j = 0,  \sb_j = 1\} \textrm{ and } S_{10} = \{j: \hat{\sb}_j = 1,  \sb_j = 0\}\] 
If \(\hat{\sb}\) and \(\sb\) disagree on more than \(4\acc \dsize\) bits, then at least one of these two sets has size larger than \(2\acc \dsize\). Let us assume that this set is \(S_{01}\), and we’ll deal with the other case by symmetry.  Suppose that the \(i\)-th row of \(\qmat_\pds\) is the indicator vector of \(S_{01}\), i.e., \[(\qmat_\pds)_{i,j} = 1 \iff j \in S_{01}.\] We then have
\[
|(\qmat_{\pds}\cdot {\sb})_i - (\qmat_{\pds}\cdot \hat{\sb})_i|= |S_{01}| &gt; 2 \acc \dsize,
\]
but, at the same time, if \(\hat{\sb}\) were output by the attacker, we would have
\[
|(\qmat_{\pds}\cdot {\sb})_i - (\qmat_{\pds}\cdot \hat{\sb})_i| \le |\ans_i - (\qmat_\pds\cdot \hat{\sb})_i| + |(\qmat_\pds \cdot \sb)_i - \ans_{i}| \le 2\acc \dsize, \]
which is a contradiction. An important point to note is that the attacker does not need to know the set \(S_{10}\), or the corresponding \(i\)-th row of \(\qmat_\pds\) and query \(\query_i\). Since the attacker asks all possible queries determined by the prior information, we can be sure \(\query_i\) is one of these queries, and an accurate answer to it rules out this particular bad choice of \(\hat{\sb}\).  To give you something concrete to cherish, we can summarize this discussion in the following theorem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/773153.773173">[DN03]</a>:</strong> There is a reconstruction attack that issues \(2^n\) queries to a dataset of \(n\) users, obtains answers with error \(\alpha n\), and reconstructs the secret bits of all but \(4 \alpha n\) users.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="an-efficient-attack">An Efficient Attack</h3>

<p>The exponential Dinur-Nissim attack is quite powerful, as it recovers 80% of the secret bits even from answers with 5% error, but it has the drawback that it requires asking \(2^\dsize\) queries to a dataset with \(\dsize\) users.  Note that this is inherent to some extent.  Suppose we randomly subsample 50% of the dataset and answer the queries using only this subset by rescaling appropriately.  Although this random subsampling does not guarantee any meaningful privacy, clearly no attacker can reconstruct 75% of the secret bits, since some of them are effectively deleted.  However, the guarantees of random sampling tell us that any set of \(\qsize\) queries will be answered with maximum error \( \acc n =  O(\sqrt{n \log \qsize})\), so we can answer \( 2^{\Omega(n)} \) queries with \(5\%\) error while provably preventing this sort of reconstruction.</p>

<p>However, Dinur and Nissim showed that if we obtain <em>highly accurate</em> answers—still noisy, but with error smaller than the sampling error—then we can reconstruct the dataset to high accuracy.  We can also make the reconstruction process computationally efficient by using linear programming to replace the exhaustive search over all \(2^\dsize\) possible vectors of secrets.  Specifically, we change the attack as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The attacker now chooses \(\qsize\) <em>randomly chosen</em> functions \( \varphi_i \from \pbsuni \to \{0,1\} \) for a much smaller \(\qsize = O(\dsize) \).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon receiving an answer vector \(\ans\), the attacker now searches for a <em>real-valued</em> \( \tilde{b} \in [0,1]^{\dsize} \) such that \( \| \ans - \qmat_\pds \cdot \tilde{b} \|_{\infty} \leq \acc n \).  Note that this vector can be found efficiently via linear programming.  The attacker then rounds each \( \tilde{b}_{i} \) to the nearest \( \hat{b}_{i} \in \{0,1\}\).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s now much trickier to analyze this attack and show that it achieves low reconstruction error, and we won’t go into details in this post.  However, the key idea is that, because the queries are chosen randomly, \( \qmat_\pds \) is a random matrix with entries in \( \{0,1\} \), and we can use the statistical properties of this random matrix to argue that, with high probability,
\[
\|\qmat_\pds \cdot \sb - \qmat_\pds \cdot \tilde{\sb}\|_\infty^2 \gtrsim |{i: \sb_i \neq \hat{\sb}_i}|.
\]
By the way we chose \(\tilde{\sb}\), we have 
\[
\|\qmat_\pds \cdot \sb - \qmat_\pds \cdot \tilde{\sb}\|_\infty \le \|\qmat_\pds \cdot \sb - \ans\|_\infty + \| \ans - \qmat_\pds \cdot \tilde{b} \|_{\infty} \leq 2\acc n,
\]
so, by combining the inequalities we get that the reconstruction error is about \( O(\alpha^2 n^2) \). Note that, in order to reconstruct 80% of the secret bits using this attack, we now need the error to be \( \alpha n  \ll \sqrt{n} \), but as long as this condition on the error is satisfied, we will have a highly accurate reconstruction.  Let’s add this theorem to your goodie bags:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Theorem <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/773153.773173">[DN03]</a>:</strong> There is an efficient reconstruction attack that issues \(O(n)\) random queries to a dataset of \(n\) users, obtains answer with error \(\alpha n\), and, with high probability, reconstructs the secret bits of all but \( O(\alpha^2 n^2)\) users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although we modeled the queries, and thus the matrix \(\qmat_\pds\) as uniformly random, it’s important to note that we really only relied on the fact that 
\[
\|\qmat_\pds \cdot \sb - \qmat_\pds \cdot \tilde{\sb}\|_\infty^2 \gtrsim
|\{i: \sb_i \neq \hat{\sb}_i\}|,
\]
and we can reconstruct while tolerating the same \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) error for any family of queries that gives rise to a matrix with this property.  Intuitively, any <em>random-enough</em> family of queries will have this property.  More specifically, the property is satisfied by any matrix with no small singular values <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-540-85174-5_26">[DY08]</a> or with large discrepancy <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5453">[MN12]</a>.  There is a large body of work showing that many specific families of queries lead to reconstruction. For example, we can perform reconstruction using <em>conjunction queries</em> that ask for the marginal distribution of small subsets of the attributes <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1806689.1806795">[KLSU10]</a>.  That is, queries of the form “count the number of people with blue eyes and brown hair and a birthday in August.”  In fairness, there are also families of queries that do not satisfy the property, or only satisfy quantitatively weaker versions of it, such as histograms and threshold queries, and for these queries it is indeed possible to achieve differential privacy with \( \ll \sqrt{n} \) error.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is going to be the end of our technical discussion, but before signing off, let’s mention some of the important extensions of this theorem that have been developed over the years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We can allow the secret information \(\sb\) to be integers or real numbers, rather than bits. The queries still return \(\qmat_\pds\cdot \sb\). The exponential attack then guarantees that, given answers with error \(\acc n\), the reconstruction \(\hat{\sb}\) satisfies \(\|\hat{\sb}-\sb\|_1 \le 4\acc n\). This means, for example, that the reconstructed secrets of all but \(4\alpha n\) users are within \(\pm 1\) of the true secrets. The efficient attack guarantees that \(\|\hat{\sb}-\sb\|_2^2 \le O(\acc^2 n^2)\), which means that the reconstructed secrets are within \(\pm 1\) for all but \(O(\acc^2 n^2)\) users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s not crucial that <em>every</em> query be answered with error \( \ll \sqrt{n} \).  If we are willing to settle 
  for an inefficient attack, then we can reconstruct even if only 51% of the queries have small error.  If at least 75% have small error, then we can reconstruct efficiently <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1250790.1250804">[DMT07]</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The reconstruction attacks still apply to the seemingly more general data model in which the private 
  dataset \(\ds\) is a subset of some arbitrary (but public) data universe \(\uni\).  To see this, note that we can take \(\uni = \{\pbs_1, \ldots, \pbs_\dsize\}\), and we can interpret the secret bits \(\sb_i\) to indicate whether \(\pbs_i\) is an element of \(\ds\). Then the reconstruction attacks allow us to determine, up to some error, which elements of \(\uni\) are contained in \(\ds\). In the setting, the attack is sometimes called <em>membership inference</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The fact that the efficient Dinur-Nissim reconstruction attack fails when the error is \( \gg \sqrt{n} \) 
  does not mean it’s easy to achieve privacy with error of that magnitude.  As we mentioned earlier, we can achieve non-trivial error guarantees for a large number of queries simply by using a random subsample of half of the dataset, which is not a private algorithm in any reasonable sense of the word, as it can reveal everything about the chosen subset.  As this example shows,</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>preventing reconstruction attacks does not mean preserving privacy.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In particular, there are membership-inference attacks that succeed in violating privacy even when the queries are answered with \( \gg \sqrt{n}\) error. We refer the reader to the survey <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/publications/exposed-survey-attacks-private-data">[DSSU17]</a> for a somewhat more in-depth survey of reconstruction and membership-inference attacks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many types of queries give rise to the conditions under which reconstruction is possible.  Stay tuned for our next post, where we show how to generate those types of queries in practice against a family of systems known as <em>Diffix</em> that are specifically designed to thwart reconstruction.</p></div>

set---describing a graph topology which is subject to discrete changes over
time. A $\Delta$-temporal matching $M$ is a set of time edges $(e,t)$ (an edge
$e$ paired up with a point in time $t$) such that for all distinct time edges
$(e,t),(e',t') \in M$ we have that $e$ and $e'$ do not share an endpoint, or
the time-labels $t$ and $t'$ are at least $\Delta$ time units apart. Mertzios
et al. [STACS~'20] provided a $2^{O(\Delta\nu)}\cdot |{\mathcal
G}|^{O(1)}$-time algorithm to compute the maximum size of $\Delta$-temporal
matching in a temporal graph $\mathcal G$, where $|\mathcal G|$ denotes the
size of $\mathcal G$, and $\nu$ is the $\Delta$-vertex cover number of
$\mathcal G$. The $\Delta$-vertex cover number is the minimum number of
vertices which are needed to hit (or cover) all edges in any $\Delta$
consecutive layers of the temporal graph. We show an improved algorithm to
compute a $\Delta$-temporal matching of maximum size with a running time of
$\Delta^{O(\nu)}\cdot |\mathcal G|$ and hence provide an exponential speedup in
terms of $\Delta$.

fundamental problem with many applications. As computations on dense graphs can
be prohibitively expensive, and it is preferable to perform the computations on
a sparse skeleton of the given graph that roughly preserves the shortest paths
information. Spanners and emulators serve this purpose. This paper develops
fast dynamic algorithms for sparse spanner and emulator maintenance and
provides evidence from fine-grained complexity that these algorithms are tight.
</p>
<p>Under the popular OMv conjecture, we show that there can be no decremental or
incremental algorithm that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge (purely additive)
$+n^{\delta}$-emulator for any $\delta&lt;1/2$ with arbitrary polynomial
preprocessing time and total update time $m^{1+o(1)}$. Also, under the
Combinatorial $k$-Clique hypothesis, any fully dynamic combinatorial algorithm
that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge $(1+\epsilon,n^{o(1)})$-spanner or emulator
must either have preprocessing time $mn^{1-o(1)}$ or amortized update time
$m^{1-o(1)}$. Both of our conditional lower bounds are tight.
</p>
<p>As the above fully dynamic lower bound only applies to combinatorial
algorithms, we also develop an algebraic spanner algorithm that improves over
the $m^{1-o(1)}$ update time for dense graphs. For any constant $\epsilon\in
(0,1]$, there is a fully dynamic algorithm with worst-case update time
$O(n^{1.529})$ that whp maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge
$(1+\epsilon,n^{o(1)})$-spanner.
</p>
<p>Our new algebraic techniques and spanner algorithms allow us to also obtain
(1) a new fully dynamic algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) with
update and path query time $O(n^{1.9})$; (2) a fully dynamic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate APSP algorithm with update time $O(n^{1.529})$; (3)
a fully dynamic algorithm for near-$2$-approximate Steiner tree maintenance.

communities of practice. The digital revolution enabled by AI and Data is
bringing ethical wicked problems in the crossroads of technology and behavior.
However, the need of a comprehensive and constructive ethical framework is
emerging as digital platforms connect us globally. The unequal structure of the
global system makes that dynamic changes and systemic problems impact more on
those that are most vulnerable. Ethical frameworks based only on the
individual-level are not longer sufficient. A new ethical vision must comprise
the understanding of the scales and complex interconnections of social systems.
Many of these systems are internally fragile and very sensitive to external
factors and threats, which turns into unethical situations that require
systemic solutions. The high scale nature of digital technology that expands
globally has also an impact at the individual level having the risk to make
humans beings more homogeneous, predictable and ultimately controllable. To
preserve the core of humanity ethic must take a stand to preserve and keep
promoting individual rights and uniqueness and cultural heterogeneity tackling
the negative trends and impact of digitalization. Only combining human-centered
and collectiveness-oriented digital development it will be possible to
construct new social models and human-machine interactions that are ethical.
This vision requires science to enhance ethical frameworks and principles with
the actionable insights of relationships and properties of the social systems
that may not be evident and need to be quantified and understood to be solved.
Artificial Intelligence is both a risk and and opportunity for an ethical
development, thus we need a conceptual construct that drives towards a better
digitalizated world.

Traditional
graph algorithms tuned for 32- or 64-bit based memory accesses will be
inefficient on architectures with 512-bit wide (or larger) instruction units
that are already present in the Intel Knights Landing (KNL) manycore CPU.
Anticipating this shift, we propose SlimSell: a vectorizable graph
representation to accelerate Breadth-First Search (BFS) based on sparse-matrix
dense-vector (SpMV) products. SlimSell extends and combines the
state-of-the-art SIMD-friendly Sell-C-sigma matrix storage format with
tropical, real, boolean, and sel-max semiring operations. The resulting design
reduces the necessary storage (by up to 50%) and thus pressure on the memory
subsystem. We augment SlimSell with the SlimWork and SlimChunk schemes that
reduce the amount of work and improve load balance, further accelerating BFS.
We evaluate all the schemes on Intel Haswell multicore CPUs, the
state-of-the-art Intel Xeon Phi KNL manycore CPUs, and NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. Our
experiments indicate which semiring offers highest speedups for BFS and
illustrate that SlimSell accelerates a tuned Graph500 BFS code by up to 33%.
This work shows that vectorization can secure high-performance in BFS based on
SpMV products; the proposed principles and designs can be extended to other
graph algorithms.

elements, where each element is described with a $k$-bit comparison-key and a
$w$-bit payload. A long-standing open problem is whether there exist $(k + w)
\cdot o(n \log n)$-sized boolean circuits for sorting. We show that one can
overcome the $n\log n$ barrier when the keys to be sorted are short.
Specifically, we prove that there is a circuit with $(k + w) \cdot O(n k) \cdot
\poly(\log^*n - \log^* (w + k))$ boolean gates capable of sorting any input
array containing $n$ elements, each described with a $k$-bit key and a $w$-bit
payload. Therefore, if the keys to be sorted are short, say, $k &lt; o(\log n)$,
our result is asymptotically better than the classical AKS sorting network
(ignoring $\poly\log^*$ terms); and we also overcome the $n \log n$ barrier in
such cases. Such a result might be surprising initially because it is long
known that comparator-based techniques must incur $\Omega(n \log n)$ comparator
gates even when the keys to be sorted are only $1$-bit long (e.g., see Knuth's
"Art of Programming" textbook). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
to achieve non-trivial results for sorting circuits using non-comparison-based
techniques. We also show that if the Li-Li network coding conjecture is true,
our upper bound is optimal, barring $\poly\log^*$ terms, for every $k$ as long
as $k = O(\log n)$.

(FAA) are ubiquitous in parallel programming. Yet, performance tradeoffs
between these operations and various characteristics of such systems, such as
the structure of caches, are unclear and have not been thoroughly analyzed. In
this paper we establish an evaluation methodology, develop a performance model,
and present a set of detailed benchmarks for latency and bandwidth of different
atomics. We consider various state-of-the-art x86 architectures: Intel Haswell,
Xeon Phi, Ivy Bridge, and AMD Bulldozer. The results unveil surprising
performance relationships between the considered atomics and architectural
properties such as the coherence state of the accessed cache lines. One key
finding is that all the tested atomics have comparable latency and bandwidth
even if they are characterized by different consensus numbers. Another insight
is that the hardware implementation of atomics prevents any instruction-level
parallelism even if there are no dependencies between the issued operations.
Finally, we discuss solutions to the discovered performance issues in the
analyzed architectures. Our analysis enables simpler and more effective
parallel programming and accelerates data processing on various architectures
deployed in both off-the-shelf machines and large compute systems.

<p>1) For two-player games, we show that the regret of optimistic Hedge decays

Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo and Schapire (NIPS'15)

better than $\tilde{\Omega}(1/ \sqrt{T})$, addressing an open question posted
in Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo and Schapire (NIPS'15).
</p>
<p>For general m-player games, we show that the swap regret of each player
decays at rate $\tilde{O}(m^{1/2} (n/T)^{3/4})$ when they combine optimistic
Hedge with the classical external-to-internal reduction of Blum and Mansour
(JMLR'07). The algorithm can also be modified to achieve the same rate against
itself and a rate of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n/T})$ against adversaries. Via standard
connections, our upper bounds also imply faster convergence to coarse
correlated equilibria in two-player games and to correlated equilibria in
multiplayer games.

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">stable matching problem</a> takes as input the preferences from two groups of agents (most famously medical students and supervisors of internships), and pairs up agents from each group in a way that encourages everyone to play along: no pair of agents would rather go their own way together than take the pairings they were both given. A solution can always be found by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm">Gale–Shapley algorithm</a>, but there are generally many solutions, described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_of_stable_matchings">lattice of stable matchings</a>. Some pairs of agents are included in at least one stable matching, while some other pairs are never matched. In this way, each instance of stable matchings gives rise to a graph, the <em>graph of stably matchable pairs</em>. This graph is the subject and title of my latest preprint, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09230">arXiv:2010.09230</a>, which asks: Which graphs can arise this way? How hard is it to recognize these graphs, and infer a stable matching instance that might have generated them? How does the graph structure relate to the lattice structure?</p>

<p>For some answers, see the preprint. One detail is connected to <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/10/18/polyhedra-without-disjoint.html">my previous post, on polyhedra with no two disjoint faces</a> (even though there are no polyhedra in the new preprint): the (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free graphs discussed there come up in proving an equivalence between outerplanar graphs of stably matchable pairs and lattices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_problem">closures</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytree">oriented trees</a>. Instead of providing any technical details of any the other results in the paper, though, I thought it would be more fun to show a few visual highlights.</p>

<p>The following figure shows a cute mirror-inversion trick (probably already known, although I don’t know where or by whom) for embedding an arbitrary bipartite graph as an induced subgraph of a regular bipartite graph. I use it to show that graphs of stably matchable pairs have no forbidden induced subgraphs:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="60%" alt="Embedding a bipartite graph as an induced subgraph of a regular bipartite graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/regularize.svg" /></p>

<p>This next one depicts a combinatorial description of a stable matching instance having a \(6\times 5\) grid as its graph, in terms of the top and bottom matchings in the lattice of matchings, the “rotations” that can be used to move between matchings in this lattice, and a partial order on the rotations. For what I was doing in this paper, these rotation systems were much more convenient to work with than preferences.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="80%" alt="Rotation system describing a system of stable matchings having a 6x5 grid as its graph" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/5x6.svg" /></p>

<p>All the main ideas for a proof of NP-completeness of recognizing these graphs, by reduction from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-all-equal_3-satisfiability">not-all-equal 3-satisfiability</a>, are visible in the next picture. The proof now in the paper is significantly more complicated, though, because the construction in this image produces nonplanar graphs but I wanted a proof that would also apply in the planar case.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/nae3sat-to-matching.svg" alt="NP-completeness reduction from NAE3SAT to recognizing graphs of stably matchable pairs" /></p>

<p>The last one shows a sparse graph that can be represented as a graph of stably-matching pairs (because it’s outerplanar, bipartite, and biconnected) but has a high-degree vertex. If we tried to test whether it could be realized by doing a brute-force search over preference systems, the time would be factorial in the degree, but my preprint provides faster algorithms that are only singly exponential in the number of edges.</p>

<p> Since I was born on Oct 1, 1960 (that's not true---if I posted  my real birthday I might get my  identity stolen), I will do a nature vs nurture post based on my life, which seems less likely to offend then doing it on someone else's life. I'll just rattle off some random points on Nature vs Nurture.</p><p>1) Is it plausible that I was born with some math talent? Is plausible that I was born with some talent to understand the polynomial van der Warden theorem? What is the granularity of nature-given or nurture-given abilities?</p><p>2) My dad was a HS English teacher and later Vice-Principal. My mom taught English at a Community college. Readers of the blog might think, given my spelling and grammar, that I was switched at birth. My mom says (jokingly?) that I was switched at birth since she thinks I am good at math.</p><p>a) I am not THAT good at math. Also see next point.</p><p>b) While there are some math families, there are not many. See my post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/02/baseball-families-and-math-families.html">here</a>.</p><p>c) I think being raised in an intellectual atmosphere by two EDUCATORS who had the money to send me to college and allowed me the freedom to study what I wanted to  is far more important than the rather incidental matter of what field I studied.</p><p>d) Since my parents never went into math or the sciences it is very hard to tell  if they were `good at math' or even what that means.</p><p>3) There were early signs I was INTERESTED in math, though not that I was good at it.</p><p>a) In fourth grade I wanted to know how many SECONDS were in a century so I spend some time figuring it out on paper. Did I get the right answer?  I forgot about leap years.</p><p>b) I was either a beneficiary of, or a victim of, THE NEW MATH. So I learned about comm. and assoc. operations in 8th grade. We were asked to come up with our own operations. I wanted to come up with an operation that was comm. but not assoc. I did! Today I would write it as f(x,y) = |x-y|. This is the earliest I can think of where I made up a nice math problem. Might have been the last time I made up a nice math problem AND solved it without help. </p><p>c) In 10th grade I took some Martin Gardner books out of the library. The first theorem I learned not-in-school was that a graph is Eulerian iff every vertex has even degree. I read the chapter on Soma cubes and bought a set. (Soma cubes are explained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube">here</a>.) </p><p>d) I had a talent (nature?) at Soma Cubes.  I did every puzzle in the book in a week, diagrammed them, and even understood (on some level) the proofs that some could not be done. Oddly I am NOT good at 3-dim geom. Or even 2-dim geom.  For 1-dim I hold my own!</p><p>e) Throughout my childhood I noticed odd logic and odd math things that were said: </p><p>``Here at WCOZ (a radio station) we have an AXIOM, that's like a saying man, that weekends should be SEVEN DAYS LONG'' (Unless that axiom resolves CH, I don't think it should be assumed.) </p><p>``To PROVE we have the lowest prices in town we will give you a free camera!'' (how does that prove anything?) </p><p>``This margarine tastes JUST LIKE BUTTER'' (Okay-- so why not just buy butter?)</p><p>e) In 9th grade when I learned the quadratic formula I re-derived it once-a-month since I though it was important that one can prove such things.  I heard (not sure from where) that there was no 5th degree equation. At that very moment I told my parents:</p><p><i>I am going to major in math so I can find out why there is no 5th degree equation.</i></p><p>There are worse things for parents to hear from their children. See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/a-proof-that-227-pi-0-and-more.html">here</a> for dad's reaction. </p><p>f) When I learned that the earth's orbit around the sun is an ellipse and that the earth was one of the foci, I wondered where the other foci is and if its important. I still wonder about this one. Google has not helped me here, though perhaps I have not phrased the question properly. If you know the answer please leave a comment. </p><p>g) I also thought about The Ketchup problem and other problems, that I won't go into since I already blogged about them  <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/06/ketchup-problem.html">here</a></p><p>4) I was on the math team in high school, but wasn't very good at it. I WAS good at making up math team problems. I am now on the committee that makes up the Univ of MD HS math competition. I am still not good at solving the problems but good at making them up. </p><p>5) From 9th grade on before I would study for an exam by making up what I thought would be a good exam and doing that. Often my exam was a better test of knowledge than the exam given. In college I helped people in Math and Physics by making up exams for them to work on as practice. </p><p>6) I was good at reading, understanding, and explaining papers. </p><p>7) I was never shy about asking for help. My curiosity exeeded by ego... by a lot!</p><p>8) Note that items 5,6, and 7 above do not mention SOLVING problems. The papers I have written are of three (overlapping) types:</p><p>a) I come up with the problem, make some inroads on it based on knowledge, and then have people cleverer (this is often) or with more knowledge (this is rarer) help me solve the problems.</p><p>b) I come up with the problem, and combine two things I know from other papers to solve it. </p><p>c) Someone else asks for my help on something and I have the knowledge needed. I can only recall one time where this lead to a paper. </p><p>NOTE- I do not think I have ever had a clever or new technique. CAVEAT: the diff between combining  known knowledge in new ways and having a clever or new technique is murky. </p><p>8) Over time these strengths and weaknesses have gotten more extreme. It has become a self-fulfilling prophecy where I spend A LOT of time making up problems without asking for help, but when I am trying to solve a problem I early on ask for help. Earlier than I should? Hard to know. </p><p>9) One aspect is `how good am I at math' But a diff angle is that I like to work on things that I KNOW are going to work out, so reading an article is better than trying to create new work. This could be a psychological thing. But is that nature or nurture?  </p><p>10) Could I be a better problem solver? Probably. Could I be a MUCH better problem solver? NO. Could I have been a better problem solver  I did more work on that angle when I was younger? Who knows? </p><p>11) Back to the Quintic: I had the following thought in ninth grade, though I could not possibly have expressed it: The question of, given a problem, how hard is it, upper and lower bounds, is a fundamental one that is worth a lifetime of study. As such my interest in complexity theory and recursion theory goes back to ninth grade or even further. My interest in Ramsey Theory for its own sake (and not in the service of complexity theory) is much more recent and does not quite fit into my narrative. But HEY- real life does not have as well defined narratives as fiction does. </p><p>12) Timing and Luck: IF I had been in grad student at a slight diff time I can imagine doing work on  algorithmic  Galois theory. <a href="https://singer.math.ncsu.edu/Algorithmic_slides.pdf">Here</a>  is a talk on Algorithmic  Galois theory. Note that one of the earliest results is by Landau and Miller from 1985---I had a course from Miller on Alg. Group Theory in 1982. This is NOT a wistful `What might have been' thought. Maybe I would have sucked at it, so its just as well I ended up doing recursion theory, then Ramsey theory, then recursion-theoretic Ramsey Theory, then muffins. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><div><br /></div></div>

<p>A central <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/">puzzle</a> of deep learning is the question of <em>generalization</em>. In other words, what can we deduce from the <em>training performance</em> of a neural network about its <em>test performance</em> on <em>fresh unseen examples</em>. An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530">influential paper</a> of Zhang, Bengio, Hardt, Recht, and Vinyals showed that the answer could be “nothing at all.” </p>



<p>Zhang et al. gave examples where modern deep neural networks achieve 100% accuracy on classifying their training data, but their performance on unseen data may be no better than chance. Therefore we cannot give meaningful guarantees for deep learning using traditional “generalization bounds” that bound the difference between test and train performance by some quantity that tends to zero as the number of datapoints <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> increases. This is why (to quote their title), Zhang et al. claimed that <strong>“understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization”</strong>.</p>



<p>But what if the issue isn’t that we’ve been doing generalization bounds wrong, but rather that we’ve been doing deep learning (or more accurately, supervised deep learning) wrong?</p>



<h3>Self Supervised + Simple fit (SSS) learning</h3>



<p>To explain what we mean, let’s take a small detour to contrast “traditional” or “end-to-end” supervised learning with a different approach to supervised learning, which we’ll call here “Self-Supervised + Simple fit” or “SSS algorithms.” (While the name “SSS algorithms” is new, the approach itself has a <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/FKI-126-90_%28revised%29bw_ocr.pdf">long history</a> and has recently been used with great success in practice; our work gives no new methods—only new analysis.)</p>



<p>The classical or “end-to-end” approach for supervised learning can be phrased as <em>“ask and you shall receive”</em>. Given labeled data, you ask (i.e., run an optimizer) for a complex classifier (e.g., a deep neural net) that fits the data (i.e., outputs the given labels on the given data points) and hope that it will be successful on future, unseen, data points as well. End-to-end supervised learning achieves state-of-art results for many classification problems, particularly for computer vision datasets ImageNet and CIFAR-10.</p>



<p>However, end-to-end learning does not directly correspond to the way humans learn to recognize objects (see also <a href="https://youtu.be/7I0Qt7GALVk?t=2475">this talk of LeCun</a>). A baby may see millions of images in the first year of her life, but most of them do not come with explicit labels. After seeing those images, a baby can make future classifications using very few labeled examples. For example, it might be enough to show her once what is a dog and what is a cat for her to correctly classify future dogs and cats, even if they look quite different from these examples.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LXRaTQq.png" alt="End-to-end learning vs SSS algorithms." /><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Cartoon of end-to-end vs SSS learning </figure>



<p>In recent years, practitioners have proposed algorithms that are more similar to human learning than supervised learning. Such methods separate the process into two stages. In the <em>first stage</em>, we do <strong>representation learning</strong> whereby we use <em>unlabeled</em> data to learn a <em>representation</em>: a complex map (e.g., a deep neural net) mapping the inputs into some “representation space.” In the <em>second stage</em>, we fit a simple classifier (e.g., a linear threshold function) to the representation of the datapoints and the given labels. We call such algorithms <strong>“Self-Supervision + Simple fit”</strong> or <strong>SSS algorithms</strong>. (Note that, unlike other representation-learning based classifiers, the complex representation is “frozen” and not “fine-tuned” in the second stage, where only a simple classifier is used on top of it.)</p>



<p>While we don’t have a formal definition, a “good representation” should make downstream tasks easier, in the sense of allowing for fewer examples or simpler classifiers. We typically learn a representation via <strong>self supervision</strong> , whereby one finds a representation minimizing an objective function that intuitively requires some “insight” into the data. Approaches for self-supervision include reconstruction, where the objective involves recovering data points from partial information (e.g., recover missing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">words</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07379">pixels</a>), and <em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709">contrastive learning</a></em>, where the objective is to find a representation that make similar points close and dissimilar points far (e.g., in Euclidean space).</p>



<p>SSS algorithms have been traditionally used in natural language processing, where unlabeled data is plentiful, but labeled data for a particular task is often scarce. But recently SSS algorithms were also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06162">used with great success</a> even for vision tasks such as ImageNet and CIFAR10 where <em>all data is labeled!</em> While SSS algorithms do not yet beat the state-of-art supervised learning algorithms, they do get <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10029">pretty close</a>. SSS algorithms also have other practical advantages over “end-to-end supervised learning”: they can make use of unlabeled data, the representation could be useful for non-classification tasks, and may have improved out of distribution performance. There has also been recent theoretical analysis of contrastive and reconstruction learning under certain statistical assumptions (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">Arora et al</a> and  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01064">Lee et al</a>).</p>



<h3>The generalization gap of SSS algorithms</h3>



<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508">a recent paper</a>, we show that SSS algorithms not only work in practice, but work in theory too.</p>



<p>Specifically, we show that such algorithms have <strong>(1)</strong> small generalization gap and <strong>(2)</strong> we can <strong>prove</strong> (under reasonable assumptions) that their generalization gap tends to zero with the number of samples, with bounds that are meaningful for many modern classifiers on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We consider the setting where all data is labeled, and the <em>same dataset</em> is used for both learning the representation and fitting a simple classifier. The resulting classifier includes the overparameterized representation, and so we cannot simply apply “off the shelf” generalization bounds. Indeed, a priori it’s not at all clear that the generalization gap for SSS algorithms should be small.</p>



<p>To get some intuition for the generalization gap of SSS algorithms, consider the experiment where we inject some <em>label noise</em> into our distribution. That is, we corrupt an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta" class="latex" title="\eta" /> fraction of the labels in both the train and test set, replacing them with random labels. Already in the noiseless case (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D0&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta=0" class="latex" title="\eta=0" />), the generalization gap of SSS algorithms is noticeably smaller than that of end-to-end supervised learning. As we increase the noise, the difference becomes starker. End-to-end supervised learning algorithms can always achieve 100% training accuracy, even as the test accuracy deteriorates, since they can “memorize” all the training labels they are given. In contrast, for SSS algorithms, both training and testing accuracy decrease together as we increase the noise, with training accuracy correlating with test performance. </p>

<p></p>



<p>Our main theoretical result is a formal proof of the above statement. To do so, we consider training with a small amount of label noise (say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D5%5C%25&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta=5\%" class="latex" title="\eta=5\%" />) and define the following quantities:</p>



<ul><li>The <strong>robustness gap</strong> is the amount by which training accuracy degrades between the “clean” (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D0&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta=0" class="latex" title="\eta=0" />) experiment and the noisy one. (In this and all other quantities, the training accuracy is measured with respect to the original uncorrupted labels.)</li><li>The <strong>memorization gap</strong> considers the noisy experiment (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ceta%3D5%5C%25&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\eta=5\%" class="latex" title="\eta=5\%" />) and measures the amount by which performance on the corrupted data samples (where we received the wrong label) is worse than performance on the overall training set. If the algorithm can memorize all given labels, it will be perfectly wrong on the corrupted data samples, leading to a large memorization gap.</li><li>The <strong>rationality gap</strong> is the difference between the performance on the corrupted data samples and performance on unseen test examples. For example, if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> is an image of a dog, then it measures the difference between the probability that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3D%5Ctext%7B%22dog%22%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}" class="latex" title="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}" /> when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2C%5Ctext%7B%22cat%22%7D%29&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(x,\text{&quot;cat&quot;})" class="latex" title="(x,\text{&quot;cat&quot;})" /> is in the training set and the probability that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f%28x%29%3D%5Ctext%7B%22dog%22%7D&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}" class="latex" title="f(x)=\text{&quot;dog&quot;}" /> when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="x" class="latex" title="x" /> is not in the training set at all. Since intuitively, getting the wrong label should be worse than getting no label at all, we typically expect the rationality gap to be around zero or negative. Formally we define the rationality gap to the maximum between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=0&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="0" class="latex" title="0" /> and the difference above, so it is always non-negative. We think of an algorithm with a significant positive rationality gap as “irrational.”</li></ul>



<p>By summing up the quantities above, we get the following inequality, which we call the <strong>RRM bound</strong></p>



<p><em><span style="color: #0693e3;" class="has-inline-color">generalization gap</span></em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleq&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\leq" class="latex" title="\leq" /> <em><span style="color: #00d084;" class="has-inline-color">robustness gap</span></em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" title="+" /> <em><span style="color: #fcb900;" class="has-inline-color">rationality gap</span></em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B&amp;bg=eeeeee&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="+" class="latex" title="+" /> <em><span style="color: #cf2e2e;" class="has-inline-color">memorization gap</span></em></p>



<p>In practice, the <strong>robustness</strong> and <strong>rationality</strong> gaps are always small, both for end-to-end supervised algorithms (which have a large generalization gap), and for SSS algorithms (which have a small generalization gap). Thus the main contribution to the generalization gap comes from the <strong>memorization gap</strong>. Roughly speaking, our main result is the following:</p>



<p><em>If the complexity of the second-stage classifier of an SSS algorithm is smaller than the number of samples then the generalization gap is small.</em></p>



<p>See the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08508">paper</a> for the precise definition of “complexity,” but it is bounded by the number of bits that it takes to describe the simple classifier (no matter how complex is the representation used in the first stage). Our bound yields non-vacuous results in various practical settings; see the figures below or their <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/yaminibansal/streamlit-apps/main/figure1.py" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interactive version</a>. </p>

Because of limited computational resources, we only evaluated the theoretical bound for two models in this dataset.</figure>



<h3>What’s next</h3>



<p>There are still many open questions. Can we prove rigorous bounds on robustness and rationality? We have some preliminary results in the paper, but there is much room for improvement. Similarly, our complexity-based upper bound is far from tight at the moment, though the RRM bound itself is often surprisingly tight. Our work only applies to SSS algorithms, but people have the intuition that even end-to-end supervised learning algorithms implicitly learn a representation. So perhaps these tools can apply to such algorithms as well. As mentioned, we don’t yet have formal definitions for “good representations,” and the choice of the self-supervision task is still somewhat of a “black art” – can we find a more principled approach?</p></div>

<p>Some research I’ve been doing led me to consider the (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free graphs. It’s not always easy to go from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_graph_characterization">forbidden minors</a> to the graphs that forbid them, or vice versa, but in this case I think there’s a nice characterization, which I’m posting here because it doesn’t fit into the research writeup: these are the graphs whose nontrivial triconnected components are \(K_5\), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_graph">wheel graphs</a>, or the graph \(K_5-e\) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_bipyramid">triangular bipyramid</a>. The illustration below shows an example of a graph with this structure, with its nontrivial triconnected components colored red and yellow. There’s a simpler and more geometric way to say almost the same thing: the only convex polyhedra that do not have two vertex-disjoint faces are the pyramids and the triangular bipyramid.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/prism-k33-free.svg" alt="A (prism, K_{3,3})-minor-free graph, with its nontrivial triconnected components colored red and yellow" /></p>

<p>Some definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Here by the prism graph I mean the graph of the triangular prism. Any other prism has this one as a minor, and so is irrelevant as a forbidden minor. However, the pyramids in this structure can have any polygon as their base, corresponding to wheel graphs with arbitrarily many vertices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>\(K_{3,3}\) is a complete bipartite graph with three vertices on each side of its bipartition, famous as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_utilities_problem">utility graph</a>, one of the two forbidden minors for planar graphs. The triangular prism graph and \(K_{3,3}\) are the only two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_graph">3-regular graphs</a> with six vertices.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/prism-k33.svg" alt="The prism graph and K_{3,3}" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The triconnected components of a graph are the graphs associated with the nodes of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR_tree">SPQR tree</a>, or of the SPQR trees of its biconnected components. These are cycle graphs, dipole multigraphs, or 3-connected graphs, and by “nontrivial” I mean the ones that are not cycles or dipoles. A triconnected component might not be a subgraph of the given graph, because it can have additional edges that correspond to paths in the given graph. For instance, subdividing the edges of any graph into paths, or more generally replacing edges by arbitrary series-parallel graphs, does not change its set of nontrivial triconnected components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m using “face” in the usual three-dimensional meaning, a two-dimensional subset of the boundary of the polyhedron. For higher-dimensional polytopes, “face” has a different meaning that also includes vertices and edges, and “facet” would be used to refer to the \((d-1)\)-dimensional faces, but using that terminology seems overly pedantic here.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sketch of proof of the characterization of polyhedra without two disjoint faces: Consider any polyhedron without disjoint faces. If one face shares an edge with all the others, it’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halin_graph">Halin graph</a>, a graph formed by linking the leaves of a tree into a cycle; if the tree is a star, it’s a pyramid, and otherwise contracting all but one of the interior edges of the tree, and then all but four of the cycle edges, will produce a prism minor. In the remaining case, some two faces share only a vertex \(v\), which must have degree four or more. Each face that is disjoint from \(v\) must touch all that faces incident to \(v\), which can only happen when there is one face disjoint from \(v\) (a pyramid) or two faces disjoint from \(v\), neither of which has an edge disjoint from the other one (a bipyramid).</p>

<p>Sketch of a lemma that every convex polyhedron with two disjoint faces has a prism minor: glue a pyramidal cap into each of the two faces, producing a larger convex polyhedron which by either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinitz%27s_theorem">Steinitz’s theorem</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinski%27s_theorem">Balinski’s theorem</a> is necessarily 3-connected, and find three vertex-disjoint paths between the apexes of the attached pyramids. The parts of these paths outside the two glued pyramids, together with the boundaries of the two faces, form a subdivision of a prism.</p>

<p>Sketch of proof of the characterization of (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free graphs: The nontrivial triconnected components are exactly the maximal triconnected minors of the given graph, so if either of the two triconnected forbidden minors is to be found in the given graph, it will be found in one of the triconnected components. \(K_5\) and the triangular bipyramid are too small to have one of the forbidden minors. The only 3-connected minors of the pyramid graphs are smaller pyramids, obtained by contracting one of the cycle edges of the pyramid, so these also do not have a forbidden minor. Therefore the graphs of the stated form are all (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free.</p>

<p>In the other direction, suppose that a graph is (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free.
Each triconnected component is a minor, so it must also be (prism,\(K_{3,3}\))-minor-free. What can these components look like? Forbidding \(K_{3,3}\) as a minor rules out nonplanar components other than \(K_5\), by a theorem of Wagner<sup id="fnref:wagner"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/10/18/polyhedra-without-disjoint.html#fn:wagner" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and Hall.<sup id="fnref:hall"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2020/10/18/polyhedra-without-disjoint.html#fn:hall" class="footnote">2</a></sup> So the remaining components that we need to consider are triconnected planar graphs with no prism minor. These cannot have two disjoint faces by the lemma, and so they can only be pyramids or the triangular bipyramid.</p>

Let $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ be a boolean function, and let $f_\land (x, y) = f(x \land y)$ denote the AND-function of $f$, where $x \land y$ denotes bit-wise AND. We study the deterministic communication complexity of $f_\land$ and show that, up to a $\log n$ factor, it is bounded by a polynomial in the logarithm of the real rank of the communication matrix of $f_\land$. This comes within a $\log n$ factor of establishing the log-rank conjecture for AND-functions with no assumptions on $f$. Our result stands in contrast with previous results on special cases of the log-rank 
conjecture, which needed significant restrictions on $f$ such as monotonicity or low $\mathbb{F}_2$-degree. Our techniques can also be used to prove (within a $\log n$ factor) a lifting theorem for AND-functions, stating that the deterministic communication complexity of $f_\land$ is polynomially-related to the AND-decision tree complexity of $f$.

The results rely on a new structural result regarding boolean functions $f:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}$ with a sparse polynomial representation, which may be of independent interest. We show that if the polynomial computing $f$ has few monomials then the set system of the monomials has a small hitting set, of size poly-logarithmic in its sparsity. We also establish extensions of this result to multi-linear polynomials $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ with a larger range.</div>

<p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, October 21th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 17:00 UTC). <strong>Aayush Jain</strong> from UCLA will speak about “<em>Indistinguishability Obfuscation from Well-Founded Assumptions</em>” (abstract below). </p>



<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk/live-seat-reservation">the online form</a>. Due to security concerns, <em>registration is required</em> to attend the interactive talk. (The link to the YouTube livestream will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/livetalk">on our  website</a> on the day of the talk, so people who did not sign up will still be able to  watch the talk live.) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/suggest">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/plustcs/">the website</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-block-quote">Abstract: We present a construction of an indistinguishability obfuscation scheme, whose security rests on the subexponential hardness of four well-founded assumptions. We show the existence of an indistinguishability Obfuscation scheme for all circuits assuming sub-exponential security of the following assumptions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-quote"><li>The Learning with Errors (LWE) assumption with arbitrarily small subexponential modulus-to-noise ratio,</li><li>The SXDH assumption with respect to bilinear groups of prime order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="p" class="latex" title="p" />,</li><li>Existence of a Boolean Pseudorandom Generator (PRG) in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BNC%7D%5E0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathsf{NC}^0" class="latex" title="\mathsf{NC}^0" /> with arbitrary polynomial stretch, that is, mapping <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> bits to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B1%2B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="n^{1+\tau}" class="latex" title="n^{1+\tau}" /> bits, for any constant \tau&gt;0.</li><li>The Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_p&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{Z}_p" class="latex" title="\mathbb{Z}_p" /> with error-rate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell%5E%7B-%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\ell^{-\delta}" class="latex" title="\ell^{-\delta}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cell&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\ell" class="latex" title="\ell" /> is the dimension of the secret and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdelta%3E0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\delta&gt;0" class="latex" title="\delta&gt;0" /> is an arbitrarily small constant.<br />Further, assuming only polynomial security of these assumptions, there exists a compact public-key functional encryption scheme for all circuits.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-block-quote">The main technical novelty is the introduction and construction of a cryptographic pseudorandom generator that we call a Structured-Seed PRG (sPRG), assuming LPN over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D_p&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbb{Z}_p" class="latex" title="\mathbb{Z}_p" /> and PRGs in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathsf%7BNC%7D%5E0&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathsf{NC}^0" class="latex" title="\mathsf{NC}^0" />. During the talk, I will discuss how structured seed PRGs have evolved from different notions of novel pseudorandom generators proposed in the past few years, and how an interplay between different areas of theoretical computer science played a major role in providing valuable insights leading to this work. Time permitting, I will go into the details of how to construct sPRGs. <br /><br />Joint work with Huijia (Rachel) Lin and Amit Sahai</p></div>

What interests me is their <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shiratski/2242870712/">pentagonal tiles</a>. It’s not one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_tiling">15 monohedral pentagon tilings</a>: the tiles have two shapes, one forming half of a regular hexagon (all angles \(&gt; 60^\circ\)) and another surrounding the hexagons (sharp angle \(= 60^\circ\)).

    <p>Sometimes when I’ve been doing big literature searches on jstor (manually clicking on dozens of links because jstor’s search results don’t tell me which book is being reviewed, delayed by maybe a second or so per click so that I don’t get stopped by jstor’s anti-bot filters) I then get locked out of Google Scholar for a day or so on the same IP address because Google thinks I’m a bot. It doesn’t happen when I search Scholar directly. Has anyone else noticed this? Any idea how to avoid it? (<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105037500352288970">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>)</p>

The link is in Dutch but Google translate works well except at one point: the school’s name, “De Garve”, means “the sheaf”, and the article remarks that this is appropriate for a pattern that looks like ears of corn.</p>

<p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) launched fifty years ago this month in the United States. The New York Times talks about its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/arts/television/pbs-50-anniversary.html">fifty reasons</a> how the network mattered. I'll throw in my thoughts.</p><p>I was just slightly too old for shows like Sesame Street, Electric Company, Mr. Rogers and Zoom, not that that stopped me from watching them. My kids grew up on Barney and Friends. My daughter even had a toy Barney that interacted with the show, which went <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/02/barney-evil-dinosaur.html">as well as you'd expect</a>. </p><p>PBS introduced me to those great British TV shows for young nerds like me including Monty Python and Doctor Who. I wasn't into Nova but did watch Carl Sagan's Cosmos religiously in high school.</p><p>My favorite PBS show was the American Experience, short documentaries about US culture. I remember learning about this history of Coney Island and the quiz show scandals before Robert Redford made a movie about it.</p><p>Siskel and Ebert got their start on PBS and became my go to source for movie reviews.</p><p>In 1987 PBS broadcasted Ivy League football games.

<p>My latest post on this blog was on December 30th 2019. It seems like a lifetime away. The rate at which paradigm shifting events have been happening in 2020 is staggering. And it might very well be that the worst of 2020 is ahead of us, especially for those of us currently in the USA. </p>
<p>When I started communicating online broadly (blog, twitter) I promised myself to keep it strictly about science (or very closely neighboring topics), so the few lines above is all I will say about the current worldwide situation.</p>
<p>In other news, as is evident from the 10 months hiatus in blogging, I have taken elsewhere (at least temporarily) my need for rapid communication about theorems that currently excite me. Namely to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/sebastienbubeck" class="liinternal">youtube</a>. Since the beginning of the pandemic I have been recording home videos of what would have been typically blog posts, with currently 5 such videos:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/uRarIjJGmhs" class="liinternal">A law of robustness for neural networks</a> : I explain the conjecture we recently made that, for random data, any interpolating two-layers neural network must have its Lipschitz constant larger than the squareroot of the ratio between the size of the data set and the number of neurons in the network. This would prove that overparametrization is *necessary* for robustness.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/U-XsUB69mvc" class="liinternal">Provable limitations of kernel methods</a> : I give the proof by Zeyuan Allen-Zhu and Yuanzhi Li that there are simple noisy learning tasks where *no kernel* can perform well while simple two-steps procedures can learn.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/6-GBDpe2kuI" class="liinternal">Memorization with small neural networks</a> : I explain old (classical combinatorial) and new (NTK style) construction of optimally-sized interpolating two-layers neural networks.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/HIwZH2C--nA" class="liinternal">Coordination without communication</a> : This video is the only one in the current series where I don’t talk at all about neural networks. Specifically it is about the cooperative multiplayer multiarmed bandit problem. I explain the strategy we devised with Thomas Budzinski to solve this problem (for the stochastic version) without *any* collision at all between the players.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/O84mcq7P_es" class="liinternal">Randomized smoothing for certified robustness</a> : Finally, in the first video chronologically, I explain the only known technique for provable robustness guarantees in neural networks that can scale up to large models.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next video will be about basic properties of tensors, and how it can be used for smooth interpolation (in particular in the context of our law of robustness conjecture). After that, we will see, maybe more neural networks, maybe more bandits, maybe some non-convex optimization ….</p>

<p><em>[If you’re not American, or you’re American but a masochist who enjoys the current nightmare, this post won’t be relevant to you—sorry!]</em></p>



<p>Until recently, this blog had a tagline that included “HOLD THE NOVEMBER US ELECTION BY MAIL.”  So I thought I should warn readers that circumstances have changed in ways that have important practical implications over the next few weeks.  It’s no longer that we <em>don’t know</em> whether Trump and Pence will acknowledge a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">likely loss</a>—rather, it’s that <em>we know they won’t</em>.  They were repeatedly asked; we all heard their answers.</p>



<p>That means that the <em>best</em> case, the ideal scenario, is already without precedent in the country’s 240-year history.  It’s a president who never congratulates the winner, who refuses to meet him or coordinate a transfer of power, who skips the inauguration, and who’s basically dragged from the White House on January 20, screaming to his supporters (and continuing to scream until his dying breath) that the election was faked.</p>



<p>As I said, that banana-republic outcome is now the <em>best</em> case.  But it’s also plausible that Trump simply declares himself the winner on election night, because the mail-in votes, urban votes, yet-to-be-counted votes, or any other votes that trend the wrong way are fake; social media and the Murdoch press amplify this fantasy; Trump calls on Republican-controlled state legislatures to set aside the “rigged” results and appoint their own slates of electors; the legislatures dutifully comply; and the Supreme Court A-OKs it all.  If you think none of that could happen, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/what-if-trump-refuses-concede/616424/?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;fbclid=IwAR28w8ZJIZSlvqoOT-To3UWgMj4wVc9PkDA7Vbs60S_J7T0kOo1_RyVGe98">read this <em>Atlantic</em> article</a> from a few weeks ago, carefully to the end, and be more terrified than you’ve ever been in your life.  And don’t pretend that you know what would happen next.</p>



<p>I know, I know, I’m mentally ill, it’s Trump Derangement Syndrome, I see Nazis behind every corner just because they killed most of my relatives, a little global pandemic here and economic collapse there and riots and apocalyptic fires and resurgent fascism and I act as though it’s the whole world coming to an end.  A few months from now, after everything has gone swimmingly, this post will still be here and you can come back and tell me how crazy I was.  I accept that risk.</p>



<p>For now, though, the best chance to avert a catastrophe is for Trump not merely to lose, but <strong>lose in a landslide that’s already clear by election night</strong>.  Which means: as Michelle Obama <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/18/21373177/michelle-obama-dnc-2020-speech-voting-post-office">advised</a> already in August, put on your mask, brave the virus, and vote in person if you can—<em>especially</em> if you live in a state that’s in play, and that won’t start tallying mail-in ballots till after election day.  If your state allows it, and if early votes will be counted by election night (check this!), vote early, when the lines are shorter.  That’s what Dana and I did this morning; Texas <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/04/joe-biden-win-texas/">going blue</a> on election night would be one dramatic way to foreclose shenanigans.  If you can’t vote in person, or if your state counts mail-in ballots earlier, then vote by mail or drop-box, but <em>do it now</em>, so you have a chance to fix any problems well before Election Day.  (Note that, even in normal circumstances—which these aren’t—a substantial fraction of all mail-in ballots get rejected because of trivial errors.)  I welcome other tips in the comments, from the many readers more immersed in this stuff than I am.</p>



<p>And if this post helped spur you in any way, please say so in the comments.  It will improve my mood, thereby helping me finish my next post, which will be on the Continuum Hypothesis.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update:</span></strong> It’s always fascinating to check my comments and see the missives from parallel universes, where Trump is a normal candidate who one might decide to vote for based on normal criteria, rather than what he himself has announced he is: a knife to the entire system that underlies such decisions.  For a view from <em>this</em> universe, see (e.g.) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02852-x?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=organic&amp;utm_campaign=NGMT_USG_JC01_GL_Nature&amp;fbclid=IwAR1tLfLbZwXPd6U3a8BnqxvvMxo3SUDPWxhQccXYz9BU9_dL8x8deY3_dRc">today’s <em>Nature</em> editorial</a>.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Another Update:</span></strong> If it allays anyone’s fears, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of pandemic preparedness when Dana and I went to vote.  It was in a huge, cavernous gym on the UT campus, the lines were very short, masks and 6ft distancing were strictly enforced, and finger-coverings and hand sanitizer were offered to everyone.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Unrelated Update (10/16):</span></strong> For those who are interested, here’s a <a href="https://mattasher.com/2020/10/16/scott-aaronson-on-the-hunt-for-real-randomness/">new podcast with me and Matt Asher</a>, where we talk about the use of quantum mechanics (especially Bell inequality violations) to generate certified random numbers.</p></div>

<p> MATH:</p><p>My last <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/10/revisiting-continuum-hypothesis.html">post</a> on CH mentioned that Hugh Woodin used to think NOT(CH) but now thinks CH. In both cases his reasons have some math content to them. Also, note that Hugh Woodin seems to believe that CH somehow HAS an answer. Kurt Godel also thought CH HAS an answer. It has been said that he could have announced  his result that CH is consistent by saying  L is THE model, and the problem is now solved. </p><p>Should we care what Hugh Woodin and Kurt Godel think about CH?</p><p>YES- they have both studied the issue A LOT. If you think CH should have an answer, then surely you would care what they think. </p><p>NO-  CH has no answer so there opinions are no better than mine. If you think CH does not have an answer then you might think this; however, I think you should still be at least INTERESTED in what people who have thought about the problem A LOT have to say, even if you will disagree with them.</p><p>But with MATH there are people who clearly know more than you on topics you care about, so it is worth hearing what they have to say. </p><p>POLITICS:</p><p>Recently Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson (by Wikipedia: actor, producer, businessman, and former professional wrestler) ENDORSED Joe Biden. Should we care about his opinion? Maybe, if wrestling fans and former pro wrestler tend to be Republicans, so this may indicate a shift. I do not know if this is the case. </p><p>Robert De Niro was in favor of impeaching Donald Trump. He also said that Trump was like a Gangster. He would know because he was in the movie GOODFELLOWS and later THE IRISHMAN (about Jimmy Hoffa). To be fair I do not think he said that is how he would know. Even so, I don't think I care what he thinks, unless he has some specialized knowledge I do not know about. </p><p>David Frum is a republican who had a break with the party NOT over Donald Trump, but over Obamacare- which you may recall was originally a CONSERVATIVE response to Hillarycare by the Heritage Foundation.  He has a good article on this <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/the-republican-waterloo/520833/">here</a>. Because he is an intelligent  republican in favor of Obamacare (or some version of it) he is worth listening to.</p><p>In POLITICS its trickier- who is worth listening to and why. For all I know, THE ROCK has made a detailed study of the Republican and Democratic platforms (actually this cannot be true since the Republicans did not have a platform this time). </p><p>COMMERCIALS:</p><p>Tom Selleck (Actor-Magnum PI a while back, Blue Bloods now)  does commercials for reverse mortgages. A while back I asked a group of people WHY he is doing them. Here were some answers and reactions</p><p>a) He needs the money. Not likely, he seems to have done well and does not seem to have the kind of bad habits (e.g., drugs) that need money. Maybe he has expensive tastes (my only expensive tastes is in fine European Kit Kat bars--- which actually are not that expensive). </p><p>b) He likes doing commercials. Maybe.</p><p>c) He believes in the product. At this, everyone cracked up in laughter.</p><p>This raises a more general point: Why does ANYONE believe ANY commercial since we KNOW the actor is being PAID to say it. I ask non rhetorically as always. </p></div>

<p>
Roger Penrose, Reinhard Genzel, and Andrea Ghez have won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics. The prize is divided half to Penrose for theoretical work and half to Genzel and Ghez for finding a convincing and appreciably large practical example.

</p><p>
Today we congratulate the winners and give further musings on the nature of knowledge and the role of theory.

</p><p>
The physics Nobel has always had the rule that it cannot be for a theory alone, no matter how beautiful and how many mathematical discoveries follow from its development. Stephen Hawking’s theory of black-hole <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation">radiation</a> is almost universally accepted, despite its association with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox">paradox</a>, yet it was said that only an empirical confirmation such as mini-black holes being discovered to explode in an accelerator core would have brought it a Nobel. The official citation to Sir Roger says that his prize is:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity.” </em>
</blockquote>




<p>
What is a “robust” prediction? The word strikes us as having overtones of <em>necessity</em>. Necessary knowledge is the kind we deal with in mathematics. The citation to Genzel and Ghez stays on empirical grounds:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.” </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
The “object” <em>must</em> be a black hole—given relativity and its observed gravitational effects, it cannot be otherwise. Among many possible witnesses for the reality of black holes—one being the evident origin of the gravitational waves whose <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/waves-hazards-and-guesses/">detection</a> brought the 2017 Nobel—the centers of galaxies are hefty examples. The combination of these citations opens several threads we’d like to discuss.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> The Proof Horizon of a Black Hole </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Dick and I are old enough to remember when black holes had the status of conjecture. One of my childhood astronomy books stated that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_X-1">Cygnus X-1</a> X-ray source was the best known candidate for a black hole. In 1974, Hawking bet Kip Thorne that it was not a black hole. The bet lasted until 1990, when Hawking conceded. He wrote the following in his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time">book</a>, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> This was a form of insurance policy for me. I have done a lot of work on black holes, and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. But in that case, I would have the consolation of winning my bet. … When we made the bet in 1975, we were 80% certain that Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. By now [1988], I would say that we are about 95% certain, but the bet has yet to be settled. </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
In the 1980s, I was a student and then postdoc in Penrose’s department, so I was imbued with the ambience of black holes and never had a thought about doubting their existence. I even once spent an hour with John Wheeler, who coined the term “black hole,” when Penrose delegated me to accompany Wheeler to Oxford’s train station for his return to London. But it seems from the record that the progression to regarding black holes as proven entities was as gradual as many argue the act of crossing a large black hole’s event horizon to be. Although the existence of a central black hole from data emanating from Sagittarius had been proposed at least as far back as 1971, the work by Ghez and then Genzel cited for their prize began in 1995. The official <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2002/press-release/">announcement</a> for Riccardo Giacconi’s share of the 2002 physics Nobel stated:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> “He also detected sources of X-rays that most astronomers now consider to contain black holes.” </em>
</blockquote>


<p>



</p><p>
This speaks lingering doubt at least about <em>where</em> black holes might be judged to exist, if not their existence at all.

</p><p>
However their time of confirmation might be pinpointed, it is the past five years that have given by far the greatest flood of evidence, including the first visual <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2019/4/19/how-scientists-captured-the-first-image-of-a-black-hole/">image</a> of a black hole last year. The fact of their presence in our universe is undeniable. But <em>necessity</em> is a separate matter, and with Penrose this goes back to 1964.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Relativity and Necessity </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/an-interview-with-kurt-gdel/">mentioned</a> Kurt Gödel’s solution to the equations of general relativity (GR) in which time travel is possible. This does not mean that time travel must be possible, or that it is possible in our universe. A “solution” to GR is more like a <em>model</em> in logic: it may satisfy a theory’s axioms but have other properties that are contingent (unless the theory is <em>categorical</em>, meaning that all of its models are isomorphic). Gödel’s model has a negative value for Einstein’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant">cosmological constant</a>; the 2011 physics Nobel went to the discovery that in our universe the constant has a tiny <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/empirical-humility/">positive</a> value. GR also allows solutions in which some particles (called <em>tachyons</em>) travel faster than light.

</p><p>
That GR has solutions allowing black holes had been known from its infancy in work by Karl Schwarzschild and Johannes Droste. There are also solutions without black holes; a universe with no mass is legal in GR in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_solution_(general_relativity)">many ways</a> besides the case of special relativity. Penrose took the opposite tack, of giving minimal conditions under which black holes are <em>necessary</em>. Following this <a href="https://theconversation.com/nobel-prize-how-penrose-genzel-and-ghez-helped-put-black-holes-at-the-centre-of-modern-astrophysics-147613">article</a>, we list them informally as follows:

</p><p>


</p><ol> 
<li>
Sufficiently large concentrations of mass exerting gravity exist. 
</li><li>
Gravity always attracts, never repels. 
</li><li>
No physical effect can travel faster than light. 
</li><li>
Gravity determines how light bends and moves. 
</li><li>
The space-time manifold is metrically complete. 
</li></ol>



<p>
Penrose showed that any system obeying these properties and evolving in accordance with GR must develop black holes. He showed this without any symmetry assumptions on the system. Thus he derived black holes as a prediction with the force of a theorem derived from minimal axioms.

</p><p>
His 1965 <a href="http://quantum-gravitation.de/media/2d2cde3ec9c38fffffff80d0fffffff1.pdf">paper</a> actually used a proof by contradiction. He derived five properties needed in order for the system to avoid forming a singularity. Then he showed they are mutually inconsistent—a proof by contradiction. Here is the crux of his paper:

</p><p>




</p><p>

</tbody></table>



<p>
In the diagram, time flows up. The point in a nutshell—a very tight nutshell—is that once a surface flows inside the cylinder at the Schwarzschild radius then light and any other motion from it can go only inward toward a singularity. The analysis is possible without the kind of symmetry assumption that had been used to tame the algebraic complexity of the equations of GR. The metric completeness mandates a singularity apart from any symmetries; a periodic equilibrium is ruled out by analysis of Cauchy surfaces.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> Necessary For Us? </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
Like Richard Feynman’s famous diagrams for quantum field theory, Penrose developed his diagrams as tools for shortcutting the vicissitudes of GR. We could devote entire other posts to his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_tiling">tiles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_triangle">triangle</a> and other combinatorial inventions. His tools enable quantifying black-hole formation from observations in our universe.

</p><p>
The question of <em>necessity</em>, however, pertains to other possible universes. Let us take for granted that GR and quantum theory are facets of a physical theory that governs the entire cosmos—the long-sought “theory of everything”—and let us also admit the contention of inflationary theorists that multiple universes are a necessary consequence of any inflation theory. The question remains, <em>are black holes necessary in those universes?</em>

</p><p>
It is possible that those universes might not satisfy axiom 1 above, or might have enough complexity for existence of black holes but not large-scale formation of them. The question then becomes whether black holes must exist in any universe rich enough for sentient life forms such as ourselves to develop. This is a branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle">anthropic principle</a>.

</p><p>
Lee Smolin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_natural_selection">proposed</a> a mechanism via which black holes engender new universes and so propagate the complexity needed for their large-scale formation. Since complexity also attends the development of sentient life forms, this would place our human existence in the wake of consequence, as opposed to the direction of logic when reasoning by the anthropic principle.

</p><p>



</p><p>

</p><h2> A Little More About Science </h2>


<p>



</p><p>
The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded this week to Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier for their lead roles in developing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR">CRISPR</a> gene-editing technology, specifically around the protein <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9">Cas9</a>.

We argue that two more different types of results cannot be found:

We still cannot create black holes in a lab to experiment with—or maybe we could but should be very afraid of going anywhere near doing so. It was not clear that there could ever be a real application of this result.

Clearly this can and was experimented on in labs. Also clear that there are applications of this result. Actually it is now a standard tool used in countless labs. There even are patent battles over the method.

We like the fact that Nobels are given for such diverse type of research. It is not just that one is for astrophysics and one for chemistry. It is that Nobels can be given for very different types of research. We think this is important.

</p><p>
But wait. These results do have something in common, something that sets them apart from any research we can do in complexity theory. Both operate like this:

</p><p>

</p><blockquote><b> </b> <em> 	Observe something important from nature. Something that is there independent of us. Then in Penrose’s case explain why it is true. Then in Charpentier and Doudna’s case, use it to solve some important problems. </em>
</blockquote>

</p><p>
We wonder if anything like this could be done in our research world—say in complexity theory?

We prove a general structural theorem for a wide family of local algorithms, which includes property testers, local decoders, and PCPs of proximity. Namely, we show that the structure of every algorithm that makes $q$ adaptive queries and satisfies a natural robustness condition admits a sample-based algorithm with $n^{1- 1/O(q^2 \log^2 q)}$ sample complexity, following the definition of Goldreich and Ron (TOCT 2016). We prove that this transformation is nearly optimal. Our theorem also admits a scheme for constructing privacy-preserving local algorithms. 

Using the unified view that our structural theorem provides, we obtain results regarding various types of local algorithms, including the following.


- We strengthen the state-of-the-art lower bound for relaxed locally decodable codes, obtaining an exponential improvement on the dependency in query complexity; this resolves an open problem raised by Gur and Lachish (SODA 2020).
- We show that any (constant-query) testable property admits a sample-based tester with sublinear sample complexity; this resolves a problem left open in a work of Fischer, Lachish, and Vasudev (FOCS 2015) by extending their main result to adaptive testers.
- We prove that the known separation between proofs of proximity and testers is essentially maximal; this resolves a problem left open by Gur and Rothblum (ECCC 2013, Computational Complexity 2018) regarding sublinear-time delegation of computation.

Our techniques strongly rely on relaxed sunflower lemmas and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem.</div>
