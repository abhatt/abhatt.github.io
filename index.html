<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://duch.mimuw.edu.pl/~tugboat/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/curseOfMetricIsland.png"><img src="https://duch.mimuw.edu.pl/~tugboat/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/curseOfMetricIsland_small.png" align="right" class="wp-image-587 alignright" alt="The Curse of Metric Island" /></a>The deadline was approaching without mercy and there was, of course, still some polishing to be done for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.67">our SODA paper</a>. But then we run into an issue. To make things worse, this issue turned out to be a hard one, a fundamental known open problem in Computational Geometry. The good thing is, I liked the problem so much that I decided to dedicate it this post. This is the story about the Sum of Square Roots problem and how we bypassed (ignored) it without solving it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything began in the haze of the 70's of the last millennium. It is nebulous who stumbled first upon this enigma. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/small-dist.html">Some say</a> that Ron Graham has discussed the problem in public lectures, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2321488">some others</a> say that Joseph O'Rourke has posed it as an open question in the American Mathematical Monthly, while <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/P33.html">some others</a> suspect that the problem had been already hiding in older different formulations. However, it is a historical fact that one shinny/cloudy day, three computer scientists finished polishing a manuscript that became a classical paper known as "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800113.803626">Some NP-complete geometric problems</a>". In this paper, Michael Garey, Ron Graham and David Johnson showed the NP-hardness of two important problems in geometric metrics: Steiner Tree and Traveling Salesman. For the Euclidean plane, they showed only NP-hardness as they did not manage to show that these problems are contained in NP. Moreover, they accentuated that we cannot even rule out that the decision version of Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree is outside of NP. What a seeming paradox given that we can compute such a minimum tree in polynomial time! So, whom did they blame? The short answer: The Euclidean metric. Garey and his coauthors explain that all these problems have a common hidden issue: They rely on comparing Euclidean lengths, that is, they rely on comparing irrational numbers based on square roots. Whereas this task is trivial if we just want to compare two line segments (e.g. by comparing the radicands), the problem starts when we want to compare two polygonal paths. Even assuming rational (or, after scaling, integer) coordinates, this problem translates into a question that is fundamental in Computational Geometry: Given two lists of integers, <em>a<sub>1</sub></em> ... and <em>b<sub>1</sub></em> ..., can we decide whether "<em>∑ √a<sub>i</sub> ≥ ∑ √b<sub>i</sub></em>" in P? Put into words: <strong>Can we efficiently compare two sums of square roots over integers?</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-1073"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To emphasize the significance of this question, let me cite <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/P33.html">David Eppstein</a>: "A major bottleneck in proving NP-completeness for geometric problems is a mismatch between the real-number and Turing machine models of computation: one is good for geometric algorithms but bad for reductions, and the other vice versa. Specifically, it is not known on Turing machines how to quickly compare a sum of distances (square roots of integers) with an integer or other similar sums, so even (decision versions of) easy problems such as the minimum spanning tree are not known to be in NP."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Is this problem computable at all?" - might the curious reader ask after realizing that the approach of iteratively increasing the precision until the first difference in digits will never terminate if both numbers happen to be equal. Luckily, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0747-7171(85)80013-4">Allan Borodin et al.</a> and <a href="https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/18449">Johannes BlĂśmer</a> showed that polynomial time is enough to decide whether two such sums have the same value. Therefore, it is astonishing that the problem of deciding the sign of their difference, a question that seems only slightly harder, has been only recently spotted by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/070697926">Eric Allender et al</a> on an island of the counting hierarchy CH (3rd level) located in the wide ocean of PSPACE. Thus, it is still far far away from the needle head of P, where <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.44.5325">Gregorio Malajovich</a> conjectured it to live.  Until this will be shown, <a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4053/sum-of-square-roots-hard-problems">Jeff Erickson</a> proposes to study which problems are (<a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/4053/sum-of-square-roots-hard-problems">non-boringly</a>) Σ√-hard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, if we could only sufficiently bound the difference of the sums from below! Then we could bound from above the precision required to determine the correct sign of the difference: Just image that <em>B</em> is such a lower bound on the difference. Now, take a precision that allows us to compute an approximate difference being only <em>B/2</em> away from the real one. Then it is easy to verify that the following procedure determines the correct sign: Output the sign of the approximate difference if it is outside of <em>[-B/2,B/2]</em>, otherwise output <em>0</em>. What is the run time of this procedure? It is proportional to the precision, which corresponds to the length of <em>B</em>, that is, to <em>-log B</em>. Hence, if <em>-log B</em> is bounded from above by a polynomial in the length of the input, then we are in P! So, is there any reasonable lower bound for the worst case? That is, <strong>what is the smallest positive difference between any two sums of <em>k</em> square roots of integers of size at most <em>n</em>?</strong> Welcome to <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/P33.html">Problem 33</a> of <a href="http://cs.smith.edu/~jorourke/TOPP/Welcome.html">The Open Problems Project</a>! Let <em>r(n,k)</em> denote such a minimum difference as a function of <em>n</em> and <em>k</em>. For instance, consider <em>n=20</em> and <em>k=2</em>. Then <em>r(n,k)</em> is roughly <em>0.0002</em> and it is attained by <em>√{10} + √{11} - √{5} - √{18}</em>. As being an open problem, there is no tight bound known for <em>r(n,k)</em>. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2006.05.002">Jianbo Qian and Cao An Wang</a> as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2011.06.014">Qi Cheng and Yu-Hsin Li</a> proved(*) that there are sums where <em>-log r(n,k)</em> is at least in the order of magnitudes of <em>k</em> log <em>n</em>. However, these lower bounds constitute an exponentially gap to the best known upper bounds which are <em>O(2<sup>2k</sup> log n)</em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010005">Christoph Burnikel et al.</a>(**)] and <em>2<sup>O(n/log n)</sup></em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2011.06.014">Qi Cheng et al.</a>]. So, maybe you, dear reader, will be the one to close the gap?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the dramatic opening of this post, I mentioned <a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.67">our paper</a>, where the problem of Sum of Square Roots appeared. There, we design a PTAS for the Traveling Salesman problem (TSP) with hyperplane neighborhoods, that is, we look for a <em>(1+ε)</em>-approximation of a minimum-length tour that, instead of points, visits a given set of hyperplanes in ℝ<sup><em>d</em></sup> with <em>d</em> being fixed. The basis of our algorithm is a integer grid of constant size (depending on <em>ε</em> and <em>d</em>). Our key observation is that there is a translation and scaling of the grid such that snapping an (adequately sparsified) optimum solution to the grid results in a <em>(1+ε</em>)-approximation. Using this insight, we let our algorithm enumerate all (reasonable) TSP tours lying in the unit-cube grid. With a simple LP, we translate and scale each tour such that it visits all the hyperplanes of the input whilst minimizing its tour length (i.e., the scaling factor). At the end, we obtain a set of feasible TSP tours and output the shortest one. And here we were confronted with the Sum of Square Roots problem. Which of the tours is the shortest one?<br />
Was all our work devastated, all our blood, sweat and tears in vain? Just because the very last line of our algorithm had unknown complexity?<br />
Our solution was simple: We just skipped the issue and our paper got accepted. Why? Well, the issue wasn't one for the following three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We could be lazy and assume the real RAM computational model with constant time for square root operations (as often done in Computational Geometry).</li>
<li>We could be industrious and approximate the real tour lengths with a sufficiently small error since we look anyway for an approximation in overall.</li>
<li>We could think and then realize that our candidate tours consist of only constant many vertices. Indeed, the best known lower bound on the difference <em>r(n,k)</em> implies the following nice take-away which shall conclude this epilogue:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We can compare two sums of square roots in polynomial time if the number of square roots is constant!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">-------------------------<br />
Proof sketches for the interested reader of the lower and upper bounds on <em>r(n,k)</em>:<br />
(*) <em>Ω(k log n)</em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2011.06.014">Cheng et al.</a>]: The interval <em>[k, k √{n}]</em> contains so many distinct sums of square roots (over square-free integers) that, by a pigeonhole argument, there are two sums with very small distance.<br />
(**) <em>O(2<sup>2k</sup> log n)</em> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010005">Burnikel et al.</a>]: The difference is an algebraic integer and, consequently, the root of a polynomial with integer coefficients and degree at most <em>2<sup>2k</sup></em>. A simple inequality yields the bound.</p></div>

the execution of these programs have become the most relevant in our days.
Programs should work efficiently, i.e. work as quickly as possible and spend as
little resources as possible. Most often, such a "measure of efficiency" is the
polynomial program execution time of the length of the input data. In this
article will introduce the method of $\Delta_0^p$-enrichments which will show
how to switch from the usual polynomial model of $\mathfrak{M}$ using
$\Delta_0^p$-enrichments to a model with new properties and new elements so
that the new model will also be polynomial. Thus, we will show how to create
new classes of objects whose set will be polynomially computable. We will also
prove the theorem about $\Delta_0^p-$fixed point, which is a natural polynomial
analogue of the Gandy fixed point theorem and allows us to take a different
look at polynomial computability. In the 1970s and 1980s, Yu.L.Ershov,
S.S.Goncharov, and D.I.Sviridenko proposed a direction of semantic programming
based on the hereditary-finite lists super structure $HW(\mathfrak{M})$. The
main goal of our article is to creating programs whose temporal computational
complexity will be polynomial. Method $\Delta_0^p$-enrichments will help
consider any program written in a high-level language as a logical formula in a
suitable model. And the calculation of the program is the same as checking the
truth of the formula on it. Therefore, the transition from calculating programs
written in high-level languages to verifying the validity of formulas on a
model is natural.

Phillips</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08014">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We revisit the range sampling problem: the input is a set of points where
each point is associated with a real-valued weight. The goal is to store them
in a structure such that given a query range and an integer $k$, we can extract
$k$ independent random samples from the points inside the query range, where
the probability of sampling a point is proportional to its weight.
</p>
<p>This line of work was initiated in 2014 by Hu, Qiao, and Tao and it was later
followed up by Afshani and Wei. The first line of work mostly studied
unweighted but dynamic version of the problem in one dimension whereas the
second result considered the static weighted problem in one dimension as well
as the unweighted problem in 3D for halfspace queries.
</p>
<p>We offer three main results and some interesting insights that were missed by
the previous work: We show that it is possible to build efficient data
structures for range sampling queries if we allow the query time to hold in
expectation (the first result), or obtain efficient worst-case query bounds by
allowing the sampling probability to be approximately proportional to the
weight (the second result). The third result is a conditional lower bound that
shows essentially one of the previous two concessions is needed. For instance,
for the 3D range sampling queries, the first two results give efficient data
structures with near-linear space and polylogarithmic query time whereas the
lower bound shows with near-linear space the worst-case query time must be
close to $n^{2/3}$, ignoring polylogarithmic factors. Up to our knowledge, this
is the first such major gap between the expected and worst-case query time of a
range searching problem.

for the orthogonal range searching problem in the semigroup model, since
Chazelle's result from 1990. This is one of the very fundamental problems in
range searching with a long history. Previously, Andrew Yao's influential
result had shown that the problem is already non-trivial in one
dimension~\cite{Yao-1Dlb}: using $m$ units of space, the query time $Q(n)$ must
be $\Omega( \alpha(m,n) + \frac{n}{m-n+1})$ where $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the
inverse Ackermann's function, a very slowly growing function.
</p>
<p>In $d$ dimensions, Bernard Chazelle~\cite{Chazelle.LB.II} proved that the
query time must be $Q(n) = \Omega( (\log_\beta n)^{d-1})$ where $\beta = 2m/n$.
Chazelle's lower bound is known to be tight for when space consumption is
`high' i.e., $m = \Omega(n \log^{d+\varepsilon}n)$. We have two main results.
The first is a lower bound that shows Chazelle's lower bound was not tight for
`low space': we prove that we must have $m (n) = \Omega(n (\log n \log\log
n)^{d-1})$. Our lower bound does not close the gap to the existing data
structures, however, our second result is that our analysis is tight. Thus, we
believe the gap is in fact natural since lower bounds are proven for idempotent
semigroups while the data structures are built for general semigroups and thus
they cannot assume (and use) the properties of an idempotent semigroup. As a
result, we believe to close the gap one must study lower bounds for
non-idempotent semigroups or building data structures for idempotent
semigroups. We develope significantly new ideas for both of our results that
could be useful in pursuing either of these directions.

book embeddings of single-source single-sink directed acyclic graphs on $k$
pages with the additional requirement that the vertices of the graph appear in
a topological ordering along the spine of the book. We show that testing
whether a graph admits a $k$UBE is NP-complete for $k\geq 3$. A hardness result
for this problem was previously known only for $k = 6$ [Heath and Pemmaraju,
1999]. Motivated by this negative result, we focus our attention on $k=2$. On
the algorithmic side, we present polynomial-time algorithms for testing the
existence of $2$UBEs of planar $st$-graphs with branchwidth $\beta$ and of
plane $st$-graphs whose faces have a special structure. These algorithms run in
$O(f(\beta)\cdot n+n^3)$ time and $O(n)$ time, respectively, where $f$ is a
singly-exponential function on $\beta$. Moreover, on the combinatorial side, we
present two notable families of plane $st$-graphs that always admit an

\mathbb{R}^d$ of a $d$-dimensional distribution $D$ from a list of independent
samples, an $\epsilon$-fraction of which have been arbitrarily corrupted by a
malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic progress has resulted in the first
polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \emph{dimension-independent} rates of
error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one may find
$\hat{\mu}$ with $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\| \leq O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$. However, error
rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while
dimension-independent, are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when
$D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has bounded $4$-th moments.
</p>
<p>In this work we give worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence that improving
on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust mean
estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show that
several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time
robust mean estimation algorithms would imply efficient algorithms for the
small-set expansion problem, refuting Raghavendra and Steurer's small-set
expansion hypothesis (so long as $P \neq NP$). We also give the first direct
reduction to the robust mean estimation problem, starting from a plausible but
nonstandard variant of the small-set expansion problem.

markets, where each agent is matched to one item and there are no monetary
transfers. For this problem, we introduce and analyze the randomized partial
improvement (RPI) mechanism. Unlike most of the mechanisms in this setting, RPI
truthfully elicits cardinal (rather than just ordinal) preferences and produces
a randomized matching where each agent's utility approximates the utility she
would obtain in the Nash bargaining solution with a uniform random matching as
the disagreement point. Intuitively, the RPI mechanism pretends that the agents
are initially endowed with a uniform random assignment. Then, leveraging random
sampling and invoking the partial allocation mechanism of Cole et al. (2013),
RPI seeks to improve the agents' utility, while possibly, to disincentivize
non-truthful reporting, leaving some of them with their initial endowment. To
prove our approximation bounds, we also study the population monotonicity of
the Nash bargaining solution in the context of matching markets, providing both
upper and lower bounds which are of independent interest.

processing 3D geometric constraint systems defined on boundary representation
(B-rep) models. The major issue of processing such variational B-rep models (in
the STEP format) is that free motions of a well-constrained model involve more
than just rigid-body motions. The fundamental difficulty lies in having a
systematic description of what pattern these free motions follow. This paper
proposes a geometric perturbation method to study these free motions. This
method is a generalization of the witness method, allowing it to directly deal
with variational B-rep models represented with the standard STEP scheme. This
generalization is essentially achieved by using a direct, geometric
representation of the free motions, and then expressing the free motions in
terms of composites of several basis motions. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, a series of comparisons and case studies are presented.

acquisition systems now able to produce high resolution grids and point clouds,
the digitization of physical terrains becomes increasingly more precise. Such
extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational
performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media,
memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity,
necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and
storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and
simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for
structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in
biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides
a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage.
Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of
meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous
or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes
compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different
multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global
framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a
fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are
provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the
consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization,
attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally,
HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression
techniques.

<p><b>Authors: </b>M. Sharir, C. Ziv <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07196">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>A classical open problem in combinatorial geometry is to obtain tight
asymptotic bounds on the maximum number of k-level vertices in an arrangement
of n hyperplanes in d dimensions (vertices with exactly k of the hyperplanes
passing below them). This is a dual version of the k-set problem, which, in a
primal setting, seeks bounds for the maximum number of k-sets determined by n
points in d dimensions, where a k-set is a subset of size k that can be
separated from its complement by a hyperplane. The k-set problem is still wide
open even in the plane, with a substantial gap between the best known upper and
lower bounds. The gap gets larger as the dimension grows. In three dimensions,
the best known upper bound is O(nk^(3/2)).
</p>
<p>In its dual version, the problem can be generalized by replacing hyperplanes
by other families of surfaces (or curves in the planes). Reasonably sharp
bounds have been obtained for curves in the plane, but the known upper bounds
are rather weak for more general surfaces, already in three dimensions, except
for the case of triangles. The best known general bound, due to Chan is
O(n^2.997), for families of surfaces that satisfy certain (fairly weak)
properties.
</p>
<p>In this paper we consider the case of pseudoplanes in 3 dimensions (defined
in detail in the introduction), and establish the upper bound O(nk^(5/3)) for
the number of k-level vertices in an arrangement of n pseudoplanes. The bound
is obtained by establishing suitable (and nontrivial) extensions of dual
versions of classical tools that have been used in studying the primal k-set
problem, such as the Lova'sz Lemma and the Crossing Lemma.

<p><em>Semantic representations</em> (aka  <em>semantic embeddings</em>) of complicated data types (e.g. images, text, video) have become central in machine learning, and also crop up in machine translation, language models, GANs, domain transfer, etc. 
These involve learning a <em>representation function</em> $f$ such that for any data point $x$ its representation $f(x)$ is “high level” (retains semantic information while discarding low level details, such as color of individual pixels in an image) and “compact” (low dimensional). 
The test of a good representation is that it should greatly simplify solving <em>new</em> classification tasks, by allowing them to be solved via linear classifiers (or other low-complexity classifiers) using small amounts of labeled data.</p>

<p>Researchers are most interested in <em>unsupervised</em> representation learning using unlabeled data. A popular approach is to use objectives similar to the <strong>word2vec</strong> algorithm for word embeddings, which work well for diverse data types such as molecules, social networks, images, text etc. 
See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">wikipage of word2vec</a> for references. 
Why do such objectives succeed in such diverse settings? 
This post is about an explanation for these methods by using our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">new theoretical framework</a> with coauthor Misha Khodak. 
The framework makes minimalistic assumptions, which is a good thing, since word2vec-like algorithms apply to vastly different data types and it is unlikely that they can share a common Bayesian generative model for the data. 
(An example of generative models in this space is described in an earlier <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2016/02/14/word-embeddings-2/">blog post on the RAND-WALK model</a>. 
As a bonus this framework also yields principled ways to design new variants of the training objectives.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-representations-learning">Semantic representations learning</h2>
<p>Do good, broadly useful representations even <em>exist</em> in the first place? 
In domains such as computer vision, we know the answer is “yes” because deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), when  trained to high accuracy on large multiclass labeled datasets such as <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a>, end up learning very powerful and succinct representations along the way. The penultimate layer of the net — the input into the final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax layer</a> — serves as a good semantic embedding of the image in new unrelated visual tasks. 
(Other layers from the trained net can also serve as good embeddings.) 
In fact the availability of such embeddings from pre-trained (on large multiclass datasets) nets has led to a revolution in computer vision, allowing a host of new classification tasks to be solved with low-complexity classifiers (e.g. linear classifiers) using very little labeled data. 
Thus they are the gold standard to compare to if we try to learn embeddings via unlabeled data.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="50%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/CURLheadless1.svg" />
</p>

<h3 id="word2vec-like-methods-curl">word2vec-like methods: CURL</h3>

<p>Since the success of <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf">word2vec</a>, similar approaches were used to learn embeddings for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02893.pdf">sentences and paragraphs</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00687">images</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640716/">biological sequences</a>.
All of these methods share a key idea: they leverage access to pairs of similar data points $x, x^+$, and learn an embedding function $f$ such that the inner product of $f(x)$ and $f(x^+)$ is on average higher than the inner product of $f(x)$ and $f(x^-)$, where $x^{-}$ is a random data point (and thus presumably dissimilar to $x$). 
In practice similar data points are usually found heuristically, often using co-occurrences, e.g. consecutive sentences in a large text corpus, nearby frames in a video clip, different patches in the same image, etc.</p>

<p>A good example of such methods is <strong>Quick Thoughts</strong> (QT) from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02893.pdf">Logeswaran and Lee</a>, which is the state-of-the-art unsupervised text embedding on many tasks. To learn a representation function $f$, QT minimizes the following loss function on a large text corpus</p>



<p>where $(x, x^+)$ are consecutive sentences and presumably “semantically similar” and $x^-$ is a random negative sample.
For images $x$ and $x^+$ could be <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00687">nearby frames</a> from a video.
For text, two successive sentences serve as good candidates for a similar pair: for example, the following are two successive sentences in the Wikipedia page on word2vec: <em>“High frequency words often provide little information.”</em> and <em>“Words with frequency above a certain threshold may be subsampled to increase training speed.”</em>
Clearly they are much more similar than a random pair of sentences, and the learner exploits this. 
From now on we use <em>Contrastive Unsupervised Representation Learning (CURL)</em> to refer to  methods that leverage similar pairs of data points and our goal is to analyze these methods.</p>

<h3 id="need-for-a-new-framework">Need for a new framework</h3>

<p>The standard framework for machine learning involves minimizing some loss function, and learning is said to succeed (or <em>generalize</em>) if the loss is roughly the same on the average training data point and the average test data point.
In contrastive learning, however, the objective used at test time is very different from the training objective: generalization error is not the right way to think about this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Main Hurdle for Theory:</strong> We have to show that doing well on task A (minimizing the word2vec-like objective) allows the representation to do well on task B (i.e., classification tasks revealed later).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Earlier methods along such lines include <em>kernel learning</em> and <em>semi-supervised learning</em>, but there training typically requires at least a few labeled examples from the classification tasks of future interest. Bayesian approaches using generative models are also well-established in simpler settings, but have proved difficult for complicated data such as images and text. 
Furthermore, the simple word2vec-like learners described above do not appear to operate like Bayesian optimizers in any obvious way, and also work for very different data types.</p>

<p>We tackle this problem by proposing a framework that formalizes the notion of semantic similarity that is implicitly used by these algorithms and use the framework to show why contrastive learning gives good representations, while defining what <em>good representations</em> mean in this context.</p>

<h2 id="our-framework">Our framework</h2>

<p>Clearly, the implicit/heuristic notion of similarity used in contrastive learning is connected to the downstream tasks in some way — e.g., similarity carries a strong <em>hint</em> that on average the “similar pairs” tend to be assigned the same labels in many downstream tasks (though there is no hard guarantee per se). We present a simple and minimalistic framework to formalize such a notion of similarity. 
For purposes of exposition we’ll refer to data points as “images”.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-similarity">Semantic similarity</h3>

<p>We assume nature has many <em>classes</em> of images, and has a measure $\rho$ on a set of classes $\mathcal{C}$, so that if asked to pick a class it selects $c$  with probability $\rho(c)$. 
Each class $c$ also has an associated distribution $D_c$ on images i.e. if nature is asked to furnish examples of class $c$ (e.g., the class “dogs”) then it picks image $x$ with probability $D_c(x)$. 
Note that classes can have arbitrary overlap, including no overlap. 
To formalize a notion of <em>semantic similarity</em> we assume that when asked to provide “similar” images, nature picks a class $c^+$ from $\mathcal{C}$ using measure $\rho$ and then picks two i.i.d. samples $x, x^{+}$ from the distribution $D_{c^+}$. 
The dissimilar example $x^{-}$ is picked by selecting another class $c^-$ from measure $\rho$ and picking a random sample $x^{-}$ from $D_{c^-}$.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="80%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/CURLframework.svg" />
</p>

<p>The training objective for learning the representation is exactly the QT objective from earlier, but now inherits the following interpretation from the framework
</p>

<p>Note that the function class $\mathcal{F}$ is an arbitrary deep net architecture mapping images to embeddings (neural net sans the final layer), and one would learn $f$ via gradient descent/back-propagation as usual. 
Of course, no theory currently exists for explaining when optimization succeeds for complicated deep nets, so our framework will simply assume that gradient descent has already resulted in some representation $f$ that achieves low loss, and studies how well this does in downstream classification tasks.</p>

<h3 id="testing-representations">Testing representations</h3>

<p>What defines a good representation? 
We assume that the quality of the representation is tested by using it to solve a binary (i.e., two-way) classification task using a linear classifier. 
(The paper also studies extensions to $k$-way classification in the downstream task.) 
How is this binary classification task selected? 
Nature picks two classes $c_1, c_2$ randomly according to measure $\rho$ and picks data points for each class according to the associated probability distributions $D_{c_1}$ and $D_{c_2}$. 
The representation is then used to solve this binary task via logistic regression: namely, find two vectors $w_1, w_2$ so as to minimize the following loss
</p>

<p>The quality of the representation is estimated as the <em>average</em> loss over nature’s choices of binary classification tasks.
</p>

<p>It is important to note that the latent classes present in the unlabeled data are the <em>same</em> classes present in the classification tasks. 
This allows us to formalize a sense of ‘semantic similarity’ as alluded to above: the classes from which data points appear together more frequently are the classes that make up <em>relevant</em> classification tasks. 
Note that if the number of classes is large, then typically the data used in unsupervised training may involve <em>no samples</em> from the classes used at test time. 
Indeed, we are hoping to show that the learned representations are useful for classification on potentially unseen classes.</p>

<p>What would be a dream result for theory? Suppose we fix a class of representation functions ${\mathcal F}$, say those computable by a ResNet 50 architecture with some choices of layer sizes etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Dream Theorem:</strong> Minimizing the unsupervised loss (using modest amount of unlabeled data) yields a representation function $f \in {\mathcal F}$ that is competitive with the <strong>best</strong> representation from ${\mathcal F}$ on downstream classification tasks, even with very few labeled examples per task.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the number of unlabeled data pairs needed to learn an approximate minimizer can be controlled using Rademacher complexity arguments (see paper), we show that the dream theorem is impossible as phrased: we can exhibit a simple class ${\mathcal F}$ where the contrastive objective does not yield representations even remotely competitive with the best in the class.
This should not be surprising and only suggests that further progress towards such a dream result would require making more assumptions than the above minimalistic ones.</p>

<p>Instead, our paper makes progress by showing that under the above framework, if the unsupervised loss happens to be small at the end of contrastive learning then the resulting representations perform well on downstream classification.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Simple Lemma:</strong> The average classification loss on downstream binary tasks is upper bounded by the unsupervised loss.

where $\alpha$ depends on $\rho$. ($\alpha\rightarrow 1$ when $|\mathcal{C}|\rightarrow\infty$, for uniform $\rho$)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This says that the unsupervised loss function can be treated as a <strong>surrogate</strong> for the performance on downstream supervised tasks solved using linear classification, so minimizing it makes sense.
Furthermore, just a few labeled examples are needed to learn the linear classifiers in future downstream tasks.
Thus our minimalistic framework lets us show guarantees for contrastive learning and also highlights the labeled sample complexity benefits provided by it.</p>

<h2 id="extensions-of-the-theoretical-analysis">Extensions of the theoretical analysis</h2>

<p>This conceptual framework not only allows us to reason about empirically successful variants of (1), but also leads to the design of new, theoretically grounded unsupervised objective functions. 
Here we give a high level view; details are in  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09229">our paper</a>.</p>

<p><em>A priori,</em> one might imagine that the log and exponentials in (1) have some information-theoretic interpretation; here we relate the functional form to the fact that logistic regression is going to be used in the downstream classification tasks. 
Analogously, if the classification is done via hinge loss, then (2) is true for a different unsupervised loss that uses a hinge-like loss instead. 
This objective, for instance, was used to learn image representations from videos by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00687">Wang and Gupta</a>. 
Also, usually in practice $k&gt;1$ negative samples are contrasted with each positive sample $(x,x^+)$ and the unsupervised objective looks like the $k$-class cross-entropy loss. 
We prove a statement similar to (2) for this setting, where the supervised loss now is the average $(k+1)$-way classification loss.</p>

<p>Finally, the framework provides guidelines for designing new unsupervised objectives when <em>blocks</em> of similar data are available (e.g., sentences in a paragraph). 
Replacing $f(x^+)$ and $f(x^-)$ in (1) with the average of the representations from the positive and the negative block respectively, we get a new objective which comes with stronger guarantees and better performance in practice. 
We experimentally verify the effectiveness of this variant in our paper.</p>

<h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>

<p>We report some controlled experiments to verify the theory. Lacking a canonical multiclass problem for text, we constructed a new 3029-class labeled dataset where a class is one of 3029 articles from Wikipedia,  and datapoints are one of $200$ sentences in these articles. Representations will be tested on a random binary classification task involves two articles, where the labels of the data point is which of the two articles it belongs to. (A 10-way classification task is similarly defined.)  Datapoints for the test tasks will be held out while training representations. The class of sentence representation ${\mathcal F}$ is a simple multilayer architecture one based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).</p>

<p>The supervised method for learning representations uses trains a multiclass classifier on the 3029-way task and the representation is taken from the layer before the final softmax output. This was the gold standard in above discussions.</p>

<p>The unsupervised method is fed pairs of similar data points generated according to our theory: similar data points are just pairs of sentences sampled from the same article. Representations are learnt by minimizing the above unsupervised loss objectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img width="60%" src="http://www.offconvex.org/assets/CURLexperiment.svg" />
</p>
<p>The highlighted parts in the table show that the unsupervised representations compete well with the supervised representations on the average $k$-way classification task ($k=2, 10$).</p>

<p>Additionally, even though not covered by our theory, the representation also performs respectably on the full  multiclass problem.
We find some support for a suggestion of our theory that the mean (centroid) of the unsupervised representations in each class should be good classifiers for average $k$-way supervised tasks. We find this to be true for unsupervised representations, and surprisingly for supervised representations as well.</p>

<p>The paper also has other experiments studying the effect of number of negative samples and larger blocks of similar data points, including experiments on the CIFAR-100 image dataset.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>While contrastive learning is a well-known <em>intuitive</em> algorithm, its practical success has been a mystery for theory. 
Our conceptual framework lets us formally show guarantees for representations learnt using such algorithms. 
While shedding light on such algorithms, the framework also lets us come up with and analyze variants of it. 
It also provides insights into what guarantees are provable and shapes the search for new assumptions that would allow stronger guarantees. 
While this is a first cut, possible extensions include imposing a metric structure among the latent classes.
Connections to meta-learning and transfer learning may also arise.
We hope that this framework influences and guides practical implementations in the future.</p></div>

plane graph. In an $\mathcal F$-contact representation of a plane graph $G$,
vertices are realized by internally disjoint elements from a family $\mathcal
F$ of connected geometric objects. Two such elements touch if and only if their
corresponding vertices are adjacent. These touchings also induce the same
embedding as in $G$. In a morph between two $\mathcal F$-contact
representations we insist that at each time step (continuously throughout the
morph) we have an $\mathcal F$-contact representation.
</p>
<p>We focus on the case when $\mathcal{F}$ is the family of triangles in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ that are the lower-right half of axis-parallel rectangles. Such
RT-representations exist for every plane graph and right triangles are one of
the simplest families of shapes supporting this property. Thus, they provide a
natural case to study regarding morphs of contact representations of plane
graphs.
</p>
<p>We study piecewise linear morphs, where each step is a linear morph moving
the endpoints of each triangle at constant speed along straight-line
trajectories. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm that decides whether there
is a piecewise linear morph between two RT-representations of an $n$-vertex
plane triangulation, and, if so, computes a morph with $\mathcal O(n^2)$ linear
morphs. As a direct consequence, we obtain that for $4$-connected plane
triangulations there is a morph between every pair of RT-representations where
the ``top-most'' triangle in both representations corresponds to the same
vertex. This shows that the realization space of such RT-representations of any
$4$-connected plane triangulation forms a connected set.

automata by introducing a new, convenient model, in which, as each input symbol
is read, an interior system of an automaton, known as a configuration,
continues to evolve in a topological space by applying continuous transition
operators one by one. The acceptance and rejection of a given input are
determined by observing the interior system after the input is completely
processed. Such automata naturally generalize 1-way finite automata of various
types, including deterministic, probabilistic, quantum, and pushdown automata.
We examine the strengths and weaknesses of the power of this new automata model
when recognizing formal languages. We investigate tantalizing effects of
various topological features of our topological automata by analyzing their
behaviors when different kinds of topological spaces and continuous maps, which
are used respectively as configuration spaces and transition operators, are

preserved up to a multiplicative $t$ factor. A classical result of Alth\"ofer
et al. is that for every integer $k$ and every graph $G$, there is a
$(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$ with at most $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. But for some
settings the more interesting notion is not the number of edges, but the
degrees of the nodes. This spurred interest in and study of spanners with small
maximum degree. However, this is not necessarily a robust enough objective: we
would like spanners that not only have small maximum degree, but also have
"few" nodes of "large" degree. To interpolate between these two extremes, in
this paper we initiate the study of graph spanners with respect to the
$\ell_p$-norm of their degree vector, thus simultaneously modeling the number
of edges (the $\ell_1$-norm) and the maximum degree (the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm).
We give precise upper bounds for all ranges of $p$ and stretch $t$: we prove
that the greedy $(2k-1)$-spanner has $\ell_p$ norm of at most $\max(O(n),
O(n^{(k+p)/(kp)}))$, and that this bound is tight (assuming the Erd\H{o}s girth
conjecture). We also study universal lower bounds, allowing us to give
"generic" guarantees on the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm which
generalize and interpolate between the known approximations for the $\ell_1$
and $\ell_{\infty}$ norm. Finally, we show that at least in some situations,
the $\ell_p$ norm behaves fundamentally differently from $\ell_1$ or
$\ell_{\infty}$: there are regimes ($p=2$ and stretch $3$ in particular) where
the greedy spanner has a provably superior approximation to the generic
guarantee.

computer vision applications, in which we are given n 2D-3D correspondences
between points in the scene and points in the camera image (some of which are
incorrect associations), and where we aim to determine the camera pose (the
position and orientation of the camera in the scene) from this data. We
demonstrate that this posing problem can be reduced to the problem of computing
{\epsilon}-approximate incidences between two-dimensional surfaces (derived
from the input correspondences) and points (on a grid) in a four-dimensional
pose space. Similar reductions can be applied to other camera pose problems, as
well as to similar problems in related application areas. We describe and
analyze three techniques for solving the resulting {\epsilon}-approximate
incidences problem in the context of our camera posing application. The first
is a straightforward assignment of surfaces to the cells of a grid (of
side-length {\epsilon}) that they intersect. The second is a variant of a
primal-dual technique, recently introduced by a subset of the authors [2] for
different (and simpler) applications. The third is a non-trivial generalization
of a data structure Fonseca and Mount [3], originally designed for the case of
hyperplanes. We present and analyze this technique in full generality, and then
apply it to the camera posing problem at hand. We compare our methods
experimentally on real and synthetic data. Our experiments show that for the
typical values of n and {\epsilon}, the primal-dual method is the fastest, also
in practice.

intersection representation of a set of $n$ curves inside a disk such that one
endpoint of every curve is attached to the boundary of the disk. Given an
outerstring graph representation, the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem of
the underlying graph can be solved in $O(s^3)$ time, where $s$ is the number of
segments in the representation (Keil et al., Comput. Geom., 60:19--25, 2017).
If the strings are of constant size (e.g., line segments, L-shapes, etc.), then
the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ time.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we examine the fine-grained complexity of the MIS problem on
some well-known outerstring representations. We show that solving the MIS
problem on grounded segment and grounded square-L representations is at least
as hard as solving MIS on circle graph representations. Note that no
$O(n^{2-\delta})$-time algorithm, $\delta&gt;0$, is known for the MIS problem on
circle graphs. For the grounded string representations where the strings are
$y$-monotone simple polygonal paths of constant length with segments at
integral coordinates, we solve MIS in $O(n^2)$ time and show this to be the
best possible under the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH). For the
intersection graph of $n$ L-shapes in the plane, we give a $(4\cdot \log
OPT)$-approximation algorithm for MIS (where $OPT$ denotes the size of an
optimal solution), improving the previously best-known $(4\cdot \log
n)$-approximation algorithm of Biedl and Derka (WADS 2017).

\ldots, v_n$, and $n$ tokens with labels $1, 2, \ldots, n$, one on each vertex.
The goal is to get token $i$ to vertex $v_i$ for all $i= 1, \ldots, n$ using a
minimum number of \emph{swaps}, where a swap exchanges the tokens on the
endpoints of an edge.
</p>
<p>Token swapping on a tree, also known as "sorting with a transposition tree",
is not known to be in P nor NP-complete. We present some partial results:
</p>
<p>1. An optimum swap sequence may need to perform a swap on a leaf vertex that
has the correct token (a "happy leaf"), disproving a conjecture of Vaughan.
</p>
<p>2. Any algorithm that fixes happy leaves---as all known approximation
algorithms for the problem do---has approximation factor at least $4/3$.
Furthermore, the two best-known 2-approximation algorithms have approximation
factor exactly 2.
</p>
<p>3. A generalized problem---weighted coloured token swapping---is NP-complete
on trees, but solvable in polynomial time on paths and stars. In this version,
tokens and vertices have colours, and colours have weights. The goal is to get
every token to a vertex of the same colour, and the cost of a swap is the sum
of the weights of the two tokens involved.

The determinant polynomial $Det_n(\mathbf{x})$ of degree $n$ is the determinant of a $n \times n$ matrix of formal variables. A polynomial $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over a field $\mathbf{F}$ if there exists a $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{F})$ such that $f = Det_n(A \cdot \mathbf{x})$. Determinant equivalence test over $\mathbf{F}$ is the following algorithmic task: Given black-box access to a $f \in \mathbf{F}[\mathbf{x}]$, check if $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over $\mathbf{F}$, and if so then output a transformation matrix $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{F})$. In Kayal (2012), a randomized polynomial time determinant equivalence test was given over $\mathbf{C}$. But, to our knowledge, the complexity of the problem over finite fields and over rationals was not well understood. 

In this work, we give a randomized $poly(n,\log |\mathbf{F}|)$ time determinant equivalence test over finite fields $\mathbf{F}$ (under mild restrictions on the characteristic and size of $\mathbf{F}$). Over rationals, we give an efficient randomized reduction from factoring square-free integers to determinant equivalence test for quadratic forms (i.e. the $n=2$ case), assuming GRH. This shows that designing a polynomial-time determinant equivalence test over rationals is a challenging task. Nevertheless, we show that determinant equivalence test over rationals is decidable: For bounded $n$, there is a randomized polynomial-time determinant equivalence test over rationals with access to an oracle for integer factoring. Moreover, for any $n$, there is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that takes input black-box access to a rational polynomial $f$ and if $f$ is equivalent to $Det_n$ over rationals then it returns a $A \in GL(n^2,\mathbf{L})$ such that $f = Det_n(A \cdot \mathbf{x})$, where $\mathbf{L}$ is an extension field of $\mathbf{Q}$ of degree at most $n$. 

The above algorithms over finite fields and over rationals are obtained by giving a polynomial-time randomized reduction from determinant equivalence test to another problem, namely the full matrix algebra isomorphism problem. We also show a reduction in the converse direction which is efficient if $n$ is bounded. These reductions, which hold over any $\mathbf{F}$ (under mild restrictions on the characteristic and size of $\mathbf{F}$), establish a close connection between the complexity of the two problems. This then lead to our results via applications of known results on the full algebra isomorphism problem over finite fields and over $\mathbf{Q}$.</div>

<br />
I took a poll of the theory community (and others) about P vs NP and related issues in 2002, 2012, and 2019 (sorry its not an arithmetic  sequence --- read the third poll article to see why).  The 2002 and 2012 polls are on the web (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper1.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper2.pdf">here</a> ), and now the third poll is out and its <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper3.pdf">here</a> or <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3319627.3319636">here</a> . All three appear in Lane's Complexity Column in SIGACT News.<a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper1.pdf"></a><br />
<br />
I'll give some highlights and thought about the third poll, but for more read the article. Or read all three and see how opinions have changed over time.<br />
<br />
0) How many respondents: 100 the first time, and 152 the second time, 124 the third time.<br />
<br />
1) P≠NP is at about 80%. When restricted to people who have thought about the problem a lot (my judgement) then it goes to 99%. The strongest P≠NP is by Lance who says<br />
<br />
                                People who think P=NP are like people who believe Elvis is alive.<br />
<br />
I disagree. I think Elvis is alive and is trying to prove P=NP.<br />
<br />
2) When will it be solved? 66% thought it would be solved before 2100, a bit more than in prior years. But also more thought it would never be solved. Some commented that a computer might solve it.  I doubt that, but I do think this poll will be done by a computer in 10 years.<br />
<br />
3) Because I used Survey monkey (1) each question got more answers, and (2) most  questions got a forced YES or NO  so less funny comments or room for creative answers. People could still leave comments, and some did.<br />
<br />
4) Related to point (3): The last time I did the poll P=BPP was thought by everyone <i>who answered</i> <i>the question</i>. This year far more people answered it and quite a few thought P≠BPP. This may be because Survey monkey had a psychological affect of making people vote even if they didn't really know (people who have thought a lot about P vs NP  all thought P=BPP). Has  there been evidence that P≠BPP that I am unaware of? Or since there has not been that much progress on it maybe they are unequal.  10  years ago I would have thought we would have L=RL by now.<br />
<br />
5) The last time I did the poll 10 people thought factoring IS in P and the NSA or the KGB knows that. This time around nobody thought that. Why? Those 10 people have vanished mysteriously.<br />
<br />
6) Five people thought P vs NP will be resolved by Harambe. That is more than any person got.<br />
<br />
7)  Is this poll worth doing? I would say yes (gee, I have to having done his poll three times) because it is good to have an objective record of subjective opinion. <br />
<br />
8) I'll give some of my answers: P≠NP, Elvis is dead, and both will be proven in the year 2525. For more about the future see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yesyhQkYrQM">this</a>.<br />

In this paper we study the quantum learnability of constant-depth classical circuits under the uniform distribution and in the distribution-independent framework of PAC learning.  In order to attain our results, we  establish connections between quantum learning and quantum-secure  cryptosystems. We then achieve the following results. 

1) Hardness of learning $AC^0$ and $TC^0$ under the uniform distribution. Our first result concerns the concept class $TC^0$ (resp. $AC^0$), the class of constant depth and polynomial-sized circuits with unbounded fan-in majority gates (resp. AND, OR, NOT gates). We show that if there exists no quantum polynomial time (resp. sub-exponential time) algorithm to solve the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum learning algorithm for $TC^0$ (resp. $AC^0$) under the uniform distribution (even with access to quantum membership queries). The main technique in this result uses explicit pseudo-random generators that are believed to be quantum-secure to construct concept classes that are hard to learn quantumly under the uniform distribution. 


2) Hardness of learning $TC^0_2$ in the PAC setting. Our second result shows that if there exists no quantum polynomial time algorithm for the LWE problem, then there exists no polynomial time quantum PAC learning algorithm for the class $TC^0_2$, i.e., depth-$2$ $TC^0$ circuits. The main technique in this result is to establish a connection between the quantum security of public-key cryptosystems and the learnability of a concept class that consists of decryption functions of the cryptosystem. 


This gives a strong conditional negative answer to one of the "Ten Semi-Grand Challenges for Quantum Computing Theory" raised by Aaronson, who asked if $AC^0$ and $TC^0$ can be PAC-learned in quantum polynomial time.</div>

<p>
Today, the day before St. Patrick’s Day, we ponder universal riddles of existence. Ken, who will visit me this coming week, insisted on reporting what happened this morning.</p>
<p>
I woke up early, walked alone into our living room, and was amazed to see Neil already here. He was looking out the window at dawn sunlight flooding over St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the many other landmarks we can see from our apartment in midtown Manhattan. </p>
<p>
Spring has at last given an earnest of coming. The scene was transfixing, exhilirating, all the glory of nature except for the green-clad little man puffing his pipe with his back to me.</p>
<p>
“Neil—?”</p>
<p>
He turned and tipped his hat to me but then turned back to the window. I wondered if I had caught him in meditation. I stood back until he turned a second time. He had always visited me late on the evening before St. Patrick’s Day, or the morning of it.</p>
<p>
“You’re here early.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Aye. Top o’ the morning to ye.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Why?”</p>
<p>
He gave me a long stare but warmly, not hostile. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“By the living daylights in ye…”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Then I understood. The Romans have their Ides, the Irish have the 17th, but I got the day in between—when last year I was not here but in an operating room for long hours.</p>
<p>
“Thanks” was all I could say. I had actually come out to look up a mathematical idea for a “part 2” post I’ve been struggling with ever since posting the “part 1” years ago. This pulled me back to math, then to how Neil has always tricked me and I’ve never been able to pin him down. I realized this might be my best opportunity.</p>
<p>
“Neil, may I ask you a Big Question? Not directly personal.”</p>
<p>
He simply said, “Aye.” No tricks yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Question </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I had my chance—something I’ve wanted to ask him for years but not had an opening for.</p>
<p>
“Neil, what can you tell me about <em>female</em> Leprechauns?” </p>
<p>
Neil had mentioned family, cousins, even siblings—I figured they had to come from somewhere. But nothing I’d read mentioned female leprechauns. I braced for silence again, but Neil’s reply was immediate and forthright:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“They comprise the most heralded subset of our people. They are included in everything we do.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“How so?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Our society agreed early on that every female leprechaun should have the highest station. All female leprechauns are sent to the best schools, with personal tutoring reserved in advanced subjects. They are our superpartners in every way.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“How do you treat them?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“If a lady leprechaun applies for a position, she is given full consideration. Whenever a lady leprechaun gives advice, it is harkened to. None of us has ever ‘malesplained’ or demeaned a lady leprechaun in any way.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Are they as short—uh, tall—as you?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Every adult female leprechaun is between one cubit and one-and-a-half in stature, like us menfolk. We don’t have quite the variation of your human species.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“I would surely like to meet one.”</p>
<p>
Neil heaved a sigh. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Ye know the trepidation with us and your womenfolk.” Indeed, I recalled Neil’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/17/leprechauns-will-find-you/">story</a> of what was evidently his own harrowing encounter with the wife of William Hamilton. “It is symmetrical, I’m afraid. No female leprechaun has ventured into your world.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I had figured that. </p>
<p>
“But can you give me an <em>example</em> of a female leprechaun? Someone who has done something notable.”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Reality </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Neil puffed on his pipe. I knew I had him cornered and moved in.</p>
<p>
“Neil, is everything you just said about female leprechauns <em>true</em>?”</p>
<p>
To my surprise, he answered quickly.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“<em>Aye.</em> As in mathematics, each of my statements was perfectly true.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Oh. Then I realized how empty domains are treated in mathematical logic. I looked at him sharply. </p>
<p>
“Neil, there <a href="https://thefw.com/things-you-didnt-know-about-leprechauns/">are</a> <a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2019/03/15/art-culture/where-are-all-the-female-leprechauns-we-asked-an-expert">no</a> female leprechauns. All of your statements have been vacuous, bull-.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“That’s not right or fair. That which I told ye have been important values of our society from the beginning. Many studies of female leprechauns have established their natures precisely. We have devoted vast resources to the quest for female leprechauns. Readiness—how we would integrate them—this is enshrined in all of our laws. Even your late Senator, <a>Birch</a> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=O-sOBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT275&amp;lpg=PT275&amp;dq=Bayh+Irish+name&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bECfTQqWkJ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2yp53w6HQk_aXp2uT6okbmEG7Y3w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtzKG6iIfhAhVuQt8KHdB5DmgQ6AEwDnoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bayh Irish name&amp;f=false">Bayh</a>, was <a href="https://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol48/iss1/4/">informed</a> by us at Notre Dame.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Neil’s sincerity was evident. I still felt bamboozled. He carried on.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Ye have whole brilliant careers studying physical objects that may not exist. The analysis of them is still important in mathematics and other scientific applications. And in mathematics itself—”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I was actually relieved to turn the subject back toward mathematics, as Neil and I usually talked about.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“—your most storied advance of the past quarter century was achieved by ten years’ concerted study of the Frey-Hellegouarch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frey_curve">curve</a>. Which by Fermat’s Last Theorem does not exist.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Existence </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I could not argue with that. This set me pondering. Whether mathematical objects <em>exist</em> in reality defines the debate over Platonism. But what, then, is the reality of <em>nonexistent</em> mathematical objects? </p>
<p>
Nonexistent objects still follow rules and aid deductions about objects that do exist. So, they too exist? Moreover, we often cannot prove that those objects do not exist—for all we know they may be just as real. Polynomial-time algorithms for satisfiability and many other problems—those are bread and butter in theory. I wanted Neil to tell me more about some of them.</p>
<p>
“Neil, have your folk worked on the projective plane of order 10?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“<em>Aye</em>. Not only did we long ago have all the results of this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316573900642">paper</a> on them, our engineers recommended it as the thoroughfare pattern for new towns.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“You have built them?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Indeed—in two new districts around Carlingford back home.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“But they don’t exist.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“By our laws and treaties they exist until your people prove they don’t. Then they have a 50-year sunset. Which <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.8684&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">means</a> the towns have 20 years left.<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“That’s sad.”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“It’s actually a much better system than the Scots have. Their villages of this type such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a> come <a href="https://www.glenlaurel.com/about-us/blog/the-legend-of-brigadoon">back</a> every 100 years just for one day. But Brexit may put paid to our two towns sooner. We are <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/travel/leprechauns-protected-european-law">protected</a> under E.U. law, but those towns are just over the Northern Ireland border.<br />

<p>
I pondered: what could I ask about computational complexity that Neil could respond to in this kind of zero-knowledge way? But Neil cut in.</p>
<blockquote><p>

</font>
</p></blockquote>

<p></p><p>
I thought, which could he mean? I recalled the story we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/01/23/definitions-definitions-do-we-need-them/">told</a> about a student getting his degree for a thesis with many new results on a strong kind of Lipschitz/Hölder function even though an examiner observed that non-constant ones do not exist. Ken heard the same story as an undergraduate, with the detail that it was an undergraduate senior thesis, not PhD. The Dirac delta function? Well, that definitely exists as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function#As_a_measure">measure</a>. I forgot an obvious example until Neil said it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“There is the field with one element: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_1}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_1}" />.”
</font></p></blockquote><font color="green">
<p>
Of course. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/do-we-need-mysticism-in-theory/">posted</a> about it. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“It is an active research subject, especially in the past dozen years. Your Fields medalist Alain Connes has co-written a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.2401v1.pdf">whole</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2926">series</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2024">papers</a> on it. Yuri Manin <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1564">also</a>. Your blog friend Henry Cohn got a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407093">paper</a> on it into the <em>Monthly</em>—think of the youngsters… Edifices are even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0069">being</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00209-009-0638-0.pdf">built</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05831">upon</a> it.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
“Can you give some less-obvious ones for our readers?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“There is the uniform distribution on the natural numbers. This <a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/tr/tr814/tr814.pdf">paper</a> gives variations that do exist, but it makes the need and use of the original concept clear.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ken had in fact once finished a lecture on Kolmogorov complexity when short on time by appealing to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“There are fields <i>F</i> whose algebraic closures have degrees 3 and 5 over <i>F</i>. Those are highly useful.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I knew by a <a href="https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/galoistheory/artinschreier.pdf">theorem</a> of Emil Artin and Otto Schreier that they cannot exist. But it struck me as natural that they <em>should</em> exist. I wondered how much one would need to tweak the rules of group theory to make them possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“Then there is the free complete lattice on 3 generators.”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Wait—I thought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_lattice#Free_complete_lattices">that</a> could exist if one loosened up set theory. So I asked:</p>
<p>
“Neil, do some of these objects exist in alternative worlds known to leprechauns in which the rules of mathematics are crazy, not like the real world?”</p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“What makes you think ye don’t live in one of those other worlds?”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Before I could react, Neil picked up a solid glass sphere art object that belonged to Kathryn. He pulled out a diamond-encrusted knife and slashed it as green light flashed in every direction until he stopped. Then from his hands he gave me <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach-Tarski_paradox">two</a> glass spheres of the same size. </p>
<blockquote><p>
<font color="green"><br />
“For the happy couple—<em>la le Padraig suna ye-uv!</em>”<br />
</font>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And he was gone.</p>

<p>It’s the last day of classes for the winter quarter here at UCI, and a good time for some spring cleaning of old bookmarked links.

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>The purpose of this post is mostly just to signal-boost Konstantin Kakaes’s article in MIT <em>Technology Review</em>, entitled <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613123/no-ibm-didnt-just-reverse-time-with-a-quantum-computer/">“No, scientists didn’t just ‘reverse time’ with a quantum computer.”</a>  The title pretty much says it all—but if you want more, you should read the piece, which includes the following droll quote from some guy calling himself “Director of the Quantum Information Center at the University of Texas at Austin”:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If you’re simulating a time-reversible process on your computer, then you can ‘reverse the direction of time’ by simply reversing the direction of your simulation. From a quick look at the paper, I confess that I didn’t understand how this becomes more profound if the simulation is being done on IBM’s quantum computer.</p></blockquote>



<p>Incredibly, the time-reversal claim has now gotten uncritical attention in <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>Discover</em>, <em>Cosmopolitan</em>, my Facebook feed, and elsewhere—hence this blog post, which has basically no content except “the claim to have ‘reversed time,’ by running a simulation backwards, is exactly as true and as earth-shattering as a layperson might think it is.”</p>



<p>If there’s anything interesting here, I suppose it’s just that “scientists use a quantum computer to reverse time” is one of the purest examples I’ve ever seen of a scientific claim that basically amounts to a mind-virus or meme optimized for sharing on social media—discarding all nontrivial “science payload” as irrelevant to its propagation. </p></div>

<p>My 1983 Ph D thesis was on Helly-type theorems which is an exciting part of discrete geometry and, in the last two decades, I have had an ongoing research project with Roy Meshulam on topological Helly-type theorems. The subject found new connections with structural graph theory and <span class="abstract-full has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="1903.00245v1-abstract-full">Gyárfás-type problems, and also with high-dimensional expanders. </span> We already devoted quite a few posts directly and indirectly to Helly-type theorems.</p>
<p>In this post I would like to report on two recent related breakthroughs, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">one by Andreas Holmsen and Dong-Gyu Lee</a>, and the other <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00245">by Andreas Holmsen</a>.

<h3>Helly theorem, colorful Helly, and the Fractional Helly Theorem.</h3>
<p>You can find the statements of Helly theorem, Radon theorem, and the colorful Caratheodory theorem in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/24/sarkarias-proof-of-tverbergs-theorem-1/">this post</a>.  The colorful Helly theorem was first observed by Lovasz. The fractional Helly theorem was first proved by Katchalski and Liu.</p>
<p><strong>The colorful Helly theorem:</strong> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_1%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_2%2C+%5Cdots%2C+%7B%5Ccal+K%7D_%7Bd%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}" class="latex" title="{\cal K}_1, {\cal K}_2, \dots, {\cal K}_{d+1}" /> be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" /> nonempty families of convex sets in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" />. If for every choice of a <em>transversal</em> – one set from every family – there is a point in common to all the chosen sets then for one of the families, there is a point in common to all sets in the family.</p>
<p>[Sorry, I got it wrong first, thanks to Shakhar Smorodinsky for alerting me.<del><span style="color: #555555;"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">]</span></span></del></p>
<p><strong>The fractional Helly theorem:</strong> For every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha &gt;0" class="latex" title="\alpha &gt;0" /> there is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta+%3E0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta &gt;0" class="latex" title="\beta &gt;0" /> such that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_1%2CK_2%2C%5Cdots%2C+K_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_1,K_2,\dots, K_n" class="latex" title="K_1,K_2,\dots, K_n" /> are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> convex sets in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> and at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Calpha&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\alpha" class="latex" title="\alpha" /> fraction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28d%2B1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(d+1)" class="latex" title="(d+1)" />-tuples of the sets have a point in common then a fraction of at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\beta" class="latex" title="\beta" /> of the sets have a point in common.</p>
<p>I should mention that these theorems do not follow combinatorially from Helly’s theorem itself. They manifest deep properties of hypergraphs coming from geometry, and it is an important question to give general abstract properties, combinatorial or topological leading to such properties.</p>
<p>The result of Holmsen and Lee asserts roughly that the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from Radon’s theorem! Holmsen’s result asserts that  the fractional Helly property follows combinatorially from the colorful Helly theorem!</p>
<h2>Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee: Fractional Helly from Radon</h2>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01068">Radon numbers and the fractional Helly theorem</a></p>
<p>Authors: Andreas Holmsen Dong-Gyu Lee</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A basic measure of the combinatorial complexity of a convexity space is its Radon number. In this paper we show a fractional Helly theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number, answering a question of Kalai. As a consequence we also get a weak epsilon-net theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number. This answers a question of Bukh and extends a recent result of Moran and Yehudayoff.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>A result due to Gyárfás, Hubenko, and Solymosi (answering a question of Erdös) states that if a graph G on n vertices does not contain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" title="K_{2,2}" /> as an induced subgraph yet has at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%7B%7Bn%7D+%5Cchoose+%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c{{n} \choose {2}}" class="latex" title="c{{n} \choose {2}}" /> edges, then G has a complete subgraph on at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c%5E2%2F10n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="c^2/10n" class="latex" title="c^2/10n" /> vertices. In this paper we suggest a “higher-dimensional” analogue of the notion of an induced <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=K_%7B2%2C2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="K_{2,2}" class="latex" title="K_{2,2}" /> which allows us to generalize their result to k-uniform hypergraphs. Our result also has an interesting consequence in discrete geometry. In particular, it implies that the fractional Helly theorem can be derived as a purely combinatorial consequence of the colorful Helly theorem.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We show that the Radon number characterizes the existence of weak nets in separable convexity spaces (an abstraction of the euclidean notion of convexity). The construction of weak nets when the Radon number is finite is based on Helly’s property and on metric properties of VC classes. The lower bound on the size of weak nets when the Radon number is large relies on the chromatic number of the Kneser graph. As an application, we prove a boosting-type result for weak <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-6"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-7"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-8">ϵ</span></span></span></span>-nets.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Here's an old trick that we found useful for proving some tight complexity lower bounds. You are given <em>m</em> coins, each of weight either <em>a</em> or <em>b</em>, and a modern scale that can tell you the total weight of any chosen subset of coins. How many weighings do you need to identify which coin is which? Checking each coin individually uses <em>m</em> weighings, but can you do less?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In any weighing, we try some unknown number of weight-<em>a</em> coins between 0 and <em>m</em>, so this results in one of <em>m</em> + 1 possible values, giving us at most log(<em>m</em> + 1) bits of information. In total we need m bits of information to identify each coin, so clearly we will need at least Ω(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) weighings.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It turns out that this many is in fact enough, and this generalizes to various other settings with less restricted weights. This is the basis for two of our recent results: a tight complexity lower bound for Integer Linear Programming with few constraints and for multicoloring (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_coloring#Definitions">b-fold coloring</a>), assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. The trick allows us to use constraints that check the value of some number between 0 and <em>m</em> to indeed extract about log(<em>m</em>) bits of new information from each, in a way that is general enough to check <em>m</em> clauses of a 3-CNF-SAT instance using only <em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) constraints.</p>
<p><span id="more-1071"></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Detecting matrices</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One way to rephrase this coin-weighing problem is as follows: the unknown coin weights are described by a (column) vector <em>x</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>. A subset of coins is described by a characteristic (row) vector <em>v</em> in {0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> and the resulting value of the weighing is the dot product <em>v</em> <strong>·</strong> <em>x</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>For a number of weighings <em>k</em>, the row vectors form a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with <em>k</em> rows and <em>m</em> columns, while the obtained values are simply the <em>k</em>-element vector <em>M x</em>. The condition that these values are enough to identify each entry of <em>x</em> is formalized as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br />
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is called a <em>detecting matrix</em>. In other words, instead of checking x = y entry by entry, it suffices to compare the k entries of M x and M y. (An equivalent definition is to require that the kernel of <em>M</em> is trivial on {-1,0,1}<sup><em>m</em></sup>, since we could instead compare (<em>x</em> - <em>y</em>)/(<em>a</em> - <em>b</em>) with zero). A generalization for <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in {0, 1, …, <em>d</em> - 1}<sup><em>m</em></sup> was first proved by <a href="https://doi.org/10.4153/CMB-1965-034-2">(Lindström 1965)</a> (in fact he proves the constant hidden behind <em>O</em> is 2 log<sub>2</sub>(<em>d</em>) and cannot be improved, for any <em>d</em>), giving a deterministic, poly-time construction. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.162.2327">(Bshouty 2009)</a> gives a more direct and general construction using Fourier analysis. However, a random matrix can be shown to be detecting with fairly elementary methods.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Integer Linear Programming</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In ILP we are given a matrix <em>A</em> with <em>n</em> columns and <em>m</em> rows, a vector <em>b</em> with <em>m</em> entries, and we ask for a vector <em>x</em> with <em>n</em> non-negative integer entries such that <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em>. So each of the <em>m</em> rows is a linear equality to be satisfied. What is the complexity for small <em>m</em>?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We start with an instance <em>A x</em> = <em>b</em> encoding a suitable 3-CNF-SAT instance of size <em>O</em>(<em>m</em>) in a straightforward way, using only {0,1,2,3} entries in <em>A</em> and <em>b</em>. Instead of checking each row individually, we use detecting matrices to check them in bunches, reducing our problem to an equivalent instance <em>M A x</em> = <em>M b</em>. The matrix <em>M A </em>of the new instance has only O(<em>m</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows (at the cost of having larger entries in <em>M b</em>). With some tinkering, this simple reduction shows that, assuming ETH, ILP with <em>m</em> constraints cannot be solved in time 2<sup><em>o</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup>, even when the matrix has only 0-1 entries and <em>b</em> has poly(<em>m</em>) entries. This matches a recent (surprisingly simple and clever!) 2<sup><em>O</em>(<em>m</em> log <em>m</em>)</sup> algorithm by <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3175322">Eisenbrand and Weismantel (SODA 2018)</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>One caveat when applying detecting matrices is that we do not know any bound on one side, <em>A x</em>, except that it is a non-negative integer vector. Fortunately, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s004530010033">(Grebinsky &amp; Kucherov 2000)</a> showed that a random 0-1 matrix satisfies the following:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For all <em>d</em>,<em>m</em>, there is a 0-1 matrix <em>M</em> with k=<em>O</em>(<em>m</em> <em>log</em> <em>d</em> / log <em>m</em>) rows and <em>m</em> columns<br />
such that for any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in ℕ<sup><em>m</em></sup> with ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub> ≤ <em>d</em> <em>m</em>, x ≠ y implies <em>M x</em> ≠ <em>M y</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Here no upper bound on <em>x</em> is needed, because a single row in <em>M</em> full of ones is enough to guarantee that the sum of entries is the same: ‖<em>x</em>‖<sub>1</sub> = ‖<em>y</em>‖<sub>1</sub>. However, it remains an open problem to find a deterministic construction (we work around this by giving a somewhat weaker construction). See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01296.pdf">the full paper (STACS 2019)</a> for details (with Dušan Knop and Michał Pilipczuk). The reduction for <em>multicoloring</em> is quite different and more problem-specific, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03432">the full paper (ESA 2017)</a> for definitions (with Marthe Bonamy, Łukasz Kowalik, Michał Pilipczuk and Arkadiusz Socała).</p>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Semidefinite programming is a powerful tool in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the random hyperplane rounding method of Goemans and Williamson has been extensively studied for more than two decades, resulting in various extensions to the original technique and beautiful algorithms for a wide range of applications. Despite the fact that this approach yields tight approximation guarantees for some problems, like Max Cut, for many others, like Max Sat, Max DiCut, and constraint satisfaction problems with global constraints, the tight approximation ratio is still unknown. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that very few techniques for rounding semi-definite relaxations are known.</p>
<p>In this work, we present a new general and simple method for rounding semi-definite programs, based on Brownian motion. Our approach is inspired by recent results in algorithmic discrepancy theory. We develop and present tools for analyzing our new rounding algorithms, utilizing mathematical machinery from the theory of Brownian motion, complex analysis, and partial differential equations. Focusing on constraint satisfaction problems, we apply our method to several classical problems, including Max Cut, Max 2-Sat, and Max DiCut, and derive new algorithms that are competitive with the best known results. We further show that our algorithms can be used, together with the Sum of Squares hierarchy, to approximate constraint satisfaction problems subject to multiple global cardinality constraints.</p>

If the president of the United States uses "complexity" in a tweet, I can't leave it alone.<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr">
Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better. Split second decisions are....</div>

....needed, and the complexity creates danger. All of this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!</div>

I got my MIT degree in Applied Mathematics so I don't count, but I know plenty of MIT computer scientists and the one undeniable truth is that I don't want any of them flying my plane.<br />
<br />
I also agree with the Donald that a complex environment can often lead to confusion, especially in an emergency. HCI matters.<br />
<br />
But that's where it stops. Better technology in the plane and on the ground, combined with better procedures have all but eliminated deadly major commercial airplane crashes in the US and quite rare in the world at large. I'll call that more than a "little gain". I remember the "old and simpler" days where we had deadly airline crashes every few months. No thanks.<br />
<br />
I've had great discussions with some of the aerospace engineering professors at Georgia Tech. The amount of effort to get the "front-of-the-plane" software right via formal methods and rigorous testings has become harder to engineer than the plane itself. The "back-of-the-plane" software that controls the video screens and WiFi gets less attention. I can live with safety over movies.<br />
<br />
When technology makes things much safer, whether it be planes or self-driving cars, the rare accidents become far more noticeable. while we should use these opportunities to learn and make things safer, the rare accidents help us realize just how much more safer technology can make us.<br /></div>
