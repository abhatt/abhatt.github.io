vital for improving clinical practice and understanding brain oxygen transport.
This is achieved by extracting graph-based representations based on pre-mapping
of vascular structures. Recent graphing methods can provide smooth vessels
trajectories and well-connected vascular topology. However, they require
water-tight surface meshes as inputs. Furthermore, adding vessels radii
information on their graph compartments restricts their alignment along
vascular centerlines. Here, we propose a novel graphing scheme that works with
relaxed input requirements and intrinsically captures vessel radii information.
The proposed approach is based on deforming geometric graphs constructed within
vascular boundaries. Under a laplacian optimization framework, we assign
affinity weights on the initial geometry that drives its iterative contraction
toward vessels centerlines. We present a mechanism to decimate graph structure
at each run and a convergence criterion to stop the process. A refinement
technique is then introduced to obtain final vascular models. Our
implementation is available on https://github.com/Damseh/VascularGraph. We
benchmarked our results with that obtained using other efficient and
stateof-the-art graphing schemes, validating on both synthetic and real
angiograms acquired with different imaging modalities. The experiments indicate
that the proposed scheme produces the lowest geometric and topological error
rates on various angiograms. Furthermore, it surpasses other techniques in
providing representative models that capture all anatomical aspects of vascular
structures.

potential of byte-addressable non-volatile memory (NVM). In this paper, we
attentively investigate the properties of B+-tree and find that, a conventional
B+-tree node is a linear structure in which key-value (KV) pairs are maintained
from the zero offset of the node. These pairs are shifted in a unidirectional
fashion for insertions and deletions. Inserting and deleting one KV pair may
inflict a large amount of write amplifications due to shifting KV pairs. This
badly impairs the performance of in-NVM B+-tree. In this paper, we propose a
novel circular design for B+-tree. With regard to NVM's byte-addressability,
our Circ-tree design embraces tree nodes in a circular structure without a
fixed base address, and bidirectionally shifts KV pairs in a node for
insertions and deletions to minimize write amplifications. We have implemented
a prototype for Circ-Tree and conducted extensive experiments. Experimental
results show that Circ-Tree significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art
in-NVM B+-tree variants, i.e., NV-tree and FAST+FAIR, by up to 1.6x and 8.6x,
respectively, in terms of write performance. The end-to-end comparison by
running YCSB to KV store systems built on NV-tree, FAST+FAIR, and Circ-Tree
reveals that Circ-Tree yields up to 29.3% and 47.4% higher write performance,
respectively, than NV-tree and FAST+FAIR.

is to find a closed figure that is as close as possible to the input figure and
tiles the plane. Koizumi and Sugihara's formulation reduces this problem to an
eigenvalue problem in which the tile and input figures are represented as
$n$-point polygons. In their formulation, the same number of points are
assigned to every tiling edge, which forms a tiling template, to parameterize
the tile shape. By considering all possible configurations for the assignment
of the $n$ points to the tiling edges, we can achieve much flexibility in terms
of the possible tile shapes and the quality of the optimal tile shape improves
drastically, at the cost of enormous computational effort. In this paper, we
propose an efficient algorithm to find the optimal tile shape for this extended
formulation of the Escherization problem.

structures such as k-d trees and bounding volume hierarchies. This paper
compares several recently published hierarchical data structures with regard to
construction and rendering performance. The papers that form our prior work
have primarily focused on interactively building the data structures and only
showed that rendering performance is superior to using simple acceleration data
structures such as uniform grids with macro cells. In the area of surface ray
tracing, there exists a trade-off between construction and rendering
performance of hierarchical data structures. In this paper we present
performance comparisons for several empty space skipping data structures in
order to determine if such a trade-off also exists for volume rendering with
uniform data topologies.

the study of Morse functions, Morse vector fields, and Morse-Smale complexes.
To achieve such a goal, we present MVF Designer, a new interactive design
system that provides fine-grained control over vector field geometry, enables
the editing of vector field topology, and supports a design process in a simple
and efficient way using elementary moves, which are actions that initiate or
advance our design process. Our system allows mathematicians to explore the
complex configuration spaces of Morse functions, their gradients, and their
associated Morse-Smale complexes. Understanding these spaces will help us
expand further their applicability in topological data analysis and
visualization.

according to a general extreme value (GEV) choice model, and the choice
parameters are not given exactly but lie in an uncertainty set. We show that,
when the robust problem is unconstrained and the price sensitivity parameters
are homogeneous, the robust optimal prices have a constant markup over products
and we provide formulas that allow to compute this constant markup by binary
search. We also show that, in the case that the price sensitivity parameters
are only homogeneous in each subset of the products and the uncertainty set is
rectangular, the robust problem can be converted into a deterministic pricing
problem and the robust optimal prices have a constant markup in each subset,
and we also provide explicit formulas to compute them. For constrained pricing
problems, we propose a formulation where, instead of requiring that the
expected sale constraints be satisfied, we add a penalty cost to the objective
function for violated constraints. We then show that the robust pricing problem
with over-expected-sale penalties can be reformulated as a convex optimization
program where the purchase probabilities are the decision variables. We provide
numerical results for the logit and nested logit model to illustrate the
advantages of our approach. Our results generally hold for any arbitrary GEV
model, including the multinomial logit, nested or cross-nested logit.

3-sphere recognition, for which the existence of a polynomial time algorithm
remains unknown. A major algorithmic tool behind some of the best known
algorithms for these problems is normal surface theory.
</p>
<p>One of the key operations in normal surface theory is finding a non-trivial
normal disc or sphere in a 3-dimensional triangulation. Our first result shows
that an algebraic abstraction of this problem is $\mathrm{NP}$-hard, which
(assuming $\mathrm{P} \neq \mathrm{NP}$) suggests that any polynomial time
solution will need to exploit some geometric or topological intuition. Another
key operation used by many topological problems is to find a vertex normal
surface of a certain type. We study two closely-related problems of this type:
one we show is polynomial time, and the other we show is
$\mathrm{NP}$-complete. Most hardness proofs for knots and 3-manifolds in the
literature reduce from satisfiability; our proof reduces from Hamiltonian
cycle, and so adds a new style of reduction to the toolbox for computational
topologists.

descriptor. By encoding the size and prominence of topological features at
varying scales, the PD provides important geometric and topological information
about a space. Recent work has shown that particular sets of PDs can
differentiate between different shapes. This trait is desirable because it
provides a method of representing complex shapes using finite sets of
descriptors. The problem of choosing such a set of representative PDs and then
using them to uniquely determine the shape is referred to as reconstruction. In
this paper, we present an algorithm for reconstructing embedded graphs in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ (plane graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$) with $n$ vertices from $n^2 - n
+ d + 1$ directional PDs. Lastly, we empirically validate the correctness and
time-complexity of our algorithm in $\mathbb{R}^2$ on randomly generated plane
graphs using our implementation, and explain the numerical limitations of
implementing our algorithm.

Today Ken and I discuss predicting the end to mathematical conjectures. This is apart from considering odds on which way they will go, which we also talk about.</p>
<p>
Nine years ago the Christmas issue of the <em>New Scientist</em> magazine analyzed a small set of solved mathematical conjectures and used it to forecast when the P vs. NP conjecture would be solved.

The <b>2010</b> <em>New Scientist</em> article could be considered a bagatelle since they looked at only 18 conjectures, but Hisano and Sornette took the idea seriously.

They removed a dozen-plus conjectures whose origin dates and/or solution dates are not firmly known, leaving 144 conjectures: 60 solved and 84 still open as of <b>2012</b>. </p>
<p>
It should be understood that their conclusions about the whole enterprise are negative. They say in their abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We find however evidence that the mathematical process of creation is too much non-stationary, with too little data and constraints, to allow for a meaningful conclusion. … In conclusion we cannot really reject the simplest model of an exponential rate of conjecture proof with a rate of 0.01/year for the dataset that we have studied, translating into an average waiting time to proof of 100 years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
They found exponential growth in notable conjectures being formulated, which they ascribe to growth in the number of mathematicians. They try adjusting for this by invoking the overall growth curve of the world population. </p>
<p>
Then they find a dearth of conjectures with midrange solution times, compared to the number needed to give strong fits to simple models. They try cutting quickly-resolved conjectures (ones solved in under 20 years) from the dataset to improve the fits, and obtain only an enhancement of evidence for a slow exponential curve of solution time. Here is a figure from their paper showing the exponential curves:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/conjplot.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/conjplot.jpg?w=345&amp;h=360" alt="" width="345" class="aligncenter wp-image-16486" height="360" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
In the end they are not able to find many hard distinctions between possible models. Most in particular, they conclude by calling the simple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.01}" class="latex" title="{0.01}" />-solution-chance-per-year model “our best model.”</p>
<p>
But that model in turn, without memory of the age of the conjecture, struck me—Ken writing here—as running counter to a famous controversial argument of recent vintage. So Dick and I put our heads together again…</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Doomsday For Conjectures? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">Doomsday</a> <a href="http://www.anthropic-principle.com/?q=anthropic_principle/doomsday_argument">Argument</a> can be phrased as a truism:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If your hearing about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> is a uniformly random event in the lifespan of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />, which began <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> years ago, then the odds are 50-50 that the future lifetime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> will be no less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B3%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{t}{3}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{t}{3}}" /> years and no more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3t%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3t}" class="latex" title="{3t}" /> years. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This extends to say the probability is 90% that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> will be no less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B19%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{t}{19}}" class="latex" title="{\frac{t}{19}}" /> and no more than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B19t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{19t}" class="latex" title="{19t}" />. The numbers come from considering the middle half or middle 90% of the span.</p>
<p>
The key word in our phrasing is <em>if</em>—if your cognizance is a uniformly random event of the lifespan. The argument’s force comes from taking your birthday as a random event in the span of humanity. We can adjust for the population growth curve and our ignorance of prehistoric times by taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> to be your ordinal in human lives ordered by birthday and projecting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BT%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{T}" class="latex" title="{T}" /> in the same units. If there were 50 billion people before you, this speaks 95% confidence that the sum of human lives will not reach a trillion.</p>
<p>
We can try the same reasoning on conjectures. Suppose you just learned about the P vs. NP problem from catching a reference to this blog. By Kurt Gödel’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/the-gdel-letter/">letter</a> to John von Neumann we date the problem to <b>1956</b>, which makes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+63%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t = 63}" class="latex" title="{t = 63}" /> years. Presuming your encounter is random, you can conclude a 50-50 chance of the conjecture being solved between the years <b>2040</b> (which is 21 years from now) and <b>2208</b> (which is still shorter than Fermat’s Last Theorem lasted). The less you knew about P vs. NP, the more random the encounter—and the stronger the inference.</p>
<p>
Perhaps Wikipedia’s <b>1971</b> origin for P vs. NP from its precise statement by Steve Cook is more realistic. Was my learning about it in <b>1979</b> (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t=8}" class="latex" title="{t=8}" />) a random event? If so, I should have been 75% confident of a solution by <b>2003</b>. Its lasting 16 more years and counting busts the 83.3% confidence interval. Well, Dick learned about it within weeks, at most months, after inception. If that was random then its longevity counts as a 99.9% miss. Of course, Dick’s learning about it was far from random. But.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Doomsday Conflict </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our point, however, is this: Consider <em>any</em> conjecture that has lasted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+87%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t = 87}" class="latex" title="{t = 87}" /> years. That’s the point at which the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.01%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.01}" class="latex" title="{0.01}" /> exponential and Doomsday models come into conflict:</p>
<ul>
<li>
By Doomsday, there is 75% confidence of the conjecture lasting at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7Bt%7D%7B3%7D+%3D+29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\frac{t}{3} = 29}" class="latex" title="{\frac{t}{3} = 29}" /> more years. <p></p>
</li><li>
But since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.99%5E%7B29%7D+%3C+0.75%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.99^{29} &lt; 0.75}" class="latex" title="{0.99^{29} &lt; 0.75}" />, by the H-S best model, one should have less confidence.
</li></ul>
<p>
The longer a conjecture lasts, the greater this conflict. We are not addressing the issue of uniform sampling over the lifespan of the conjecture, but this conflict applies to <b>all</b> observers past the 87-year mark. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_conjecture">honeycomb</a> conjecture was documented by 36 BCE and finally solved by Thomas Hales in <b>1999</b>. </p>
<p>
Note that since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.99%5E%7B87%7D+%3D+0.417%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.99^{87} = 0.417\dots}" class="latex" title="{0.99^{87} = 0.417\dots}" />, one cannot evade our model conflict by saying only a small fraction of conjectures last that long. Despite H-S noting that the honeycomb conjecture and Fermat and some others break their curve, their curve at left below shows excellent agreement up to and beyond the 100-year mark. </p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/hsfigs5-6.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/hsfigs5-6.png?w=600&amp;h=298" alt="" width="600" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-16487" height="298" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The curve at right shows that a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.02%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.02}" class="latex" title="{0.02}" /> rate fits even better when short-lived conjectures are deleted. Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.98%5E%7B14.33%7D+%3C+0.75%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.98^{14.33} &lt; 0.75}" class="latex" title="{0.98^{14.33} &lt; 0.75}" />, that makes the conflict set in at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+43%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t = 43}" class="latex" title="{t = 43}" /> years old. Then it applies even for P vs. NP dated to Cook. At <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt+%3D+100%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t = 100}" class="latex" title="{t = 100}" /> the conflict is considerable: Doomsday 66.7% of its lasting at least 50 more years, versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.98%5E%7B50%7D+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Be%7D+%5Capprox+36.4%5C%25%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.98^{50} \approx \frac{1}{e} \approx 36.4\%}" class="latex" title="{0.98^{50} \approx \frac{1}{e} \approx 36.4\%}" /> chance of its lasting that long by H-S.</p>
<p>
This conflict says there must be a factor that invalidates either or both lines of reasoning. But the Hisano-Sornette estimates are supported by data, while our Doomsday representation is quite generic. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Do Odds Matter? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A further wrinkle is whether the collective balance of opinion on whether a conjecture is true or false has any bearing. If the field is evenly divided, does that argue that the conjecture will take longer to resolve?</p>
<p>
The idea of “odds” is hard to quantify and has come into play only recently. Despite <a href="http://blog.oddhead.com/2010/08/11/betting-on-p-equals-np/">lots</a> of <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/12/probability-of-pnp.html">chat</a> about <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/09/15/theory-has-bet-on-pnp/">betting</a> on P vs. NP, and Bill Gasarch’s wonderful <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/pollpaper3.pdf">polls</a> on which side is true, data for other problems is scant. </p>
<p>
This prompts us to mention that the Springer LNCS 10,000 anniversary <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9">volume</a> came out in October. It includes a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_12">contribution</a> by Ken titled, “Rating Computer Science Via Chess”—the title refers both to how the chess ratings of the best chess computers mirrored Moore’s Law and how they draw on many general CS achievements in both hardware and software. For now we note also the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_2">contribution</a> by Ryan Williams titled, “Some Estimated Likelihoods for Computational Complexity.” Ryan places only 80% on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" /> and puts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNC%7D%5E1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NC}^1}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NC}^1}" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BTC%5E0%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{TC^0}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{TC^0}}" /> at 50-50. </p>
<p>
There are also non-betting and non-opinion senses in which conjectures are regarded as “almost certainly true.” We recently <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/goldbach-a-curious-conjecture/">posted</a> about this. Perhaps something more can be gleaned from highlighting those conjectures in the H-S data set to which such criteria apply.</p>
<p>
All of this speculation may be less idle and less isolated if it can be carried over to unsolved problems in other walks of life. Corporations and consortia doing open-ended research may already need to quantify the average time to achieve potential breakthroughs—or dismiss them—because they deal with many “feelers” at a time. The Doomsday assumption of random encounters probably doesn’t apply there. But there could be large-scale tests of it by “punters” seeking out random lifespans they can bet on, such as runs of shows or the time to make a movie of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/12/20/biggest-disaster-decade-roundup-most-memorable-cats-reviews/"><i>Cats</i></a>, and profit by applying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What do you think about attempts to forecast the time to solve P vs. NP, or to forecast breakthroughs on larger scales? </p>
<p>
There are many rebuttals to the Doomsday Argument, some general and some context-specific. Is our argument that it conflicts generally with memoryless exponential models subsumed by any of them?</p>

<div class="content">
Randomness extraction is a fundamental problem that has been studied for over three decades. A well-studied setting assumes that one has access to multiple independent weak random sources, each with some entropy. However, this assumption is often unrealistic in practice. In real life, natural sources of randomness can produce samples with no entropy at all or with unwanted dependence. Motivated by this and applications from cryptography, we initiate a systematic study of randomness extraction for the class of adversarial sources defined as follows.

A weak source $\mathbf{X}$ of the form $\mathbf{X}_1,...,\mathbf{X}_N$, where each $\mathbf{X}_i$ is on $n$ bits, is an $(N,K,n,k)$-source of locality $d$ if the following hold:

(1) Somewhere good sources: at least $K$ of the $\mathbf{X}_i$'s are independent, and each contains min-entropy at least $k$. We call these $\mathbf{X}_i$'s good sources, and their locations are unknown. (2) Bounded dependence: each remaining (bad) source can depend arbitrarily on at most $d$ good sources.

We focus on constructing extractors with negligible error, in the regime where most of the entropy is contained within a few sources instead of across many (i.e., $k$ is at least polynomial in $K$). In this setting, even for the case of $0$-locality, very little is known prior to our work. For $d \geq 1$, essentially no previous results are known. We present various new extractors for adversarial sources in a wide range of parameters, and some of our constructions work for locality $d = K^{\Omega(1)}$. As an application, we also give improved extractors for small-space sources.

The class of adversarial sources generalizes several previously studied classes of sources, and our explicit extractor constructions exploit tools from recent advances in extractor machinery, such as two-source non-malleable extractors and low-error condensers. Thus, our constructions can be viewed as a new application of non-malleable extractors. In addition, our constructions combine the tools from extractor theory in a novel way through various sorts of explicit extremal hypergraphs. These connections leverage recent progress in combinatorics, such as improved bounds on cap sets and explicit constructions of Ramsey graphs, and may be of independent interest.</div>

combinatorial optimisation problems. The computational complexity of VCSPs
depends on the set of allowed cost functions in the input. Recently, the
computational complexity of all VCSPs for finite sets of cost functions over
finite domains has been classified. Many natural optimisation problems,
however, cannot be formulated as VCSPs over a finite domain. We initiate the
systematic investigation of infinite-domain VCSPs by studying the complexity of
VCSPs for piecewise linear homogeneous cost functions. Such VCSPs can be solved
in polynomial time if the cost functions are improved by fully symmetric
fractional operations of all arities. We show this by reducing the problem to a
finite-domain VCSP which can be solved using the basic linear program
relaxation. It follows that VCSPs for submodular PLH cost functions can be
solved in polynomial time; in fact, we show that submodular PLH functions form
a maximally tractable class of PLH cost functions.

play a crucial role in cryptographic constructions. In 2013, Bernstein,
Jeffery, Lange and Meurer constructed a quantum subset sum algorithm with
heuristic time complexity $2^{0.241n}$, by enhancing the classical random
subset sum algorithm of Howgrave-Graham and Joux with a quantum walk technique.
In 2018, Helm and May improved heuristic running time and memory to
$2^{0.226n}$ by quantizing the classical Becker, Coron and Joux algorithm. In
our paper, we get a new quantum algorithm with running time down to
$\widetilde{O}(2^{0.209n})$ for all but a negligible fraction of random subset
sum instances by combining the classical sampling and quantum walks.

effective solution for the purpose of implementing DNNs on edge devices such as
mobiles, ASICs and FPGAs, because they have no sufficient resources to support
computation involving millions of high precision weights and
multiply-accumulate operations. This paper proposes a novel method to compress
vectors of high precision weights of DNNs to ternary vectors, namely a cosine
similarity based target non-retraining ternary (TNT) compression method. Our
method leverages cosine similarity instead of Euclidean distances as commonly
used in the literature and succeeds in reducing the size of the search space to
find optimal ternary vectors from 3N to N, where N is the dimension of target
vectors. As a result, the computational complexity for TNT to find
theoretically optimal ternary vectors is only O(N log(N)). Moreover, our
experiments show that, when we ternarize models of DNN with high precision
parameters, the obtained quantized models can exhibit sufficiently high
accuracy so that re-training models is not necessary.

MPSoC systems often deliver overly pessimistic and thus suboptimal results
w.r.t. exploiting time slack in order to minimize the energy consumption. This
holds true in particular in case computation times of tasks may be
workload-dependent and becoming known only at runtime or in case of
conditionally executed tasks or scenarios. This paper studies and
quantitatively evaluates different classes of algorithms for scheduling
periodic applications given by task graphs (i.e., DAGs) with precedence
constraints and a global deadline on homogeneous MPSoCs purely at runtime on a
per-instance base. We present and analyze algorithms providing provably optimal
results as well as approximation algorithms with proven guarantees on the
achieved energy savings. For problem instances taken from realistic embedded
system benchmarks as well as synthetic scalable problems, we provide results on
the computation time and quality of each algorithm to perform a) scheduling and
b) voltage/speed assignments for each task at runtime. In our portfolio, we
distinguish as well continuous and discrete speed (e.g., DVFS-related)
assignment problems. In summary, the presented ties between theory (algorithmic
complexity and optimality) and execution time analysis deliver important
insights on the practical usability of the presented algorithms for runtime
optimization of task scheduling and speed assignment on MPSoCs.

decomposition of a graph of bounded treewidth can be found in linear time. The
algorithm is based on an algorithm of Bodlaender and Kloks that computes an
optimal tree decomposition given a non-optimal tree decomposition of bounded
width. Both algorithms, in particular the second, are hardly accessible. In our
review, we present them in a much simpler way than the original presentations.
In our description of the second algorithm, we start by explaining how all tree
decompositions of subtrees defined by the nodes of the given tree decomposition
can be enumerated. We group tree decompositions into equivalence classes
depending on the current node of the given tree decomposition, such that it
suffices to enumerate one tree decomposition per equivalence class and, for
each node of the given tree decomposition, there are only a constant number of
classes which can be represented in constant space. Our description of the
first algorithm further simplifies Perkovic and Reed's simplification.

are executed in parallel by the underlying engine, isolating developers from

connected components, minimum spanning trees, or graph spectra. Finally, Slim
Graph uses statistical divergences and other metrics to analyze the accuracy of
lossy graph compression. We illustrate both theoretically and empirically that
Slim Graph accelerates numerous graph algorithms, reduces storage used by graph

provides a direct approach to decomposing the exponential of a sum of
operators. Despite significant effort, the error scaling of such product
formulas remains poorly understood. We develop a theory of Trotter error that
overcomes the limitations of prior approaches based on truncating the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. Our analysis directly exploits the
commutativity of operator summands, producing tighter error bounds for both
real- and imaginary-time evolutions. Whereas previous work achieves similar
goals for systems with geometric locality or Lie-algebraic structure, our
approach holds in general. We give a host of improved algorithms for digital
quantum simulation and quantum Monte Carlo methods, including simulations of
second-quantized plane-wave electronic structure, $k$-local Hamiltonians,
rapidly decaying power-law interactions, clustered Hamiltonians, the transverse
field Ising model, and quantum ferromagnets, nearly matching or even
outperforming the best previous results. We obtain further speedups using the
fact that product formulas can preserve the locality of the simulated system.
Specifically, we show that local observables can be simulated with complexity
independent of the system size for power-law interacting systems, which implies
a Lieb-Robinson bound as a byproduct. Our analysis reproduces known tight
bounds for first- and second-order formulas. Our higher-order bound
overestimates the complexity of simulating a one-dimensional Heisenberg model
with an even-odd ordering of terms by only a factor of $5$, and is close to
tight for power-law interactions and other orderings of terms. This suggests
that our theory can accurately characterize Trotter error in terms of both
asymptotic scaling and constant prefactor.

<div class="content">
We initiate a comprehensive study of the question of randomness extractions from two somewhat dependent sources of defective randomness. 
Specifically, we present three natural models, which are based on different natural perspectives on the notion of bounded dependency between a pair of distributions.
Going from the more restricted model to the less restricted one, our models and main results are as follows. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\em Bounded dependence as bounded coordination}:
Here we consider pairs of distributions that arise from independent random processes that are applied to the outcome of a single global random source, which may be viewed as a mechanism of coordination (which is adversarial from our perspective). 

We show that if the min-entropy of each of the two outcomes is larger than the length of the global source, then extraction is possible (and is, in fact, feasible). We stress that the extractor has no access to the global random source nor to the internal randomness that the two processes use, but rather gets only the two dependent outcomes.

This model is equivalent to a setting in which the two outcomes are generated by two independent sources, but then each outcome is modified based on limited leakage (equiv., communication) between the two sources.  (Here this leakage is measured in terms of the number of bits that were communicated, but in the next model we consider the actual influence of this leakage.)

\item{\em Bounded dependence as bounded cross influence}:
Here we consider pairs of outcomes that are produced by a pair of sources such that each source has bounded (worst-case) influence on the outcome of the other source.  We stress that the extractor has no access to the randomness that the two processes use, but rather gets only the two dependent outcomes.

We show that, while (proper) randomness extraction is impossible in this case, randomness condensing is possible and feasible; specifically, the randomness deficiency of condensing is linear in our measure of cross influence, and this upper-bound is tight.  We also discuss various applications of such condensers, including for cryptography, standard randomized algorithms, and sublinear-time algorithms, while pointing out their benefit over using a seeded (single-source) extractor. 

\item{\em Bounded dependence as bounded mutual information}:
Due to the average-case nature of this mutual information, here there is a trade-off between the error (or deviation) probability and the randomness deficiency.  Loosely speaking, for joint distributions of mutual information $t$, we can condense with randomness deficiency $O(t/\epsilon)$ and error $\epsilon$, and this trade-off is optimal.  
\end{enumerate}
All positive results are obtained by using a standard two-source extractor (or condenser) as a black-box.</div>

<div class="content">
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recam%C3%A1n%27s_sequence">Recamán’s sequence</a> is a sequence of natural numbers in which the zeroth number is zero and the th number adds or subtracts  from the previous number, subtracting if that would lead to a new value and adding otherwise. It was popularized in a 2018 Numberphile video that showed both an interesting visualization of it using nested circles and a spooky piano composition obtained by using its values as notes.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://oeis.org/A005132">the OEIS entry for this sequence</a> Benjamin Chaffin claims to have computed and plotted its first  numbers. Can it really be done this fast?
And until recently, the sequence’s Wikipedia article claimed that when computing this sequence, each number takes  time to compute, sourced to the analysis in <a href="https://blogs.mathworks.com/cleve/2018/07/09/the-oeis-and-the-recaman-sequence/">a blog post with a MATLAB implementation</a>. Can it really be this slow?</p>

<p>In analyzing the complexity of computing integer sequences, it’s often important to consider numerical precision. The standard computational model used for algorithm analysis, the unit-cost RAM, allows constant-time arithmetic on -bit integers, enough to allow the model to index its memory. Models of computing with larger word sizes are less standard. And some sequences need linearly many bits just to represent a single sequence value, too many to handle in constant time. But that’s not an issue for Recamán’s sequence. Even a sequence that always added  at each step, rather than sometimes, subtracting, would grow at most quadratically, allowing the first  numbers to be computed using only -bit arithmetic.</p>

<p>Using this model, we can analyze a naive algorithm for the sequence that directly implements its recurrence while maintaining a set data structure to keep track of what has been seen already.</p>

<p>If sets are represented using hash tables with provable constant expected time per operation (say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing#Choice_of_hash_function">linear probing with tabulation hashing</a>), then this takes constant expected time per number, or  for the first  numbers. So much for being quadratic. Alternatively, if we knew that the sequence grew only linearly, we could avoid hashing and expected time analysis by using a bitvector to get deterministic constant time per number.</p>

<p>So the next question to ask is: does the sequence grow only linearly, or more quickly? Before running an experiment to test this, my intuition was that if the choice to add or subtract were uniformly random, then the sequence would grow like a random walk, typically  steps away from the origin, which with step size  would give growth . On the other hand, to achieve equal probability of going up or down you need roughly half of the integers to be visited, and for that to happen the sequence should grow only as . For any faster growth rate, the density of visited integers would be less than half and the sequence would be pulled downward. So I expected that the true growth rate should be at a level where the upward pressure of a uniform random walk and the downward pressure of less-than-half occupancy balance each other, but I didn’t have a strong a priori feeling whether this meant linear growth (with constant but somewhat less than half occupancy) or slightly superlinear growth.</p>

<p>This is something we can check experimentally, so I used the naive algorithm to generate a quarter-billion sequence elements, sampled them down to 629 pairs of  by keeping only elements at cubic positions, and fit a line to their log-log plot using Siegel’s repeated median estimator in R. The result has weird stripy patterns that don’t look much like a line, but its exponent looks a lot like a 1 to me.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/recaman/density.png" alt="Log-log plot of samples from Recamán's sequence" /></p>

<p>We can get a cleaner curve (and a more informative picture of how big a bitvector we might need) by plotting only the points where the sequence reaches a new high point. There were too many data points to fit easily, so I thinned them out by including only high points that were half a percent higher than the previous one, giving me 254 data points. To look more carefully at near-linear growth rates, I plotted  against  this time. Again, the results had weird stripy patterns that I didn’t expect (I thought filtering for the high points would have eliminated that), but the plot seems to clearly show that the growth rate of the sequence is nonlinear. Although the fit line shows growth of the form , I don’t think the data is clear enough to conclude that this is the right growth rate.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/recaman/highpoint.png" alt="Plot of high points of Recamán's sequence, divided by n" /></p>

<p>So, sadly, the bitvector solution doesn’t appear to give us a deterministic solution with constant time per element. It takes a nonlinear amount of time to initialize a nonlinear number of bits. Maybe instead some deterministic choice of hash function allows the hashing solution to work without randomization, but proving that seems difficult. On the other hand there’s a lot of other structure in the sequence. Maybe we can take advantage of it and get even faster, computing an implicit representation of the sequence (rather than an explicit list of each of its elements) in time sublinear in the number of elements generated? Surely, if the claim of having generated  elements is to be believed, this must be possible.</p>

<p>A hint comes from the plots in the MATLAB post showing that Recamán’s sequence contains long alternations between addition and subtraction that fill in two contiguous blocks of integers. A comment by Jan Van lent from <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2016/06/12/the-recaman-sequence/">a 2016 blog post on <em>The Math Less Traveled</em></a> suggests that there should be few (maybe ) of these blocks, and that we can save space using a data structure that stores blocks rather than individual numbers. This would have advantages even in the naive algorithm: when I tried bumping my data sets to a full billion elements they bogged down, not because I didn’t have enough time to run four times slower, but because I ran out of memory for the hash table.</p>

<p>We can use a data structure that allows for integer predecessor queries to store only the starting endpoints of each block of occupied integers, associating with each start the end of the same block. Then, we could test whether a query integer  is in one of the blocks by finding the predecessor of  (the first block start at or before ) and checking whether its block extends as far as . A similar but more complicated calculation could also be used, for each sequence element, to find the length of the alternation starting at that element (stopping the alternation when the negative steps in the alternation run into another block), and then to update the collection of blocks to cover all of the elements encountered during this alternation. The obvious choice of predecessor data structure would be a balanced binary search tree, but (because we’re dealing with integers of polynomial magnitude) it’s better in theory to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Emde_Boas_tree">Van Emde Boas tree</a>, which can handle each data structure operation in time . If we generate Recamán’s sequence one alternation at a time in this way, and it has  alternations and  blocks in its first  elements, then the improved generation algorithm will take time  and space . I have a VEB-tree implementation, but it lacks predecessor queries, and four times more elements are only a small step on my log plots, so I haven’t tested this. But we can still use the naive algorithm to compute  and  and study how they grow. Here, first, is .</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/recaman/alternations.png" alt="Plot of number of alternating subsequences of Recamán's sequence" /></p>

<p>The number of alternations looks like a reasonable fit for .
The number of blocks can be at most twice the number of alternations, but it could well be smaller as blocks coalesce after they are formed. The plot of numbers of blocks looks almost the same as the one above, so instead I plotted a ratio. I don’t think the fit line in the plot is particularly convincing. Nevertheless to me this looks like  and  have the same exponent but differ by a lower-order factor like a log or log-log.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/recaman/blocks.png" alt="Plot of ratio of alternating subsequences to contiguous occupied blocks for Recamán's sequence" /></p>

<p>So what have we learned?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Even the obvious hashtable-based methods can achieve constant expected time per element. But their limiting factor is memory, not time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s tempting to use bitvectors instead, and that might not be a bad choice in practice, but in theory that appears to take more than constant time per element. Deterministic hashing might take constant time per element but this is unproven.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Generating the sequence implicitly in terms of its alternations, and using a data structure that represents the generated elements in terms of their blocks, looks like it can achieve something like  in both time and space,
but again this is unproven.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This is still not anywhere near fast enough to get  elements, nor even  as the largest generated value. So either something is wrong with that claim (most likely a typo in the number of elements), or there are significant algorithmic improvements possible beyond just using alternations and blocks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Also, last week, I attended the <a href="https://q2b.qcware.com/">Q2B</a> conference in San Jose, where a central theme was the outlook for practical quantum computing in the wake of the first clear demonstration of quantum computational supremacy.  Thanks to the folks at <a href="https://qcware.com/">QC Ware</a> for organizing a fun conference (full disclosure: I’m QC Ware’s Chief Scientific Advisor).  I’ll have more to say about the actual scientific things discussed at Q2B in future posts.</p>



<p>None of that is why you’re here, though.  You’re here because of the battle over “quantum supremacy.”</p>



<p>A week ago, my good friend and <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk-3">collaborator</a> Zach Weinersmith, of <a href="http://smbc-comics.com/">SMBC Comics</a>, put out a <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/classical">cartoon</a> with a dark-curly-haired scientist named “Dr. Aaronson,” who’s revealed on a hot mic to be an evil “quantum supremacist.”  Apparently a rush job, this cartoon is far from Zach’s finest work.  For one thing, if the character is supposed to be me, why not draw him as me, and if he isn’t, why call him “Dr. Aaronson”?  In any case, I learned from talking to Zach that the cartoon’s timing was purely coincidental: Zach didn’t even <em>realize</em> what a hornet’s-nest he was poking with this.</p>



<p>Ever since John Preskill <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5813">coined</a> it in 2012, “quantum supremacy” has been an awkward term.  Much as I admire John Preskill’s wisdom, brilliance, generosity, and good sense, in physics as in everything else—yeah, “quantum supremacy” is not a term I would’ve coined, and it’s certainly not a hill I’d choose to die on.  Once it had gained common currency, though, I sort of took a liking to it, mostly because I realized that I could mine it for dark one-liners in my talks.</p>



<p>The thinking was: even as white supremacy was making its horrific resurgence in the US and around the world, here we were, physicists and computer scientists and mathematicians of varied skin tones and accents and genders, coming together to pursue a different and better kind of supremacy—a small reflection of the better world that we still believed was possible.  You might say that we were <strong>reclaiming</strong> the word “supremacy”—which, after all, just means a state of being supreme—for something non-sexist and non-racist and inclusive and good.</p>



<p>In the world of 2019, alas, perhaps it was inevitable that people wouldn’t leave things there.</p>



<p>My first intimation came a month ago, when <a href="https://twitter.com/LeonieMueck?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Leonie Mueck</a>—someone who I’d gotten to know and like when she was an editor at <em>Nature</em> handling quantum information papers—emailed me about her view that our community should abandon the term “quantum supremacy,” because of its potential to make women and minorities uncomfortable in our field.  She advocated using “quantum advantage” instead.</p>



<p>So I sent Leonie back a friendly reply, explaining that, as the father of a math-loving 6-year-old girl, I understood and shared her concerns—but also, that I also didn’t know an alternative term that really worked.</p>



<p>See, it’s like this.  Preskill meant “quantum supremacy” to refer to a <em>momentous event</em> that seemed likely to arrive in a matter of years: namely, the moment when programmable quantum computers would first outpace the ability of the fastest classical supercomputers on earth, running the fastest algorithms known by humans, to simulate what the quantum computers were doing (at least on special, contrived problems).  And … “the historic milestone of quantum advantage”?  It just doesn’t sound right.  Plus, as many others pointed out, the term “quantum advantage” is already used to refer to … well, quantum <em>advantages</em>, which might fall well short of supremacy.</p>



<p>But one could go further.  Suppose we did switch to “quantum advantage.”  Couldn’t that term, too, remind vulnerable people about the unfair advantages that some groups have over others?  Indeed, while “advantage” is certainly subtler than “supremacy,” couldn’t that make it all the more insidious, and therefore dangerous?</p>



<p>Oblivious though I sometimes am, I realized Leonie would be unhappy if I offered that, because of my wholehearted agreement, I would henceforth never again call it “quantum supremacy,” but only “quantum superiority,” “quantum dominance,” or “quantum hegemony.”</p>



<p>But maybe you now see the problem.  What word does the English language provide to describe one thing <em>decisively beating or</em> <em>being better than</em> a different thing for some purpose, and which <em>doesn’t</em> have unsavory connotations?</p>



<p>I’ve heard “quantum ascendancy,” but that makes it sound like we’re a UFO cult—waiting to ascend, like ytterbium ions caught in a laser beam, to a vast quantum computer in the sky.</p>



<p>I’ve heard “quantum inimitability” (that is, inability to imitate using a classical computer), but who can pronounce that?</p>



<p>Yesterday, my brilliant former student <a href="https://ewintang.com/">Ewin Tang</a> (yes, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3880">that one</a>) relayed to me a suggestion by Kevin Tian: “quantum eclipse” (that is, the moment when quantum computers first eclipse classical ones for some task).  But would one want to speak of a “quantum eclipse experiment”?  And shouldn’t we expect that, the cuter and cleverer the term, the harder it will be to use unironically?</p>



<p>In summary, while someone <em>might</em> think of a term so inspired that it immediately supplants “quantum supremacy” (and while I welcome suggestions), I currently regard it as an open problem.</p>



<p>Anyway, evidently dissatisfied with my response, last week Leonie teamed up with 13 others to publish a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03781-0">letter in <em>Nature</em></a>, which was originally entitled “Supremacy is for racists—use ‘quantum advantage,'” but whose title I see has now been changed to the less inflammatory “Instead of ‘supremacy’ use ‘quantum advantage.'”  Leonie’s co-signatories included four of my good friends and colleagues: Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Helmut Katzgraber, Anne Broadbent, and Chris Granade (the last of whom got started in the field by helping me edit <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565"><em>Quantum Computing Since Democritus</em></a>).</p>



<p>(<strong>Update:</strong> Leonie pointed me to a longer list of signatories <a href="https://www.quantumresponsibility.org/openletter">here</a>, at their website called “quantumresponsibility.org.”  A few names that might be known to <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> readers are Andrew White, David Yonge-Mallo, Debbie Leung, Matt Leifer, Matthias Troyer.)</p>



<p>Their letter says:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The community claims that quantum supremacy is a technical term with a specified meaning.  However, any technical justification for this descriptor could get swamped as it enters the public arena after the intense media coverage of the past few months.</p><p>In our view, ‘supremacy’ has overtones of violence, neocolonialism and racism through its association with ‘white supremacy’.  Inherently violent language has crept into other branches of science as well — in human and robotic spaceflight, for example, terms such as ‘conquest’, ‘colonization’ and ‘settlement’ evoke the <em>terra nullius</em> arguments of settler colonialism and must be contextualized against ongoing issues of neocolonialism.</p><p>Instead, quantum computing should be an open arena and an inspiration for a new generation of scientists.</p></blockquote>



<p>When I did an “Ask Me Anything” session, as the closing event at Q2B, <a href="https://www.sckaiser.com/">Sarah Kaiser</a> asked me to comment on the <em>Nature</em> petition.  So I repeated what I’d said in my emailed response to Leonie—running through the problems with each proposed alternative term, talking about the value of reclaiming the word “supremacy,” and mostly just trying to diffuse the tension by getting everyone laughing together.  Sarah later <a href="https://twitter.com/crazy4pi314/status/1205288610297069568">tweeted</a> that she was “really disappointed” in my response.</p>



<p>Then the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> got in on the action, with a brief <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/achieving-quantum-wokeness-11576540808">editorial</a> (warning: paywalled) mocking the <em>Nature</em> petition:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>There it is, folks: Mankind has hit quantum wokeness.  Our species, akin to Schrödinger’s cat, is simultaneously brilliant and brain-dead.  We built a quantum computer and then argued about whether the write-up was linguistically racist.</p><p>Taken seriously, the renaming game will never end.  First put a Sharpie to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal laws trump state laws.  Cancel Matt Damon for his 2004 role in “The Bourne Supremacy.”  Make the Air Force give up the term “air supremacy.”  Tell lovers of supreme pizza to quit being so chauvinistic about their toppings.  Please inform Motown legend Diana Ross that the Supremes are problematic.</p><p>The quirks of quantum mechanics, some people argue, are explained by the existence of many universes.  How did we get stuck in this one? </p></blockquote>



<p>Steven Pinker also weighed in, with a linguistically-informed <a href="https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1206662965614825472">tweetstorm</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This sounds like something from The Onion but actually appeared in Nature … It follows the wokified stigmatization of other innocent words, like “House Master” (now, at Harvard, Residential Dean) and “NIPS” (Neural Information Processing Society, now NeurIPS).  It’s a familiar linguistic phenomenon, a lexical version of Gresham’s Law: bad meanings drive good ones out of circulation.  Examples: the doomed “niggardly” (no relation to the n-word) and the original senses of “cock,” “ass,” “prick,” “pussy,” and “booty.”  Still, the prissy banning of words by academics should be resisted.  It dumbs down understanding of language: word meanings are conventions, not spells with magical powers, and all words have multiple senses, which are distinguished in context.  Also, it makes academia a laughingstock, tars the innocent,  and does nothing to combat actual racism &amp; sexism.</p></blockquote>



<p>Others had a stronger reaction.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Yarvin">Curtis Yarvin</a>, better known as Mencius Moldbug, is one of the founders of “neoreaction” (and a significant influence on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon">Steve Bannon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Anton">Michael Anton</a>, and other Trumpists).  Regulars might remember that Yarvin argued with me in <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>‘s comment section, under a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167">post</a> in which I denounced Trump’s travel ban and its effects on my Iranian PhD student.  Since then, Yarvin has sent me many emails, which have ranged from long to <em>extremely</em> long, and whose message could be summarized as: “[labored breathing] Abandon your liberal Enlightenment pretensions, young Nerdwalker.  Come over the Dark Side.”</p>



<p>After the “supremacy is for racists” letter came out in <em>Nature</em>, though, Yarvin sent me his shortest email ever.  It was simply a link to the letter, along with the comment “I knew it would come to this.”</p>



<p>He meant: “What more proof do you need, young Nerdawan, that this performative wokeness is a cancer that will eventually infect everything you value—even totally apolitical research in quantum information?  And by extension, that my whole worldview, which warned of this, is fundamentally correct, while your faith in liberal academia is naïve, and will be repaid only with backstabbing?”</p>



<p>In a subsequent email, Yarvin predicted that in two years, the whole community will be saying “quantum advantage” instead of “quantum supremacy,” and in five years I’ll be saying “quantum advantage” too.  As Yarvin <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2009/01/gentle-introduction-to-unqualified/">famously wrote</a>: “Cthulhu may swim slowly.  But he only swims left.”</p>



<p>So what do I <em>really</em> think about this epic battle for (and against) supremacy?</p>



<p>Truthfully, half of me just wants to switch to “quantum advantage” right now and be done with it.  As I said, I know some of the signatories of the <em>Nature</em> letter to be smart and reasonable and kind.  They don’t wish to rid the planet of everyone like me.  They’re not Amanda Marcottes or Arthur Chus.  Furthermore, there’s little I despise more than a meaty scientific debate devolving into a pointless semantic one, with brilliant friend after brilliant friend getting sucked into the vortex (“you too?”).  I’m strongly in the Pinkerian camp, which holds that words are just arbitrary designators, devoid of the totemic power to dictate thoughts.  So if friends and colleagues—even just a few of them—tell me that they find some word I use to be offensive, why not just be a <em>mensch</em>, apologize for any unintended hurt, switch words midsentence, and continue discussing the matter at hand?</p>



<p>But then the other half of me wonders: once we’ve ceded an open-ended veto over technical terms that remind anyone of anything bad, <em>where does it stop?</em>  How do we ever certify a word as kosher?  At what point do we all get to stop arguing and laugh together? </p>



<p>To make this worry concrete, look back at <a href="https://twitter.com/crazy4pi314/status/1205288610297069568">Sarah Kaiser’s Twitter thread</a>—the one where she expresses disappointment in me.  Below her tweet, someone remarks that, besides “quantum supremacy,” the word “ancilla” (as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancilla_bit">ancilla qubit</a>, a qubit used for intermediate computation or other auxiliary purposes) is problematic as well.  Here’s Sarah’s response:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I agree, but I wanted to start by focusing on the obvious one, Its harder for them to object to just one to start with, then once they admit the logic, we can expand the list</p></blockquote>



<p>(What would Curtis Yarvin say about that?)</p>



<p>You’re probably now wondering: what’s wrong with “ancilla”?  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06768">Apparently</a>, in ancient Rome, an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ancilla">“ancilla”</a> was a female slave, and indeed that’s the Latin root of the English adjective <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ancillary">“ancillary”</a> (as in “providing support to”).  I confess that I hadn’t known that—had you?  Admittedly, once you <em>do</em> know, you might never again look at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_NOT_gate">Controlled-NOT gate</a>—pitilessly flipping an ancilla qubit, subject only to the whims of a nearby control qubit—in quite the same way.</p>



<p>(Ah, but the ancilla can fight back against her controller!  And she does—in the Hadamard basis.)</p>



<p>The thing is, if we’re gonna play this game: what about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_and_annihilation_operators">annihilation operators</a>?  Won’t those need to be … annihilated from physics?</p>



<p>And what about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix">unitary matrices</a>?  Doesn’t their very name negate the multiplicity of perspectives and cultures?</p>



<p>What about Dirac’s oddly-named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation">bra/ket notation</a>, with its limitless potential for puerile jokes, about the “bra” vectors displaying their contents horizontally and so forth?  (Did you smile at that, you hateful pig?)</p>



<p>What about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_adjoint">daggers</a>?  Don’t we need a less violent conjugate tranpose?</p>



<p>Not to beat a dead horse, but once you hunt for examples, you realize that the whole dictionary is shot through with domination and brutality—that you’d have to massacre the English language to take it out.  There’s nothing special about math or physics in this respect.</p>



<p>The same half of me also thinks about my friends and colleagues who oppose claims of quantum supremacy, or even the quest for quantum supremacy, on various <em>scientific</em> grounds.  I.e., either they don’t think that the Google team achieved what it said, or they think that the task wasn’t hard enough for classical computers, or they think that the entire goal is misguided or irrelevant or uninteresting.</p>



<p>Which is fine—these are precisely the arguments we <em>should </em>be having—except that I’ve personally seen some of my respected colleagues, while arguing for these positions, opportunistically tack on ideological objections to the term “quantum supremacy.”  Just to goose up their case, I guess.  And I confess that every time they did this, it made me want to keep saying “quantum supremacy” from now till the end of time—<em>solely to deny these colleagues a cheap and unearned “victory,” one they apparently felt they couldn’t obtain on the merits alone.</em>  I realize that this is childish and irrational.</p>



<p>Most of all, though, the half of me that I’m talking about thinks about Curtis Yarvin and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> editorial board, cackling with glee to see their worldview so dramatically confirmed—as theatrical wokeness, that self-parodying modern monstrosity, turns its gaze on (of all things) quantum computing research.  More red meat to fire up the base—or at least that sliver of the base nerdy enough to care.  And the left, as usual, walks right into the trap, sacrificing its credibility with the outside world to pursue a runaway virtue-signaling spiral.</p>



<p>The same half of me thinks: do we <em>really</em> want to fight racism and sexism?  Then let’s work together to assemble a broad coalition that can defeat Trump.  And Jair Bolsonaro, and Viktor Orbán, and all the other ghastly manifestations of humanity’s collective lizard-brain.  Then, if we’re really fantasizing, we could liberalize the drug laws, and get contraception and loans and education to women in the Third World, and stop the systematic disenfranchisement of black voters, and open up the world’s richer, whiter, and higher-elevation countries to climate refugees, and protect the world’s remaining indigenous lands (those that didn’t burn to the ground this year).</p>



<p>In this context, the trouble with obsessing over terms like “quantum supremacy” is not merely that it diverts attention, while contributing nothing to fighting the world’s actual racism and sexism.  The trouble is that the obsessions are actually <em>harmful</em>.  For they make academics—along with progressive activists—look silly.  They make people think that we must not have meant it when we talked about the existential urgency of climate change and the world’s other crises.  They pump oxygen into right-wing echo chambers.</p>



<p>But it’s worse than ridiculous, because of the message that I fear is received by many outside the activists’ bubble.  When you <em>say</em> stuff like “[quantum] supremacy is for racists,” what’s <em>heard</em> might be something more like:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Watch your back, you disgusting supremacist.  Yes, <em>you</em>.  You claim that you mentor women and minorities, donate to good causes, try hard to confront the demons in your own character?  Ha!  None of that counts for anything with us.  You’ll never be with-it enough to be our ally, so don’t bother trying.  We’ll see to it that you’re never safe, not even in the most abstruse and apolitical fields.  We’ll comb through your words—even words like ‘ancilla qubit’—looking for any that we can cast as offensive by our opaque and ever-shifting standards.  And once we find some, we’ll have it within our power to end your career, and you’ll be reduced to groveling that we don’t.  Remember those popular kids who bullied you in second grade, giving you nightmares of social ostracism that persist to this day?  We plan to achieve what even those bullies couldn’t: to shame you with the full backing of the modern world’s moral code.  See, we’re the <em>good guys</em> of this story.  It’s goodness itself that’s branding you as racist scum.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In short, I claim that the message—not the message <em>intended</em>, of course, by anyone other than a Chu or a Marcotte or a SneerClubber, but the message <em>received</em>—is basically a Trump campaign ad.  I claim further that our civilization’s current self-inflicted catastrophe will end—i.e., the believers in science and reason and progress and rule of law will claw their way back to power—when, and only when, a generation of activists emerges that understands these dynamics as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/politics/obama-woke-cancel-culture.html">Barack Obama</a> did.</p>



<p>Wouldn’t it be awesome if, five years from now, I could say to Curtis Yarvin: <em>you were wrong</em>?  If I could say to him: <em>my colleagues and I still use the term ‘quantum supremacy’ whenever we care to, and none of us have been cancelled or ostracized for it—so maybe you should revisit your paranoid theories about Cthulhu and the Cathedral and so forth</em>?  If I could say: <em>quantum computing researchers now have bigger fish to fry than arguments over words—like moving beyond quantum supremacy to the first useful quantum simulations, as well as the race for scalability and fault-tolerance</em>?  And even: <em>progressive activists now have bigger fish to fry too—like retaking actual power all over the world</em>?</p>



<p>Anyway, as I said, that’s how half of me feels.  The other half is ready to switch to “quantum advantage” or any other serviceable term and get back to doing science.</p></div>

Juris Hartmanis needs no introduction. But we can note this long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxbKu7MrqA4">interview</a> last February by the Heidelberg Laureate Foundation. His sister, Astrid Ivask, was a <a href="https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/blog/literary-tributes/tribute-astrid-ivask-literary-light">world</a>–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Ivask">recognized</a> poet.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I wish to discuss one of his old conjectures.<br />
<span id="more-16469"></span></p>
<p>
We have previously discussed one of his conjectures <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/a-conjecture-of-hartmanis/">here</a>. The conjecture we are interested in his one made in his joint <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/5864">paper</a> with Herbert Shank titled, “On the Recognition of Primes by Automata.”</p>
<p>
Shank once wrote a paper <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/on-the-undecidability-of-finite-planar-cubic-graphs1/84518469D4AF1774ADE070EBA56601C9">On the undecidability of finite planar cubic graphs</a> with Solomon Garfunkel. I, Dick, liked this paper because it honestly pointed out that a predecessor paper by them was erroneous:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In the March, 1971 issue of this Journal (JSL) a paper of ours was published purporting to prove the hereditary undecidability of the first-order theory of finite planar graphs. The proof presented there contains an error which is unfortunately “unfixable” by the methods of that paper. The theorem however is true and we demonstrate here a generalization to finite cubic (exactly three edges at each vertex) planar graphs. The method involves coding the halting problem for a Turing machine into the theory of these graphs by considering special printouts of computations. Let us first consider a discussion of the aforementioned mistake and see what can be learned from it <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Primality Space Conjecture </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Hartmanis and Shank (HS) asked the following conjecture—over fifty years ago—about testing whether an integer is a prime number: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++01%2C11%2C101%2C111%2C1101%2C1011%2C10001%2C+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  01,11,101,111,1101,1011,10001, \dots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  01,11,101,111,1101,1011,10001, \dots " /></p>
<p>We’ve written them in binary notation with the ones’ place first—just the way to give numbers on the input tape of a Turing machine. No error in their Turing representation here—just their brilliant conjecture connecting space to number theory: Suppose that primality is computed in space <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(n)}" class="latex" title="{S(n)}" />. Then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++S%28n%29+%5Cge+cn%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  S(n) \ge cn, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  S(n) \ge cn, " /></p>
<p>for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{c&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{c&gt;0}" />. That is, any primality test must take linear space. </p>
<p>
As usual, space is the measure of how much storage the algorithm must use. The input tape is read-only and does count against the storage bound. The famous AKS primality test showed that whether a given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> is prime can be determined in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7BO%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{O(1)}}" class="latex" title="{n^{O(1)}}" /> time but did not improve the linear upper bound on space, which HS showed by trivial means: Try all possible divisors between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{x}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{x}}" />. The arithmetic and loop for this method can all be conducted in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n)}" /> space.</p>
<p>
What is some intuition for this conjecture? Why insist the space be <em>linear</em> when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B1-%5Cepsilon%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{1-\epsilon}}" class="latex" title="{n^{1-\epsilon}}" /> space is plenty—given that polynomial time could still be equal to logspace? Well, suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28n%29+%5Cll+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(n) \ll n}" class="latex" title="{S(n) \ll n}" /> and consider the integers <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{n-1}}" class="latex" title="{2^{n-1}}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n}" class="latex" title="{2^n}" />, that is all having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> bits in binary notation. The number of machine configurations apart from the content <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> of the input tape is at most:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7BO%28S%28n%29%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{O(S(n))}}" class="latex" title="{2^{O(S(n))}}" /> possible contents of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(n)}" class="latex" title="{S(n)}" /> worktape cells, times <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n+1}" class="latex" title="{n+1}" /> input head positions, times <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%28n%29%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S(n)+1}" class="latex" title="{S(n)+1}" /> or so worktape head positions, times <p></p>
</li><li>
the finite number of states.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cll+N+%3D+2%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ll N = 2^n}" class="latex" title="{\ll N = 2^n}" />. In fact, it is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cll+%5Cfrac%7BN%7D%7Bn%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BN%7D%7B%5Cln+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\ll \frac{N}{n} = \frac{N}{\ln N}}" class="latex" title="{\ll \frac{N}{n} = \frac{N}{\ln N}}" /> which is asymptotically the number of those <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> that are prime according to the Prime Number Theorem. This means that the vast majority of prime numbers have <em>no</em> worktape configuration that is unique to their accepting computation, not even close. Thus each configuration would be shared with many other primes—and most would be shared with many non-primes as well. Whereas many non-primes are composite for the same reason—such as all strings beginning with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> being even—the intuition is that each prime has its distinct track of reasons that ought not to come together with other primes.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Less Space </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The HS paper notes that since the set of primes is not regular, it needs at least order-of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5Clog%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log\log(n)}" class="latex" title="{\log\log(n)}" /> space. This is a weak lower bound. </p>
<p>
Both the bound and the above intuition become sharper if we require that the input tape be <em>one-way</em> as well as read-only: its head cannot go left to re-read lower-order bits. Every non-regular language requires order-of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log(n)}" class="latex" title="{\log(n)}" /> space by such 1-way machines. </p>
<p>
If we write the prime numbers in unary notation—that is, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B0%5Em+%3A+m+%5Ctext%7B+is+prime%7D%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{0^m : m \text{ is prime}\}}" class="latex" title="{\{0^m : m \text{ is prime}\}}" />—then we can prove they cannot be recognized by a machine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28%5Clog+m%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{o(\log m)}" class="latex" title="{o(\log m)}" /> space. Having the input tape be unary makes the whole computation depend on the configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> as described above. In consequence, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BL%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{L(M)}" class="latex" title="{L(M)}" /> has infinite arithmetic progressions of accepted strings. But by the celebrated theorem of Gustav Dirichlet, each such progression contains infinitely many primes as well as infinitely-many non-primes.  </p>
<p>
Scaling back from unary to binary seems to scale the space up to linear, so perhaps this result supports the HS conjecture. HS make related observations about log space and the density of the primes in the paper.  On the other hand, polynomial time could still be equal to logspace (with two-way input tape), which would make their conjecture wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Another Prime Conjecture </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We believe that the HS conjecture is hard, is related to some interesting questions, and could be false. That is, there might be some way to check that a number is prime in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bo%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{o(n)}" class="latex" title="{o(n)}" /> space. Proving lower bounds on space remains, after many decades, hopeless.</p>
<p>
Here is a related conjecture. Using the same binary representation as above—where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1011%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1011}" class="latex" title="{1011}" /> is 13 and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{10001}" class="latex" title="{10001}" /> is 17—Jeffrey Shallit has <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~shallit/Talks/bc4.pdf">asked</a> whether we can determine whether a given finite automaton accepts <i>some</i> input so that it is a prime number. We believe it is still open. Let’s assume for the moment that it is true. Then we can solve some open questions in number theory related to primes. This problem unlike the HS is worth some money. For example, the above would pay 50 British pounds—about $66.62. </p>
<p>
Jeff points out that if the above is decidable then one can solve the famous problem: Are there any Fermat primes that are not known? Recall a Fermat prime is one of the form 	 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7B2%5E%7B%5Cell%7D%7D+%2B+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  2^{2^{\ell}} + 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  2^{2^{\ell}} + 1. " /></p>
<p>The largest one known is </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7B2%5E%7B4%7D%7D+%2B+1+%3D+65%2C%5C%21537.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  2^{2^{4}} + 1 = 65,\!537." class="latex" title="\displaystyle  2^{2^{4}} + 1 = 65,\!537." /></p>
<p>All such primes match the regular expression <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B10%5E%2A1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{10^*1}" class="latex" title="{10^*1}" /> in binary notation, which is easy for a finite automaton to recognize. This expression matches numbers of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ek+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^k + 1}" class="latex" title="{2^k + 1}" />, but as we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/06/01/almost-fermat-primes/">here</a>, they can be prime only when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k}" class="latex" title="{k}" /> is a power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />.</p>
