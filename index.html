circuit that implements it? This quantity, known as the quantum circuit
complexity, is a fundamental property of quantum evolutions that has widespread
applications in many fields, including quantum computation, quantum field
theory, and black hole physics. In this letter, we obtain a new lower bound for
the quantum circuit complexity in terms of a novel complexity measure that we
propose for quantum circuits, which we call the quantum Wasserstein complexity.
Our proposed measure is based on the quantum Wasserstein distance of order one
(also called the quantum earth mover's distance), a metric on the space of
quantum states. We also prove several fundamental and important properties of
our new complexity measure, which stand to be of independent interest. Finally,
we show that our new measure also provides a lower bound for the experimental
cost of implementing quantum circuits, which implies a quantum limit on
converting quantum resources to computational resources. Our results provide
novel applications of the quantum Wasserstein distance and pave the way for a
deeper understanding of the resources needed to implement a quantum
computation.

Euclidean plane, a minimum ply cover of $P$ with $U$ is a subset of $U$ that
covers $P$ and minimizes the number of squares that share a common
intersection, called the minimum ply cover number of $P$ with $U$. Biedl et al.
[Comput. Geom., 94:101712, 2020] showed that determining the minimum ply cover
number for a set of points by a set of axis-parallel unit squares is NP-hard,
and gave a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for instances in which the
minimum ply cover number is constant. The question of whether there exists a
polynomial-time approximation algorithm remained open when the minimum ply
cover number is $\omega(1)$. We settle this open question and present a
polynomial-time $(8+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the general
problem, for every fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/g/Galby:Esther.html">Esther Galby</a>, Sandor Kisfaludi-Bak, Daniel Marx, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Sharma:Roohani.html">Roohani Sharma</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.06015">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>In the Directed Steiner Network problem, the input is a directed graph G, a
subset T of k vertices of G called the terminals, and a demand graph D on T.
The task is to find a subgraph H of G with the minimum number of edges such
that for every edge (s,t) in D, the solution H contains a directed s to t path.
In this paper we investigate how the complexity of the problem depends on the
demand pattern when G is planar. Formally, if \mathcal{D} is a class of
directed graphs closed under identification of vertices, then the
\mathcal{D}-Steiner Network (\mathcal{D}-SN) problem is the special case where
the demand graph D is restricted to be from \mathcal{D}. For general graphs,
Feldmann and Marx [ICALP 2016] characterized those families of demand graphs
where the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the
number k of terminals. They showed that if \mathcal{D} is a superset of one of
the five hard families, then \mathcal{D}-SN is W[1]-hard parameterized by k,
otherwise it can be solved in time f(k)n^{O(1)}.
</p>
<p>For planar graphs an interesting question is whether the W[1]-hard cases can
be solved by subexponential parameterized algorithms. Chitnis et al. [SICOMP
2020] showed that, assuming the ETH, there is no f(k)n^{o(k)} time algorithm
for the general \mathcal{D}-SN problem on planar graphs, but the special case
called Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph can be solved in time f(k)
n^{O(\sqrt{k})} on planar graphs. We present a far-reaching generalization and
unification of these two results: we give a complete characterization of the
behavior of every $\mathcal{D}$-SN problem on planar graphs. We show that
assuming ETH, either the problem is (1) solvable in time 2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}, and
not in time 2^{o(k)}n^{O(1)}, or (2) solvable in time f(k)n^{O(\sqrt{k})}, but
not in time f(k)n^{o(\sqrt{k})}, or (3) solvable in time f(k)n^{O(k)}, but not
in time f(k)n^{o({k})}.

size $n$ require $\Omega(nk)$ rounds. In this paper, we see if these bounds can
be improved by smoothed analysis. We study perhaps the most natural randomized
algorithm for disseminating tokens in this setting: at every time step, choose
a token to broadcast randomly from the set of tokens you know. We show that
with even a small amount of smoothing (one random edge added per round), this
natural strategy solves $k$-message broadcast in $\tilde{O}(n+k^3)$ rounds,
with high probability, beating the best known bounds for $k=o(\sqrt{n})$ and
matching the $\Omega(n+k)$ lower bound for static networks for $k=O(n^{1/3})$
(ignoring logarithmic factors). In fact, the main result we show is even
stronger and more general: given $\ell$-smoothing (i.e., $\ell$ random edges
added per round), this simple strategy terminates in
$O(kn^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(n)\ell^{-1/3})$ rounds. We then prove this analysis close
to tight with an almost-matching lower bound. To better understand the impact
of smoothing on information spreading, we next turn our attention to static
networks, proving a tight bound of $\tilde{O}(k\sqrt{n})$ rounds to solve
$k$-message broadcast, which is better than what our strategy can achieve in
the dynamic setting. This confirms that although smoothed analysis reduces the
difficulties induced by changing graph structures, it does not eliminate them
altogether. Finally, we apply our tools to prove an optimal result for
$k$-message broadcast in so-called well-mixed networks in the absence of
smoothing. By comparing this result to an existing lower bound for well-mixed
networks, we establish a formal separation between oblivious and strongly
adaptive adversaries with respect to well-mixed token spreading, partially
resolving an open question on the impact of adversary strength on the
$k$-message broadcast problem.

A central open problem in complexity theory concerns the question of
whether all efficient randomized algorithms can be simulated by
efficient deterministic algorithms. The celebrated ``hardness
v.s. randomness” paradigm pioneered by Blum-Micali (SIAM JoC’84),
Yao (FOCS’84) and Nisan-Wigderson (JCSS’94) presents hardness
assumptions under which $\prBPP = \prP$, but these hardness assumptions 
are not known to also be necessary for such derandomization.
 
In this work, following the recent work by Chen and Tell (FOCS’21) that 
considers “almost-all-input” hardness of a function $f$ (i.e., hardness 
of computing $f$ on more than a finite number of inputs), we consider 
“almost-all-input” \emph{leakage-resilient hardness} of a function $f$
—that is, hardness of computing $f(x)$ even given, say, $\sqrt{|x|}$ 
bits of leakage of $f(x)$. We show that leakage-resilient hardness 
characterizes derandomization of $\prBPP$ (i.e., gives a both \emph{
necessary} and \emph{sufficient} condition for derandomization). In more 
detail, we show that there exists a constant $c$ such that the following 
are equivalent:

- $\prBPP = \prP$;
- Existence of a poly-time computable function $f :\{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow  \{0,1\}^n$
 that is almost-all-input leakage-resilient hard with respect to 
$n^c$-time probabilistic algorithms.

Our characterization naturally extends also to the low-end
derandomization regime, to derandomization of $\prMA$, and also to
average-case derandomization, by appropriately weakening the
requirements on the function $f$.</div>

While the
cliques is too stiff to applicate to real cases, the k-plex relaxes the notion
of the clique, allowing each node to miss up to k connections. Although
k-plexes are more flexible than cliques, finding them is more challenging as
their number is greater. In this paper, we aim to detect the k-plex under the
size and time constraints, leveraging the new vision of automated learning
bounding strategy. We introduce the constraint learning concept to learn the
bound strategy from the branch and bound process and develop it into a Mixed
Integer Programming framework. While most of the work is dedicated on learn the
branch strategy in branch and bound-based algorithms, we focus on the learn to
bound strategy which needs to handle the problem that learned strategy might
not examine the feasible solution. We adopted the MILP framework and design a
set of variables relative to the k-plex property as our constraint space to
learn the strategy. The learn to bound strategy learning the original strategy
function also reduces the computation load of the bound process to accelerate
the branch and bound algorithm. Note that the learn to bound concept can apply
to any branch and bound based algorithm with the appropriate framework. We
conduct the experiment on different networks, the results show that our learn
to branch and bound method does accelerate the original branch and bound method
and outperforms other baselines, while also being able to generalize on
different graph properties.

Would any TeXpert like to help us, in exchange for a generous acknowledgment?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>I returned last week from the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">NSF Workshop on Quantum Advantage and Next Steps</a> at the University of Chicago.  Thanks so much to Chicago CS professor (and my former summer student) <a href="https://www.billfefferman.com/">Bill Fefferman</a> and the other organizers for making this workshop a reality.  Given how vividly I remember the situation 12 years ago, when the idea of sampling-based quantum supremacy was the weird obsession of me and a few others, it was particularly special to attend a workshop on the topic with well over a hundred participants, some in-person and some on Zoom, delayed by covid but still excited by the dramatic experimental progress of the past few years.</p>



<p>Of course there’s a lot still to do.  Many of the <a href="https://chicagoquantum.org/events/nsf-workshop-quantum-advantage-and-next-steps">talks</a> drew an exclamation point on something I’ve been saying for the past couple years: that there’s an urgent need for better quantum supremacy experiments, which will require both theoretical <em>and</em> engineering advances.  The experiments by Google and USTC and now Xanadu represent a big step forward for the field, but since they started being done, the classical spoofing attacks have also steadily improved, to the point that whether “quantum computational supremacy” still exists depends on exactly how you define it.</p>



<p>Briefly: if you measure by total operations, energy use, or CO2 footprint, then probably yes, quantum supremacy remains.  But if you measure by number of seconds, then it doesn’t remain, not if you’re willing to shell out for enough cores on AWS or your favorite supercomputer.  And even the quantum supremacy that does remain might eventually fall to, e.g., further improvements of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01657">algorithm due to Gao et al</a>.  For more details, see, e.g., the now-published work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03011">Pan, Chen, and Zhang</a>, or this <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">good popular summary</a> by Adrian Cho for <em>Science</em>.</p>



<p>If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.  But the point I made in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/whatihope.ppt">my talk</a> was that, as long as we remain in the paradigm of sampling experiments that take ~2<sup>n</sup> time to verify classically and <em>also</em> ~2<sup>n</sup> time to spoof classically (where n is the number of qubits), all quantum speedups that we can achieve will be fragile and contingent, however interesting and impressive.  As soon as we go way beyond what classical computers can keep up with, we’ve <em>also</em> gone way beyond where classical computers can check what was done.</p>



<p>I argued that the only solution to this problem is to design new quantum supremacy experiments: ones where some secret has been inserted in the quantum circuit that lets a classical computer efficiently verify the results.  The fundamental problem is that we need three properties—</p>



<ol><li>implementability on <em>near-term</em> quantum computers,</li><li>efficient classical verifiability, and</li><li>confidence that quantum computers have a theoretical asymptotic advantage,</li></ol>



<p>and right now we only know how to get any two out of the three.  We can get 1 and 2 with <a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-applications/qaoa.html">QAOA</a> and various other heuristic quantum algorithms, 1 and 3 with BosonSampling and Random Circuit Sampling, or 2 and 3 with Shor’s algorithm or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Yamakawa-Zhandry</a> or recent interactive protocols.  To get all three, there are three obvious approaches:</p>



<ol><li>Start with the heuristic algorithms and find a real advantage from them,</li><li>Start with BosonSampling or Random Circuit Sampling or the like and figure out how to make them efficiently verifiable classically, or</li><li>Start with protocols like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00687">Kahanamoku-Meyer et al.’s</a> and figure out how to run them on near-term devices.</li></ol>



<p>At the Chicago workshop, I’d say that the most popular approach speakers talked about was 3, although my own focus was more on 2.</p>



<p>Anyway, until a “best-of-all-worlds” quantum supremacy experiment is discovered, there’s plenty to do in the meantime: for example, better understand the classical hardness of spoofing Random Circuit Sampling with a constant or logarithmic number of gate layers.  Understand the best that classical algorithms can do to spoof the Linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark for BosonSampling, and build on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06964">Grier et al.</a> to understand the power of BosonSampling with a linear number of modes.</p>



<p>I’ll be flying back with my family to Austin today after seven weeks at the Jersey shore, but I’ll try to field any questions about the state of quantum supremacy in general or this workshop in particular in the comments!</p></div>

We prove two results about randomised query complexity $\mathrm{R}(f)$. First, we introduce a linearised complexity measure $\mathrm{LR}$ and show that it satisfies an inner-optimal composition theorem: $\mathrm{R}(f\circ g) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{R}(f) \mathrm{LR}(g))$ for all partial $f$ and $g$, and moreover, $\mathrm{LR}$ is the largest possible measure with this property. In particular, $\mathrm{LR}$ can be polynomially larger than previous measures that satisfy an inner composition theorem, such as the max-conflict complexity of Gavinsky, Lee, Santha, and Sanyal (ICALP 2019).

Our second result addresses a question of Yao (FOCS 1977). He asked if $\epsilon$-error expected query complexity $\bar{\mathrm{R}}_\epsilon(f)$ admits a distributional characterisation relative to some hard input distribution. Vereshchagin (TCS 1998) answered this question affirmatively in the bounded-error case. We show that an analogous theorem fails in the small-bias case $\epsilon=1/2-o(1)$.</div>

The first CONCUR conference dates back to 1990 and was one of the conferences organized as part of the two-year <a href="https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/4345371/589768.pdf" target="_blank">ESPRIT Basic  Research  Action  3006</a>  with  the  same  name.   The  CONCUR  community  has  run  the conference ever since and established the <a href="https://concurrency-theory.org/organizations/ifip" target="_blank">IFIP WG 1.8 “Concurrency Theory”</a> in 2005 under Technical Committee TC1 Foundations of Computer Science of IFIP1.</p><p>In light of the well-established nature of the CONCUR conference, and spurred by a <a href="https://slides.com/piluc/icalp-50?token=fl3BBJ8j" target="_blank">data-and graph-mining comparative analysis</a> carried out by Pierluigi Crescenzi and three of his students to celebrate the 50th anniversary of ICALP, Pierluigi and I undertook a similar study for the CONCUR conference using some, by now classic, tools from network science.  Our goal was to try and understand the evolution of the CONCUR conference throughout its history, the ebb and flow in the popularity of some research areas in concurrency theory, and the centrality of CONCUR authors, as measured by several metrics from network science, amongst other topics. </p><p>Our article available <a href="http://www.icetcs.ru.is/luca/CONCUR.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> reports on our findings.  We hope that members of the CONCUR community will enjoy reading it and playing with the web-based resources that accompany this piece.  It goes without saying that the data analysis we present has to be taken with a huge pinch of salt and is only meant to provide an overview of the evolution of CONCUR and to be food for thought for the concurrency theory community. <br /></p></div>

sensor grids) need diverse real-time summary statistics across multiple
subpopulations of multidimensional datasets. However, state-of-the-art
frameworks do not offer general and accurate analytics in real time at
reasonable costs. The root cause is the combinatorial explosion of data
subpopulations and the diversity of summary statistics we need to monitor
simultaneously. We present Hydra, an efficient framework for multidimensional
analytics that presents a novel combination of using a ``sketch of sketches''
to avoid the overhead of monitoring exponentially-many subpopulations and
universal sketching to ensure accurate estimates for multiple statistics. We
build Hydra as an Apache Spark plugin and address practical system challenges
to minimize overheads at scale. Across multiple real-world and synthetic
multidimensional datasets, we show that Hydra can achieve robust error bounds
and is an order of magnitude more efficient in terms of operational cost and
memory footprint than existing frameworks (e.g., Spark, Druid) while ensuring
interactive estimation times.

an intermediate trust model between the standard local and central models
[EFMRTT19; CSUZZ19]. A key result in this model is that randomly shuffling
locally randomized data amplifies differential privacy guarantees. Such
amplification implies substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in
which data is contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17].
</p>
<p>In this work, we improve the state of the art privacy amplification by
shuffling results both theoretically and numerically. Our first contribution is
the first asymptotically optimal analysis of the R\'enyi differential privacy
parameters for the shuffled outputs of LDP randomizers. Our second contribution
is a new analysis of privacy amplification by shuffling. This analysis improves
on the techniques of [FMT20] and leads to tighter numerical bounds in all
parameter settings.

We provide several approximation algorithms for the $L_p$ TSP problem,
including $4.27$ &amp; $10.92$-approximation algorithms for single &amp; multi vehicle
$L_2$ TSP, called the Traveling Firefighter Problem. Among other contributions,
we provide an $8$-approximation and a $1.78$ inapproximability for All-Norm TSP
problem, addressing scenarios where one does not know the ideal cost function,
or is seeking simultaneous approximation with respect to any cost function.

[STOC 1999, SIDMA 2003] as a tool to solve partitioning problems. In this
paper, the following result concerning independent sets in graphs having
sparse-dense partitions is presented: if a $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits a
sparse-dense partition concerning classes $\mathcal S$ and $\mathcal D$, where
$\mathcal D$ is a subclass of the complement of $K_t$-free graphs (for some
~$t$), and graphs in $\mathcal S$ can be recognized in polynomial time, then:
</p>
<p>enumerate all maximal independent sets of $G$ (or find its maximum) can be
performed in $n^{O(1)}$ time whenever it can be done in polynomial time for
graphs in the class $\mathcal S$.
</p>
<p>This result has the following interesting implications:
</p>
<p>A P versus NP-hard dichotomy for Max. Independent Set on graphs whose vertex
set can be partitioned into $k$ independent sets and $\ell$ cliques, so-called
$(k, \ell)$-graphs. concerning the values of $k$ and $\ell$ of $(k,
\ell)$-graphs.
</p>
<p>A P-time algorithm that does not require $(1,\ell)$-partitions for
determining whether a $(1,\ell)$-graph $G$ is well-covered. Well-covered graphs
are graphs in which every maximal independent set has the same cardinality.
</p>
<p>The characterization of conflict graph classes for which the conflict version
of a P-time graph problem is still in P assuming such classes. Conflict
versions of graph problems ask for solutions avoiding pairs of conflicting
elements (vertices or edges) described in conflict graphs.

optimization. We survey the use of the SoS hierarchy to obtain approximation
algorithms on graphs using their spectral properties. We present a simplified
proof of the result of Feige and Krauthgamer on the performance of the
hierarchy for the Maximum Clique problem on random graphs. We also present a
result of Guruswami and Sinop that shows how to obtain approximation algorithms
for the Minimum Bisection problem on low threshold-rank graphs.
</p>
<p>We study inapproximability results for the SoS hierarchy for general
constraint satisfaction problems and problems involving graph densities such as
the Densest $k$-subgraph problem. We improve the existing inapproximability
results for general constraint satisfaction problems in the case of large
arity, using stronger probabilistic analyses of expansion of random instances.
We examine connections between constraint satisfaction problems and density
problems on graphs. Using them, we obtain new inapproximability results for the
hierarchy for the Densest $k$-subhypergraph problem and the Minimum $p$-Union
problem, which are proven via reductions.
</p>
<p>We also illustrate the relatively new idea of pseudocalibration to construct
integrality gaps for the SoS hierarchy for Maximum Clique and Max $K$-CSP. The
application to Max $K$-CSP that we present is known in the community but has
not been presented before in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.

Larsen</a>, who received the <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time Award</a> for the paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44618-4_12.pdf" target="_blank">The Impressive Power of Stopwatches</a> (available also <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220701029_The_Impressive_Power_of_Stopwatches" target="_blank">here</a>), which appeared at CONCUR 2000 and was co-authored with <a href="https://franck44.github.io/" target="_blank">Franck Cassez</a>. On behalf of the concurrency theory community, I thank Kim for taking the time to answer my questions. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading Kim's answer as much as I did. <span class="im"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: You receive the CONCUR ToT Award 2022 for your paper  The Impressive Power of Stopwatches, which appeared at CONCUR 2000. </span>In that article, you showed that timed automata enriched with  stopwatches and unobservable time delays have the same expressive power  of  linear hybrid automata. Could you briefly explain to our readers  what timed automata with stopwatches are? Could  you also tell us how you came to study the question addressed in your  award-winning article? Which of the results in your paper did you find  most surprising or challenging?</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Kim:</b> <span class="im"></span><span lang="EN-US">Well, in timed automata all  clocks grow with rate 1 in all locations of the automata. Thus you can  tell the amount of time that has elapsed since a particular clock was  last reset, e.g. due to an external event of interest.   A stopwatch is a real-valued variable similar to a regular clock.  In  contrast to a clock, a stopwatch will in certain locations grow with  rate 1 and in other locations grow with rate 0, i.e. it is stopped.  As  such, a stopwatch gives you information about  the accumulated time spent in a certain parts of the automata.  </span></p><p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In modelling schedulability  problems for real-time systems, the use of stopwatches is crucial in  order to adequately capture preemption.   I definitely believe that it  was our shared interest in schedulability that brought  us to study timed automata with stopwatches.  We knew from earlier  results by Alur et al. that properties such as reachability was  undecidable. But what could we do about this? And how much expressive  power would the addition of stopwatches provide?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US"></span><span lang="EN-US">In the paper we certainly put the  most emphasis on the latter question, in that we showed that stopwatch  automata and linear hybrid automata accept the same class of timed  languages, and this was at least for me the most  surprising and challenging result. However, focusing on impact,  I think the approximate zone-based method that we apply in the paper  has been extremely important from the point of view of having our  verification tool <a href="https://uppaal.org/" target="_blank">UPPAAL</a> being taken-up at large  by the embedded systems community.  It has been really interesting to  see how well the over-approximation method actually works.</span><span class="im"></span></p><span class="im"><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span lang="EN-US">Luca</span></b><span lang="EN-US">: In your article, you showed that linear hybrid automata and stopwatch automata accept the same class of timed languages. </span>Would this result still hold if all delays were observable?

I messaged Bill and told him to write <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/07/juris-hartmanis-passed-away-on-july-29.html">an obit</a> and I'd follow with something personal when I returned.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div><table cellpadding="0" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sMoKiQvVwB8/VVEMTLT-beI/AAAAAAAA2VQ/LMLeAxFklRg/s1600/GE.jpg"><img width="400" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sMoKiQvVwB8/VVEMTLT-beI/AAAAAAAA2VQ/LMLeAxFklRg/s400/GE.jpg" border="0" height="281" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="text-align: center;" class="tr-caption">Hartmanis and Stearns in 1963</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>In November 1962 Hartmanis, working with Richard Stearns at the GE Labs in Schenectady, determined how to use Turing machines to formalize the basic idea to measure resources, like time and memory, as a function of the problem being solved. Their classic Turing-award winning paper <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7.pdf">On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms</a>, not only gave this formulation but showed that increasing resources increased the problems one can solve.

Juris brought the topics to life and I found my passion. At the beginning of the class, he said the highest grade usually went to an undergrad followed by the grad students in the class. I was a counterexample, as I had the second highest grade. Never did find out who beat me out.</div><div><br /></div><div>In spring of my senior year, 1985, I forgave the traditional senior-slump <i>Wines</i> for graduate complexity with Juris. He focused the course around the <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/03/berman-hartmanis-isomorphism.html">isomorphism conjecture</a> he developed with his student Len Berman, which implied P≠NP, and Hartmanis believed using the conjecture might lead to settling P v NP.

<p>Last month saw a flurry of activity in Property Testing. We had thirteen papers!! Without further ado, let us dig in.</p>

<p><strong>Testing of Index-Invariant Properties in the Huge Object Model</strong> (by Sourav Chakraborty, Eldar Fischer, Arijit Ghosh, Gopinath Mishra, and Sayantan Sen)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12514">arXiv</a>) This paper explores a class of distribution testing problems in the Huge Object Model introduced by Goldreich and Ron (see our coverage of the model <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/2021/10/news-for-september-2021/">here</a>). A quick refresher of this model: so, suppose you want to test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) supported over, say the boolean hypercube \(\{0,1\}^n\) has a certain property \(\mathcal{P}\). You pick a string \(x \sim \mathcal{D}\) where the length of \(x\) is \(n\). In situations where \(n\) is really large, you might not want to read all of \(x\) and you may instead want to read only a few bits from it. To this end, Goldreich and Ron formulated a model where you have query access to the strings you sample. The distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is deemed to be \(\varepsilon\)-far from \(\mathcal{P}\) if \(EMD(\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{P}) \geq \varepsilon\) (here \(EMD\) denotes the earthmover distance with respect to the relative Hamming distance between bitstrings).  In this model, one parameter of interest is the query complexity of your tester.</p>



<p>One of the results in the featured paper above shows the following: Let \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) denote the class of monotone distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) (a distribution \(D\)  belongs to the class \(\sf{MONOTONE}\) if \(D(x) \leq D(y)\) whenever \(0^n \preceq x \preceq y \preceq 1^n\)). Let \(\mathcal{B}_d\) denote the class of distributions supported over \(\{0,1\}^n\) whose supports have VC dimension at most \(d\). Let \(\mathcal{P} = \sf{MONOTONE} \cap \mathcal{B}_d\). Then, for any \(\varepsilon &gt; 0\), you can test whether a distribution \(\mathcal{D} \in \mathcal{P}\) or whether it is \(\varepsilon\)  far from \(\mathcal{P}\) with query complexity \(poly(1/\varepsilon)\). In fact, the paper shows this for a much richer class \(\mathcal{P}\) which is the class of so-called <em>index-invariant</em> distributions with bounded VC-dimensions. The paper also shows the necessity of both of these conditions for efficient testability. Do check it out!</p>

<p><strong>Identity Testing for High-Dimensional Distributions via Entropy Tensorization</strong> (by Antonio Blanca, Zongchen Chen, Daniel Štefankovič, and Eric Vigoda)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09102">arXiv</a>) </p>



<p>This paper considers a classic in distribution testing. Namely, the problem of testing whether the hidden input distribution \(\pi\) is identical to an explicitly given distribution \(\mu\). Both distributions are supported over a set \(\Omega\). The caveat is \(\Omega\) is some high dimensional set (think \(\Omega = [k]^n\)) and that it has a size that grows exponentially in \(n\). In this case, identity testing has sample complexity \(\Omega(k^{n/2})\) even when \(\mu\) is the uniform distribution. In an attempt to overcome this apparent intractability of identity testing in high dimensions, this paper takes the following route: in addition to the standard sample access to \(\pi\), you also assume access to a <em>stronger sampling oracle</em> from \(\pi\). And now you would like to understand for which class of explicitly given distributions \(\mu\) can you expect algorithms with efficient sample complexity (assuming the algorithm is equipped with this <em>stronger sampling oracle</em>). For any \(i \in [n]\) and \(\omega \in \Omega\), the stronger oracle considered in this work allows you to sample \(x \sim \pi_{\omega(-i)}\) where \(\pi_{\omega(-i)}\) denotes the conditional marginal distribution of \(\pi\) over the \(i\)-th coordinate when the remaining coordinates have been fixed according to \(\omega\).</p>



<p>The paper shows if the known distribution \(\mu\) satisfies some approximate tensorization of entropy criterion, then identity testing with such distributions \(\mu\) can be done with \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon)\) queries. Thanks to the spectral independence toolkit pioneered by Anari et al, it turns out that the approximate tensorization property holds for a rich class of distributions. (<em>A side note to self</em>: It looks like I am running out of reasons to postpone learning about the new tools like Spectral Independence.)   </p>

<p><strong>Near-Optimal Bounds for Testing Histogram Distributions</strong> (by Clément L. Canonne, Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, and Sihan Liu)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06596">arXiv</a>) Histograms comprise one of the most natural and widely used ways for summarizing some relevant aspects of massive datasets. Let \(\Omega\) denote an \(n\)-element dataset (with elements being \(\{1,2, \ldots, n \}\)). A \(k\)-histogram is a function that is piecewise constant over \(k\) interval pieces. This paper studies the sample complexity of the following fundamental task: given a distribution \(\mathcal{P}\) supported over \(\Omega\), is \(\mathcal{P}\) a \(k\)-histogram or is \(\mathcal{P}\) far from being a \(k\)-histogram. The main result of the paper is a (near) sample optimal algorithm for this problem. Specifically, this paper shows that \(k\)-histogram testing has sample complexity \(\Theta\left(\sqrt{nk}/\varepsilon + k/\varepsilon^2 + \sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^2\right)\).</p>



<p><strong>Comments on “Testing Conditional Independence of Discrete Distributions”</strong> (by Ilmun Kim)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02819">arXiv</a>) Probability is full of subtleties and conditional probability is perhaps the biggest landmine of subtleties in this venerable discipline. The featured paper closely examines some subtleties in Theorem 1.3 of the CDKS18 paper on testing conditional independence of discrete distributions. Essentially, this theorem undertakes the following endeavor: you would like to test whether a bivariate discrete distribution has independent marginals conditioned on values assumed by a third random variable. Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18 asserts that there exists a computationally efficient tester for conditional independence with small sample complexity. The featured paper fixes the sample complexity bound claimed in Theorem 1.3 of CDKS18.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptographic Hardness of Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise</strong> (by Ilias Diakonikolas, Daniel M. Kane, Pasin Manurangsi, and Lisheng Ren)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14266">arXiv</a>) The study of robust supervised learning in high dimensions has seen a lot of impressive progress in the last few years. The paper under review presents sample complexity lower bounds for the task of learning halfspaces in this overarching framework. Let us unpack this paper slowly. So, let us recall the classic task of learning halfspaces in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). You know the drill. I have a known concept class \(\mathcal{C}\) (comprising of boolean functions) in my hand. Unbeknownst to you, I have a boolean function \(f \in \mathcal{C}\). You get as input a multiset \(\{x_i, f(x_i)\}_{i \in [s]}\) of labeled examples from a distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) where \(x_i \sim \mathcal{D}_x\) and \(\mathcal{D}_x\) is fixed but arbitrary. Your goal is to develop an algorithm that returns a hypothesis with a small misclassification rate. The classic stuff.</p>



<p>Now, consider the same setup with a little twist: the so-called Massart noise setup. The labels \(f(x_i)\) are no longer reliable and the label on each \(x_i\) gets flipped adversarially with probability \(\eta_i \leq \eta &lt; 1/2\). In a breakthrough Diakonikolas, Gouleakis, and Tzamos made the first algorithmic progress on this problem and gave algorithms with running time \(poly(n/\varepsilon)\) and misclassification rate \(\eta + \varepsilon\). The current paper shows a lower-bound result. Assuming the hardness of the so-called “Learning With Errors” problem, this paper shows that under Massart Noise, it is not possible for a polynomial time learning algorithm to achieve a misclassification rate of \(o(\eta)\).</p>

<p><strong>Locally-iterative (Δ+1)-Coloring in Sublinear (in Δ) Rounds</strong> (by Xinyu Fu, Yitong Yin, and Chaodong Zheng)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14458">arXiv</a>) A time-honored problem in Distributed Computing is Distributed graph coloring. Let us first understand what problem this paper studies. So, you are given a graph \(G = (V,E)\) with maximum degree \(\Delta\). In a seminal work, Szegedy and Vishwanathan introduced the framework of <em>locally-iterative algorithms</em> as a natural family of distributed graph coloring algorithms. These algorithms proceed in \(r\) rounds. In each round, you update the color of a vertex \(v\) where the new color of \(v\) is a function of the current color of \(v\) and the current color of its neighbors. The current paper shows that you can in the locally-iterative framework, you can in fact, obtain a proper coloring of \(G\) with \(\Delta(G) + 1\) colors in \(r = O(\Delta^{3/4} \log \Delta) + \log^* n\) rounds. </p>

<p><strong>Learning Hierarchical Structure of Clusterable Graphs</strong> (by Michael Kapralov, Akash Kumar, Silvio Lattanzi, Aida Mousavifar)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02581">arXiv</a>) [<em>Disclaimer: I am one of the authors of this paper.</em>] Hierarchical clustering of graph data is a fundamentally important task in the current big data era. In 2016, Dasgupta introduced the notion of Dasgupta cost which essentially allows one to measure the quality of a hierarchical clustering. This paper presents algorithms that can estimate the Dasgupta Cost of a graph coming from a special family of \(k\)-clusterable graphs in the semi-supervised setting. These graphs have \(k\) clusters. These clusters are essentially subsets of vertices that induce expanders and these clusters are sparsely connected to each other. We are given query access to the adjacency list of \(G\). Also, for an initial “warmup” set of randomly chosen vertices, we are told the clusters they belong to. Armed with this setup, this paper presents algorithms that run in time \(\approx \sqrt{n}\) and return an estimate to the Dasgupta Cost of \(G\) which is within a \(\approx \sqrt{\log k}\) factor of the optimum cost.</p>

<p><strong>Finding a Hidden Edge</strong> (by Ron Kupfer and Noam Nisan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02344">arXiv</a>) Let us consider as a warmup (as done in the paper) the following toy problem. You have a graph on \(n\) vertices whose edge set \(E\) is hidden from you. Your objective is to return any \((i,j) \in E\). The only queries you are allowed are of the following form. You may consider any subset \(Q \subseteq V \times V\) and you can ask whether \(Q\) contains any edge. A simple binary search solves this question with \(\log m\) queries (where \(m = {n \choose 2}\)). However, if you want a non-adaptive algorithm for this problem (unlike binary search) you can show that any deterministic algorithm must issue \(m\) non-adaptive queries. Turns out randomness can help you get away with only \(O(\log^2m)\) non-adaptive queries for this special toy problem. Now, let me describe the problem considered in this work in earnest. Suppose the only queries you are allowed are of the following form: you may pick any \(S \subseteq V\) and you may ask whether the graph induced on \(S\) contains an edge. The paper’s main result is that there is an algorithm for finding an edge in \(G\) which issues nearly linear in \(n\) many non-adaptive queries. The paper also presents an almost matching lower bound.</p>

<p><strong>On One-Sided Testing Affine Subspaces</strong> (by Nader Bshouty)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/104/">ECCC</a>) Dictatorship testing is one of the classics in property testing of boolean functions. A more generalized problem considers testing whether the presented function is a \(k\)-monomial. If you are a regular reader of the posts on PTReview, you might have seen this problem essentially asks you to test whether a boolean function \(f \colon \mathcal{F}^n \to {0,1}\) is an indicator of an \((n-d)\) dimensional affine/linear subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\) (here \(\mathcal{F}\) denotes a finite field). Namely, you would like to test whether the set \(f^{-1}\) is an \((n-k)\) dimensional affine subspace of \(\mathcal{F}^n\). The paper under review improves the state-of-the-art query complexity for this problem from a previous value of \(O\left(|\mathcal{F}|/\varepsilon\right)\) to \(\tilde{O}\left(1/\varepsilon\right)\).</p>

<p><strong>Non-Adaptive Edge Counting and Sampling via Bipartite Independent Set Queries</strong> (by Raghavendra Addanki, Andrew McGregor, and Cameron Musco)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02817">arXiv</a>) If you have been around the PTReview corner for a while, you know that sublinear time estimation of graph properties is one of our favorite pastimes here. Classic work in this area considers the following queries: vertex degree queries, \(i\)-th neighbor queries, and edge existence queries. This classic query model has received a lot of attention and thanks to the work of Eden and Rosenbaum we know algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity \(O(n/\sqrt{m}) \cdot poly(\log n) \cdot poly(1/\varepsilon)\). Motivated by a desire to obtain more query-efficient algorithms, Beame et al. introduced an augmented query model where you are also allowed the following queries: you may pick \(L, R \subseteq V\) and you get a yes/no response indicating whether there exists an edge in \(E(L, R)\). These are also called the bipartite independent set <em>(BIS)</em> queries. The featured paper shows that with (<em>BIS</em>) queries you get <em>non-adaptive</em> algorithms for near-uniform edge sampling with query complexity being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4} \log^6 n)\). The main result of the paper gives a non-adaptive algorithm for estimating the number of edges in \(G\) with query complexity (under <em>BIS</em>) being a mere \(\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5} \log^5 n)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Query-Optimal Algorithm for Finding Counterfactuals</strong> (by Guy Blanc, Caleb Koch, Jane Lange, Li-Yang Tan)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07072">arXiv</a>) Given an abstract space \(X^d\), an instance \(x^* \in X^d\) and a model \(f\) (which you think of as a boolean function over \(X^d\)), a point \(x’ \in X^d\) is called a counterfactual to \(x^*\) if \(x^*, x’\) differ in few features (i.e., have a small Hamming distance) and \(f(x^*) \neq f(x’)\). Ideally, you would like to find counterfactuals that are as close to each other in Hamming Distance. The main result of this paper is the following: Take a monotone model \(f \colon \{0,1\}^d \to \{0,1\}\), an instance \(x^* \in \{0,1\}^d\) with small sensitivity (say \(\alpha\)). Then there exists an algorithm that makes at most \(\alpha^{\Delta(x^*)}\) queries to \(f\) and returns all optimal counterfactuals of \(f\). Here \(\Delta(x^*) = \min_{x \in \{0,1\}^d} \{\Delta_H(x, x^*) \colon f(x) \neq f(x^*) \}\). The paper also proves a matching lower bound on query complexity which is obtained by some monotone model \(f\).</p>

<p><strong>A Sublinear-Time Quantum Algorithm for Approximating Partition Functions</strong> (by Arjan Cornelissen and Yassine Hamoudi)(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08643">arXiv</a>) For the classical Hamiltonian \(H \colon \Omega \to \{0,1, \ldots, n\}\), at inverse temperature \(\beta\), the probability, under the so-called Gibbs distribution, assigned to a state \(x \in \Omega\) is proportional to \(\exp(-\beta H(x))\). The partition function is given by \(Z(\beta) = \sum_{x \in \Omega} \exp(-\beta H(x))\). At high temperatures (or low values of \(\beta\)) the partition function is typically easy to compute. However, the low-temperature regime is often challenging. You use MCMC methods to compute \(Z(\infty)\). In particular, you write this as the following telescoping product \(Z(\infty) = Z(0) \cdot \prod_{i = 0}^{i = \ell – 1} \frac{Z(\beta_{i+1})}{Z(\beta_i)}\) where \(0 = \beta_1 &lt; \beta_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; \beta_{\ell} = \infty\) is some increasing sequence of inverse temperatures with limited fluctuations in Gibbs distribution between two consecutive values and you use MCMC methods to estimate each of the \(\ell\) ratios in the above product. The main result of this paper presents a quantum algorithm that on input a Gibbs distribution generated by a Markov Chain with a large spectral gap performs sublinearly few steps (in size of the logarithm of the state space) of the quantum walk operator and returns a \(\pm \varepsilon Z(\infty)\) additive estimate to \(Z(\infty)\).</p>

<p><strong>A Near-Cubic Lower Bound for 3-Query Locally Decodable Codes from Semirandom CSP Refutation</strong> (by Omar Alrabiah, Venkatesan Guruswami, Pravesh Kothari, and Peter Manohar)(<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2022/101/">ECCC</a>) If you made it till here, it is time for a treat. Let us close (hopefully, I did not miss any papers this time!) with a breakthrough in Locally Decodable Codes. So, for 2-query LDCs, we know fairly tight bounds on the block length. For 3-query LDCs, on the other hand, we know a sub-exponential upper bound on the block length. However, the best-known lower bound on the block length was merely quadratic. The featured paper improves this to a cubic lower bound on the block length. The main tool used to achieve this is a surprising connection between the existence of locally decodable codes and the refutation of Boolean CSP instances with limited randomness. This looks like a fantastic read to close off this month’s report!</p></div>

<p> Dan Spielman asked me to blog about the Held Prize. I first present what he send me, and then have some thoughts.</p><p><br /></p><p>FROM DAN: </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Nominations are now being accepted for the National Academy of Sciences’ 2023 Michael and Sheila Held Prize. The Held Prize honors outstanding, innovative, creative, and influential research in the areas of combinatorial and discrete optimization, or related parts of computer science, such as the design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. This $100,000 prize is intended to recognize recent work (defined as published within the last eight years). Additional information, including past recipients, eligibility requirements, and more, can be found at <a href="http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/michael-and-sheila-held-prize.html">here</a>.</p><p>All nominations must be submitted online. Unless otherwise stated, the following materials must be submitted: </p><p>A letter from the nominator describing the candidate's work and why he or she should be selected for the award. No more than three (3) pages.</p><p>Curriculum vitae. No more than two (2) pages (similar to CVs included with NSF proposals).</p><p>Bibliography listing no more than twelve (12) of the nominee's most significant publications.</p><p>Suggested citation. A 50-word summary stating why the nominee should be considered for this award. (Citation</p><p>examples)</p><p>Two letters of support. Support letters must be written by individuals from institutions outside both the</p><p>nominator's and the nominee’s institution. Up to three letters of support are accepted.</p><p>Nominations will be accepted through Monday, October 3, 2022. Please help spread the word that the nomination process is underway. </p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>BILL COMMENTS</p><p>1) The scope seems rather broad (Dan confirmed this in private email) in that its Comb Opt AND Discrete Opt OR related fields like algorithms and complexity theory. </p><p>2) The research has to be Outstanding AND Innovative AND creative AND influential. That seems hard to do :-(  If they made it an OR instead of an AND I may ask someone to nominate me for my Muffin Work. It does use 0-1 programming!</p><p>3) The past winners are, of course, very impressive. But there is one I want to point out to emphasize that the scope is broad: Amit Sahai won in 2022, and here is what the webpage says about it:</p><p>For a leading role in development of cryptographic Software Obfuscation and its applications, starting from initial conception of "Indistinguishability Obfuscation" and culminating in new constructions based upon well-founded cryptographic assumptions. These breakthroughs highlight how computational complexity can enable secrecy while computing in insecure environments.</p><p>4) Comb Opt and Discrete Opt seem to be Operations Research. So this inspires the following question:</p><p><i>What are the similarities and differences between Operations Research and Research on Algorithms?</i> </p><p>I tend to think of Operations Research  as being more tied to the real world- but is that true?</p><p>5) Not enough 2-letter combinations  for what you want to say: I had to use the term <i>Operations Research </i>instead of the abbreviation OR since I was using OR for or. Oh well. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>Science magazine has an article written by Adrian Cho <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ordinary-computers-can-beat-google-s-quantum-computer-after-all">Ordinary computers can beat Google’s quantum computer after all</a>. It is about the remarkable progress in classical simulations of sampling task like those sampling tasks that led to the 2019 Google’s announcement of “quantum supremacy”. I reported about the breakthrough paper of Feng Pan and Pan Zhang <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/03/10/amazing-feng-pan-and-pan-zhang-announced-a-way-to-spoof-classically-simulate-the-googles-quantum-supremacy-circuit/">in this post</a> and there are updates in the post itself and the comment section about a variety of related works by several groups of researchers.</p>
<p>The very short summary is that by now classical algorithms are ten orders of magnitude faster than those used in the Google paper and hence the speed-up is ten orders of magnitude lower than Google’s fantastic claims. (The Google paper claims that their ultimate task that required 300 seconds for the quantum computer will require 10,000 years on a powerful supercomputers. with the new algorithms the task can be done in a matter of seconds.)</p>
<p>Also regarding the Google supremacy paper, my paper with Yosi Rinott and Tomer Shoham,  <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/sts836.pdf">Statistical Aspects of the Quantum Supremacy Demonstration,</a> just appeared in “Statistical Science”. (Click on the link for the journal version.) The Google 2019 paper and, more generally, NISQ experiments raise various interesting statistical issues. (In addition, it is important to double check various statistical claims of the paper.) One of our findings is that there is a large gap between the empirical distribution and the Google noise model. I hope to devote some future post to our paper and to some further research we were doing.</p>
<p>The leaking of the Google paper in September 23, 2019 led to huge media and academic attention and many very enthusiastic reactions.  I also wrote here on the blog a <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">few</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">critical</a> <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/the-story-of-poincare-and-his-friend-the-baker/">posts</a> about the Google claims.</p>
<p>Here is a figure with the price of bitcoin around the time of the Google quantum supremacy (unintended) announcement.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: There is a recent post on Shtetl Optimized with <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6645">Scott Aaronson’s take</a> on the supremacy situation. Overall our assessments are not very far apart. I don’t understand the claim: “If the experimentalists care enough, they could easily regain the quantum lead, at least for a couple more years, by (say) repeating random circuit sampling with 72 qubits rather than 53-60, and hopefully circuit depth of 30-40 rather than just 20-25.” </p></div>

We show that lower bounds on the border rank of matrix multiplication can be used to non-trivially derandomize polynomial identity testing for small algebraic circuits. Letting $\underline{R}(n)$ denote the border rank of $n \times n \times n$ matrix multiplication, we construct a hitting set generator with seed length $O(\sqrt{n} \cdot \underline{R}^{-1}(s))$ that hits $n$-variate circuits of multiplicative complexity $s$. If the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ is not 2, our generator has seed length $O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$ and hits circuits of size $O(n^{1 + \delta})$ for sufficiently small $\varepsilon, \delta &gt; 0$. Surprisingly, the fact that $\underline{R}(n) \ge n^2$ already yields new, non-trivial hitting set generators for circuits of sublinear multiplicative complexity.</div>

Concretely efficient interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) are of interest due to their applications to scaling blockchains, their minimal security assumptions, and their potential future-proof resistance to quantum attacks.

Scalable IOPs, in which prover time scales quasilinearly with the computation size and verifier time scales poly-logarithmically with it, have been known to exist thus far only over a set of finite fields of negligible density, namely, over "FFT-friendly" fields that contain a sub-group of size  $2^k$.

Our main result is to show that scalable IOPs can be constructed over any sufficiently large finite field, of size that is at least quadratic in the length of computation whose integrity is proved by the IOP. This result has practical applications as well, because it reduces the proving and verification complexity of cryptographic statements that are naturally stated over pre-defined finite fields which are not "FFT-friendly".

Prior state-of-the-art scalable IOPs relied heavily on arithmetization via univariate polynomials and Reed--Solomon codes over FFT-friendly fields. To prove our main result and extend scalability to all large finite fields, we generalize the prior techniques and use new algebraic geometry codes evaluated on sub-groups of elliptic curves (elliptic curve codes). We also show a new arithmetization scheme that uses the rich and well-understood group structure of elliptic curves to reduce statements of computational integrity to other statements about the proximity of functions evaluated on the elliptic curve to the new family of elliptic curve codes.

This paper continues our recent work [Ben-Sasson et al., ECCC TR21-103] that used elliptic curves and their subgroups to create FFT-based algorithms for polynomial manipulation over generic finite fields. However, our new IOP constructions force us to use new codes (ones that are not based on polynomials), and this poses a new set of challenges involving the more restricted automorphism group of these codes, and the constraints of Riemann--Roch spaces of strictly positive genus.</div>

<p><strong>Scott’s Introduction</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Hartmanis">Juris Hartmanis</a> — one of the founding figures of theoretical computer science, winner of the Turing Award, cofounder of the Cornell computer science department (of which I’m an alumnus), cofounder of the <a href="https://computationalcomplexity.org/">Conference on Computational Complexity</a> or CCC (which I just attended), PhD adviser to many of the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/hartmanisstud.pdf">leading complexity theorists</a> — has passed away at age 94.</p>



<p>Scientifically, Hartmanis will be remembered as long as our field exists for several contributions.  First and foremost, his 1965 proof, with Richard Stearns, of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_hierarchy_theorem">time</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_hierarchy_theorem">space</a> hierarchy theorems, which adapt Turing’s undecidability theorems to show that there exist computable problems that are arbitrarily hard (and thus, if you like, that the new field of computational complexity theory would have a subject matter).  Second, his and Berman’s investigation, in the 1970s, of the detailed structure of NP-complete problems (are they “paddable”? can they be <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2016/162/download/">sparse</a>? are all NP-complete sets <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/survey/Isomorphism-Conjecture.pdf">polynomial-time isomorphic</a>?  or as we now believe, are they not?), which helped start the whole area of “structural complexity theory” (the original subject matter of the CCC conference).  Third, his investigations of logic and complexity theory, including whether problems like P vs. NP could be <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/indep.pdf">independent</a> of the axioms of set theory, and the relations of that question to relativization and oracles.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/">this memorial post</a> by Richard Lipton and Ken Regan points out, some of Hartmanis’s most important contributions are so basic that it feels weird today even to mention them explicitly: the use of Turing machines to model computational complexity (!).  The study of complexity via “complexity classes,” consisting of all problems solvable within a given resource bound.  The whole <a href="https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo">Complexity Zoo</a> could’ve been renamed Jurisic Park.</p>



<p>One of my regrets in life is that I didn’t get to know Hartmanis well when I was an undergrad at Cornell.  (This was a stage of my life when I was still intimidated by my professors, or hyper-mega-intimidated if they were Juris Hartmanis.)  I actually conversed with him more after I’d graduated and returned for visits.  He was so considerate and kind, almost grandfatherly, that I realized how foolish I was not to have sought him out as a student.</p>



<p>There was, however, another undergrad at Cornell at the same time as me, who wasn’t <em>quite</em> as intimidated as I was, and who ended up doing an independent study with Hartmanis, about the possibility of complete problems for NP∩coNP if I remember correctly.  This undergrad’s real goal was to solve the P vs. NP problem, which might sound ridiculous until I tell you that his name was <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/">Ryan Williams</a>.  I asked Ryan to share his own memories of Juris, and he’s graciously done so below.  You won’t regret reading this.  —SA</p>

<p><strong>Juris Hartmanis by Ryan Williams</strong></p>



<p>I am extremely sad that Professor Juris Hartmanis has passed away. He made an enormous impact on my early career, and on my growth as a scientist: arguably, I wouldn’t be a scientist at all without him. He was extraordinarily gentle, inspiring, and encouraging to me.</p>



<p>My story of how I know Professor Hartmanis is really my “origin story” as a theoretical computer scientist. So I’ll tell you a little about the situation before I met him, to give some before/after context.</p>



<p>As a freshman at Cornell learning math and computer science, I became captivated by P vs NP and P vs PSPACE. In my teenage hubris, I planned it out: in the spring I’d take discrete math, fall I’d take the intro to theory of computing, and the following spring I’d take the grad complexity course being taught by Prof. Hartmanis that term. After that, I’d go to grad school in theory, and somewhere along the way tackle P vs NP. Simple enough…</p>



<p>I did fine in discrete math, but struggled in intro to theory, partly due to the fact that the lectures (and exams) were at 9am. I managed to do well on the final and earned a B+. I began to wonder if my plan was unsound. I went to the instructor and told them of my plan. They recommended that I should not try for grad school, as I didn’t seem to be particularly talented and there were “no jobs in theory”. (Jobs? Who needs jobs?) I asked if my chances of getting in grad school would be improved if I did well in the grad complexity class. They said “maybe”, and that was enough to keep me going.</p>



<p>The vibe in Prof. Hartmanis’ class was amazing. He was exceptionally passionate about teaching complexity. His lectures were a revelation; they were exhilarating. He stayed laser-focused on communicating the heart of the ideas, with brevity and levity as needed to avoid the technical details (often nasty in the case of Turing machines). In the margins of my own class notes, I jotted down countless one-liners and antics. One of my favorite memories is that, when he wanted to be done with a proof and was tired of further questions, he would write his Q.E.D. symbol very large, with a little intimidating devil inside of it, like so:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://www.scottaaronson.com/devil.png" alt="" /></figure></div>


<p>As he’d often be packing more material in the lecture than time allowed, he joked that he wasn’t responsible for what was said in the last five minutes of class (when he’d rush to cover what remained). He was having so much <em>fun</em> with the material, and he repeatedly showed that one could think about these very deep and complex things very simply. My intuition for complexity grew so fast that the rest of my mathematical education was lifted immeasurably by it.</p>



<p>In response, I began to take my studies very seriously that semester. I showed up to every session of his office hours. I peppered him with questions after class. He was unwaveringly patient, helping me sort out my latest confusion. Eventually my questions turned into actual research problems, which occasionally received interesting answers (mostly already answered in the literature). After the semester ended, I began to schedule weekly meetings with him, discussing anything and everything complexity. He always seemed happy to chat, and during conversations he made the development of my research taste a top priority. He made it clear when what I was saying was interesting to him, and when it wasn’t… and if it wasn’t, I needed to explain why I found it interesting. But I understood that all of this was for my education as a future theoretical computer scientist, which he treated as inevitable.</p>



<p>I don’t know why Professor Hartmanis believed in me. During that period in my life, I felt like nobody else did, and it felt odd that the Turing Award winner was the one who believed the most. On the coattails of his eager recommendation, I was able to attend an REU at DIMACS. Later he was shocked and annoyed when in spite of his letter, I was rejected from every grad school I applied to (I suppose the B+ didn’t help). However, probably owing to Prof. Hartmanis’ stature at the NSF, I was still awarded an NSF grad fellowship. When I told him of the good and bad news, and that I had no Plan B, he immediately picked up the phone and called someone explaining the situation. He hung up and announced “Congratulations Ryan, you have been admitted to the MEng program.” So I spent the next year in Ithaca as an MEng student. He informed me he was retiring, and maybe grad programs are getting skeptical of complexity. Maybe I should try to sneak in by studying something adjacent. He suggested working with Bart Selman on SAT (which I did). My confidence was shaken by the rejections but, seeing how strongly he believed in me, I could not let him down.</p>



<p>He was always full of affirmations for me, with a trademark mix of humor and motivation. After I would report a batch of new observations, he would say something like: “As they say, the biggest pig eats the most potatoes. And you sir, are a very big pig!” After I had a paper accepted to SODA, he declared that I was now a computer scientist. After I had a paper accepted to IJCAI, he declared that I had become a world-famous computer scientist. Prof. Hartmanis remained my strongest champion and loudest cheerleader in research, until I was finally admitted to some grad schools the next time around.</p>



<p>I’m immensely grateful to have known him. Without his faith, I’d have never become a theoretical computer scientist. Without his initial influence, I’d have never been a good one. I’ve been writing entirely through tears; I hope for everyone reading that they too have the chance to impact a young person’s life so profoundly.</p>

<p> Juris Hartmanis, one of the founders of Complexity Theory, passed away on July 29 at the age of 94.  The Gödel's Last Letter blog has an obit posted <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/">here</a>.  Scott Aaronson has some words and a guest post by Ryan Williams <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6622">here</a>. When other bloggers post obits I will update this paragraph to point to them. </p><p>Here is one non-blog obit: <a href="https://usobit.com/obituaries-2022/juris-hartmanis-july-5-1928-july-29-2022-age-94/">here</a>.  For an interview with Juris see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2736346">here</a>.</p><p>Hartmanis and Stearns shared the 1993  Turing award for the paper <i>On the Computational Complexity of</i> <i>Algorithms </i>(see <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7.pdf">here</a> for the paper and see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/194313.214781">here</a> for his Turing Award Talk). In that paper they define DTIME(T(n)) for Turing Machines. They also proved some theorems about how changes to the model (1-tape, 2-tape, 1-dim, 2-dim others) change the notion of DTIME(T(n))- so they were well aware that the definition was not robust. They also have some theorems about computable numbers. </p><p>We are used to the notion that you can measure how long a computation takes my counting the number of steps on a Turing Machine. Before the Hartmanis-Stearns paper this was not how people thought of things. Knuth (I suspect independently) was looking at what we might now call concrete complexity- how many operations does an algorithm need. Hartmanis-Stearns were beginning what is now called Complexity Theory. </p><p> Recall that later, the Cook-Levin Theorem used Turing Machines. </p><p>If Hartmanis-Stearns did not start the process of putting complexity on a rigorous mathematical basis how might complexity theory have evolved? It is possible we would not have the Cook-Levin Theorem or the notion of NP. It is possible that we would ASSUME that SAT is hard and use that to get other problems hard, and also do reverse reductions as well to get some problems equivalent to SAT. Indeed- this IS what we do in other parts of theory with assuming the following problems are hard (for various definitions of hard): 3SUM, APSP, Unique Games. And in Crypto Factoring, DL, SVP, and other problems. </p><p>Hartmanis did other things as well. I list some of them that are of interest to me - other people will likely list other things of interest to them. </p><p>0) He had 21 PhD Students, some of them quite prominent. The list of them is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/hartmanisstud.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>1) The Berman-Hartmanis Conjecture: All NP-Complete sets are poly isomorphic. Seems true for all natural NP-complete sets. Still open. This conjecture inspired a lot of work on sparse sets including that if a sparse set S is btt-hard for NP, then P=NP (proven by Ogiwara-Watanabe)</p><p>2) The Boolean Hierarchy: we all know what NP is. What about sets that are the <i>difference </i>of two NP sets? What about sets of the form A - (B-C) where A,B,C are all in NP? These form a hierarchy. We of course do not know if the hierarchy is proper, but if it collapse then PH collapses.</p><p>3) He helped introduce time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity into complexity theory, see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4568108">here</a>.</p><p>4) He was Lance Fortnow's undergraduate advisor. </p><p>5) There is more but I will stop here.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

Juris Hartmanis passed away this morning. He was a professor in Cornell’s computer science department since 1965. He won the 1993 Turing Award with Richard Stearns for their 1963–1965 <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1965-117-00/S0002-9947-1965-0170805-7/">paper</a> “On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms.”</p>
<p>
Today, Dick and I express our condolences and also appreciation for a long life and career shaping our field of computational complexity theory. </p>
<p>
One mark of a long life is that the <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-4478-3">Complexity Theory Retrospective</a> volume honoring his 60th birthday in 1988 was longer ago than the beginning of my tenure-track career at Buffalo in 1989. In the early 1980s, when I met both him and Alan Selman (who edited the volume), they were progenitors of the vein within computational complexity that emphasizes the structure of classes of problems. </p>
<p>
I mean “progenitor” quite strongly: When I joined Cornell as a Mathematical Sciences Institute postdoc in 1986, the Computer Science Department generously gave me office space a few doors down from Juris in Upson Hall. I mixed with a gaggle of his students: Lane Hemaspaandra and Jim Kadin and Richard Chang and Desh Ranjan, also saw much of Jin-Yi Cai on his return visits, and had just missed Ming Li and Luc Longpré. We all amplified the energy that Juris brought to the field.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Echo in Quantum </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The structural framework needed to be filled with combinatorial power from other areas of mathematical sciences. But to see the framework’s longevity, one need look no further than the Best Paper in the 2022 Computational Complexity Conference and a paper just accepted to FOCS 2022 that was <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-algorithms-conquer-a-new-kind-of-problem-20220711/">featured</a> in <em>Quanta</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10409">The Acrobatics of BQP</a>” by Scott Aaronson, DeVon Ingram, and William Kretschmer. <p></p>
</li><li>
“<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">Verifiable Quantum Advantage Without Structure</a>” by Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry.
</li></ul>
<p>
Both are on quantum computing, a field that really began to exist about the time that Juris decided that Pankaj Rohatgi would be his last PhD student. The foci are problems involving Fourier transforms and their correlations, error-correcting codes, and the relationship of randomness to entropy that go well beyond what we thought of as “Structure.” Neither paper cites anything by Juris. Yet the former paper’s results are framed as complexity class relations that jump off the page—here are just three square centimeters of the abstract:</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/acrobaticssnippet/" rel="attachment wp-att-20268"><img width="450" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AcrobaticsSnippet.jpg?resize=450%2C115&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-20268" height="115" /></a></p>
<p>
All three results in the latter paper are relative to a random oracle; the first states: “There are NP search problems solvable by BQP machines but not BPP machines.” The expansion of formal machine models from the basic Turing machine, in order to embrace elements of complexity, is the backbone of the paper with Stearns. The relation of machine models to classes in the presence of oracles was the focus of Juris’s ICALP 1986 <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-16761-7_62">paper</a> with Lane, “Complexity Classes Without Machines.” </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Founding Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My pithiest statement of the 1965 paper’s impact is that it made Turing’s tape-machine formulation <em>durable</em>. Indeed, the notions of streaming algorithms, nearly-linear time efficiency, and data locality being one-dimensional that I recall from the 1990s have more affinity to that paper’s technical development than to the polynomial benchmark of feasibility that yielded the formalizations of P and NP either side of 1970. Here are two machine diagrams from the paper:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/hs65tapes/" rel="attachment wp-att-20269"><img width="525" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HS65tapes.jpg?resize=525%2C289&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-20269" height="289" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
Before giving the second diagram, let me note that their simple question of whether there is any algebraic irrational number that can be computed to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> places in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n)}" class="latex" /> time by this kind of machine, has yet to be answered.</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/07/29/juris-hartmanis-1928-2022/hs65tht/" rel="attachment wp-att-20271"><img width="525" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/HS65THT.jpg?resize=525%2C294&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-20271" height="294" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The latter diagram conveys their proof of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_hierarchy_theorem">Time Hierarchy Theorem</a>—though needing a quadratic separation, as today’s logarithmic-gap formulation needed an improvement the following year by Stearns with Frederick Hennie. That is to say, the paper that defined complexity measures also demonstrated how it is possible to prove lower bounds for them. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> It Could Have Been Lambdas </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Lest you think the machine formulation was inevitable at the start, consider the following <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/fiftieth-anniversary-of-publication-of.html?showComment=1431672005603#c7849278842572743298">comment</a> from “Mathai”—whom I take to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathai_Joseph">Mathai Joseph</a>—in Lance Fortnow’s 2015 <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/fiftieth-anniversary-of-publication-of.html">post</a> marking the paper’s 50th anniversary:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I talked to Hartmanis about this in 2012 and asked if they had considered using recursive function theory. He said they had and it had made things horribly complicated. Then they came across Turing machines and the whole thing became ‘so simple’ !” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I myself once took part in work trying to re-base complexity on recursion in an alteration of the lambda calculus. So many things have earned the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit">Turing tarpits</a>; theirs based squarely on Turing was not.</p>
<p>
Dick Karp, quoted by Stearns in his <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5272">contribution</a> to the 60th birthday volume, captured the paper’s importance:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[I]t is the 1965 paper by Juris Hartmanis and Richard Stearns that marks the beginning of the modern era of complexity theory. Using the Turing machine as their model of an abstract computer, [they] provided a precise definition of the “complexity class” consisting of all problems solvable in a number of steps bounded by some given function of the input length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />. Adapting the diagonalization technique that Turing had used to prove the undecidability of the Halting Problem, they proved many interesting results about the structure of complexity classes. All of us who read their paper could not fail to realize that we now had a satisfactory formal framework for pursuing the questions that [Jack] Edmonds had raised earlier in an intuitive fashion.</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Dick and I have talked about the importance of good definitions often on this blog, and here is a similar <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/08/what-makes-great-definition.html">post</a> by Lance. In my formative years, I was fortunate to have two texts that wove theirs and the P-NP-based definitions together: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability">[GJ79]</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Automata_Theory,_Languages,_and_Computation">[HU79]</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Undecidability and Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
A second vein of Juris’s work made a more particular impression on me, even before I met him. For SWAT (now FOCS) in 1967, he wrote a single-author <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/321495.321507">paper</a>, “On the Complexity of Undecidable Problems in Automata Theory.” The essence is that above a certain level of machine sophistication, whenever you prove the “good news” of lower bounds to separate classes in a hierarchy, you also get the “bad news” of there being problems between the class levels whose status is not resolvable in whatever strong system of logic you employ. </p>
<p>
This raises the question, for classes like P and NP that have not yet been separated, whether the logical independence phenomenon washes over the entire landscape. He and John Hopcroft wrote a short <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008335.1008336">paper</a> for SIGACT News outlining this possibility. The topic was taken up by others, including Dick with Rich De Millo and later myself, and continues to percolate. </p>
<p>
One of his last papers, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44577-3_17">Computational Complexity and Mathematical Proofs</a>,” takes the opposite avenue of how the structure of computations influences the production of proofs, including interactive proofs. This was based on an earlier paper with Chang, Ranjan, and Rohatgi, which I covered in a 2015 <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/05/17/the-shapes-of-computations/">post</a>. This diagram conveys the idea:</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Dinner Before Going to NSF </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One of my most delightful memories is sitting next to Juris at the conference dinner at the IFIP 1994 congress in Hamburg. Earlier that day I had met the conference honoree, Konrad Zuse, even speaking a little in German with him. We were not seated close to Zuse—indeed, I am not confident to say either way whether he was there. But seated across from us was a woman representing the NSF whom Juris was most interested to talk with.</p>
<p>
The strong memory I have is that I did not commandeer the conversation toward technical problems within structural complexity. Juris was eager to convey command and interest in the breadth of Computer Science, and so was I. We three went further: into music and art and culture quite apart from computers. It was a delightful flow of talk for almost two hours. Juris thanked me afterward for not waxing technical. I did not fully get the picture until Juris <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=101782">joined</a> NSF as Director of CISE two years later, in 1996. </p>
<p>
There is much more I could say about his work promoting the complexity theory community, about being a founding editor of the Springer-Verlag <em>Lecture Notes in Computer Science</em> series, about helping to found Cornell’s computer science department. On the last, his longtime Cornell colleague Anil Nerode has sent me this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “I was chairman of the committee of three, which included Bob Walker, that selected him to chair and organize a new computer science department. He already exhibited the scientific and people skills, and the breadth of vision, for which he was later famous. I will miss him very much.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
One other detail I remember of Juris’s personal life is that he liked sporty cars. I am not among those who rode with him muscularly in one—other drivers have filled that niche for me. We invite readers who have done so—or who wish to give any other personal reminiscences—to contribute below. I’ll leave with the observation that of the two scientists in this photo—</p>

<p>I am pleased to post <a href="http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sangio/" target="_blank">Davide Sangiorgi</a>'s interview with <a href="https://concur2022.mimuw.edu.pl/tot-award/" target="_blank">CONCUR 2022 Test-of-Time Award</a> recipient <a href="http://pauillac.inria.fr/~leifer/" target="_blank">James Leifer</a>, who will receive the award for the paper <br /><a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44618-4_19.pdf" target="_blank">"Deriving Bisimulation Congruences for Reactive Systems</a>" co-authored with the late Robin Milner. <br /></p><p>Thanks to James for painting a rich picture of the scientific and social context within which the work on that paper was done and to Davide for conducting the interview. I trust that readers of this blog will enjoy reading it as much as I did. </p><div><b>Davide:</b> How did the work presented in your CONCUR ToT paper come about?</div><div><br /></div><div><b>James:</b> I  was introduced to Robin Milner by my undergraduate advisor Bernard  Sufrin around 1994. Thanks to that meeting, I started with Robin at  Cambridge in 1995 as a fresh Ph.D. student. Robin had recently moved  from Edinburgh and had a wonderful research group, including, at various  times, Peter Sewell, Adriana Compagnoni, Benjamin Pierce, and Philippa  Gardner. There were also many colleagues working or visiting Cambridge  interested in process calculi: Davide Sangiorgi, Andy Gordon, Luca  Cardelli, Martín Abadi,... It was an exciting atmosphere!  I was  particularly close to Peter Sewell, with whom I discussed the ideas here  extensively and who was generous with his guidance.</div><div><br /></div><div>There  was a trend in the community at the time of building complex process  calculi (for encryption, Ambients, etc.) where the free syntax would be  quotiented by a structural congruence to "stir the soup" and allow  different parts of a tree to float together; reaction rules (unlabelled  transitions) then would permit those agglomerated bits to react, to  transform into something new.</div><div><br /></div><div>Robin wanted to  come up with a generalised framework, which he called Action Calculi,  for modelling this style of process calculi.  His framework would  describe graph-like "soups" of atoms linked together by arcs  representing binding and sharing; moreover the atoms could contain  subgraphs inside of them for freezing activity (as in prefixing in the pi-calculus), with the possibility of boundary crossing arcs  (similarly to how nu-bound names in pi-calculus can be used in  deeply nested subterms).  </div><div><br /></div><div>Robin had an amazing  talent for drawing beautiful graphs! He would "move" the nodes around  on the chalkboard and reveal how a subgraph was in fact a reactum (the  LHS of an unlabelled transition).  In the initial phases of my Ph.D. I  just tried to understand these graphs: they were so natural to draw on  the blackboard! And yet, they were also so uncomfortable to use when  written out in linear tree- and list-like syntax, with so many distinct  concrete representations for the same graph.</div><div><br /></div><div>Putting  aside the beauty of these graphs, what was the benefit of this  framework? If one could manage to embed a process calculus in  Action Calculi, using the graph structure and fancy binding and nesting  to represent the quotiented syntax, what then?  We dreamt about a  proposition along the following lines: if you represent your syntax  (quotiented by your structural congruence) in Action Calculi graphs, and  you represent your reaction rules as Action Calculi graph rewrites,  then we will give you a congruential bisimulation for free!</div><div><br /></div><div>Compared  to CCS for example, many of the rich new process calculi lacked  labelled transitions systems. In CCS, there was a clean, simple notion  of labelled transitions and, moreover, bisimulation over those labelled  transitions yielded a congruence: for all processes <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>, and all  process contexts<i> C[-]</i>, if <i>P ~ Q</i>, then <i>C[P] ~ C[Q]</i>. This is a  key quality for a bisimulation to possess, since it allows modular  reasoning about pieces of a process, something that's so much harder in a  concurrent world than in a sequential one.</div><div><br /></div><div>Returning  to Action Calculi, we set out to make good on the dream that everyone  gets a congruential bisimulation for free! Our idea was to find a  general method to derive labelled transitions systems from the  unlabelled transitions and then to prove that bisimulation built from  those labelled transitions would be a congruence.</div><div><br /></div><div>The  idea was often discussed at that time that there was a duality whereby a  process undergoing a labelled transition could be thought of as the  environment providing a complementary context inducing the process to  react. In the early labelled transition system in pi-calculus for  example, I recall hearing that <i>P</i> undergoing the input labelled  transition <i>xy</i> could be thought of as the environment outputting  payload<i> y </i>on channel <i>x</i> to enable a tau transition with <i>P.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>So  I tried to formalise this notion that labelled transitions are  environmental contexts enabling reaction, i.e. defining <i>P ---C[-]---&gt; P'</i> to mean <i>C[P] ------&gt; P'</i> provided that <i>C[-]</i> was somehow "minimal", i.e. contained nothing superfluous beyond  what was necessary to trigger the reaction. We wanted to get a rigorous  definition of that intuitive idea. There was a long and difficult period  (about 12 months) wandering through the weeds trying to define minimal  contexts for Action Calculi graphs (in terms of minimal nodes and  minimal arcs), but it was hugely complex, frustrating, and ugly and we  seemed no closer to the original goal of achieving congruential  bisimulation with these labelled transitions systems.</div><div><br /></div><div>Eventually  I stepped back from Action Calculi and started to work on a more  theoretical definition of "minimal context" and we took inspiration from  category theory.  Robin had always viewed Action Calculi graphs as  categorical arrows between objects (where the objects represented  interfaces for plugging together arcs). At the time, there was much  discussion of category theory in the air (for game theory); I certainly  didn't understand most of it but found it interesting and inspiring. </div><div><br /></div><div>If  we imagine that processes and process-contexts are just categorical  arrows (where the objects are arities) then context composition is arrow  composition. Now, assuming we have a reaction rule <i>R ------&gt; R'</i>,  we can define labelled transitions <i>P ---C[-]---&gt; P'</i> as follows:  there exists a context <i>D</i> such that <i>C[P] = D[R] </i>and <i>P' = D[R']</i>.  The first equality is a commuting diagram and Robin and I thought that  we could formalise minimality by something like a categorical pushout!  But that wasn't quite right as <i>C </i>and <i>D</i> are not <i>the minimum </i>pair (compared to all other candidates), but <i>a minimal</i> pair:  there may be many incomparable minimal pairs all of which are witnesses  of legitimate labelled transitions.  There was again a long period of  frustration eventually resolved when I reinvented "relative pushouts"  (in place of pushouts). They are a simple notion in slice categories but  I didn't know that until later...</div><div><br /></div><div>Having found  a reasonable definition of "minimal", I worked excitedly on  bisimulation, trying to get a proof of congruence: <i>P ~ Q</i> implies <i>E[P] ~ E[Q]</i>. For weeks, I was considering the labelled transitions  of <i>E[P] ---F[-]---&gt;</i> and all the ways that could arise. The most  interesting case is when a part of <i>P,</i> a part of <i>E</i>, and <i>F</i> all  "conspire" together to generate a reaction. From that I was able to  derive a labelled transition of <i>P</i> by manipulating relative pushouts,  which by hypothesis yielded a labelled transition of <i>Q</i>, and then, via a  sort of "pushout pasting", a labelled transition <i>E[Q] ---F[-]---&gt;</i>. It was a wonderful moment of elation when I pasted  all the diagrams together on Robin's board and we realised that we had  the congruence property for our synthesised labels!</div><div><br /></div><div>We  looked back again at Action Calculi, using the notion of relative  pushouts to guide us (instead of the arbitrary approach we had  considered before) and we further looked at other kinds of process  calculi syntax to see how relative pushouts could work there...   Returning to the original motivation to make Action Calculi a universal  framework with congruential bisimulation for free, I'm not convinced of  its utility. But it was the challenge that led us to the journey of the  relative pushout work, which I think is beautiful.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Davide: </b>What influence did this work have in the rest of your career? How much of your subsequent work built on it?</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>James:</b> It  was thanks to this work that I visited INRIA Rocquencourt to discuss  process calculi with Jean-Jacques Lévy and Georges Gonthier. They kindly  invited me to spend a year as postdoc in 2001 after I finished my  thesis with Robin, and I ended up staying in INRIA ever since. I didn't  work on bisimulation again as a research topic, but stayed interested in  concurrency and distribution for a long time, working with Peter Sewell  et al on distributed language design with module migration and  rebinding, and with Cédric Fournet et al on compiler design for  automatically synthesising cryptographic protocols for high level  sessions specifications.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Davide: </b>Could you tell  us about your interactions with Robin Milner? What was it like to work  with him? What lessons did you learn from him?</div><div><br /></div><div><b>James: </b>I was tremendously inspired by Robin.</div><div><br /></div><div>He  would stand at his huge blackboard, his large hands covered in chalk,  his bicycle clips glinting on his trousers, and he would stalk up and  down the blackboard --- thinking and moving.  There was something  theatrical and artistic about it: his thinking was done in physical  movement and his drawings were dynamic as the representations of his  ideas evolved across the board.</div><div><br /></div><div>I loved his  drawings. They would start simple, a circle for a node, a box for a  subgraph, etc. and then develop more and more detail corresponding to  his intuition.

(DAG) partitioning problem. The acyclic partitioning problem is defined as
partitioning the vertex set of a given directed acyclic graph into disjoint and
collectively exhaustive subsets (parts). Parts are to be assigned such that the
total sum of the vertex weights within each part satisfies a common upper bound
and the total sum of the edge costs that connect nodes across different parts
is minimized. Additionally, the quotient graph, i.e., the induced graph where
all nodes that are assigned to the same part are contracted to a single node
and edges of those are replaced with cumulative edges towards other nodes, is
also a directed acyclic graph. That is, the quotient graph itself is also a
graph that contains no cycles. Many computational and real-life applications
such as in computational task scheduling, RTL simulations, scheduling of
rail-rail transshipment tasks and Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design
make use of acyclic DAG partitioning. We address the need for a simple and
elegant mathematical formulation for the acyclic DAG partitioning problem that
enables easier understanding, communication, implementation, and
experimentation on the problem.

of static emitters. The objective is to localise the position of the emitters
in a given area by centralised coordination of mobile passive sensors. This
framework uses only the geometry of the problem to minimise the maximal bounds
of the emitters' locations without using a belief or probability distribution.
This geometric approach provides effective boundaries on the emitters'
position. It can also be useful in evaluating different decision-making
strategies for coordinating mobile passive sensors and complementing
statistical methods during the initialisation process. The effectiveness of the
geometric approach is shown by designing and evaluating a greedy
decision-making strategy, where a sensor selects its future position by
minimising the maximum uncertainty on its next measurement using one of the
global objective functions. Finally, we analyse and discuss the emergent
behaviour and robustness of the proposed algorithms.

polynomially-many queries to a function $f \colon \mathbb F_p^n \to \mathbb C$
and produces a decomposition of $f$ as a sum of cubic phases and a small error
term. This is a natural higher-order generalization of the classical
Goldreich-Levin algorithm. The classical (linear) Goldreich-Levin algorithm has
wide-ranging applications in learning theory, coding theory and the
construction of pseudorandom generators in cryptography, as well as being
closely related to Fourier analysis. Higher-order Goldreich-Levin algorithms on
the other hand involve central problems in higher-order Fourier analysis,
namely the inverse theory of the Gowers $U^k$ norms, which are well-studied in
additive combinatorics. The only known result in this direction prior to this
work is the quadratic Goldreich-Levin theorem, proved by Tulsiani and Wolf in
2011. The main step of their result involves an algorithmic version of the
$U^3$ inverse theorem. More complications appear in the inverse theory of the
$U^4$ and higher norms. Our cubic Goldreich-Levin algorithm is based on
algorithmizing recent work by Gowers and Mili\'cevi\'c who proved new
quantitative bounds for the $U^4$ inverse theorem.
</p>
<p>Our cubic Goldreich-Levin algorithm is constructed from two main tools: an
algorithmic $U^4$ inverse theorem and an arithmetic decomposition result in the
style of the Frieze-Kannan graph regularity lemma. As one application of our
main theorem we solve the problem of self-correction for cubic Reed-Muller
codes beyond the list decoding radius. Additionally we give a purely
combinatorial result: an improvement of the quantitative bounds on the $U^4$
inverse theorem.

heterogenous machines in the presence of non-uniform machine-dependent
communication delays. We are given as input a set of $n$ unit size
precedence-constrained jobs, and a set of $m$ related machines each with size
$m_i$ (machine $i$ can execute at most $m_i$ jobs at any time). Each machine
$i$ also has an associated in-delay $\rho^{\mathrm{in}}_i$ and out-delay
$\rho^{\mathrm{out}}_i$. For any job $v$, machine $i$, and time $t$, we say
that $v$ is available to machine $i$ at time $t$ if $v$ is completed on $i$

\rho^{\mathrm{out}}_j)$. If job $v$ is scheduled at time $t$ on machine $i$,
then all of its predecessors must be available to $i$ by time $t$. The
objective is to construct a schedule that minimizes makespan, which is the
maximum completion time over all jobs.

<p>We consider schedules which allow duplication of jobs as well as schedules
which do not. When duplication is allowed, we provide an asymptotic
$\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation algorithm; it is a true approximation if
the makespan also accounts for the time to communicate the jobs to the machines
and for the time to communicate the results out. For no-duplication schedules,
we also obtain an asymptotic $\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation via a
reduction to the case with duplication, and a true
$\mathrm{polylog}(n)$-approximation for symmetric delays ($\rho^{\text{in}}_{i}
= \rho^{\mathrm{out}}_i$ for all machines $i$). These results represent the
first polylogarithmic approximation algorithms for scheduling with non-uniform
communication delays.

<p>I promise you: this post is going to tell a scientifically coherent story that involves <em>all five topics </em>listed in the title.  Not one can be omitted.</p>



<p>My story starts with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpzigpEJnU">Zoom talk</a> that the one and only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind">Lenny Susskind</a> delivered for the Simons Institute for Theory of Computing back in May.  There followed a panel discussion involving Lenny, Edward Witten, Geoffrey Penington, Umesh Vazirani, and your humble shtetlmaster.</p>



<p>Lenny’s talk led up to a gedankenexperiment involving an observer, Alice, who bravely jumps into a specially-prepared black hole, in order to see the answer to a certain computational problem in her final seconds before being ripped to shreds near the singularity.  Drawing on earlier work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14646">Bouland, Fefferman, and Vazirani</a>, Lenny speculated that the computational problem could be exponentially hard even for a (standard) quantum computer.  Despite this, Lenny repeatedly insisted—indeed, he asked me again to stress here—that he was <em>not</em> claiming to violate the <a href="https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/6088/what-precisely-is-the-quantum-extended-church-turing-thesis">Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis</a> (QECTT), the statement that all of nature can be efficiently simulated by a standard quantum computer.  Instead, he was simply investigating how the QECTT needs to be <em>formulated</em> in order to be a true statement.</p>



<p>I didn’t understand this, to put it mildly.  If what Lenny was saying was right—i.e., if the infalling observer could see the answer to a computational problem not in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQP">BQP</a>, or Bounded-Error Quantum Polynomial-Time—then why <em>shouldn’t</em> we call that a violation of the QECTT?  Just like we call Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm a likely violation of the <em>classical</em> Extended Church-Turing Thesis, the thesis saying that nature can be efficiently simulated by a classical computer?  Granted, you don’t have to <em>die</em> in order to run Shor’s algorithm, as you do to run Lenny’s experiment.  But why should such implementation details matter from the lofty heights of computational complexity?</p>



<p>Alas, not only did Lenny never answer that in a way that made sense to me, he kept trying to shift the focus from real, physical black holes to “silicon spheres” made of qubits, which would be programmed to <em>simulate</em> the process of Alice jumping into the black hole (in a dual boundary description).  Say what?  Granting that Lenny’s silicon spheres, being quantum computers under another name, could clearly be simulated in BQP, wouldn’t this still leave the question about the computational powers of observers who jump into <em>actual</em> black holes—i.e., the question that we presumably cared about in the first place?</p>



<p>Confusing me even further, Witten seemed almost dismissive of the idea that Lenny’s gedankenexperiment raised any new issue for the QECTT—that is, any issue that wouldn’t already have been present in a universe without gravity.  But as to Witten’s reasons, the most I understood from his remarks was that he was worried about various “engineering” issues with implementing Lenny’s gedankenexperiment, involving gravitational backreaction and the like.  Ed Witten, now suddenly the practical guy!  I couldn’t even isolate the crux of disagreement between Susskind and Witten, since after all, they <em>agreed</em> (bizarrely, from my perspective) that the QECTT wasn’t violated.  Why wasn’t it?</p>



<p>Anyway, shortly afterward I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6457">attended the 28th Solvay Conference in Brussels</a>, where one of the central benefits I got—besides seeing friends after a long COVID absence and eating some amazing chocolate mousse—was a <em>dramatically</em> clearer understanding of the issues in Lenny’s gedankenexperiment.  I owe this improved understanding to conversations with many people at Solvay, but above all Daniel Gottesman and Daniel Harlow.  Lenny himself wasn’t there, other than in spirit, but I ran the Daniels’ picture by him afterwards and he assented to all of its essentials.</p>



<p>The Daniels’ picture is what I want to explain in this post.  Needless to say, I take sole responsibility for any errors in my presentation, as I <em>also</em> take sole responsibility for not understanding (or rather: not doing the work to translate into terms that I understood) what Susskind and Witten had said to me before.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>The first thing you need to understand about Lenny’s gedankenexperiment is that it takes place entirely in the context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence">AdS/CFT</a>: the famous holographic duality between two types of physical theories that look wildly different.  Here AdS stands for <em>anti-de-Sitter</em>: a quantum theory of gravity describing a D-dimensional universe with a negative cosmological constant (i.e. hyperbolic geometry), one where black holes can form and evaporate and so forth.  Meanwhile, CFT stands for <em>conformal field theory</em>: a quantum field theory, with no apparent gravity (and hence no black holes), that lives on the (D-1)-dimensional boundary of the D-dimensional AdS space.  The staggering claim of AdS/CFT is that every physical question about the AdS bulk can be translated into an equivalent question about the CFT boundary, and vice versa, with a one-to-one mapping from states to states and observables to observables.  So in that sense, they’re actually the <em>same</em> theory, just viewed in two radically different ways.  AdS/CFT originally came out of string theory, but then <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12981">notoriously</a> “swallowed its parent,” to the point where nowadays, if you go to what are still called “string theory” meetings, you’re liable to hear <em>vastly</em> more discussion of AdS/CFT than of actual strings.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the story I want to tell won’t depend on fine details of how AdS/CFT works.  Nevertheless, <em>you can’t just ignore the AdS/CFT part</em> as some technicality, in order to get on with the vivid tale of Alice jumping into a black hole, hoping to learn the answer to a beyond-BQP computational problem in her final seconds of existence.  The reason you can’t ignore it is that the whole beyond-BQP computational problem we’ll be talking about, involves the <em>translation</em> (or “dictionary”) between the AdS bulk and the CFT boundary.  If you like, then, it’s actually the chasm between bulk and boundary that plays the starring role in this story.  The more familiar chasm <em>within</em> the bulk, between the interior of a black hole and its exterior (the two separated by an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon">event horizon</a>), plays only a subsidiary role: that of causing the AdS/CFT dictionary to become exponentially complex, as far as anyone can tell.</p>



<p>Pause for a minute.  Previously I led you to believe that we’d be talking about an actual observer Alice, jumping into an actual physical black hole, and whether Alice could see the answer to a problem that’s intractable even for quantum computers in her last moments before hitting the singularity, and if so whether we should take that to refute the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis.  What I’m saying now is so wildly at variance with that picture, that it had to be repeated to me about 10 times before I understood it.  Once I did understand, I then had to repeat it to <em>others</em> about 10 times before <em>they</em> understood.  And I don’t care if people ridicule me for that admission—how slow Scott and his friends must be, compared to string theorists!—because my only goal right now is to get <em>you</em> to understand it.</p>



<p>To say it again: Lenny has <em>not</em> proposed a way for Alice to surpass the complexity-theoretic power of quantum computers, even for a brief moment, by crossing the event horizon of a black hole.  If <em>that</em> was Alice’s goal when she jumped into the black hole, then alas, she probably sacrificed her life for nothing!  As far as anyone knows, Alice’s experiences, even after crossing the event horizon, ought to continue to be described extremely well by general relativity and quantum field theory (at least until she nears the singularity and dies), and therefore ought to be simulatable in BQP.  Granted, we don’t actually <em>know</em> this—you can call it an open problem if you like—but it seems like a reasonable guess.</p>



<p>In that case, though, what beyond-BQP problem was Lenny talking about, and what does it have to do with black holes?  Building on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14646">Bouland-Fefferman-Vazirani paper</a>, Lenny was interested in a class of problems of the following form: Alice is given as input a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which encodes a boundary CFT state, which is dual to an AdS bulk universe that contains a black hole.  Alice’s goal is, by examining |ψ⟩, to learn something about what’s <em>inside</em> the black hole.  For example: does the black hole interior contain “shockwaves,” and if so how many and what kind?  Does it contain a wormhole, connecting it to a different black hole in another universe?  If so, what’s the volume of that wormhole?  (Not the first question <em>I</em> would ask either, but bear with me.)</p>



<p>Now, when I say Alice is “given” the state |ψ⟩, this could mean several things: she could just be physically given a collection of <em>n</em> qubits.  Or, she could be given a gigantic table of 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> amplitudes.  Or, as a third possibility, she could be given a description of a quantum circuit that prepares |ψ⟩, say from the all-0 initial state |0<sup><em>n</em></sup>⟩.  Each of these possibilities leads to a different complexity-theoretic picture, and the differences are extremely interesting to <em>me</em>, so that’s what I mostly focused on in my remarks in the panel discussion after Lenny’s talk.  But it won’t matter much for the story I want to tell in this post.</p>



<p>However |ψ⟩ is given to Alice, the prediction of AdS/CFT is that |ψ⟩ encodes everything there is to know about the AdS bulk, <em>including</em> whatever is inside the black hole—but, and this is crucial, the information about what’s inside the black hole will be <em>pseudorandomly scrambled</em>.  In other words, it works like this: whatever simple thing you’d like to know about parts of the bulk that <em>aren’t</em> hidden behind event horizons—is there a star over here? some gravitational lensing over there? etc.—it seems that you could not only learn it by measuring |ψ⟩, but learn it <em>in polynomial time</em>, the dictionary between bulk and boundary being computationally efficient in that case.  (As with almost everything else in this subject, even <em>that</em> hasn’t been rigorously proven, though my postdoc Jason Pollack and I made <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/discretebulk.pdf">some progress</a> this past spring by proving a piece of it.)  On the other hand, as soon as you want to know what’s <em>inside</em> an event horizon, the fact that there are no probes that an “observer at infinity” could apply to find out, seems to translate into the requisite measurements on |ψ⟩ being exponentially complex to apply.  (Technically, you’d have to measure an ensemble of poly(<em>n</em>) identical copies of |ψ⟩, but I’ll ignore that in what follows.)</p>



<p>In more detail, the relevant part of |ψ⟩ turns into a pseudorandom, scrambled mess: a mess that it’s plausible that no polynomial-size quantum circuit could even distinguish from the maximally mixed state.  So, while in principle the information is all there in |ψ⟩, getting it out seems as hard as various well-known problems in symmetric-key cryptography, if not literally NP-hard.  This is <em>way</em> beyond what we expect even a quantum computer to be able to do efficiently: indeed, after 30 years of quantum algorithms research, the best quantum speedup we know for this sort of task is typically just the quadratic speedup from Grover’s algorithm.</p>



<p>So now you understand why there was some hope that Alice, by jumping into a black hole, could solve a problem that’s exponentially hard for quantum computers!  Namely because, once she’s inside the black hole, she can just<em> see</em> the shockwaves, or the volume of the wormhole, or whatever, and no longer faces the exponentially hard task of decoding that information from |ψ⟩.  It’s as if the black hole has <em>solved the problem for her</em>, by physically instantiating the otherwise exponentially complex transformation between the bulk and boundary descriptions of |ψ⟩.</p>



<p>Having now gotten your hopes up, the next step in the story is to destroy them.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Here’s the fundamental problem: |ψ⟩ does <em>not</em> represent the CFT dual of a bulk universe that contains the black hole with the shockwaves or whatever, <em>and that also contains Alice herself, floating outside the black hole, and being given |ψ⟩ as an input.</em>  Indeed, it’s unclear what the latter state would even mean: how do we get around the circularity in its definition?  How do we avoid an infinite regress, where |ψ⟩ would have to encode a copy of |ψ⟩ which would have to encode a copy of … and so on forever?  Furthermore, who created this |ψ⟩ to give to Alice?  We don’t normally imagine that an “input state” contains a complete description of the body and brain of the person whose job it is to learn the output.</p>



<p>By contrast, a scenario that we <em>can</em> define without circularity is this: Alice is given (via physical qubits, a giant table of amplitudes, an obfuscated quantum circuit, or whatever) a pure quantum state |ψ⟩, which represents the CFT dual of a hypothetical universe containing a black hole.  Alice wants to learn what shockwaves or wormholes are inside the black hole, a problem plausibly conjectured not to have any ordinary polynomial-size quantum circuit that takes copies of |ψ⟩ as input.  To “solve” the problem, Alice sets into motion the following sequence of events:</p>



<ol><li>Alice scans and uploads her own brain into a quantum computer, presumably destroying the original meat brain in the process!  The QC represents Alice, who now exists only virtually, via a state |φ⟩.</li><li>The QC performs entangling operations on |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩, which correspond to inserting Alice into the bulk of the universe described by |ψ⟩, and then having her fall into the black hole.</li><li>Now in simulated form, “Alice” (or so we assume, depending on our philosophical position) has the subjective experience of falling into the black hole and observing what’s inside.  <em>Success!</em>  Given |ψ⟩ as input, we’ve now caused “Alice” (for some definition of “Alice”) to have observed the answer to the beyond-BQP computational problem.</li></ol>



<p>In the panel discussion, I now model Susskind as having proposed scenario 1-3, Witten as going along with 1-2 but rejecting 3 or not wanting to discuss it, and me as having made valid points about the computational complexity of simulating Alice’s experience in 1-3, yet while being radically mistaken about what the scenario <em>was</em> (I still thought an actual black hole was involved).</p>



<p>An obvious question is whether, having learned the answer, “Alice” can now get the answer back out to the “real, original” world.  Alas, the expectation is that this would require exponential time.  Why?  Because otherwise, this whole process would’ve constituted a subexponential-time algorithm for distinguishing random from pseudorandom states using an “ordinary” quantum computer!  Which is conjectured not to exist.</p>



<p>And what about Alice herself?  In polynomial time, could she return from “the Matrix,” back to a real-world biological body?  Sure she could, in principle—if, for example, the entire quantum computation were run in reverse.  But notice that reversing the computation would <em>also</em> make Alice forget the answer to the problem!  Which is not at all a coincidence: if the problem is outside BQP, then in general, Alice can know the answer <em>only</em> while she’s “inside the Matrix.”</p>



<p>Now that hopefully everything is crystal-clear and we’re all on the same page, what can we say about this scenario?  In particular: <em>should</em> it cause us to reject or modify the QECTT itself?</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>Daniel Gottesman, I thought, offered a brilliant reductio ad absurdum of the view that the simulated black hole scenario should count as a refutation of the QECTT.  Well, he didn’t <em>call</em> it a “reductio,” but I will.</p>



<p>For the reductio, let’s forget not only about quantum gravity but even about quantum mechanics itself, and go all the way back to classical computer science.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">fully homomorphic encryption scheme</a>, the <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf">first example</a> of which was discovered by Craig Gentry 15 years ago, lets you do arbitrary computations on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it.  It has both an encryption key, for encrypting the original plaintext data, and a separate decryption key, for decrypting the final answer.</p>



<p>Now suppose Alice has some homomorphically encrypted top-secret emails, which she’d like to read.  She has the encryption key (which is public), but not the decryption key.</p>



<p><em>If</em> the homomorphic encryption scheme is secure against quantum computers—as the schemes discovered by Gentry and later researchers currently appear to be—and <em>if</em> the QECTT is true, then Alice’s goal is obviously infeasible: decrypting the data will take her exponential time.</p>



<p>Now, however, a classical version of Lenny comes along, and explains to Alice that she simply needs to do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Upload her own brain state into a classical computer, destroying the “meat” version in the process (who needed it?).</li><li>Using the known encryption key, homomorphically encrypt a computer program that simulates (and thereby, we presume, <em>enacts</em>) Alice’s consciousness.</li><li>Using the homomorphically encrypted Alice-brain, <em>together with</em> the homomorphically encrypted input data, do the homomorphic computations that simulate the process of Alice’s brain reading the top-secret emails.</li></ol>



<p>The claim would now be that, <em>inside the homomorphic encryption</em>, the simulated Alice has the subjective experience of reading the emails in the clear.  Aha, therefore she “broke” the homomorphic encryption scheme!  Therefore, assuming that the scheme was secure even against quantum computers, the QECTT must be false!</p>



<p>According to Gottesman, this is almost perfectly analogous to Lenny’s black hole scenario.  In particular, they share the property that “encryption is easy but decryption is hard.”   Once she’s uploaded her brain, Alice can efficiently <em>enter</em> the homomorphically encrypted world to see the solution to a hard problem, just like she can efficiently <em>enter</em> the black hole world to do the same.  In both cases, however, getting <em>back</em> to her normal world with the answer would then take Alice exponential time.  Note that in the latter case, the difficulty is <em>not</em> so much about “escaping from a black hole,” as it is about inverting the AdS/CFT dictionary.</p>



<p>Going further, we can regard the AdS/CFT dictionary for regions behind event horizons as, itself, an <em>example</em> of a fully homomorphic encryption scheme—in this case, of course, one where the ciphertexts are quantum states.  This strikes me as potentially an important insight about AdS/CFT itself, even if that wasn’t Gottesman’s intention.  It complements many other recent connections between AdS/CFT and theoretical computer science, including the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7041">view of AdS/CFT as a quantum error-correcting code</a>, and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.00354">connection between AdS/CFT and the Max-Flow/Min-Cut Theorem</a> (see also my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/discretebulk.pdf">talk</a> about my work with Jason Pollack).</p>



<p>So where’s the reductio?  Well, when it’s put so starkly, I suspect that not many would regard Gottesman’s classical homomorphic encryption scenario as a “real” challenge to the QECTT.  Or rather, people might say: yes, this raises fascinating questions for the philosophy of mind, but at any rate, we’re no longer talking about <em>physics</em>.  Unlike with (say) quantum computing, no new <em>physical</em> phenomenon is being brought to light that lets an otherwise intractable computational problem be solved.  Instead, it’s all about the <em>user herself</em>, about Alice, and which physical systems get to count as instantiating her.</p>



<p>It’s like, imagine Alice at the computer store, weighing which laptop to buy.  Besides weight, battery life, and price, she definitely does care about processing power.  She might even consider a quantum computer, if one is available.  Maybe even a computer with a black hole, wormhole, or closed timelike curve inside: as long as it gives the answers she wants, what does she care about the innards?  But a computer whose normal functioning would (pessimistically) kill her or (optimistically) radically change her own nature, trapping her in a simulated universe that she can escape only by forgetting the computer’s output?  Yeah, I don’t envy the computer salesman.</p>



<p>Anyway, if we’re going to say this about the homomorphic encryption scenario, then shouldn’t we say the same about the simulated black hole scenario?  Again, from an “external” perspective, all that’s happening is a giant BQP computation.  Anything beyond BQP that we consider to be happening, depends on adopting the standpoint of an observer who “jumps into the homomorphic encryption on the CFT boundary”—at which point, it would seem, we’re no longer talking about physics but about philosophy of mind.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p>So, that was the story!  I promised you that it would integrally involve black holes, holography, the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, fully homomorphic encryption, <em>and</em> brain uploading, and I hope to have delivered on my promise.</p>



<p>Of course, while this blog post has forever cleared up all philosophical confusions about AdS/CFT and the Quantum Extended Church-Turing Thesis, many questions of a more technical nature remain.  For example: what about the original scenario?  <em>can</em> we argue that the experiences of bulk observers can be simulated in BQP, even when those observers jump into black holes?  Also, what can we say about the complexity class of problems to which the simulated Alice can learn the answers?  Could she even solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time this way, or at least invert one-way functions?  More broadly, what’s the power of “BQP with an oracle for applying the AdS/CFT dictionary”—once or multiple times, in one direction or both directions?</p>



<p>Lenny himself described his gedankenexperiment as exploring the power of a new complexity class that he called “JI/poly,” where the JI stands for “Jumping In” (to a black hole, that is).  The nomenclature is transparently ridiculous—“/poly” means “with polynomial-size advice,” which we’re <em>not</em> talking about here—and I’ve argued in this post that the “JI” is rather misleading as well.  If Alice is “jumping” anywhere, it’s not into a black hole <em>per se</em>, but into a quantum computer that simulates a CFT that’s dual to a bulk universe containing a black hole.</p>



<p>In a broader sense, though, to contemplate these questions at all is clearly to “jump in” to … <em>something</em>.  It’s old hat by now that one can start in physics and end up in philosophy: what else is the quantum measurement problem, or the Boltzmann brain problem, or anthropic cosmological puzzles like whether (all else equal) we’re a hundred times as likely to find ourselves in a universe with a hundred times as many observers?  More recently, it’s also become commonplace that one can start in physics and end in computational complexity theory: quantum computing itself is the example par excellence, but over the past decade, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4504">Harlow-Hayden argument</a> about decoding Hawking radiation and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07876">complexity = action proposal</a> have made clear that it can happen even in quantum gravity.</p>



<p>Lenny’s new gedankenexperiment, however, is the first case I’ve seen where you start out in physics, and end up embroiled in some of the hardest questions of philosophy of mind and computational complexity theory <em>simultaneously</em>.</p></div>
