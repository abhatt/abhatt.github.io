What is the actual cost of derandomization? And can we get it for free? These questions were recently raised by Doron et. al (FOCS 2020) and have been attracting considerable interest. In this work we extend the study of these questions to the setting of *derandomizing interactive proofs systems*. 

First, we show conditional derandomization of $\mathcal{MA}$ and of $\mathcal{AM}$ with *optimal runtime overhead*, where optimality is under the  $\#NSETH$ assumption. Specifically, denote by $\mathcal{AM}\mathcal{TIME}^{[\rightleftharpoons c]}[T]$ a protocol with $c$ turns of interaction in which the verifier runs in polynomial time $T$. We prove that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that:

1. $\mathcal{MATIME}[T]\subseteq \mathcal{NTIME}[T^{2+\epsilon}]$, and

2. $\mathcal{AM}\mathcal{TIME}^{[\rightleftharpoons c]}[T] \subseteq \mathcal{NTIME}[n\cdot T^{\lceil c/2 \rceil+\epsilon}]$,

where $(1)$ follows if there is a property $\Pi$ of Boolean functions that can be recognized from a $2^n$-length truth-table in $\mathcal{NTIME}[2^{(2+\epsilon/3)\cdot n}]$ such that functions with $\Pi$ are hard for $(\mathcal{N}\cap co\mathcal{N})\mathcal{TIME}[2^{(2-\delta)\cdot n}]/2^{(1-\delta)\cdot n}$; and $(2)$ follows if for every $k\ge1$ there is a $\Pi$ that can be recognized from a $2^n$-length truth-table in $\mathcal{NTIME}[2^{(k+\epsilon/3)\cdot n}]$ such that functions with $\Pi$ are hard for $\mathcal{MAMTIME}[2^{(1-\delta)\cdot k n}]/2^{(1-\delta)\cdot n}$.

To obtain faster derandomization, we introduce the notion of a *deterministic effective argument system*: This is a deterministic verifier $V$ such that correct claims $x\in L$ can be proved to $V$ (i.e., there is a proof $\pi$ such that $V(x,\pi)=1$), and for every probabilistic polynomial-time adversary $\tilde{P}$, the probability that $\tilde{P}$ finds an incorrect claim $x\notin L$ and a misleading proof $\pi$ such that $V(x,\pi)=1$ is negligible.

Under strong hardness assumptions, we prove that *any constant-round proof system can be compiled into a deterministic effective argument system, with essentially no time overhead*. As one corollary, under the foregoing hardness assumptions, for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there is a deterministic verifier $V$ that gets as input an $n$-bit formula of size $2^{o(n)}$, runs in time $2^{\epsilon \cdot n}$, and satisfies the following: For every formula $\Phi$ there is a proof $\pi$ such that $V(\Phi,\pi)$ prints the number of satisfying assignments for $\Phi$; and for every adversary $\tilde{P}$ running in time $2^{O(n)}$, the probability that $\tilde{P}$ finds $\Phi$ and $\pi$ such that $V(\Phi,\pi)$ prints an incorrect count is $2^{-\omega(n)}$.</div>

<p>(This is a joint post with David and Tomas Harris.)</p><p><br /></p><p>In my an earlier post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-seq-problems-was-solved.html">here</a>) I discussed the MATH behind a problem that I worked on, with David and Tomas Harris, that we later found out had already been solved. In this post we discuss HOW this happened. </p><p>Recall that Bill Gasarch read a column of Oliver Roeder (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-number-any-number/">here</a>) on Nate Silvers' blog where he challenged his readers to the following:</p><p>Find the longest sequence using numbers from {1,...,100} such that every number is either a factor or multiple of the previous number. (A later column (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-bathroom-occupied/">here</a> ) revealed the answer to be 77 via a computer search, which we note is not a human-readable proof.)</p><p>Bill wrote a blog post (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/09/a-problem-i-thought-was-interesting-now.html">here</a>) and an open problems column (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/nate.pdf">here</a> ) asking about the general case of {1,...,n}. Before doing this Bill DID try to check the literature to see what was known, but he didn't check very hard since this was not going to be a published paper. Also, he vaguely thought that if it was a known problem then one of his readers would tell him.</p><p>QUESTION: Is it appropriate to blog on things that you have not done a search of the literature on?</p><p>ANSWER: Yes, but you should SAY SO in the blog post.</p><p>As measured by comments, the post did not generate much interest- 10 comments. 2 were me (Gasarch) responding to comments.</p><p>David (who has a PhD from UMCP under Aravind Srinivasan) asked Bill to find a HS project for his son Tomas. Bill gave Tomas the sequence problem (as he called it) to look at- perhaps write a program to find what happens for {1,...,n} for small n, perhaps find human-readable proofs of weaker bound, for small n or for n=100.</p><p>David got interested in the MATH behind the problem so the project became three projects: Tomas would look at the programing aspects and the human-readable aspects, David would look at the Math, and Bill would...  hmmm, not clear what Bill would do, but he did write up a great deal of it and cleaned up some of the proofs.</p><p>David showed</p><p>Omega( n/( (log n)^{1.68} )  LE  L(n)  LE  O( n/( (log n)^{0.79} ). </p><p>Tomas and Bill obtained a human-readable proof that L(100) LE 83. (Comments on my blog sketched a proof that L(100) LE 83, and someone else that L(100) LE 80). See my previous post (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/04/the-roeder-seq-problems-was-solved.html">here</a>) for more on the known numbers for L. </p><p>At that point David did a brief literature search; however, he didn't know what to look for.</p><p>BILL still thought of this as a HS project so he didn't think much about a paper coming out of it, or if it was original. So he didn't do the due diligence of seeing what was already known.</p><p>David and Tomas were busy working on it, so they only did a few cursory checks of the literature.</p><div><div><br /></div><div>With the two results above,  we had a paper! David then looked much more carefully at the literature. He DID find some earlier papers -- he did a Google search for Roeder's puzzle, which mentioned another mathematician, who was quoted in a blog by another mathematician, who eventually mentioned Pomerance's old paper on the topic. Once he found a reference to an actual math paper it was easy to use Google Scholar to find forward/backward citations and find the current state of the art.</div><div><br /></div><div>His email had subject title</div><div><br /></div><div>                        SHUT IT ALL DOWN!!!</div><div><br /></div><div>Which made Bill think it involved a nuclear reactor undergoing The China Syndrome rather than just telling us that other people did had better and earlier results. </div><div><br /></div><div><p class="MsoNormal">In 1995 Gerald Tenenbaum showed, in a paper written in French,  that there exists a,b such that </p><p class="MsoNormal">                               n/(log n)^a LE L(n) LE n/(log n)^b (see <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/ASENS_1995_4_28_2_115_0/">here</a>). </p><p class="MsoNormal">More recently, in 2021, Saias showed, in a paper written in French, that </p><p class="MsoNormal">                                      L(n) GE (0.3 - o(1)) n/log n (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03855">here</a>). </p></div><div><br /></div><div>SO, why didn't Bill, David, Tomas find that it was already known until late in the process:</div><div><br /></div><div>1) They didn't know the right search term: <i>Divisor Graph</i></div><div><br /></div><div>2) The literature was in French so the right search term is <i>graphe divisoriel</i></div><div><br /></div><div>3) The transition from FUN HS PROJECT to SERIOUS MATH PAPER was somewhat abrupt and caught Bill by surprise.</div><div><br /></div><div>Was this a disappointment?</div><div><br /></div><div>1) We all learned some math from it, so that was nice.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) We were in a position to read and understand the paper since we knew all of the difficulties --- however, it was in French which I do not read. David reads some, Tomas does not read French.  I prefer to be scooped in English, but even then  I might not be able to read up on the problem since  math is... hard. When did math get so hard? see my blog on that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/07/when-did-math-get-so-hard.html">here</a>. When did CS theory get so hard? See my blog on that <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/11/when-did-computer-science-theory-get-so.html">here</a>.)</div><div><br /></div><div>Could this happen again?</div><div><br /></div><div>1) Yes. Language barriers are hard to overcome. Though this is rare nowadays--- not much serious mathematics seems to be done outside English. French mathematicians seem to like to keep their language alive, although they probably know English as well. There may be a few other countries (China, perhaps), where English language skills are not advanced and researchers are cut off from the English literature.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) Yes. I've heard of cases where many people discovered the same theorem but were unaware of each others results since they were in different fields.</div><div><br /></div><div>3) Is it easier or harder to reprove a theorem now then it was X years ago?</div><div><br /></div></div><div>We have better search tools, but we also have more to search. </div><div><br /></div></div>

a star-shaped polygon. It is based on minimizing discrete Dirichlet energies,
following the idea of Tutte's embedding theorem. We will call it a geodesic
triangulation of the star-shaped polygon. Moreover, we study the homotopy
property of spaces of all straight-line embeddings. We give a simple argument
to show that this space is contractible if the boundary is a non-convex
quadrilateral. We conjecture that the same statement holds for general
star-shaped polygons.

to machine learning. It requires the learner to solve a sequence of $k$
different learning tasks, one after the other, while retaining its aptitude for
earlier tasks; the continual learner should scale better than the obvious
solution of developing and maintaining a separate learner for each of the $k$
tasks. We embark on a complexity-theoretic study of continual learning in the
PAC framework. We make novel uses of communication complexity to establish that
any continual learner, even an improper one, needs memory that grows linearly
with $k$, strongly suggesting that the problem is intractable. When
logarithmically many passes over the learning tasks are allowed, we provide an
algorithm based on multiplicative weights update whose memory requirement
scales well; we also establish that improper learning is necessary for such
performance. We conjecture that these results may lead to new promising
approaches to continual learning.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Alman:Josh.html">Josh Alman</a>, <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/h/Hirsch:Dean.html">Dean Hirsch</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.10819">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We design the first efficient sensitivity oracles and dynamic algorithms for
a variety of parameterized problems. Our main approach is to modify the
algebraic coding technique from static parameterized algorithm design, which
had not previously been used in a dynamic context. We particularly build off of
the `extensor coding' method of Brand, Dell and Husfeldt [STOC'18], employing
properties of the exterior algebra over different fields.
</p>
<p>For the $k$-Path detection problem for directed graphs, it is known that no
efficient dynamic algorithm exists (under popular assumptions from fine-grained
complexity). We circumvent this by designing an efficient sensitivity oracle,
which preprocesses a directed graph on $n$ vertices in $2^k poly(k)
n^{\omega+o(1)}$ time, such that, given $\ell$ updates (mixing edge insertions
and deletions, and vertex deletions) to that input graph, it can decide in time
$\ell^2 2^kpoly(k)$ and with high probability, whether the updated graph
contains a path of length $k$. We also give a deterministic sensitivity oracle
requiring $4^k poly(k) n^{\omega+o(1)}$ preprocessing time and $\ell^2
2^{\omega k + o(k)}$ query time, and obtain a randomized sensitivity oracle for
the task of approximately counting the number of $k$-paths. For $k$-Path
detection in undirected graphs, we obtain a randomized sensitivity oracle with
$O(1.66^k n^3)$ preprocessing time and $O(\ell^3 1.66^k)$ query time, and a
better bound for undirected bipartite graphs.
</p>
<p>In addition, we present the first fully dynamic algorithms for a variety of
problems: $k$-Partial Cover, $m$-Set $k$-Packing, $t$-Dominating Set,
$d$-Dimensional $k$-Matching, and Exact $k$-Partial Cover. For example, for
$k$-Partial Cover we show a randomized dynamic algorithm with $2^k
poly(k)polylog(n)$ update time, and a deterministic dynamic algorithm with
$4^kpoly(k)polylog(n)$ update time.

The
problem can be seen as a generalization of the classic list update problem to
trees, and finds applications in reconfigurable datacenter networks. We are
given a fixed balanced binary tree T connecting n nodes V = {v_1, ... , v_n}. A
source node v_0, attached to the root of the tree, issues communication
requests to nodes in V, in an online and adversarial manner; the access cost of
a request to a node v, is given by the current depth of v in T. The online
algorithm can try to reduce the access cost by performing swap operations, with
which the position of a node is exchanged with the position of its parent in
the tree; a swap operation costs one unit. The objective is to design an online
algorithm which minimizes the total access cost plus adjustment cost
(swapping). Avin et al. recently presented Random-Push, a constant competitive
online algorithm for this problem, based on random walks, together with an
analysis exploiting the most recently used (MRU) property of random walks.
</p>
<p>We study analytically and empirically, online algorithms for this problem. In
particular, we explore how to derandomize Random-Push. We consider a simple
derandomized algorithm which we call Rotor-Push, as its behavior is reminiscent
of rotor walks. We first prove that Rotor-Push is constant competitive: its
competitive ratio is 12 and hence by a factor of five lower than the best
existing competitive ratio. In contrast to Random-Push, the algorithm does not
feature the MRU property, which requires a new analysis. We present a
significantly improved and simpler analysis for the randomized algorithm,
showing that it is 16-competitive. We compare empirically all self-adjusting
single-source tree networks, using synthetic and real data with varying
locality and observe that Rotor-Push and Random-Push have almost identical
performance.

graphs in the presence of transient edge failures. Henzinger et al. [ITCS 2017]
initiated the study of fault-tolerant (sensitivity) oracles for the diameter
and vertex eccentricities. We extend this with a special focus on space
efficiency. We present several new data structures, among them the first
fault-tolerant eccentricity oracle for dual failures in subcubic space. We
further prove lower bounds that show limits to approximation vs. space and
diameter vs. space trade-offs for fault-tolerant oracles. They highlight key
differences between data structures for undirected and directed graphs.
</p>
<p>Initially, our oracles are randomized leaning on a sampling technique
frequently used in sensitivity analysis. Building on the work of Alon, Chechik,
and Cohen [ICALP 2019] as well as Karthik and Parter [SODA 2021], we develop a
hierarchical framework to derandomize fault-tolerant data structures. We first
apply it to our own diameter and eccentricity oracles and then show its
versatility by derandomizing algorithms from the literature: the distance
sensitivity oracle of Ren [JCSS 2022] and the Single-Source Replacement Path
algorithm of Chechik and Magen [ICALP 2020]. This way, we obtain the first
deterministic distance sensitivity oracle with subcubic preprocessing time.

model; it is a restricted version of read-once quantum branching programs, with
respect to "width" complexity. It is known that the maximal gap between
deterministic and quantum complexities is exponential. But there are few
examples of functions with such a gap. We present a new technique
("reordering") for proving lower bounds and upper bounds for OBDD with an
arbitrary order of input variables if we have similar bounds for the natural
order. Using this transformation, we construct a total function $REQ$ such that
the deterministic $OBDD$ complexity of it is at least $2^{\Omega(n / \log n)}$,
and the quantum $OBDD$ complexity of it is at most $O(n^2/\log n)$. It is the
biggest known gap for explicit functions not representable by $OBDD$s of a
linear width. Another function(shifted equality function) allows us to obtain a
gap $2^{\Omega(n)}$ vs $O(n^2)$.
</p>
<p>Moreover, we prove the bounded error quantum and probabilistic $OBDD$ width
hierarchies for complexity classes of Boolean functions. Additionally, using
"reordering" method we extend a hierarchy for read-$k$-times Ordered Binary
Decision Diagrams ($k$-$OBDD$) of polynomial width, for $k = o(n / \log^3 n)$.
We prove a similar hierarchy for bounded error probabilistic $k$-$OBDD$s of
polynomial, superpolynomial and subexponential width.

input graph are feasible solutions. We view a feasible solution as a set of
tokens placed on the vertices of the graph. A reconfiguration variant of a
vertex-subset problem asks, given two feasible solutions of size $k$, whether
it is possible to transform one into the other by a sequence of token slides
(along edges of the graph) or token jumps (between arbitrary vertices of the
graph) such that each intermediate set remains a feasible solution of size $k$.
Many algorithmic questions present themselves in the form of reconfiguration
problems: Given the description of an initial system state and the description
of a target state, is it possible to transform the system from its initial
state into the target one while preserving certain properties of the system in
the process? Such questions have received a substantial amount of attention
under the so-called combinatorial reconfiguration framework. We consider
reconfiguration variants of three fundamental underlying graph vertex-subset
problems, namely Independent Set, Dominating Set, and Connected Dominating Set.
We survey both older and more recent work on the parameterized complexity of
all three problems when parameterized by the number of tokens $k$. The emphasis
will be on positive results and the most common techniques for the design of
fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.

in a graph without unintentionally removing its triangles. Consequently,
triangle finding problems do not become easy even in almost $k$-cycle free
graphs, for any constant $k\geq 4$.
</p>
<p>Triangle finding is at the base of many conditional lower bounds in P, mainly
for distance computation problems, and the existence of many $4$- or $5$-cycles
in a worst-case instance had been the obstacle towards resolving major open
questions.
</p>
<p>Hardness of approximation: Are there distance oracles with $m^{1+o(1)}$
preprocessing time and $m^{o(1)}$ query time that achieve a constant
approximation? Existing algorithms with such desirable time bounds only achieve
super-constant approximation factors, while only $3-\epsilon$ factors were
conditionally ruled out (P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu, Roditty, and Thorup; FOCS 2012). We
prove that no $O(1)$ approximations are possible, assuming the $3$-SUM or APSP
conjectures. In particular, we prove that $k$-approximations require
$\Omega(m^{1+1/ck})$ time, which is tight up to the constant $c$. The lower
bound holds even for the offline version where we are given the queries in
advance, and extends to other problems such as dynamic shortest paths.
</p>
<p>The $4$-Cycle problem: An infamous open question in fine-grained complexity
is to establish any surprising consequences from a subquadratic or even
linear-time algorithm for detecting a $4$-cycle in a graph. We prove that
$\Omega(m^{1.1194})$ time is needed for $k$-cycle detection for all $k\geq 4$,
unless we can detect a triangle in $\sqrt{n}$-degree graphs in
$O(n^{2-\delta})$ time; a breakthrough that is not known to follow even from
optimal matrix multiplication algorithms.

staying safely at home. While meeting others is pleasant, it also increases the
risk of infection. We consider this dilemma by introducing a game-theoretic
network creation model in which selfish agents can form bilateral connections.
They benefit from network neighbors, but at the same time, they want to
maximize their distance to all other agents. This models the inherent conflict
that social distancing rules impose on the behavior of selfish agents in a
social network. Besides addressing this familiar issue, our model can be seen
as the inverse to the well-studied Network Creation Game by Fabrikant et al.
[PODC 2003] where agents aim at being as central as possible in the created
network. Thus, our work is in-line with studies that compare minimization
problems with their maximization versions.
</p>
<p>We look at two variants of network creation governed by social distancing. In
the first variant, there are no restrictions on the connections being formed.
We characterize optimal and equilibrium networks, and we derive asymptotically
tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. The second variant
is the model's generalization that allows restrictions on the connections that
can be formed. As our main result, we prove that Swap-Maximal Routing-Cost
Spanning Trees, an efficiently computable weaker variant of Maximum
Routing-Cost Spanning Trees, actually resemble equilibria for a significant
range of the parameter space. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds on the
Price of Anarchy and Price of Stability. These results imply that, compared the
well-studied inverse models, under social distancing the agents' selfish
behavior has a significantly stronger impact on the quality of the equilibria,
i.e., allowing socially much worse stable states.

<p>There is a fundamental difference between form and meaning. Form is the physical structure of something, while meaning is the interpretation or concept that is attached to that form. For example, the form of a chair is its physical structure – four legs, a seat, and a back. The meaning of a chair is that it is something you can sit on.</p>



<p>This distinction is important when considering whether or not an AI system can be trained to learn semantic meaning. AI systems are capable of learning and understanding the form of data, but they are not able to attach meaning to that data. In other words, AI systems can learn to identify patterns, but they cannot understand the concepts behind those patterns.</p>



<p>For example, an AI system might be able to learn that a certain type of data is typically associated with the concept of “chair.” However, the AI system would not be able to understand what a chair is or why it is used. In this way, we can see that an AI system trained on form can never learn semantic meaning.</p>

<div class="content">
The classical coding theorem in Kolmogorov complexity states that if an $n$-bit string $x$ is sampled with probability $\delta$ by an algorithm with prefix-free domain then K$(x) \leq \log(1/\delta) + O(1)$. In a recent work, Lu and Oliveira [LO21] established an unconditional time-bounded version of this result, by showing that if $x$ can be efficiently sampled with probability $\delta$ then rKt$(x) = O(\log(1/\delta)) + O(\log n)$, where rKt denotes the randomized analogue of Levin's Kt complexity. Unfortunately, this result is often insufficient when transferring applications of the classical coding theorem to the time-bounded setting, as it  achieves a  $O(\log(1/\delta))$ bound instead of the information-theoretic optimal $\log(1/\delta)$.

Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate optimal coding theorems in the time-bounded setting. Our main contributions can be summarised as follows.

Efficient coding theorem for rKt with a factor of $2$. Addressing a question from [LO21], we show that if $x$ can be efficiently sampled with probability at least $\delta$ then rKt$(x) \le (2 + o(1)) \cdot \log(1/\delta) + O\!\left(\log n\right)$. As in previous work, our coding theorem is efficient in the sense that it provides a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm that, when given $x$, the code of the sampler, and $\delta$,  it outputs, with  probability $\ge 0.99$, a probabilistic representation of $x$ that certifies this rKt complexity bound.

Optimality under a cryptographic assumption. Under a hypothesis about the security of cryptographic pseudorandom generators, we show that no efficient coding theorem can achieve a bound of the form rKt$(x) \leq (2 - o(1)) \cdot \log(1/\delta) +$ poly$(\log n)$. Under a weaker assumption, we exhibit a gap between efficient coding theorems and existential coding theorems with near-optimal parameters.

Optimal coding theorem for pK$^t$ and unconditional Antunes-Fortnow. We consider pK$^t$ complexity [GKLO22], a variant of rKt where the randomness is public and the time bound is fixed. We observe the existence of an optimal coding theorem for pK$^t$, and employ this result to establish an unconditional version of a theorem of Antunes and Fortnow [AF09] which characterizes the worst-case running times of languages that are in average polynomial-time over all P-samplable distributions.</div>

We prove super-polynomial lower bounds on the size of propositional proof systems operating with constant-depth algebraic circuits over fields of zero characteristic. Specifically, we show that the subset-sum variant $\sum_{i,j,k,l\in[n]} z_{ijkl}x_ix_jx_kx_l-\beta = 0$, for Boolean variables, does not have polynomial-size IPS refutations where the refutations are multilinear and written as constant-depth circuits.

Andrews and Forbes (STOC’22) established recently a constant-depth IPS lower bound, but their hard instance does not have itself small constant-depth circuits, while our instance is computable already with small depth-2 circuits. 

Our argument relies on extending the recent breakthrough lower bounds against constant-depth algebraic circuits by Limaye, Srinivasan and Tavenas (FOCS’21) to the functional lower bound framework of Forbes, Shpilka, Tzameret and Wigderson (ToC’21), and may be of independent interest. Specifically, we construct a polynomial $f$ computable with small-size constant-depth circuits, such that the multilinear polynomial computing $1/f$ over Boolean values and its appropriate set-multilinear projection are hard for constant-depth circuits.</div>

Random $\Delta$-CNF formulas are one of the few candidates that are expected to be hard to refute in any proof system. One of the frontiers in the direction of proving lower bounds on these formulas is the $k$-DNF Resolution proof system (aka $\mathrm{Res}(k)$). Assume we sample $m$ clauses over $n$ variables. There are two known lower bounds.
1. Segerlind, Buss, Impagliazzo showed an exponential lower bound for any constant $k$, $\Delta = \mathcal{O}(k^2)$ in case $m = \mathcal{O}(n^{7 / 6})$.
2. Alekhnovich showed lower bound for $k = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}})$, any $\Delta \ge 3$ in case $m = \mathcal{O}(n)$.


Both of these papers used the same technique: the so-called small restriction switching lemma. However, they used different properties of the dependency graph of the random formula. In this paper we present a new technique with the same flavour though based on a different complexity measure that we call closure covering. We use only the expansion of the dependency graph of the formula. This technique allows us to unify and improve both of these bounds simultaneously. In particular, as a corollary we show:
1) an exponential lower bound for any constant $k$, $\Delta = \mathcal{O}(1)$ in case $m = \mathrm{poly}(n)$;
2) an exponential lower bound for $k = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log n})$, $\Delta = \mathcal{O}(1)$ in case $m = \mathcal{O}(n)$.

It is the first lower bound that works for clause density $\frac{m}{n} &gt; n^{1 / 6}$ (density can even be superpolynomial for random $\log n$-CNF).</div>

We investigate the complexity of languages that correspond to algebraic real numbers, and we present improved upper bounds on the complexity of these languages.  Our key technical contribution is the presentation of improved uniform TC^0 circuits
for division, matrix powering, and related problems, where the improvement is in terms of "majority depth" (initially studied by Maciel and Therien). As a corollary, we obtain improved bounds on the complexity of certain problems involving arithmetic circuits, which are known to lie in the counting hierarchy, and we answer a question posed by Yap.</div>

<p>Thanks to everyone who asked whether I’m OK!  Yeah, I’ve been living, loving, learning, teaching, worrying, procrastinating, just not blogging.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Last week, Takashi Yamakawa and Mark Zhandry posted a preprint to the arXiv, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02063">“Verifiable Quantum Advantage without Structure,”</a> that represents some of the most exciting progress in quantum complexity theory in years.  I wish I’d thought of it.  tl;dr they show that relative to a random oracle (!), there’s an NP search problem that quantum computers can solve exponentially faster than classical ones.  And yet this is 100% consistent with the Aaronson-Ambainis Conjecture!</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>A student brought my attention to <a href="https://deduckproject.github.io/quantle/">Quantle</a>, a variant of Wordle where you need to guess a true equation involving 1-qubit quantum states and unitary transformations.  It’s really well-done!  Possibly the best quantum game I’ve seen.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-has-demonstrated-the-underlying-physics-required-to-create-a-new-kind-of-qubit/">announced on the web</a> that it had achieved an experimental breakthrough in topological quantum computing: not <em>quite</em> the creation of a topological qubit, but some of the underlying physics required for that.  This followed their needing to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00612-z">retract</a> their previous claim of such a breakthrough, due to the criticisms of Sergey Frolov and others.  One imagines that they would’ve taken far greater care this time around.  Unfortunately, a research paper doesn’t seem to be available yet.  Anyone with further details is welcome to chime in.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>Woohoo!  Maximum flow, maximum bipartite matching, matrix scaling, and isotonic regression on posets (among many others)—all algorithmic problems that I was familiar with way back in the 1990s—are now solvable in nearly-linear time, thanks to a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00671">breakthrough by Chen et al.</a>!  Many undergraduate algorithms courses will need to be updated.</p>

<font color="#000000"></font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/db/" rel="attachment wp-att-19928"><img width="220" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/db.jpg?resize=220%2C165&amp;ssl=1" class="alignright wp-image-19928" height="165" /></a></p>
<p>
Dietrich Braess is a professor of mathematics at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany.  He is famous for the discovery of a paradox. When he was doing research on traffic modeling in 1968, he discovered that the flow in a road network could be <i>hindered</i> by <i>adding</i> a new road.</p>
<p>
Today we note a connection between him and the new ACM Athena Award winner, Éva Tardos, whom we congratulate.</p>
<p>
The paradox has a paradox riding on it.  The original is about the game theory of elective actions by drivers individually trying to optimize their routes. Yet it shows up in purely physical dynamics.  Consider the following <a href="http://www.davros.org/science/roadparadox.html">network</a> of springs and strings:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/par/" rel="attachment wp-att-19929"><img width="100" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/par.png?resize=100%2C192&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19929" height="192" /></a></p>
<p>
Quoting Clive Feathers, who <a href="http://www.davros.org/">studies</a> Britain’s railways and the London Underground:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If all the strings are taut, then each of them will be carrying one-third of the weight of the block. So if the purple string is cut, the remaining strings will carry more of the weight and the block will drop down a bit as the springs take up the load, right?</em></p><em>
<p>
Wrong!</p>
</em><p><em>
As shown, each string has a tension of 4N, so the springs will each be under a tension of 8N and will stretch accordingly. Now, when the purple string is cut the remaining strings have a tension of 6N, and so does each spring. So there is less tension in the springs, and they will contract accordingly, making the block rise. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Braess Paradox </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Who cares about springs and strings? Indeed. </p>
<p>
The point is that this paradox arises in problems we study in CS. It is named now as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess's_paradox">Braess’s Paradox</a>. Springs and strings can be changed to edges. Edges in turn relate to networks of many kinds; the following figure comes from a <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/aad490">paper</a> on power grids:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/smile/" rel="attachment wp-att-19931"><img width="500" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/smile.jpg?resize=500%2C282&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19931" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>
The original paradox is that adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down overall traffic flow through it. The new road initially makes its use locally optimal for everyone until a saturation point <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> is reached. The limit on choices before and after using the new road, however, also makes the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> usage increase the cost of the previously optimal strategies. This evolves a worse configuration for everyone that is not locally improvable. </p>
<p>
The flip side is that a clog-prone network can sometimes be improved by removing certain parts of it. This paradox has been used to explain instances of improved traffic flow when existing major roads are closed. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws12/ct/Braess-paradox.pdf">In Stuttgart, Germany</a> after investments into the road network in 1969, the traffic situation did not improve until a section of newly-built road was closed for traffic again.<p></p>
<p></p></li><li>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/25/health/what-if-they-closed-42d-street-and-nobody-noticed.html">ON Earth Day</a> this year (1990), New York City’s Transportation Commissioner decided to close 42d Street, which as every New Yorker knows is always congested. “Many predicted it would be doomsday,” said the Commissioner, Lucius J. Riccio. “You didn’t need to be a rocket scientist or have a sophisticated computer queuing model to see that this could have been a major problem.”<p></p>
<p>
But to everyone’s surprise, Earth Day generated no historic traffic jam. Traffic flow actually improved when 42d Street was closed.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Today’s News and the Paradox </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This started as a post on Éva Tardos, who is a professor at Cornell University. She just was named the 2022-2023 ACM <a href="https://awards.acm.org/athena">Athena Lecturer</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> This award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to Computer Science. Each year ACM honors a preeminent woman computer scientist as the Athena Lecturer. The recipient gives an invited talk at a major ACM conference of her choice. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
What is the connection between Tardos as Athena Lecturer and the Braess Paradox? Indeed, the citation notes her contributions to algorithmic game theory. These are game-theory situations in her purview.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/04/22/a-paradox/et-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-19933"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/et.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19933" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>
She has many papers that bound approximations to optimal solutions. Often the answers are likely to be hard to solve exactly—they are NP-complete for example. But she has some wonderful papers that study questions where paradoxes apply regardless of whether <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3D+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P = NP}}" class="latex" /> is true.</p>
<p>
One is the <a href="http://www.timroughgarden.org/papers/mcbp.pdf">paper</a> by Henry Lin, Tim Roughgarden, Eva Tardos, and Asher Walkover, and is titled, “Stronger Bounds On Braess’s Paradox And The Maximum Latency Of Selfish Routing.” It addresses the flip-side paradox: how much can the performance of a network be improved by removing one edge? One might expect that removing an edge might be less likely to improve the smallest networks, as well as less impactful on larger networks, so that the highest improvement would come in some mid-size example. In fact, they show that Braess’s original example of four nodes and five edges has the highest improvement. </p>
<p>
They also show that the problem of finding the maximum improvement possible within a sub-network of a large network is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-hard to approximate, even sub-exponentially. We wonder how this connects to an earlier <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~fan/wp/braess_rsa.pdf">paper</a> by Fan Chung, Stephen Young, and Wenbo Zhao showing that expander graphs tend to have many subgraphs exhibiting the Braess paradox. This is surprising because expanders by-and-large promote free network flows.</p>
<p></p><p>
We add that Tardos is just the third Athena Lecturer from the theory area since the first award in 2006: Shafi Goldwasser in 2008 and Nancy Lynch in 2012. Congrats, Éva. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I did not know about the Braess Paradox before reading about her award; Ken thinks he saw it a decade or so ago. Previously my favorite result of Tardos was in the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eva/Gap.Between.Monotone.NonMonotone.Circuit.Complexity.is.Exponential.pdf">paper</a>, “The Gap Between Monotone And Non-Monotone Circuit Complexity Is Exponential.” Now not so clear.</p>
<p>
What is your favorite of her results?</p>

“Missingness”, or the absence of features from an input, is a concept that is fundamental to many model debugging tools. In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">latest paper</a>, we examine the challenges of implementing missingness in computer vision. In particular, we demonstrate how current approximations of missingness introduce biases into the debugging process of computer vision models. We then show how a natural implementation of missingness based on VITs can mitigate these biases and lead to more reliable model debugging.
</i></p>

<p>Deep learning models can learn powerful features. However, these learned features can be unintuitive or spurious. Indeed, recent studies have pointed out that ML models often leverage unexpected—and, in fact, undesirable—associations. These include image pathology detection models that rely on <a href="https://cerre.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ai_explainability_whitepaper_google.pdf">pen marks made by radiologist</a> and image classifiers that focus too much on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09994">backgrounds</a> or on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12231">texture</a>. Such prediction mechanisms can cause models to fail in downstream tasks or new environments.</p>

<p>How can we detect model failures caused by relying on such brittle or undesirable associations? Answering this question is a major goal of model debugging. Work in this context brought forth techniques that allow, for example, surfacing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05796">human aligned</a> <a href="https://gradientscience.org/glm_saga/">concepts</a>, <a href="https://gradientscience.org/3db/">probing specific types of bias a model uses</a>, or highlighting features that were <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07451">important for a</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">specific prediction</a>.</p>

<p>A common theme in many of these debugging methods is to study model behavior on so-called counterfactual inputs, i.e., inputs with and without specific features. For example, consider the image of a dog being held by its owner below. By removing the owner from the image, we can study how much our model’s prediction depends on the presence of a human. In a similar vein, we can remove parts of the dog (head, body, paws) to identify which ones among them are most critical for correctly classifying the image. This concept of “the absence of a feature” from the input is sometimes referred to as <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/">missingness</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/woman_dog_example.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Woman-Dog Example" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
        By removing parts of the image, we can study how much our model depends on a given input feature (such as the human, or the dog's snout).  
</div>

<p>Indeed, this primitive of missingness is used quite a lot in model debugging techniques. For example, widely-used methods such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365">integrated gradients</a> leverage it. It also has been applied to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07623">radiology images</a> to understand the regions of the scan that are important for diagnoses, or to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04301">flag spurious correlations</a>. Finally, in natural language processing, model designers often remove words <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12487">to understand their impact on the output</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/main_lime.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Example of LIME" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
LIME, a popular model debugging method, relies on the  missingness primitive to generate model explanations. The method first generates a set of ablations by randomly removing parts of the image. These ablations are then used to generate a model explanation, typically obtained by fitting a sparse linear model to them. 
</div>

<h2 id="challenges-of-implementing-missingness-in-computer-vision">Challenges of implementing missingness in computer vision</h2>

<p>Missingness is a rather intuitive notion: we simply would like the model to predict as if the corresponding part of the input didn’t exist. Also, in a domain such as NLP implementing this primitive is fairly straightforward: we simply drop the corresponding words from the sentence. However, in the context of computer vision, its proper implementation turns out to be much more challenging. This is because images are spatially contiguous objects: it is unclear how to leave a “hole” in the image.</p>

<p>Researchers thus have come up with all kinds of ways to “fill” such hole, i.e., approximating missingness by replacing the region with other pixels. This involves <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.01365.pdf">blacking out the pixels</a>, replacing them with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03825.pdf">random noise</a>, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03296.pdf">blurring the corresponding image region</a>. However, these approaches, even though very natural, turn out to have unintended effects. For example, researchers found that <a href="https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/">saliency maps generated with integrated gradients are quite sensitive to the chosen baseline color of the filling</a>, and thus can change significantly based on the (arbitrary) choice of that missingness approximation.</p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/various_approx_original.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Woman-Dog Example" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
    Practitioners often approximate missingness in computer vision by replacing the removed region with other types of pixels. Examples include blacking out, using the mean pixel color, filling with random noise, or blurring the image.
</div>



<h2 id="missingness-approximations-can-create-bias">Missingness approximations can create bias</h2>

<p>So, what impact do such missingness approximations actually have on the resulting model predictions? In our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">recent work</a>, we systematically investigate the bias that these approximations can imbue. Specifically, <i>we find that models end up using masked out regions to make predictions rather than simply ignoring them.</i></p>

<p>For example, take a look below at the image of a spider from ImageNet, where we have removed various regions from the image by blacking out the corresponding pixels.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="bias_examples_widget"></div>
<div class="footnote">
    Various regions of an image are removed by blacking out pixels. Regardless of what regions from the image are masked, a ResNet-50 outputs a wrong class. 
</div>

<p>It turns out that irrespective of what subregions of the image are removed, a standard CNN (e.g., ResNet-50) outputs incorrect classes, even when most of the foreground object is not obscured. In fact, taking a closer look at the randomly masked images, we find that the model seems to be relying on the masking pattern itself to make the prediction (e.g., predicting class “crossword”).</p>

<p>To analyze this bias more quantitatively, we measure how missingness approximations impact the output class distribution of a Resnet-50 classifier (over the whole dataset).  Specifically, we iteratively black out parts of ImageNet images, and keep track of how the probability of predicting any one class changes. Before blacking out any pixels, the model predicts a roughly equal number of each class on the ImageNet test set (which is what one would expect given that this test set is class balanced). However, when we apply missingness approximations, this distribution skews heavily toward classes such as maze, crossword puzzle, and carton.</p>

<div id="anno"> 
    <canvas width="30%" id="resnet_bar_chart" height="15%"></canvas>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
    We measure the shift in output class distribution after applying a (blacking out) missingness approximations. As patches are increasingly blacked out, the ResNet-50 classifier's predictions skew from a uniform distribution toward a few specific classes such as maze, crossword puzzle, and carton.
</div>

<p>Our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">paper</a> investigates this missingness bias in more depth by exploring different approximations, datasets, mask sizes, etc.</p>

<h2 id="missingness-bias-in-model-debugging-a-case-study-on-lime">Missingness bias in model debugging: A case study on LIME</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, missingness primitive is often used by model debugging techniques—how does the above-mentioned bias impact them? To answer this question, we focus on a popular feature attribution method: local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938">LIME</a>.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="lime_examples_widget"></div>
<div class="footnote">
    Examples of generated LIME explanations represented as a heat map. High-intensity regions contribute more to the prediction of the model than low-intensity ones. On the right, the top 20 image regions identified by the LIME explanation are masked in black.
</div>

<p>The image above depicts an example LIME explanation generated for a ResNet-50 classifier. Specifically, for a given image, LIME generates a heatmap highlighting the regions of the image based on how much they impact prediction (according to LIME). While sometimes LIME highlights the foreground object (which is what one would expect), in most cases it also highlights rather irrelevant regions scattered all over the image. Why is this the case?</p>

<p>Although we can’t say for sure, we suspect that this behavior is caused in large part by the fact that the underlying ResNet-50 classifier relies on masked regions in the image to make predictions, and this tricks it into believing that these regions are important. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">our paper</a>, we perform a more detailed quantitative analysis of the missingness bias in LIME explanations, and find that it indeed makes them more inconsistent and, during evaluation, indistinguishable from random explanations.</p>

<h2 id="a-more-natural-implementation-of-missingness">A more natural implementation of missingness</h2>
<p>What is the right way to represent missing pixels then? Ideally, since replacing pixels with other pixels can lead to missingness bias, we would like to be able to remove these regions altogether. But what about the need of having the images be represented by contiguous inputs?</p>

<p>Certainly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require such spatial contiguity because convolutions slide filters across the image. But do we even need to use CNNs? Not really!</p>

<p>How about we turn to a different architecture:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">vision transformers</a> (ViTs)? Unlike CNNs, ViTs do not use convolutions and operate instead on sets of patches that correspond to positionally encoded regions of the image. Specifically, a ViT has two stages when processing an input image:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Tokenization</strong>: split the image into square patches, and positionally encode these patches into tokens.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-attention</strong>: pass the set of tokens through several self-attention layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>After tokenization, the self-attention layers operate on the set of tokens rather than the entire image. Thus, ViTs enables a far more natural implementation of missingness: <i>we can simply drop the tokens that encode the region we want to remove!</i></p>

<p><img src="https://gradientscience.org/assets/missingness/vit_dropping.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Woman-Dog Example" /></p>
<div class="footnote">
    ViTs split the image into a set of tokens, where each token represents a patch in the image. In order to implement missingness, we can simply drop the tokens corresponding to the regions we would like to remove.
</div>

<h2 id="mitigating-missingness-bias-through-vits">Mitigating missingness bias through ViTs</h2>

<p>As we now demonstrate,  using this more natural implementation of missingness turns out to substantially mitigate the missingness bias that we saw earlier. Indeed, recall that, with a ResNet-50, blacking out pixels biased the model toward specific classes (such as crossword). But, a similarly sized ViT-small (ViT-S) architecture is able to side-step this bias (when we implement token dropping), maintaining a correct (or at least related) prediction.</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="bias_examples_widget2"></div>
<div class="footnote">
   When we remove image regions by dropping tokens with a ViT-S classifier, the model maintains its original prediction or, at least, predicts a related class.
</div>

<p>This difference is even more striking when we examine the output class distribution corresponding to removal of image regions: while for our ResNet-50 classifier we have seen this distribution being skewed toward certain classes, for the ViT classifier, this distribution remains close to uniform.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="improving-model-debugging-with-vits">Improving model debugging with ViTs</h2>

<p>So, we have seen that ViTs allow us to mitigate missingness bias. Can we thus use ViTs to improve model debugging too? We return to our case study of LIME. As we demonstrated earlier, LIME relies on a notion of missingness, and is thus vulnerable to missingness bias when using approximations like blacking out pixels. What happens when we use ViTs and token dropping instead?</p>

<div style="overflow: auto; text-align: center;" id="lime_examples_widget2"></div>
<div class="footnote">
Examples of generated LIME explanations for a ResNet (blacking out pixels) and a ViT (dropping tokens). 
</div>

<p>The figure above displays examples of the LIME explanations generated for a ResNet classifier and for a ViT classifier (dropping tokens). Qualitatively, one can see that the explanations for the ViT seem more aligned with human intuition, highlighting the main object instead of regions in the background. We confirm these observations with a more quantitative analysis in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08945">our paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we studied how missingness approximations can lead to biases and, in turn, impact the model debugging techniques that leverage them. We also demonstrated how transformer-based architectures can enable a seamless implementation of missingness that allows us to side-step missingness bias and lead to more reliable model debugging.</p></div>

Given i.i.d. samples from an unknown distribution over a large domain $[N]$, approximating several basic quantities, including the distribution's support size, its entropy, and its distance from the uniform distribution, requires $\Theta(N / \log N)$ samples [Valiant and Valiant, STOC 2011].

Suppose, however, that we can interact with a powerful but untrusted prover, who knows the entire distribution (or a good approximation of it). Can we use such a prover to approximate (or rather, to approximately {\em verify}) such statistical quantities more efficiently? We show that this is indeed the case: the support size, the entropy, and the distance from the uniform distribution, can all be approximately verified via a 2-message interactive proof, where the communication complexity, the verifier's running time, and the sample complexity are $\widetilde{O}({\sqrt{N}})$. For all these quantities, the sample complexity is tight up to $\polylog N$ factors (for any interactive proof, regardless of its communication complexity or verification time).

More generally, we give a tolerant interactive proof system with the above sample and communication complexities for verifying a distribution's proximity to any label-invariant property (any property that is invariant to re-labeling of the elements in the distribution's support). The verifier's running time in this more general protocol is also $\widetilde{O}({\sqrt{N}})$, under a mild assumption about the complexity of deciding, given a compact representation of a distribution, whether it is in the property or far from it.</div>

We study the problem of testing whether a function $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of degree at most $d$ in the distribution-free testing model. Here, the distance between functions is measured with respect to an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ from which we can draw samples. In contrast to previous work, we do not assume that $\mathcal{D}$ has finite support. 
    
We design a tester that given query access to $f$, and sample access to $\mathcal{D}$, makes $(d/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}$ many queries to $f$, accepts with probability $1$ if $f$ is a polynomial of degree $d$, and rejects with probability at least $2/3$ if every degree-$d$ polynomial $P$ disagrees with $f$ on a set of mass at least $\varepsilon$ with respect to $\mathcal{D}$. Our result also holds under mild assumptions when we receive only a polynomial number of bits of precision for each query to $f$, or when $f$ can only be queried on rational points representable using a logarithmic number of bits. Along the way, we prove a new stability theorem for multivariate polynomials that may be of independent interest.</div>

<p>Recently a grad student in CS at UMCP emailed me the following email he got,  thinking (correctly) that I should forward it to interested ugrads. </p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Are you interested in theoretical computer science including topics like algorithms, cryptography, machine learning, and others? If so, please consider applying to the New Horizons in Theoretical Computer Science week-long online summer school! The school will contain several mini-courses from top researchers in the field. The course is free of charge,and we welcome applications from undergraduates majoring in computer science or related fields. We particularly encourage applications from students that are members of groups that are currently under-represented in theoretical computer science.</p><p>Students from previous years have shared with us that the mini-lectures, online group activities, and interactions with other students and the friendly TAs were extraordinarily engaging and fun.</p><p>For full consideration, please complete the application (it’s short and easy!) by April 25, 2022. The summer school will take place online from June 6 to June 10.</p><p>Please see our website for details: see <a href="https://tcs-summerschool.ttic.edu/">here</a> </p><p>Any questions can be directed to summer-school-admin-2022@ttic.edu.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A few points about this</p><p>1) I emailed them asking `why do people need to apply if its online and free?'</p><p>I had one answer in mind, but they gave me another one</p><p><i>Their Answer: </i>They want to have SMALL online activities in groups. If they had X students and want groups of size g then if X is large, X/g may be too large. </p><p><i>My Answer</i>: If people REGISTER for something they are more likely to actually show up. (I know of a conference that got MORE people going once they had registation, and even MORE when they began charging for it.) </p><p>2) I emailed them asking if the talks will, at some later point, be on line. They will be. I then realized that there are already LOTS of theory talks online that I have not gotten around to watching, and perhaps never will. Even so, the talks on line may well benefit people who goto the summer school if they want to look back and something. </p><p>3) Online conferences PROS and CONS:</p><p>PROS: Free (or very low cost), no hassle getting airfare and hotel, and if talks are recorded then you can see them later (that applies to in-person as well). </p><p>CONS: Less committed to going to it. Can go in a half-ass way. For example, you can go and then in the middle of a talk go do your laundry. Being FORCED to be in a ROOM with the SPEAKER may be good. Also, of course, no informal conversations in the hallways.  Also, less serendipity. </p><p>I want to say <i>It would to be good to see talks outside of my area </i>however, this may only be true for easy talks, perhaps talks in a new field, OR talks that are just barely outside my area so I have some context. </p><p>4) I was surprised I didn't get the email directly since I have more contact with ugrads (and I have this blog) then the grad student who alerted me to it. However, I have learned that information gets to people in random ways so perhaps not to surprising. </p></div>

Given a Boolean circuit $C$, we wish to convert it to a circuit $C'$ that computes the same function as $C$ even if some of its gates suffer from adversarial short circuit errors, i.e., their output is replaced by the value of one of their inputs [KLM97]. Can we design such a resilient circuit $C'$ whose size is roughly comparable to that of $C$? Prior work [KLR12, BEGY19] gave a positive answer for the special case where $C$ is a formula.

We study the general case and show that any Boolean circuit $C$ of size $s$ can be converted to a new circuit $C'$ of quasi-polynomial size $s^{O(\log s)}$ that computes the same function as $C$ even if a $1/51$ fraction of the gates on any root-to-leaf path in $C'$ are short circuited. Moreover, if the original circuit $C$ is a formula, the resilient circuit $C'$ is of near-linear size $s^{1+\epsilon}$. The construction of our resilient circuits utilizes the connection between circuits and DAG-like communication protocols} [Raz95, Pud10, Sok17], originally introduced in the context of proof complexity.</div>

<p>The next <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Foundations of Data Science</a> virtual talk of this year will take place on <strong>Wednesday, March 20th</strong> at <strong>12:00 PM Pacific Time</strong> (15:00 Eastern Time, 21:00 Central European Time, 19:00 UTC). <a href="http://www.gpeyre.com/">Gabriel Peyré</a> from<strong> CNRS and Ecole Normale Supérieure</strong> will speak about “Scaling Optimal Transport for High dimensional Learning.<em>”</em></p>



<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Please register here to join the virtual talk.</a></p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Optimal transport (OT) has recently gained lot of interest in machine learning. It is a natural tool to compare in a geometrically faithful way probability distributions. It finds applications in both supervised learning (using geometric loss functions) and unsupervised learning (to perform generative model fitting). OT is however plagued by the curse of dimensionality, since it might require a number of samples which grows exponentially with the dimension. In this talk, I will explain how to leverage entropic regularization methods to define computationally efficient loss functions, approximating OT with a better sample complexity. More information and references can be found on <a href="https://optimaltransport.github.io/">the website of our book</a> “Computational Optimal Transport.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: We give the first almost-linear time algorithm for computing exact maximum flows and minimum-cost flows on directed graphs. By well-known reductions, this implies almost-linear time algorithms for several problems including bipartite matching, optimal transport, and undirected vertex connectivity.</p>
<p>Our algorithm uses a new Interior Point Method (IPM) that builds the optimal flow as a sequence of an almost-linear number of approximate undirected minimum-ratio cycles, each of which is computed and processed very efficiently using a new dynamic data structure.</p>
<p>Our framework extends to give an almost-linear time algorithm for computing flows that minimize general edge-separable convex functions to high accuracy. This gives the first almost-linear time algorithm for several problems including entropy-regularized optimal transport, matrix scaling, p-norm flows, and Isotonic regression.</p>

<p>  (Joint Post by Bill Gasarch, David Harris, and Tomas
Harris) </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The divisor graph D(n) is an undirected graph with</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">vertex set V={1,...,n}$ and</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">edge set E={(a,b) :  a  divides  b 
or  b  divides  a }</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We denote the length of the longest simple path in D(n) by
L(n).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">EXAMPLE: if n=10 then one long-ish sequence is</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1,8,4,2,6,3,9</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">so L(10) GE 7. I leave it to the reader to do better OR to
show its optimal. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2017 Oliver Roeder asked for L(100) (see <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-number-any-number/">here</a>)
In a later post Roeder reported that Anders Kaseorg claimed L(100)=77
(see  <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-this-bathroom-occupied/">here</a>).
Anders gave a sequence and claimed that, by a computer search, this was
optimal. The column also claims that other people also claimed 77 and nobody
got a sequence of length 78, so the answer probably is 77 (it is now known that
it IS 77).  Roeder also mentions the case of n=1000 for which Kaseorg
showed L(1000) GE 418. No nontrivial lower bounds are known. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 2019 I (Gasarch) asked about asymptotic results for
L(n)  (see my blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/09/a-problem-i-thought-was-interesting-now.html">here</a> and
my open problems column <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/open/nate.pdf">here</a>.)
I began working on it with David and Tomas Harris. David proved that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Omega( n/( (log n)^{1.68} )  LE  L(n) 
LE  O( n/( (log n)^{0.79} ).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We also studied human-readable proofs that L(100) LE X for
some reasonable X, though getting a human-readable proof for X=77 seemed
impossible. We did get L(100) LE 83, in a human-readable proof. (Some
commenters on my post to sketched a proof  that L(100) LE 83 and another
that L(100) LE 80 as well.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> But it turned out that this problem had already been
studied, predating Roeder's column. (This blog post is all about the math, bout
the math, no treble.  My next post will be about how we didn't know the
literature until our paper was close to being finished.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1982 Pomerance showed L(n)  LE o(n) (see <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~carlp/divisorgraph.pdf">here</a>).
Pollington had earlier shown </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
                     
    L(n) GE ne^{polylog(n)};</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">however, the paper is not online and hence is lost to
history forever. (If you can find an online copy please email me the pointer
and I will edit this post.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In 1995 Gerald Tenenbaum showed, in a paper written in
French,  that there exists a,b such that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
               n/(log n)^a LE L(n) LE
n/(log n)^b (see <a href="http://www.numdam.org/item/ASENS_1995_4_28_2_115_0/">here</a>). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">More recently, in 2021, Saias showed, in a paper written in
French, that </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">               
                     
L(n) GE (0.3 - o(1)) n/log n (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03855">here</a>). </p><p class="MsoNormal">(ADDED LATER:  I got a very angry email telling me that the paper was in English and that I am a moron. It turns out that the abstract is in English but the paper is in French, hence the person who send the letter only read the abstract which explains their mistake.) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He conjectures that L(n)  SIM cn/log n where c is
likely in the interval [3,7]. (Apparently, no other information is known about
the relevant constant factors in the estimates.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Interestingly, the work of Tenenbaum and Saias also
demonstrates why the study of L(n)  is not an idle problem in recreational
mathematics. The upper bounds come from results on certain density conditions
for prime factorization of random integers. That is, given an integer x chosen
uniformly at random from the range {1,..., n} with prime factorization p1 GE p2
GE ... one wants to show that, with high probability, the primes pi are close
to each other in a certain sense. Most recent results on L(n) have been tied
closely with improved asymptotic estimates for deep number theory problems.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Determining the value of L(100) (i.e., Roeder's problem) was
mentioned in Saias's paper. He claims that L(100) = 77 was discovered by Arnaud
Chadozeau, who himself has written a number of papers on other properties of
D(n). Since this paper was in 2021 it was after Roeder's column; however, we
believe that the different discoveries of L(100) are independent. The recent
work around Roeder's column appears to be done independently from the extensive
French-language literature on the topic.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following problems are  likely still open:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a) Find L(n) exactly for as many n as you can.  This
would clearly need a computer program.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A listing of L(n) for n = 1 ... 200, computed by Rob Pratt
and Nathan McNew,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">appears as OEIS #A337125. This also includes additional
references.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">b) Find human-readable proofs for upper bounds on L(n)
(likely not exact) for as many</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">n as you can.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">  </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">ADDED LATER: Gaétan Berthe emailed me </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm the author of the last comment on your article about
Roeder Sequence , as your curious about the subject I can share what we've done
with my friend Paul Revenant those last few years for fun.</p><p class="MsoNormal">
<br />
It all started with a competition between our classmates (see <a href="https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/gaetan.berthe/challenge.php">here</a> though note that its in French) for the 100 and 1000 cases, after a few months Paul using a MIP solver gurobi
was able to found a solution of size 666, and last year by studying the
structure of the 666 solution we were able, with the help of gurobi again, to
prove that there was no 667 solution either.<br />
<br />
Paul then achieve to find very probable value of the sequence for 1 to 1000 (we
didn't automatize the proof of 666 but it should be doable). On my side I tried
to look for good solutions for the 10000 case, again using gurobi and the structure
that appeared in the solution of size 666. The structure enable to cut the
problem in two subpart, so the search goes faster I was able to find a solution
of size 5505.<br />
<br />
So I would say that the two mains reasons we're able to prove optimality for high
numbers as 1000 are:<br />
<br />
- MIP solver such as gurobi are very powerful tools.<br />
<br />
- The longest path in the divisor graph are highly structured.<br />
<br />
I joined our informal proof of the 666 case (the solution at the end), what is
interesting is to understand how the solution is composed of different blocks
depending of the prime decomposition of the elements. I joined lower bound from
1 to 1000 computed by Paul, that are very likely to be optimal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He also emailed me</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1)  a list of the numbers I call L(n) for n=1 to 1000.
These have not been refereed though I think they are correct. The list is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/1-1000.txt">here</a></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">AND</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2)  a PROOF that L(1000)\le 666 (and they HAVE a
sequence of length 666, so L(1000)=666).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Again, not refereed, but you can read the proof
yourself <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/proof1000.pdf">here</a> WARNING- the proof is in ENGLISH, so you cannot use it to improve your
mathematical French. </p></div>

Rich was the key guest for Harry Lewis’s class <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/richde/status/1398627350984728580">last June</a>. This time it is my turn to be part of the discussion of our paper <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">Social Process and Proofs of Theorems and Programs</a> that starts:  </p>
<p><em>Many people have argued that computer programming should strive to become more like mathematics. Maybe so, but not in the way they seem to think.</em></p>
<p>Sadly the paper’s third author, Alan Perlis, is unable to ever take part.</p>

<p>
</p><p><b> The Class </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Lewis’s class is based on his <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ideas-That-Created-Future-Computer/dp/0262045303/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=lewis+ideas+that+created+the+future&amp;qid=1595538528&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">book</a>.</p>

<p>
<em>The book highlights results that played a key part in the history of CS.  Ideas That Created the Future collects forty-six classic papers in computer science that map the evolution of the field. It covers all aspects of computer science: theory and practice, architectures and algorithms, and logic and software systems, with an emphasis on the period of 1936-1980 but also including important early work. Offering papers by thinkers ranging from Aristotle and Leibniz to Alan Turing and Nobert Wiener, the book documents the discoveries and inventions that created today’s digital world. Each paper is accompanied by a brief essay by Harry Lewis, the volume’s editor, offering historical and intellectual context. </em></p>
<p>
Some have asked: How could Rich and Alan and myself be included with such notables? Many hate our paper, but perhaps that is just life. This Tuesday it will be discussed again. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Our Paper </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Rich and I were in the late 1970’s quite interested in program correctness. We had three approaches:</p>
<li>Random Testing: We were the first to show that certain programs could be mathematically tested via random tests. The insight was that if the correctness was based on a polynomial restriction, then randomness could be proved to work with very small probability of failure. This was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220112604_A_Probabilistic_Remark_on_Algebraic_Program_Testing">A probabilistic remark on algebraic program testing.</a>
</li><li>Program Testing: The method here is based on what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation method</a>. It is powerful, but cannot be raised to mathematical certainty.
</li><li>Proving Programs is Hard: This was our negative result that is the key to the debate.
<p>
</p><p><b> The Debate—Starts </b></p>
<p></p><p>
The key to the argument is two part: </p>
<ol>
<li> The correctness of real systems is not clean. It is very complex, very case based. Terribly complex.
</li><li> The proof method of math is not geared to huge complex statements of correctness.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><b> The Debate—Continues </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Today papers on proof methods split into two classes: </p>
<ol>
<li> Those that refer to us. Usually negatively, but do at least they refer to us.
</li><li> Those that ignore us completely.
</li></ol>
<p>
Here are three examples from countless many papers: They should reference us but do not: </p>
<ol>
<li> <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/automatic-theorem-proving/philosophy.htm">Philosophical Interests in Program Verification</a>
</li><li> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-91908-9_18">Deductive Software Verification: From Pen-and-Paper Proofs to Industrial Tools</a>
</li><li> <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.522.3577&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Correctness: A Very Important Quality Factor In Programming</a>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Should there be some middle ground? Do we deserve to be in Harry’s book?</p>
<p></p></li></div>

<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Thirty years ago, I was in the middle of the second semester of my third year of undergrad, and one of the courses that I was enrolled in was on information theory. I was majoring in computer science, a major that had just been established at Sapienza University when I signed up for it in 1989, <s>organized by a computer science department that had also just been established in 1989</s>. A computer science department was established in 1991.</p>



<p>The new Sapienza computer science department was founded mostly by faculty from the Sapienza mathematics department, plus a number of people that came from other places to help start it. Among the latter, Renato Capocelli had moved to Rome from the University of Salerno, where he had been department chair of computer science.</p>



<p>Capocelli worked on combinatorics and information theory. In the early 90s, he had also become interested in the then-new area of zero-knowledge proofs.</p>



<p>Capocelli taught the information-theory course that I was attending, and it was a very different experience from the classes I had attended up to that point. To get the new major started, several professors were teaching classes outside their area, sticking close to their notes. Those teaching mathematical classes, were experts but were not deviating from the definition-theorem-proof script. Capocelli had an infectious passion for his subject, took his time to make us gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts of information theory, was full of examples and anecdotes, and  always emphasized the high-level idea of the proofs.</p>



<p>I subsequently met several other charismatic and inspiring computer scientists and mathematicians, though Capocelli had a very different personality from most of them. He was like an earlier generation of Southern Italian intellectuals, who could be passionate about their subject in a peculiarly non-nerdy way, loving it the way one may love food, people, nature, or a full life in general.</p>



<p>On April 8, 1992, Renato Capocelli <a href="https://www.di.uniroma1.it/sites/default/files/dipartimento/capocelli.pdf">died suddenly and unexpectedly</a>, though his memory lives on in the many people he inspired. The Computer Science department of the University of Salerno was named after him for a period of time.</p></div>
