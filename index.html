<p>Longest common subsequence (LCS) and edit distance (ED) are fundamental similarity measures of interest to genomic applications (insertions/deletions/substitutions are a pretty good proxy for both mutations and read errors). The fastest known algorithms for computing the LCS/ED between two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />-character strings run in nearly quadratic time. Breakthroughs in fine-grained complexity <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0348">[BI18]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06022">[AHWW16]</a> from the last few years provide some nice formal barriers further progress: in particular, substantially faster algorithms would refute <em>NC-SETH</em>, the hypothesis that given an NC circuit with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> input bits,  deciding if the circuit has any satisfying assignment requires <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%281-o%281%29%29n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="2^{(1-o(1))n}" class="latex" title="2^{(1-o(1))n}" /> time. (Note that this is a weaker, aka safer, hypothesis than the standard SETH.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Quantum algorithms for edit distance?</h2>
<p>One way to try to circumvent the computational barriers is by approximation algorithms (see my <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/07/20/approximating-edit-distance/">blog post</a>). A different approach is to go with quantum algorithms: Grover’s search can solve NC-SAT in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="2^{n/2}" class="latex" title="2^{n/2}" /> time. Even those of us less skeptic than <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">Gil Kalai</a> can probably agree that quadratic quantum speedups won’t be practical anytime soon. But in theory, I find the question of whether we can design subquadratic quantum algorithms for edit distance very interesting (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04178">[BEG+18]</a>).</p>
<p>Alas, even with the power of quantum computers we don’t know any truly subquadratic algorithms for computing LCS/ED. On the other hand, it is not clear how to rule out even linear-time algorithms. A few weeks ago, Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman, posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05686">paper</a> that gives a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> quantum <em>query complexity </em>lower bound for LCS/ED.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Problem: Close the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> vs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^2" class="latex" title="n^2" /> gap for quantum query complexity of ED/LCS.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is “query complexity” of ED/LCS? Buhrman et al. consider the following query model: In LCS, we want a <strong>maximum monotone matching</strong> between the characters of the two strings, where we can match two characters if they’re identical. Now suppose that in the query complexity problem we still want to find a maximum monotone matching, but instead of the character-equality graph (which is a union of disjoint cliques), we have an arbitrary bipartite graph, and <strong>given a pair of vertices, the oracle tells you if there is an edge between them</strong>.</p>
<p>This model may seem a bit counter-intuitive at first since the graphs may not correspond to any pair of strings; and indeed other models have been considered before <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321922">[UAH76]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4033">[AKO10]</a>. But it turns out that this model is well-motivated by the NC-SETH lower bound (see discussion below).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The ultimate hardness hypothesis</h2>
<p>What does the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> query complexity lower bound mean for algorithms on actual strings? Instead of a black box oracle, our algorithms have access to an NC-circuit that implements it. Intuitively, we don’t know how to do very much with white box circuits, so it seems plausible to hypothesize that the running time will be lower bound by the query complexity. In some sense, this is a special case of the following <em>ultimate hardness hypothesis </em>that unifies a lot of the computational hardness assumptions that we like to assume but have no idea how to prove (e.g. P!=NP, P!=BQP, NC-SETH, FP!=PPAD, etc):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ultimate Hardness Hypothesis] For every problem, the white-box computational complexity is lower bounded by the black-box query complexity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In communication complexity similar statements are known and are called simulation/lifting theorems (see e.g. <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~mika/thesis.pdf">Mika’s thesis</a>). For computational complexity, there are obvious counter examples such as “decide if the oracle can be implemented by a small circuit”. So it only makes sense to continue to assume the ultimate hardness hypothesis for “reasonable problems” instead of “every problem”.</p>
<p>But Burhman et al. identify the following variant of the ultimate hardness hypothesis which I find very interesting. It is defined with respect to a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7B2%5En%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" title="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" /> which takes as input the truth-table of a circuit and outputs True or False. Roughly, they hypothesize that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Burhman et al.-QSETH, paraphrased] For <em>every</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />, deciding if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> is true or false is as hard whether we’re given the actual circuit, or only the guarantee that the oracle is implemented by a small circuit”</p></blockquote>
<p>At a first read, I thought that arguments a-la impossibility of obfuscation <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390001.pdf">[BGI+01]</a> should refute this hypothesis, but a few weeks later I still don’t know how to prove it. Do you?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A tip for the upcoming holidays</h2>
<p>During my postdoc, I worked on the quantum query complexity of ED/LCS with Shalev Ben-David, Rolando La Placa, and John Wright. I was a bit bummed to find out that we got scooped by Buhrman et al, but I know of at least 3 other groups that were also scooped by the same paper, so at least we’re in good company <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>At the time, a fellow postdoc from Psychology asked me what I was working on. I resisted the temptation to try to explain the various quantum variants of NC-SETH, and instead told him I was working on “DNA sequencing with quantum computers”. His reaction was priceless. Regardless of what you’re actually working on, try this line during the holidays when your relatives ask you about your work.</p>

I am in the process of reviewing<br />
<br />
<i>                     What can be computed: A Practical Guide to the Theory of Computation</i><br />
<i>                     by John MacCormick</i><br />
<br />
<br />
and I need YOUR help for the first SENTENCE.  I began by saying<br />
<br />
<br />
                    This is a text book for a course on <i>Formal Language Theory</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
but then I realized that this is not what we call the course at UMCP. Then I got to thinking: what do other schools call it? I have the following so far:<br />
<br />
UMCP: Elementary Theory of Computation<br />
<br />
Harvard: Introduction to Theory of Computation<br />
<br />
MIT: Automata, Computability, and, Complexity<br />
<br />
Clark: Automata Theory<br />
<br />
(My spellcheck does not think Automata is a word. Also Computability. Usually I listen to my spellcheckers, but I checked and YES, I spelled them right.)<br />
<br />
For some other schools I either hit a place I needed an account, or I just got titles without a description so I could not be sure.<br />
<br />This is where YOU come in!<br />
<br />
Please leave comments with your school and the title of the course at your school that covers a reasonable overlap with: Regular Sets, Context Free Sets, Decidable and Undecidble and r.e. sets, P, NP, perhaps other complexity classes, and NP-completeness. Its FINE if your answer is one of the above ones, or one of the other comments--- I plan to later set this up as a pigeonhole principle problem.<br />
<br />
I suspect that courses in algorithms are called <i>Algorithms </i>or <i>Introduction to Algorithms.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
I suspect that courses in cryptography are called <i>Cryptography </i><i> </i>or <i>Intro to Cryptography.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
Why does the non-algorithm, non-crypto theory course have more names?<br />
<br />
<br />

In this paper, we propose 3 novel point upsampling modules: Multi-branch GCN,
Clone GCN, and NodeShuffle. Our modules use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
to better encode local point information. Our upsampling modules are versatile
and can be incorporated into any point cloud upsampling pipeline. We show how
our 3 modules consistently improve state-of-the-art methods in all point
upsampling metrics. We also propose a new multi-scale point feature extractor,
called Inception DenseGCN. We modify current Inception GCN algorithms by
introducing DenseGCN blocks. By aggregating data at multiple scales, our new
feature extractor is more resilient to density changes along point cloud
surfaces. We combine Inception DenseGCN with one of our upsampling modules
(NodeShuffle) into a new point upsampling pipeline: PU-GCN. We show both
qualitatively and quantitatively the advantages of PU-GCN against the
state-of-the-art in terms of fine-grained upsampling quality and point cloud
uniformity. The website and source code of this work is available at

investigate whether algorithms with runtimes of the type $\mathcal{O}^*(f(k))$
exist, where the $\mathcal{O}^*(\cdot)$ notation omits factors polynomial in
the input size. We obtain a \emph{trichotomy} by categorizing each variant to

processing units in order to reduce the running time of specific operations,
such as matrix operations, and improve their performance. Scheduling on such
hybrid platforms is a challenging problem since the algorithms used for the
case of homogeneous resources do not adapt well. In this paper we consider the
problem of scheduling a set of tasks subject to precedence constraints on
hybrid platforms, composed of two types of processing units. We propose a
$(3+2\sqrt{2})$-approximation algorithm and a conditional lower bound of 3 on
the approximation ratio. These results improve upon the 6-approximation
algorithm proposed by Kedad-Sidhoum et al. as well as the lower bound of 2 due
to Svensson for identical machines. Our algorithm is inspired by the former one
and distinguishes the allocation and the scheduling phases. However, we propose
a different allocation procedure which, although is less efficient for the
allocation sub-problem, leads to an improved approximation ratio for the whole
scheduling problem. This approximation ratio actually decreases when the number
of processing units of each type is close and matches the conditional lower
bound when they are equal.

parameter $\varepsilon$, runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(N) \cdot
2^{O(q/\varepsilon)}$, and returns a deterministic $O(q/\varepsilon)$-query
algorithm $D$ that $\varepsilon$-approximates the acceptance probabilities of
$R$. These parameters are near-optimal: runtime $N + 2^{\Omega(q/\varepsilon)}$
and query complexity $\Omega(q/\varepsilon)$ are necessary.

This has direct implications for the Turing machine model of computation:
sublinear-time algorithms for total decision problems can be efficiently
derandomized and dequantized with a subexponential-time preprocessing step.

and stable, and does not involve the knowledge of the dimension of the
manifold.

motivated by topological terrain simplification, which means removing as many
critical vertices of a terrain as possible while maintaining geometric
closeness to the original surface. Existing methods manage to reduce the
maximal possible number of critical vertices, but increase thereby the number
of regular vertices. Our method can be used to post-process a simplified
terrain, drastically reducing its size and preserving its favorable properties.

where one set is the set of all satisfiable CNF formulas and the other is the
set of CNF formulas that have $P$-proofs bounded by some polynomial. We give a
combinatorial characterization of the canonical pairs of depth~$d$ Frege
systems. Our characterization is based on certain games, introduced in this
article, that are parametrized by a number~$k$, also called the depth. We show
that the canonical pair of a depth~$d$ Frege system is polynomially equivalent
to the pair $(A_{d+2},B_{d+2})$ where $A_{d+2}$ (respectively, $B_{d+1}$) are
depth {$d+1$} games in which Player~I (Player II) has a positional winning
strategy. Although this characterization is stated in terms of games, we will
show that these combinatorial structures can be viewed as generalizations of
monotone Boolean circuits. In particular, depth~1 games are essentially
monotone Boolean circuits. Thus we get a generalization of the monotone
feasible interpolation for Resolution, which is a property that enables one to
reduce the task of proving lower bounds on the size of refutations to lower
bounds on the size of monotone Boolean circuits. However, we do not have a
method yet for proving lower bounds on the size of depth~$d$ games for $d&gt;1$.

limited number of noisy linear measurements $y \approx Ax$. In traditional
compressed sensing, "structure" is represented by sparsity in some known basis.
Inspired by the success of deep learning in modeling images, recent work
starting with~\cite{BJPD17} has instead considered structure to come from a
generative model $G: \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$. We present two results
establishing the difficulty of this latter task, showing that existing bounds
are tight. First, we provide a lower bound matching the~\cite{BJPD17} upper
bound for compressed sensing from $L$-Lipschitz generative models $G$. In
particular, there exists such a function that requires roughly $\Omega(k \log
L)$ linear measurements for sparse recovery to be possible. This holds even for
the more relaxed goal of \emph{nonuniform} recovery. Second, we show that
generative models generalize sparsity as a representation of structure. In
particular, we construct a ReLU-based neural network $G: \mathbb{R}^{2k} \to
\mathbb{R}^n$ with $O(1)$ layers and $O(kn)$ activations per layer, such that
the range of $G$ contains all $k$-sparse vectors.

conjectures the existence of an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for binary search
trees (BST's). Even the simpler problem of (offline) approximation of the
optimal cost of a BST for a given input, that we denote by $OPT$, is still
widely open, with the best current algorithm achieving an $O(\log\log
n)$-approximation. A major challenge in designing such algorithms is to obtain
a tight lower bound on $OPT$ that is algorithm friendly. Although several
candidate lower bounds were suggested in the past, such as WB-1 and WB-2 bounds
by Wilber, and Independent Rectangles bound by Demaine et al., the only
currently known non-trivial approximation algorithm achieves an $O(\log\log n)$
approximation factor by comparing $OPT$ with a weak variant of WB-1, that uses
a \emph{fixed} partitioning of the keys. This bound, however, is known to have
a gap of $\Omega(\log\log n)$, and therefore it cannot yield better
approximation algorithms. To overcome this obstacle, it is natural to consider
a stronger variant of WB-1, that maximizes the bound over \emph{all}
partitionings of the keys. An interesting question, mentioned by Iacono and by
Kozma, is whether the $O(\log\log n)$-approximation can be improved by using
this stronger bound.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we show that the gap between the stronger WB-1 bound and $OPT$
may be as large as $\Omega(\log\log n/\log\log\log n)$. This rules out the hope
of obtaining better approximation algorithms via the only known algorithmic
approach, combined with the stronger WB-1 bound. We also provide algorithmic
results: for any parameter $D$, we present a simple $O(D)$-approximation
algorithm with running time $\exp\left(O\left (n^{1/2^D}\log n\right )\right
)$. This implies an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm in sub-exponential time.

operational cost of any binary search tree (BST) for a given access sequence $X
\in [n]^m$. Both bounds play a central role in the ongoing pursuit of the
dynamic optimality conjecture (Tarjan and Sleator, 1985), but their
relationship remained unknown for more than three decades. We show that
Wilber's Funnel bound dominates his Alternation bound for all $X$, and give a
tight $\Theta(\lg\lg n)$ separation for some $X$, answering Wilber's conjecture
and an open problem of Iacono, Demaine et. al. The main ingredient of the proof
is a new *symmetric* characterization of Wilber's Funnel bound, which proves
that it is invariant under rotations of $X$. We use this characterization to
provide initial indication that the Funnel bound matches the Independent
Rectangle bound (Demaine et al., 2009), by proving that when the Funnel bound
is constant, $\mathsf{IRB}_{\diagup\hspace{-.6em}\square}$ is linear. To the
best of our knowledge, our results provide the first progress on Wilber's
conjecture that the Funnel bound is dynamically optimal (1986).

fundamental problem in many domains. Most algorithms in the literature for
solving this problem are conditional, i.e., they make some simplifying
assumptions, such as, all the roots are simple or there are no roots on the
boundary of the input box, or the underlying machine model is Real RAM. Root
clustering is a generalization of the root approximation problem that allows
for errors in the computation and makes no assumption on the multiplicity of
the roots. An unconditional algorithm for computing a root clustering of a
holomorphic function was given by Yap, Sagraloff and Sharma in 2013. They
proposed a subdivision based algorithm using effective predicates based on
Pellet's test while avoiding any comparison with zeros (using soft zero
comparisons instead). In this paper, we analyze the running time of their
algorithm. We use the continuous amortization framework to derive an upper
bound on the size of the subdivision tree. We specialize this bound to the case
of polynomials and some simple transcendental functions such as exponential and
trigonometric sine. We show that the algorithm takes exponential time even for
these simple functions, unlike the case of polynomials. We also derive a bound
on the bit-precision used by the algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first such result for holomorphic functions. We introduce new geometric
parameters, such as the relative growth of the function on the input box, for
analyzing the algorithm. Thus, our estimates naturally generalize the known
results, i.e., for the case of polynomials.

Héctor Garcia-Molina <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/12/06/hector-garcia-molina-influential-computer-scientist-database-expert-dies-65/">died</a> just before Thanksgiving. He was a computer scientist and Professor in both the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I write in sadness about his passing and to express some personal appreciations. </p>
<p>
We at GLL have talked about him before. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/lint-for-math/">this</a> for his story about the fun of using an IBM mainframe for teaching. Or see <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/whos-afraid-of-arrows-paradox/">this</a> for a story about Héctor and meetings.</p>
<p>
I, Dick, had the pleasure to have worked with him, while we were both faculty at Princeton in the 1980’s and beyond.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> His Clock </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor was the chair of the Stanford Computer Science Department from January 2001 to December 2004. Stanford then rotated the chair so all took their turn. I know that he “hated” being an administrator in general. But of course being a team player he took his turn. </p>
<p>
One way to see his real feelings about being a chair was to look at the clock his students constructed for him. The clock was a digital timer that counted down the seconds that remained in his term as the chair. It started at roughly 126227808. I am sure he did fine, but the clock was a statement. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> His Worst Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
While Héctor was at Princeton we worked together on a project—the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/sorting-out-chess-endgames/">MMM</a> project. It led to one of his least cited papers—a 1984 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1676454">paper</a> with me and Jacobo Valdes. OK, it has 48 citations according to IEEE. The idea of the project was to use memory rather than processors to speed up computations. He was a joy to work with: he was careful, and thoughtful, and just fun to work with on any project. </p>
<p>
We did write a second <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AMrcBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=The+Massive+Memory+Machine+Project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_QFT07G56P&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-KV060yO3PHRllCnj3Y5o10BX-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7o67o-abmAhXHwFkKHRfzDs4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The Massive Memory Machine Project&amp;f=false">paper</a> with Richard Cullingford instead of Valdes, which Héctor presented at a meeting on knowledge-based management systems. The above Google Books link goes to the end with a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AMrcBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=The+Massive+Memory+Machine+Project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_QFT07G56P&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-KV060yO3PHRllCnj3Y5o10BX-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7o67o-abmAhXHwFkKHRfzDs4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The Massive Memory Machine Project&amp;f=false">discussion</a> in which a simple issue was raised—we paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Won’t it take forever just to write all zeros to the memory? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Héctor had a scientist’s answer: the project was still not at the prototype stage so he didn’t know. He said the project should be viewed as a scientific experiment to find out. Maybe he also had an inkling that what was coming was a decade of breakthroughs in CPU design and parallel/pipeline processing after all. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> His Predictions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor was unparalleled at seeing the future. I always thought that one of his abilities, one that set him apart, was his ability to predict directions of research. This allowed him, and his students, to write early papers in research areas before they became hot. This is one of the talents that made him so amazing.</p>
<p>
I recall way before the world wide web was created he had students working on adding links to documents. I recall a talk by one of his students at Princeton that discussed what we now call URLs. One question that was raised during the talk was: How were the links going to be created? There was a lively discussion about this. Could they be created automatically? If not why would people take the time to create the links? Indeed.</p>
<p>
Héctor saw that links would be created. That people would take the effort to create them. I must admit that he was right, and he saw the future better than most. I wish I had a fraction of his ability to see directions like he did.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Guiding Students </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor told me that when he first got to Stanford the fund managers and investors roamed the halls. They would ask anyone they could if they had an idea for a company or a startup. It was a constant issue that Héctor had to deal with. They were continually trying to steal away students. </p>
<p>
He told me he felt like he was the head of an abbey and was always having to protect his charges within the walls.</p>
<p>
When the impetus came from within it was different. Of course, Héctor was the advisor of Sergey Brin at the time he and Larry Page conceived Google. Brin and Page found that their search engine prototypes were so good the dataflow was constantly straining Stanford’s machines. They needed to scrounge for more disks and processors to mount their servers. Héctor already oversaw the Stanford Digital Libraries Project and he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/04/8-surprising-facts-you-might-not-know-about-googles-early-days.html">arranged</a> for funds to purchase spare parts for the data servers. </p>
<p>
It is interesting that in this 2001 <a href="https://sigmod.org/publications/interviews/pdf/hector-final1.pdf">interview</a> in the <em>SIGMOD Record</em>, Héctor did not have a high opinion of the industrial side of his area:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Again, I don’t think industry really does very much research. They come up with an idea and they try to sell it. If it was a good idea, maybe they will make money. Even if it was a bad idea, if they have good marketing people, they might still make money and we never know … I don’t think they have an advantage over [academics] in testing the ideas and evaluating them and performing measurements and really understanding what are the right techniques. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In the same interview, he had sage advice for students after completing their PhDs and during the tenure process, mainly on the side of not trying to play the system but focus on doing what you love.</p>
<p>

<p></p><p>
Héctor had been a graduate student at Stanford. So his return there as a professor was a kind of homecoming. He was a home-team player in many senses. One of them is shown by this photo:</p>

A covering code is a set of codewords with the property that the union of balls, suitably defined, around these codewords covers an entire space. Generally, the goal is to find the covering code with the minimum size codebook. While most prior work on covering codes has focused on the Hamming metric, we consider the problem of designing covering codes defined in terms of  insertions and  deletions. First, we provide new sphere-covering lower bounds on the minimum possible size of such codes. Then, we provide new existential upper bounds on the size of optimal covering codes for a single insertion or a single deletion that are tight up to a constant factor. Finally, we derive improved upper bounds for covering codes using $R\geq 2$ insertions or deletions. We prove that codes exist with density that is only a factor $O(R \log R)$ larger than the lower bounds for all fixed $R$. In particular, our upper bounds have an optimal dependence on the word length, and we achieve asymptotic density matching the best known bounds for Hamming distance covering codes.</div>

<div class="content">
The query model offers a concrete setting where quantum algorithms are provably superior to randomized algorithms. Beautiful results by Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon,  Aaronson, and others presented partial Boolean functions that can be computed by quantum algorithms making much fewer queries compared to their randomized analogs. To date, separations of $O(1)$ vs. $\sqrt{N}$ between quantum and randomized query complexities remain the state-of-the-art (where $N$ is the input length), leaving open the question of whether $O(1)$ vs. $N^{1/2+\Omega(1)}$ separations are possible?

We answer this question in the affirmative. Our separating problem is a variant of the Aaronson-Ambainis $k$-fold Forrelation problem. We show that our variant:
(1) Can be solved by a quantum algorithm making $2^{O(k)}$ queries to the inputs.
(2) Requires at least $\tilde{\Omega}(N^{2(k-1)/(3k-1)})$ queries for any randomized algorithm.

For any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, this gives a  $O(1)$  vs. $N^{2/3-\varepsilon}$ separation between the quantum and randomized query complexities of partial Boolean functions. 

Our proof is Fourier analytical and uses new bounds on the Fourier spectrum of classical decision trees, which could be of independent interest. 

Looking forward, we conjecture that the Fourier bounds could be further improved in a precise manner, and show that such conjectured bounds imply optimal $O(1)$ vs. $N^{1-\varepsilon}$ separations between the quantum and randomized query complexities of partial Boolean functions.</div>

We show that the size of any regular resolution refutation of Tseitin formula $T(G,c)$ based on a graph $G$ is at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G)/\log n)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$ and $tw(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$. For constant degree graphs there is known upper bound $2^{O(tw(G))}$ [AR11, GTT18], so our lower bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor in the exponent.

In order to prove this result we show that any regular resolution proof of Tseitin formula $T(G,c)$ of size $S$ can be converted to a read-once branching program computing satisfiable Tseitin formula $T(G,c')$ of size $S^{O(\log n)}$. Then we show that any read-once branching program computing satisfiable Tseitin formula $T(G,c')$ has size at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G))}$; the latter improves the recent result of Glinskih and Itsykson [GI19].</div>

A pseudo-deterministic algorithm is a (randomized) algorithm which, when run multiple times on the same input, with high probability outputs the same result on all executions. Classic streaming algorithms, such as those for finding heavy hitters, approximate counting, $\ell_2$ approximation, finding a nonzero entry in a vector (for turnstile algorithms) are not pseudo-deterministic. For example, in the instance of finding a nonzero entry in a vector, for any known low-space algorithm $A$, there exists a stream $x$ so that running $A$ twice on $x$ (using different randomness) would with high probability result in two different entries as the output.

In this work, we study whether it is inherent that these algorithms output different values on different executions. That is, we ask whether these problems have low-memory pseudo-deterministic algorithms. For instance, we show that there is no low-memory pseudo-deterministic algorithm for finding a nonzero entry in a vector (given in a turnstile fashion), and also that there is no low-dimensional pseudo-deterministic sketching algorithm for $\ell_2$ norm estimation.  We also exhibit problems which do have low memory pseudo-deterministic algorithms but no low memory deterministic algorithm, such as outputting a nonzero row of a matrix, or outputting a basis for the row-span of a matrix.

We also investigate multi-pseudo-deterministic algorithms: algorithms which with high probability output one of a few options. We show the first lower bounds for such algorithms. This implies that there are streaming problems such that every low space algorithm for the problem must have inputs where there are many valid outputs, all with a significant probability of being outputted.</div>

<p>We hit the mother-lode of property testing papers this month. Stick with us, as we cover 10 (!) papers that appeared online in November.</p>



<p>EDIT: We actually have 11 papers, check out <em>Optimal Adaptive Detection of Monotone Patterns</em> at the bottom.</p>



<p><strong>Testing noisy linear functions for sparsity</strong>, by Xue Chen, Anindya De, and Rocco A. Servedio (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00911">arXiv</a>). Given samples from a noisy linear model \(y = w\cdot x + \mathrm{noise}\), test whether \(w\) is \(k\)-sparse, or far from being \(k\)-sparse. This is a property testing version of the celebrated sparse recovery problem, whose sample complexity is well-known to be \(O(k\log n)\), where the data lies in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). This paper shows that the testing version of the problem can be solved (tolerantly) with a number of samples independent of \(n\), assuming technical conditions: the distribution of coordinates of \(x\) are i.i.d. and non-Gaussian, and the noise distribution is known to the algorithm. Surprisingly, all these conditions are needed, otherwise the dependence on \(n\) is \(\tilde \Omega(\log n)\), essentially the same as the recovery problem.</p>



<p><strong>Pan-Private Uniformity Testing</strong>, by Kareem Amin, Matthew Joseph, Jieming Mao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01452">arXiv</a>). Differentially private distribution testing has now seen significant study, in both the local and central models of privacy. This paper studies a distribution testing in the pan-private model, which is intermediate: the algorithm receives samples one by one in the clear, but it must maintain a differentially private internal state at all time steps. The sample complexity turns out to be qualitatively intermediate to the two other models: testing uniformity over \([k]\) requires \(\Theta(\sqrt{k})\) samples in the central model, \(\Theta(k)\) samples in the local model, and this paper shows that \(\Theta(k^{2/3})\) samples are necessary and sufficient in the pan-private model.</p>



<p><strong>Almost Optimal Testers for Concise Representations</strong>, by Nader Bshouty (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/156/">ECCC</a>). This work gives a unified approach for testing for a plethora of different classes which possess some sort of <em>sparsity</em>. These classes include \(k\)-juntas, \(k\)-linear functions, \(k\)-terms, various types of DNFs, decision lists, functions with bounded Fourier degree, and much more. </p>



<p><strong>Unified Sample-Optimal Property Estimation in Near-Linear Time</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03105">arXiv</a>). This paper presents a unified approach for estimating several distribution properties with both near-optimal time and sample complexity, based on piecewise-polynomial approximation. Some applications include estimators for Shannon entropy, power sums, distance to uniformity,  normalized support size, and normalized support coverage. More generally, results hold for all Lipschitz properties, and consequences include high-confidence property estimation (outperforming the “median trick”) and differentially private property estimation.</p>



<p><strong>Testing linear-invariant properties</strong>, by Jonathan Tidor and Yufei Zhao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06793">arXiv</a>). This paper studies property testing of functions which are in a formal sense, definable by restrictions to subspaces of bounded degree. This class of functions is a broad generalization of testing whether a function is linear, or a degree-\(d\) polynomial (for constant \(d\)). The algorithm is the oblivious one, which simply repeatedly takes random restrictions and tests whether the property is satisfied or not (similar to the classic linearity test of BLR, along with many others). </p>



<p><strong>Approximating the Distance to Monotonicity of Boolean Functions</strong>, by Ramesh Krishnan S. Pallavoor, Sofya Raskhodnikova, Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/163/">ECCC</a>). This paper studies the following fundamental question in tolerant testing: given a Boolean function on the hypercube, test whether it is \(\varepsilon’\)-close or \(\varepsilon\)-far from monotone. It is shown that there is a non-adaptive polynomial query algorithm which can solve this problem for \(\varepsilon’ = \varepsilon/\tilde \Theta(\sqrt{n})\), implying an algorithm which can approximate distance to monotonicity up to a multiplicative \(\tilde O(\sqrt{n})\) (addressing an <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=250">open problem</a> by Sesh). They also give a lower bound demonstrating that improving this approximating factor significantly would necessitate exponentially-many queries. Interestingly, this is proved for the (easier) erasure-resilient model, and also implies lower bounds for tolerant testing of unateness and juntas.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Properties of Multiple Distributions with Few Samples</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour and Sandeep Silwal (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07324">arXiv</a>). This paper introduces a new model for distribution testing. Generally, we are given \(n\) samples from a distribution which is either (say) uniform or far from uniform, and we wish to test which is the case. The authors here study the problem where we are given a <em>single sample</em> from \(n\) different distributions which are either all uniform or far from uniform, and we wish to test which is the case. By additionally assuming a structural condition in the latter case (it is argued that <em>some</em> structural condition is necessary), they give sample-optimal algorithms for testing uniformity, identity, and closeness.</p>



<p><strong>Random Restrictions of High-Dimensional Distributions and Uniformity Testing with Subcube Conditioning</strong>, by Clément L. Canonne, Xi Chen, Gautam Kamath, Amit Levi, and Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/165/">ECCC</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07357">arXiv</a>). By now, it is well-known that testing uniformity over the \(n\)-dimensional hypercube requires \(\Omega(2^{n/2})\) samples — the curse of dimensionality quickly makes this problem intractable. One option is to assume that the distribution is product, which causes the complexity to drop to \(O(\sqrt{n})\). This paper instead assumes one has stronger access to the distribution — namely, one can receive samples conditioned on being from some subcube of the domain. With this, the paper shows that the complexity drops to the near-optimal \(\tilde O(\sqrt{n})\) samples. The related problem of testing whether a distribution is either uniform or has large mean is also considered. </p>



<p><strong>Property Testing of LP-Type Problems</strong>, by Rogers Epstein, Sandeep Silwal (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08320">arXiv</a>). An LP-Type problem (also known as a generalized linear program) is an optimization problem sharing some properties with linear programs. More formally, they consist of a set of constraints \(S\) and a function \(\varphi\) which maps subsets of \(S\) to some totally ordered set, such that \(\varphi\) possesses monotonicity and locality properties. This paper considers the problem of testing whether \(\varphi(S) \leq k\), or whether at least an \(\varepsilon\)-fraction of constraints in \(S\) must be removed for \(\varphi(S) \leq k\) to hold. This paper gives an algorithm with query complexity \(O(\delta/\varepsilon)\), where \(\delta\) is a dimension measure of the problem. This is applied to testing problems for linear separability, smallest enclosing ball, smallest intersecting ball, smallest volume annulus. The authors also provide lower bounds for some of these problems as well.</p>



<p><strong>Near-Optimal Algorithm for Distribution-Free Junta Testing</strong>, by Xiaojin Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10833">arXiv</a>). This paper presents an (adaptive) algorithm for testing juntas, in the distribution-free model with one-sided error. The query complexity is \(\tilde O(k/\varepsilon)\), which is nearly optimal. Algorithms with this sample complexity were previously known under the uniform distribution, or with two-sided error, but this is the first paper to achieve it in the distribution-free model with one-sided error.</p>



<p><strong>Optimal Adaptive Detection of Monotone Patterns</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Shoham Letzter, Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01169">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of testing whether a function has no monotone increasing subsequences of length \(k\), versus being \(\varepsilon\)-far from having this property. Note that this is a generalization of testing whether a function is monotone (decreasing), which corresponds to the case \(k = 2\). This work shows that the adaptive sample complexity of this problem is \(O_{k,\varepsilon}(\log n)\), matching the lower bound for monotonicity testing. This is in comparison to the non-adaptive sample complexity, which is \(O_{k,\varepsilon}((\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k\rfloor})\). In fact, the main result provides a certificate of being far, in the form of a monotone increasing subsequence of length \(k\).</p></div>

<p><em>By Preetum Nakkiran, Gal Kaplun, Yamini Bansal, Tristan Yang, Boaz Barak, and Ilya Sutskever</em></p>



<p><em>This is a lightly edited and expanded version of the following post on the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/">OpenAI blog</a> about the following <a href="http://mltheory.org/deep.pdf">paper</a>. While I usually don’t advertise my own papers on this blog, I thought this might be of interest to theorists, and a good follow up to <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/">my prior post</a>. I promise not to make a habit out of it. –Boaz</em></p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>   <a href="http://mltheory.org/deep.pdf">Our paper</a> shows that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double descent</a> occurs in conventional modern deep learning settings: visual classification in the presence of label noise (CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100) and machine translation (IWSLT’14 and WMT’14). As we increase the number of parameters in a neural network, initially the test error decreases, then increases, and then, just as the model is able to fit the train set, it undergoes a second descent, again decreasing as the number of parameters increases. This behavior also extends over train epochs, where a single model undergoes double-descent in test error over the course of training. Surprisingly (at least to us!), we show these phenomenon can lead to a regime where “<em><strong>more data hurts</strong></em>”—training a deep network on a larger train set actually performs worse.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Open a statistics textbook and you are likely to see warnings against the danger of “overfitting”: If you are trying to find a good classifier or regressor for a given set of labeled examples, you would be well-advised to steer clear of having so many parameters in your model that you are able to completely fit the training data, because you risk not generalizing to new data.</p>



<p>The canonical example for this is polynomial regression. Suppose that we get <em>n</em> samples of the form <em>(x, p(x)+noise)</em> where <em>x</em> is a real number and <em>p(x)</em> is a cubic (i.e. degree 3) polynomial. If we try to fit the samples with a degree 1 polynomial—-a linear function, then we would get many points wrong. If we try to fit it with just the right degree, we would get a very good predictor. However, as the degree grows, we get worse till the degree is large enough to fit all the noisy training points, at which point the regressor is terrible, as shown in this figure:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H4f4ST5B9RnLX1ski6HEI7RBV5gqvk7WGiFR0qf6Savafmep6i08RYlpF5sgtq9oVqQ6ZkuglvCn0PTMQ_uaK3XStJlSskTSM6I52SyCZ91FeAcphq11MKa56wsfnDAG6GuruTT3" alt="" /></figure>



<p>It seems that the higher the degree, the worse things are, but what happens if we go <em>even higher</em>? It seems like a crazy idea—-why would we increase the degree beyond the number of samples? But it corresponds to the practice of having many more  parameters than training samples in modern deep learning. Just like in deep learning, when the degree is larger than the number of samples, there is more than one polynomial that fits the data– but we choose a specific one: the one found running gradient descent.</p>



<p>Here is what happens if we do this for degree 1000, fitting a polynomial using gradient descent (see <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oMuUz3_BOENSoaOVOymLoB2mHeYBex8S">this notebook</a>):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DjQoPWG5gCueu_sAORKtrhNrrWY35OU3y-RXKJx0AZxIofVzZo-psP-JFsr_a4v20pWhH7EFfFPozckotWzvKypEebkPRJmdSa3vuy39ABdp2PqtqMr7dPX1PTDfMT362n4dGzVG" alt="" /></figure>



<p>We still fit all the training points, but now we do so in a more controlled way which actually tracks quite closely the ground truth. We see that despite what we learn in statistics textbooks, sometimes overfitting is not that bad, as long as you go “all in” rather than “barely overfitting” the data. That is, overfitting doesn’t hurt us if we take the number of parameters to be much larger than what is needed to just fit the training set — and in fact, as we see in deep learning, larger models are often better.</p>



<p>The above is not a novel observation. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin et al </a>called this phenomenon <strong><em>“double descent”</em></strong> and this goes back to <a href="http://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op01.pdf">even</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03667">earlier</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09349">works</a><a href="http://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op03b.pdf"> </a>. In this <a href="http://mltheory.org/deep.pdf">new paper</a> we (Preetum Nakkiran, Gal Kaplun, Yamini Bansal, Tristan Yang, Boaz Barak, and Ilya Sutskever) extend the prior works and report on a variety of experiments showing that “double descent” is widely prevalent across several modern deep neural networks and for several natural tasks such as image recognition (for the CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets) and language translation (for IWSLT’14 and WMT’14 datasets).  As we increase the number of parameters in a neural network, initially the test error decreases, then increases, and then, just as the model is able to fit the train set, it undergoes a <em>second descent,</em> again decreasing as the number of parameters increases.  Moreover, double descent also extends beyond number of parameters to other measures of “complexity” such as the number of training epochs of the algorithm. </p>



<p>The take-away from our work (and the prior works it builds on) is that neither the classical statisticians’ conventional wisdom that <strong><em>“too large models are worse”</em></strong> nor the modern ML paradigm that <strong><em>“bigger models are always better”</em></strong><em> </em>always hold. Rather it all depends on whether you are on the first or second descent.  Further more, these insights also allow us to generate natural settings in which even the age-old adage of <strong><em>“more data is always better”</em></strong> is violated!</p>



<p>In the rest of this blog post we present a few sample results from this recent paper.</p>



<h3 id="modelwisedoubledescent">Model-wise Double Descent</h3>



<p>We observed many cases in which, just like in the polynomial interpolation example above, the test error undergoes a “double descent” as we increase the complexity of the model. The figure below demonstrates one such example: we plot the test error as a function of the complexity of the model for ResNet18 networks. The complexity of the model is the width of the layers, and the dataset is CIFAR10 with 15% label noise. Notice that the peak in test error occurs around the “interpolation threshold”: when the models are just barely large enough to fit the train set. In all cases we’ve observed, changes which affect the interpolation threshold (such as changing the optimization algorithm, changing the number of train samples, or varying the amount of label noise) also affect the location of the test error peak correspondingly. </p>



<p>We found the double descent phenomena is most prominent in settings with added label noise— without it, the peak is much smaller and easy to miss. But adding label noise amplifies this general behavior and allows us to investigate it easily.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tFWTvNkFwG8Ljx8zp9X3Ul6aUZT9YmkwcNk07g6_EFUklZoBUd9MqApBEojLzOp9N7yndveLwg5A7uj_vxpGVofQ2QCe-bbMAguQB38cK4NhRfXBp-SWMDQUt9x44r6d_fMur7NO" alt="" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 id="samplewisenonmonotonicity">Sample-Wise Nonmonotonicity</h3>



<p>Using the model-wise double descent phenomenon we can obtain examples where training on <strong>more data actually hurts</strong>. To see this, let’s look at the effect of increasing the number of train samples on the test error vs. model size graph. The below plot shows Transformers trained on a language-translation task (with no added label noise):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YkuZGjuWGKoCcl1gNbQfaKO-96hX9ShcVZ_Dj0KlKddRZhgpMGtzs427zPuC9QwHOOKgmuV5E0aEKOU3zwhwpGmdiWwDDDBIk7hroJZfRLa7kXSThzwTDZoNSM8I2M9OfWxIW5X_" alt="" /></figure>



<p>On the one hand, (as expected) increasing the number of samples generally shifts the curve downwards towards lower test error. On the other hand, it also shifts the curve to the right: since more samples require larger models to fit, the interpolation threshold (and hence, the peak in test error) shifts to the right. For intermediate model sizes, these two effects combine, and we see that <strong>training on 4.5x more samples actually hurts test performance.</strong></p>



<h3 id="epochwisedoubledescent">Epoch-Wise Double Descent</h3>



<p><strong>There is a regime where training longer reverses overfitting.</strong> Let’s look closer at the experiment from the “Model-wise Double Descent” section, and plot Test Error as a function of both model-size and number of optimization steps. In the plot below to the right, each column tracks the Test Error of a given model over the course of training. The top horizontal dotted-line corresponds to the double-descent of the first figure. But we can also see that for a fixed large model, as training proceeds test error goes down, then up and down again—we call this phenomenon “epoch-wise double-descent.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SCP6M-txj9ax5g9cR9Ry27X2nF1sEJbpsfC9FiME5umNm-BxcHHBmhseuuWEm3mHMzo_0o5q-92ETcaU0OEXnhTmv_7MpOREaaeIMs7zbL9P5aFeqkXMYh8O8VN4FdASnAu0HOPI" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Moreover, if we plot the Train error of the same models and the corresponding interpolation contour (dotted line) we see that it exactly matches the ridge of high test error (on the right).</p>



<p><strong>In general, the peak of test error appears systematically when models are just barely able to fit the train set.</strong></p>



<p>Our intuition is that for models at the interpolation threshold, there is effectively only one model that fits the train data, and forcing it to fit even slightly-noisy or mis-specified labels will destroy its global structure. That is, there are no “good models”, which both interpolate the train set, and perform well on the test set. However in the over-parameterized regime, there are many models that fit the train set, and there exist “good models” which both interpolate the train set and perform well on the distribution. Moreover, the implicit bias of SGD leads it to such “good” models, for reasons we don’t yet understand.</p>



<p>The above intuition is theoretically justified for linear models, via a series of recent works including [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08560">Hastie et al.</a>] and [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05355">Mei-Montanari</a>]. We leave fully understanding the mechanisms behind double descent in deep neural networks as an important open question.</p>



<p></p>

<h2>Commentary: Experiments for Theory</h2>



<p>The experiments above are especially interesting (in our opinion) because of how they can inform ML theory: any theory of ML must be consistent with “double descent.” In particular, one ambitious hope for what it means to “theoretically explain ML” is to prove a theorem of the form:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“If the distribution satisfies property X and architecture/initialization satisfies property Y, then SGD trained on ‘n’ samples, for T steps, will have small test error with high probability”</p>



<p>For values of X, Y, n, T, “small” and “high” that are used in practice.</p>



<p>However, these experiments show that these properties are likely more subtle than we may have hoped for, and must be non-monotonic in certain natural parameters.</p>



<p>This rules out even certain natural “conditional conjectures” that we may have hoped for, for example the conjecture that</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“If SGD on a width W network works for learning from ‘n’ samples from distribution D, then SGD on a width W+1 network will work at least as well”</p>



<p>Or the conjecture</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“If SGD on a certain network and distribution works for learning with ‘n’ samples, then it will work at least as well with n+1 samples”</p>



<p>It also appears to conflict with a “2-phase” view of the trajectory of SGD, as an initial “learning phase” and then an “overfitting phase” — in particular, because the overfitting is sometimes reversed (at least, as measured by test error) by further training.</p>



<p>Finally, the fact that these phenomena are not specific to neural networks, but appear to hold fairly universally for natural learning methods (linear/kernel regression, decision trees, random features) gives us hope that there is a deeper phenomenon at work, and we are yet to find the right abstraction.</p>

A central question in the study of interactive proofs is the relationship between private-coin proofs, where the verifier is allowed to hide its randomness from the prover, and public-coin proofs, where the verifier's random coins are sent to the prover. 
	
	In this work, we study transformations from private-coin proofs to public-coin proofs, which preserve (up to polynomial factors) the running time of both the prover and the verifier. We re-consider this question in light of the emergence of doubly-efficient interactive proofs, where the honest prover is required to run in polynomial time. Can every private-coin doubly-efficient interactive proof be transformed into a public-coin doubly-efficient proof? We show that, assuming one-way functions exist, there is no black-box private-coin to public-coin transformation for doubly-efficient interactive proofs.
	
	Our main result is a (loose) converse: every doubly-efficient proof has a function such that if this function is invertible, then the proof can be efficiently transformed. 
	
	Turning our attention back to classic interactive proofs, where the honest prover need not run in polynomial time, we show a similar result for constant-round general interactive proofs. Finally, we demonstrate a condition that suffices for efficiency preserving emulation of any protocol (even if the number of rounds is polynomial and the honest prover is unbounded).

Adolph Ochs was the owner of the New York Times. In 1897 he created the paper’s slogan, “All the News That’s Fit to Print.” We at GLL would like some suggestions on our own slogan. Send us your ideas. Please no suggestion of “All the news that fits we print,” as that is already out there.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I wish to comment on a recent article in the NYT that was on end-to-end encryption.<br />
<span id="more-16447"></span></p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/end-to-end-encryption.html">article</a> leads by saying: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A Justice Department official hinted on Monday that a yearslong fight over encrypted communications could become part of a sweeping investigation of big tech companies. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course, end-to-end encryption scrambles messages so that <em>only</em> the sender and receiver can decode the message. Other methods are weaker: some only encrypt messages as they enter part of the network. This means that one must trust the network to keep your message secret. Thus the end-to-end method reduces the number of parties that one must trust. </p>
<p>
In 1912, Ochs was a party to encryption that was literally end-to-end on the globe. The New York Times had bought exclusive American rights to report Roald Amundsen’s expedition to the South Pole. When Amundsen returned to Hobart, Tasmania, he sent a coded cable to his brother Leon who was acting as conduit to the Times and the London Daily Chronicle. The brother pronounced the coast clear for Amundsen to communicate directly to the papers. The stories were still quickly plagiarized once the first one appeared in the Times, and Ochs had to defend his rights with lawsuits. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Usual Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There is an ongoing interest in using end-to-end encryption to protect more and more of our messages. And this interest leads to several hard problems. </p>
<p>
The main one addressed by the NYT article is: Does this type of encryption protect bad actors? Many believe that encryption makes it impossible to track criminals. Many in law enforcement, for example, wish to have the ability to access any messages, at least on a court order. Some countries are likely to make this the law—that is, they will insist that they always can access any message. A followup NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/11/27/technology/27reuters-interpol-encryption.html">article</a> described debates within Interpol about these matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Another Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The above problem is <b>not</b> what we wish to talk about today. We want to raise another problem. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>How do we know that our messages are being properly encrypted?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We could check that our app is in end-to-end mode. The app will say “yes”. The problem is that this does not prove anything. The deeper question is how do we know that messages are correctly encrypted. Indeed. </p>
<p>
Suppose that we are told that the message <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> has been sent to another person as the encrypted message <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE%28M%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{E(M)}" class="latex" title="{E(M)}" />. How do we know that this has been done? Several issues come to mind:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>The app could lie.</i> The app could for example say it is encrypting your message and it did not.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>The app could mislead.</i> The app could send an encrypted message and also send the clear message to who ever it wishes.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>The app could be wrong.</i> The app could think that the message was properly encrypted. The key, for example, could be a weak key.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> <i>The app method could be flawed.</i> The app’s method could be incorrect. The method used might be vulnerable to non or unknown attacks.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption">Authenticated</a> encryption seems to cover only part of the need. It can confirm the identity of the sender and that the ciphertext has not been tampered with. This is, however, a far cry from verifying that the encryption itself is proper and free of holes that could make it easy to figure out. Our point is also aside from problems with particular end-to-end implementations such as those considered in this 2017 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05285.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Bopuifs fodszqujpo qspcmfn was encrypted with the simple key 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++a+%5Crightarrow+b%2C+b+%5Crightarrow+c%2C+c+%5Crightarrow+d%2C+%5Cdots+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  a \rightarrow b, b \rightarrow c, c \rightarrow d, \dots " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  a \rightarrow b, b \rightarrow c, c \rightarrow d, \dots " /></p>
<p>The point of this silly example is that it might have been encrypted by a harder method, but it was only encrypted by a trivial substitution method. Nevertheless, Google could not figure it out:</p>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/12/julia-robinsons-100th-birthday.html">Julia Robinson's 100th birthday</a></h3>

<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
On Dec 8, 1919 Julia Robinson was born, so today is close to her 100th birthday (she passed away at<br />
<div>
the age of 65 on July 30, 1985).</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
So time for some facts about her</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
1) She got her PhD from Tarski where she proved the undecidability of the theory of the rationals.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
2) She is probably best known for her work on Hilbert's tenth problem (which we call H10)</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
In todays' terminology H10 would be stated as:</div>
<div>
<br />
Find an algorithm that will, given p in Z[x_1,...,x_n] determine if it has an integer solution.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Hilbert posed it to inspire deep research in Number Theory. There are some cases that are</div>
<div>
solvable (the topic of a later blog post) but the general problem is undecidable. This is not what Hilbert was aiming for. I wonder if he would be happy with the resolution.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The Davis-Putnam-Robinson paper showed that the decision problem for exponential diophantine equations was undecidable. It was published in 1961. The paper is <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970289?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a>.  Martin Davis predicted that the proof that H10 was undecidable would be by a young Russian mathematician. He was proven correct when Yuri Matiyasevich supplied the missing piece needed to complete the proof.  </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
I often read `H10 was resolved by Davis-Putnam-Robinson and Matiyasevich' or sometimes they put all four names in alphabetical order. I like that--- it really was a joint effort.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
3) She was inducted (a proof by induction?) into the National Academy of Sciences in 1975.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
4) She was elected to be president of the American Math Society in 1982.  </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
5) She got a MacAuthor Fellowship prize in 1985 (Often called the MacAuthor Genius award.)</div>
<div>
At the time it was worth $60,000.  Its now $625,000.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
6) She also did work in Game Theory. Her paper An Iterative Method of Solving a Game, which is<br />
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1969530?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents">here</a>, is a proof from the book according to Paul Goldberg's comment on this post.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
7) The Julia Robinson Math Festival is named in her honor (hmmm- is that a tautology?) Its purpose is to inspire K-12 students to get involved in math. For more on it see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Robinson_Mathematics_Festival">here</a>.<br />
<br />
8) (ADDED LATER) Commenter David Williamson pointed out that Julia Robinson did work on the transportation problem. See his comment and his pointer to the paper.<br />
<br />
(ADDED LATER) When I hear <i>Julia Robinson</i> I think <i>Hilbert's 10th problem. </i> I suspect many of you do the same. However, looking at items 6 and 8 above, one realizes that she did research in non-logic branches of math as well.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
<br /></div></div>
