<p>Besides unimaginable suffering and horror, the Black Death of the 1340’s also brought increased wages and better living standards.  It came back, among other times, in 1665.  Then like now, universities closed and students went home.  Among them was Newton, who spent his time alone in the countryside thus:</p>



<p><strong>In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the method of approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity [power] of any binomial into such a series. The same year in May I found the method of tangents of Gregory and Slusius, and in November had the direct method of fluxions and the next year [1666] in January had the theory of colours and in May following I had entrance into the inverse method of fluxions. And the same year I began to think of gravity extending to the orb of the moon … All this was in the two plague years of 1665 and 1666, for in those days I was in the prime of my age for invention and minded Mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since.</strong></p>



<p>Today’s Coronavirus pandemic is probably the first in history that’s been fought with telecommunication.  People are advised to work remotely, and many universities are switching to online courses.  Besides the suffering and horror, it is also an opportunity <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2020/02/18/working-remotely-will-be-the-most-significant-transformation-since-agriculture/">to realize that many things can be done remotely just as well if not better, change our lifestyle, and stop polluting the environment.</a></p></div>

the seller knows the buyer's marginal distributions of values for each item,
but not the joint distribution, and wishes to maximize worst-case revenue over
all possible correlation structures. We devise a computationally efficient
(polynomial in the support size of the marginals) algorithm that computes the
worst-case joint distribution for any choice of item prices. And yet, in sharp
contrast to the additive buyer case (Carroll, 2017), we show that it is NP-hard
to approximate the optimal choice of prices to within any factor better than
$n^{1/2-\epsilon}$. For the special case of marginal distributions that satisfy
the monotone hazard rate property, we show how to guarantee a constant fraction
of the optimal worst-case revenue using item pricing; this pricing equates
revenue across all possible correlations and can be computed efficiently.

enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic
depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes
the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size
$n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound
deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is
superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the
dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an
earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$
and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of
bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must
have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough
integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that
$\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded
individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size
$n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof
of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure
introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].

have a bounded torsion and whose word problem is conjunctive equivalent (in
particular positive and Turing equivalent) to a given recursively enumerable
set. These groups can be interpreted as groups of finite state machines or as
subgroups of topological full groups, on effective subshifts over other torsion
groups. We define a recursion-theoretic property of a set of natural numbers,
called impredictability, which roughly states that a Turing machine can
enumerate numbers such that every Turing machine occasionally "correctly
guesses" whether they are in the language (by halting on them or not), even if
trying not to, and given an oracle for shorter identities. We prove that
impredictable recursively enumerable sets exist. Combining these constructions
and slightly adapting a result of [Salo and T\"orm\"a, 2017], we obtain that
four-headed group-walking finite-state automata can define strictly more
subshifts than three-headed automata on a group containing a copy of the
integers, confirming a conjecture of [Salo and T\"orm\"a, 2017]. These are the
first examples of groups where four heads are better than one, and they show
the maximal height of a finite head hierarchy is indeed four.

Poincar\'e-type functional graph parameter, $\lambda_\infty(G)$, of a graph
$G$, and related it to the {\em vertex expansion} of $G$ via a Cheeger-type
inequality. This is analogous to the Cheeger-type inequality relating the
spectral gap, $\lambda_2(G)$, of the graph to its {\em edge expansion}.
</p>
<p>While $\lambda_2$ can be computed efficiently, the computational complexity
of $\lambda_\infty$ has remained an open question. Following the work of the
second author with Raghavendra and Vempala, wherein the complexity of
$\lambda_\infty$ was related to the so-called Small-Set Expansion (SSE)
problem, it has been believed that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is a hard
problem. We settle this question by proving that computing $\lambda_\infty$ is
indeed NP-hard. Additionally, we use our techniques to prove NP-hardness of
computing the spread constant (of a graph), a geometric measure introduced by
Alon, Boppana, and Spencer, in the context of deriving an asymptotic
isoperimetric inequality on cartesian products of graphs.
</p>
<p>We complement our hardness results by providing approximation schemes for
computing $\lambda_\infty$ and the spread constant of star graphs, and
investigate constant approximability for weighted trees.
</p>
<p>Finally, we provide improved approximation results for the maximum variance
embedding problem for general graphs, by replacing the optimal orthogonal
projection (PCA) with a randomized projection approach.

connecting classical dynamics with data-oriented, algorithmic methods.
Combinatorial vector fields introduced by Forman and their recent
generalization to multivector fields have provided a starting point for
building such a connection. In this work, we strengthen this relationship by
placing the Conley index in the persistent homology setting. Conley indices are
homological features associated with so-called isolated invariant sets, so a
change in the Conley index is a response to perturbation in an underlying
multivector field. We show how one can use zigzag persistence to summarize
changes to the Conley index, and we develop techniques to capture such changes
in the presence of noise. We conclude by developing an algorithm to track
features in a changing multivector field.

needed to compute Functional Aggregate Queries (FAQs) studied by Abo Khamis et
al. [PODS 2016] in a synchronous distributed network under the model considered
by Chattopadhyay et al. [FOCS 2014, SODA 2017]. Unlike the recent work on
computing database queries in the Massively Parallel Computation model, in the
model of Chattopadhyay et al., nodes can communicate only via private
point-to-point channels and we are interested in bounds that work over an {\em
arbitrary} communication topology. This is the first work to consider more
practically motivated problems in this distributed model. For the sake of
exposition, we focus on two special problems in this paper: Boolean Conjunctive
Query (BCQ) and computing variable/factor marginals in Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs). We obtain tight bounds on the number of rounds needed to compute
such queries as long as the underlying hypergraph of the query is
$O(1)$-degenerate and has $O(1)$-arity. In particular, the $O(1)$-degeneracy
condition covers most well-studied queries that are efficiently computable in
the centralized computation model like queries with constant treewidth. These
tight bounds depend on a new notion of `width' (namely internal-node-width) for
Generalized Hypertree Decompositions (GHDs) of acyclic hypergraphs, which
minimizes the number of internal nodes in a sub-class of GHDs. To the best of
our knowledge, this width has not been studied explicitly in the theoretical
database literature. Finally, we consider the problem of computing the product
of a vector with a chain of matrices and prove tight bounds on its round
complexity (over the finite field of two elements) using a novel min-entropy
based argument.

polynomials that takes us one step closer to obtaining a deterministic
polynomial time algorithm for testing zeroness of
$\Sigma^{[3]}\Pi\Sigma\Pi^{[2]}$ circuits. Specifically, we prove that if a
finite set of irreducible quadratic polynomials $\mathcal{Q}$ satisfy that for
every two polynomials $Q_1,Q_2\in \mathcal{Q}$ there is a subset
$\mathcal{K}\subset \mathcal{Q}$, such that $Q_1,Q_2 \notin \mathcal{K}$ and
whenever $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ vanish then also $\prod_{i\in \mathcal{K}} Q_i$
vanishes, then the linear span of the polynomials in $\mathcal{Q}$ has
dimension $O(1)$. This extends the earlier result [Shpilka19] that showed a
similar conclusion when $|\mathcal{K}| = 1$.
</p>
<p>An important technical step in our proof is a theorem classifying all the
possible cases in which a product of quadratic polynomials can vanish when two
other quadratic polynomials vanish. I.e., when the product is in the radical of
the ideal generates by the two quadratics. This step extends a result from
[Shpilka19]that studied the case when one quadratic polynomial is in the
radical of two other quadratics.

learning tasks during the last decades, ranging from image classification and
speech recognition to natural language understanding. As an extension of deep
learning, Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to solve the non-Euclidean
problems on graph-structured data which can hardly be handled by general deep
learning techniques. Existing GNNs under various mechanisms, such as random
walk, PageRank, graph convolution, and heat diffusion, are designed for
different types of graphs and problems, which makes it difficult to compare
them directly. Previous GNN surveys focus on categorizing current models into
independent groups, lacking analysis regarding their internal connection. This
paper proposes a unified framework and provides a novel perspective that can
widely fit existing GNNs into our framework methodologically. Specifically, we
survey and categorize existing GNN models into the spatial and spectral
domains, and reveal connections among subcategories in each domain. Further
analysis establishes a strong link across the spatial and spectral domains.

graph convolutional networks (GCN), which nicely integrate local vertex
features and graph topology in the spectral domain. However, current studies
suffer from several drawbacks: (1) graph CNNs relies on Chebyshev polynomial
approximation which results in oscillatory approximation at jump
discontinuities; (2) Increasing the order of Chebyshev polynomial can reduce
the oscillations issue, but also incurs unaffordable computational cost; (3)
Chebyshev polynomials require degree $\Omega$(poly(1/$\epsilon$)) to
approximate a jump signal such as $|x|$, while rational function only needs
$\mathcal{O}$(poly log(1/$\epsilon$))\cite{liang2016deep,telgarsky2017neural}.
However, it's non-trivial to apply rational approximation without increasing
computational complexity due to the denominator. In this paper, the superiority
of rational approximation is exploited for graph signal recovering. RatioanlNet
is proposed to integrate rational function and neural networks. We show that
rational function of eigenvalues can be rewritten as a function of graph
Laplacian, which can avoid multiplication by the eigenvector matrix. Focusing
on the analysis of approximation on graph convolution operation, a graph signal
regression task is formulated. Under graph signal regression task, its time
complexity can be significantly reduced by graph Fourier transform. To overcome
the local minimum problem of neural networks model, a relaxed Remez algorithm
is utilized to initialize the weight parameters. Convergence rate of
RatioanlNet and polynomial based methods on jump signal is analyzed for a
theoretical guarantee. The extensive experimental results demonstrated that our
approach could effectively characterize the jump discontinuities, outperforming
competing methods by a substantial margin on both synthetic and real-world
graphs.

<p>
Robert Dorfman was a professor of political economy at Harvard University, who helped create the notion of group testing. </p>
<p>
Today Ken and I discuss this notion and its possible application to the current epidemic crisis. We also discuss other mathematical aspects that have clear and immediate value.</p>
<p>
The novel coronavirus (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">COVID-19</a>) is the nasty issue we all face today. I live in New York City and can see the reduced foot traffic every day. The issue is discussed every minute on the news. I hope you are all safe, and well. But we are all worried about this. </p>
<p>
The point of group testing is that it can reduce the number of tests needed to find out who has the virus. I assume that we are not using Dorfman’s idea because it does not apply to today’s testing. But it seems like it could fit. One issue is the need for more individual testing kits. As we write this, the US is still well short of the needed supply of kits. Are there situations where group testing can still help economize?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Group Testing </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Dorfman created the notion of <em>group testing</em> in 1943. You could say he was driven by the need to test light bulbs:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/test.png?w=300&amp;h=188" alt="" width="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-16781" height="188" /></a></p>
<p>As Wikipedia group-testing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing">article</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> [Suppose] one is searching for a broken bulb among six light bulbs. Here, the first three are connected to a power supply, and they light up (A). This indicates that the broken bulb must be one of the last three (B). If instead the bulbs did not light up, one could be sure that the broken bulb was among the first three. Continuing this procedure can locate the broken bulb in no more than three tests, compared to a maximum of six tests if the bulbs are checked individually. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Okay, Dorfman’s motivation was not light bulbs. It was testing soldiers during WWII for a certain disease, that will go unnamed. This type of testing reduced the number of blood samples needed. What was analogous to connecting groups of light bulbs into one circuit was combining portions of individual blood samples into one sample. If it tested negative then that entire group could be dismissed without further testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Fewer Kits </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The point of using group testing is made stark when you think about recent issues with cruise ships. On one ship there were around <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3500}" class="latex" title="{3500}" /> passengers who were eventually found to be almost all okay. I believe only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> were infected. This could have been checked by group testing with many fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3500%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3500}" class="latex" title="{3500}" /> tests. </p>
<p>
According to the current outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html">maps</a>, known <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html#us">cases</a> in the US are still fairly sparse. Those in New York are mainly in the city, Westchester, and along the Hudson River to Albany. Let’s say we wish assurance that all non-virus related admits to a hospital are free of the virus. Can group testing apply?</p>
<p>
The original version of group testing would apply if it were deemed mandatory that all new admits give a blood sample. Some kinds of coronavirus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing">test kits</a> use blood samples. Taking blood samples might however be as costly and intrusive as having the individual tests to begin with. There are other kinds of tests involving taking swabs, but it is not apparent whether those samples can be combined at scale as readily as blood samples can.</p>
<p>
At least the <em>idea</em> of group testing has interesting connections to other parts of theory. Here is a 2000 <a href="https://www.cs.umn.edu/sites/cs.umn.edu/files/tech_reports/00-007.pdf">survey</a> by Ken’s former Buffalo colleague Hung Ngo with his PhD advisor, Ding-Zhu Du, where the application is to large scale screening of DNA samples. Hung and Ken’s colleague Atri Rudra taught a <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2011/709/">course</a> in Buffalo on group testing in relation to <em>compressed sensing</em>. More recent is a 2015 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7308980">paper</a> that tries to solve problems of counting the number of positive cases, not just whether they exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Other Mathematical Effects </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As we write, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has just declared a cap of 500 attendees for any assembly. This is forcing the suspension of Broadway shows among many other activities. Yesterday the entire SUNY system joined numerous other institutions in moving to distance-only learning after this week.  </p>
<p>
The cap is based on the likelihood of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> persons including someone who is already infected. That likelihood in turn is based on the density of known cases and what is known about the proportion of unknown to known cases. The virus has a long (two weeks) incubation time during which it is contagious but not symptomatic.</p>
<p>
Here is a graph from a PSA <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> posted just today by Alex Tabarrok for the <em>Marginal Revolution</em> blog (note that the calculations are by <a href="https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/joshua-weitz">Joshua</a> <a href="http://ecotheory.biology.gatech.edu/">Weitz</a> of Georgia Tech):</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/riskassessment-1024x776-1.jpg?w=550&amp;h=425" alt="" width="550" class="aligncenter wp-image-16782" height="425" /></a></p>
<p>
The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />-axis is the number of cases (in proportion to the US on the whole) and the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />-axis is the group size. Which axis is more important—has more effect on the danger? Tabarrok notes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Now here is the most important point. It’s the size of the group, not the number of carriers that most drives the result. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This involves comparing two partial derivatives. The <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/covid-19-event-risk-assessment-planner.html">item</a> gives a brief worked-out example without using calculus. </p>
<p>
I, Ken, have been connected this week to another example. I was statistically monitoring the World Senior Team Chess Championship, which began last Friday in Prague. Almost 500 players in teams of 4 or 5 players took part. Initially the players were roughly evenly divided between two halls. Effective Tuesday, a cap of 100 was declared for the Czech Republic, so more playing rooms were found and spectators were banned. Today, however, after an update on the density of cases in the Czech Republic, the cap was lowered to 30 effective tomorrow.  Thus the tournament was forced to finish today, two rounds earlier than planned. Even though chess events have a lower size footprint than all of the spectator sports whose seasons have been suspended in recent days, the growth of the outbreak is making cancellation the only reasonable policy for all but the smallest events.</p>
<p>
The main purpose of these and other <em>social isolation</em> measures is to flatten out the growth of cases. The target is not just to contain the outbreak but also to stay below the number of serious cases that our treatment systems can bear at once. Here is one of numerous versions of a <a href="https://healthblog.uofmhealth.org/wellness-prevention/flattening-curve-for-covid-19-what-does-it-mean-and-how-can-you-help">graphic</a> that is being widely circulated:</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/coronavirus_flattening_curve_1.jpg?w=400&amp;h=223" alt="" width="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-16783" height="223" /></a></p>
<p>
The graphic is not necessarily talking about reducing the number of cases <em>total</em>. The area under both curves is the same. A sentence in accompanying article—</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If individuals and communities take steps to slow the virus’s spread, that means the number of cases of COVID-19 will stretch out across a longer period of time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
—seems to imply that “the number of cases” is the same in both scenarios, but stretched out over time in the latter. The point is how the stretching keeps the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />-value bounded.</p>
<p>
We certainly hope that isolation can reduce that number—i.e., that containment data out of Southeast Asia in particular holds true, as opposed to fears being voiced in the West that the virus will spread to a large percentage of the population over time. See charts <a href="https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca">here</a>, especially chart 7.</p>
<p>
What governs the spreading process? This is being understood via simple mathematical models of contagion, such as come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory">percolation theory</a> and its associated <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR_0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R_0}" class="latex" title="{R_0}" /> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895684/">factor</a>. Almost a month ago, the Washington Post made an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/coronavirus-how-epidemics-spread-and-end/">interactive</a> showing how epidemics spread according to the parameters in these models. How and whether the COVID-19 pandemic follows these models remains to be seen. Of course we hope it stays on the better side of the equations.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Is group testing a practical <em>mechanism</em> for mapping and constraining the epidemic? How can we promote the understanding of mechanisms and equations and models, not only for those shaping policy but for us who must abide by it and know why.</p>

<p>Harvard University, as well most other places that I know of will be moving to remote lectures. I just gave the last in-person lecture in my <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/schedule/">cryptography course</a>. I would appreciate technical suggestions on the best format for teaching remotely. At the moment I plan to use Zoom and log-in from both my laptop (for the video) and from my iPad pro (for the interactive whiteboard).  </p>



<p>The one silver lining is that more lectures will be available online. In particular, if you’re teaching algorithms, you might find <a href="https://gt-algorithms.com/">Eric Vigoda’s videos helpful</a>. (If you know of more sources, please let us know.)</p>



<p>I was hoping that reducing meetings and activities will be good for research, but currently find it hard to concentrate on anything except this train-wreck of a situation. The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff3affea-63c7-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5">financial times</a> has a chart that summarizes the progress of the  disease in several countries:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/http___com.ft_.imagepublish.upp-prod-us.s3.amazonaws.png?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-7646" /></figure>



<p>The number of confirmed cases grows by about 33% each day. This growth in confirmed cases is partially due to increased testing  as cases increase – there is <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext">some evidence</a>  that the doubling time of the disease (time between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> infected people to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="2n" class="latex" title="2n" /> infected) is about 6 days (rather than the 2.4 days that this figure suggest). However, a doubling time of 6 days still means that the number of cases grows 10-fold in a month, and so if there are 10K actual cases in the U.S., today, there would be 100K by mid April and 1M by mid May.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Strong quarantine regimes, contact tracing, and drastically reducing activity and increasing “social distance” can very significantly reduce the base of this exponent. Reducing the base of the exponent is more than simply “delaying the inevitable”. The mortality statistics mask the fact that this can be a very serious illness even for the people who don’t die of it – about 5% of the cases need intensive care (see this <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/12/covid-19-is-rapidly-spreading-in-america-the-country-does-not-look-ready">Economist article</a>). Spreading the infections over time will enable the healthcare system to handle the increased caseload, which will completely overwhelm it otherwise.</p>



<p>Such steps are clearly much easier to achieve before the number of cases is too large to be manageable, but despite having “advance warning” from other countries, this lesson does not seem at the moment to have sunk in, at least here in the U.S. At the moment no such initiatives are taken at the federal level, the states are doing more but still not enough, and it’s up to private companies and institutions to come up with their own policies. As faculty and citizens there is not much we can do about it except support such decisions even when they are <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/12/parents-petition-coronavirus-measure/">unpopular</a>, and just try to make the remote experience as good as possible for us, our colleagues, and our students.</p></div>

Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.

  In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].</div>

Even if we could completely recreate the conference experience in virtual reality, people would not hang out in the halls without the commitment of having made the physical trip. I made this point in a tweet with a depressing response.<br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<div lang="en" dir="ltr">
At least in CS theory, I don't see any crucial importance. These days it's easy to follow the latest developments online. If you're interested in someone's work, you just email them and start a collaboration. Sooner or later networking in hallways may become a thing of the past.</div>

I don't disagree with anything Mahdi says except for the "crucial importance". Great ideas come from chance encounters and random conversations. Many of my research papers would never have happened if not for a conversation had at a conference or on the plane or train rides that took me there. Harken Gilles Brassard's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604072">origin story</a> of quantum cryptography.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
One fine afternoon in late October 1979, I was swimming at the beach of a posh
hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Imagine my surprise when this complete stranger
swims up to me and starts telling me, without apparent provocation on my part,
about Wiesner’s quantum banknotes! This was probably the most bizarre, and
certainly the most magical, moment in my professional life<sup>6</sup>. Within hours, we had
found ways to mesh Wiesner’s coding scheme with some of the then-new concepts
of public-key cryptography.... The ideas that Bennett and I tossed around on the beach that day resulted
in the first paper ever published on quantum cryptography, indeed the paper
in which the term “Quantum Cryptography” was coined. </blockquote>
And Footnote 6 read as follows.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
At the risk of taking some of the magic away, I must confess that it was not by accident that
Bennett and I were swimming at the same beach in Puerto Rico. We were both there for the

me because I was scheduled to give a talk on relativized cryptography on the last day of the
Symposium and he thought I might be interested in Wiesner’s ideas. By an amazing coincidence,
on my way to San Juan, I had read Martin Gardner’s account of Bennett’s report on
Chaitin’s Omega, which had just appeared in the November 1979 “Mathematical Games” column
of Scientific American—so, I knew the name but I could not recognize Bennett in that swimmer
because I did not know what he looked like.</blockquote>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p><strong>Scott’s foreword:</strong> This week Steve Ebin, a longtime <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> reader (and occasional commenter) from the San Francisco tech world, sent me the essay below.  Steve’s essay fit too well with my own recent thoughts, and indeed with this blog’s title, for me not to offer to share it here—and to my surprise and gratitude, Steve agreed.</p>



<p>I guess there are only two things I’d add to what Steve wrote.  First, some commenters took me to task for a misplaced emphasis in <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4671">my last coronavirus post</a>, and on further reflection, I now concede that they were right.  When a preventable catastrophe strikes the world, what’s always terrified me most are <em>not</em> the ranting lunatics and conspiracy theorists, even if some of those lunatics actually managed to attain the height of power, from where they played a central role in the catastrophe.  No, what’s terrified me more are the blank-faced bureaucrats who’ve signed the paperwork that amounted to death warrants.  Like, for example, the state regulators who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/us/coronavirus-testing-delays.html?referringSource=articleShare">ordered the Seattle infectious disease expert to stop</a>, after she’d had enough of the government’s failure to allow corona tests, took it upon herself to start testing anyway, and found lots of positive results.  Notably, only some countries have empowered lunatics, but the blank-faced bureaucrats rule everywhere unless something stronger overrides them.</p>



<p>Second, I’ll forever ask myself what went wrong with me, that it took me until metaphorical 1939 to acknowledge the scale of an unfolding catastrophe (on more than a purely intellectual level)—even while others were trying to tell me way back in metaphorical 1933.  Even so, better metaphorical 1939 than metaphorical 1946.</p>



<p><strong>Without further ado, Steve’s essay:</strong></p>



<p>The most expensive meal I ever ate was in San Francisco at a restaurant called Eight Tables. As the name implies, the restaurant has only eight tables. The meal cost $1,000 and featured 12 courses, prepared by award-winning chefs.</p>



<p>The most expensive meal a person ever ate was in late 2019, in China, and consisted of under-cooked bat meat. It cost trillions of dollars. The person who ate it, possibly a peasant, changed the course of the 21st century. The bat he ate contained a virus, and the virus threatened to spread from this man to the rest of humanity.</p>



<p>I’m making up some details, of course. Maybe the man wasn’t a peasant. Or he could have been a woman. Or the bat could have been a pangolin. Or maybe, through a lucky accident (the guy was a loner perhaps), it could have not spread. That could have happened, but it didn’t. Or maybe sometimes that does happen and we don’t know it. These are just accidents of history.</p>



<p>I’m writing this on March 9, 2020. The good news is that the virus, in its current form, doesn’t kill children. I am so thankful for that. The bad news is that the virus does kill adults. The virus is like a grim reaper, culling the sick, the debilitated, and the elderly from the population. It attacks the pulmonary system. I heard a 25-year-old survivor describing how he became unable to control his breathing and could not fall asleep or he would die. Even for healthy young people, the prognosis is often poor. </p>



<p>There were Jews in Europe in the 1930s who sat around tables with the elders of their families and villages and debated whether to leave for America, or Palestine, or South America. Most of them, including my grandmother’s family, didn’t leave, and were largely exterminated. The virus of the time was Nazism, and it too attacked the pulmonary systems of the old and the debilitated, in that case with poisonous gasses.</p>



<p>When you grow up as I did, you are taught to have a paranoia in the back of your mind that there is a major disaster about to happen. That a holocaust, or something of that magnitude, might occur in your lifetime. And so you are never complacent. For your whole life, you’re looking and waiting for a history changing event. You try to ensure that you are willing to follow your thoughts to their logical conclusion and take the necessary actions as a result, unlike many of the Jews of 1930s Europe, who refused to confront the obstacle in front of them until it was too late, and unlike many politicians and world leaders today, who are doing the same.</p>



<p>And the conclusion we must now confront is clear. We are watching a once-in-a-century event unfold. Coronavirus–its mutations, its spawn–will change the course of human history. It will overwhelm our defense system and may kill millions. It may continue to mutate and kill millions more. We will develop painful social measures to slow its spread. We will produce vaccines and better treatment protocols. Some of this will help, but none of this will work perfectly. What will happen to society as this unfolds?</p>



<p>My favorite biblical verse comes from Ecclesiastes: To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. A time to be born, and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to pluck that which is planted. And so on.</p>



<p>The season has changed, and the seven years of famine have begun.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In this paper, we are interested in understanding the complexity of computing multilinear polynomials using depth four circuits in which polynomial computed at every node has a bound on the individual degree of $r$ (referred to as multi-$r$-ic circuits). The goal of this study is to make progress towards proving superpolynomial lower bounds for general depth four circuits computing multilinear polynomials, by proving better and better bounds as the value of $r$ increases.
	
  Recently, Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018) showed that any depth four arithmetic circuit of bounded individual degree $r$ computing a multilinear polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $d=o(n)$, must have size at least $\left(\frac{n}{r^{1.1}}\right)^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{r}}\right)}$ when $r$ is $o(d)$ and is strictly less than $n^{1.1}$. This bound however deteriorates with increasing $r$. It is a natural question to ask if we can prove a bound that does not deteriorate with increasing $r$ or a bound that holds for a "larger" regime of $r$.

  We here prove a lower bound which does not deteriorate with $r$, however for a specific instance of $d = d(n)$ but for a wider range of $r$. Formally, we show that there exists an explicit polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ such that any depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $r&lt;n^{0.2}$ must have size at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^2 n))$. This improvement is obtained by suitably adapting the complexity measure of Kayal et al. (Theory of Computing, 2018). This adaptation of the measure is inspired by the complexity measure used by Kayal et al. (SIAM J. Computing, 2017).</div>

vertex-colored interval graphs, namely \emph{$f$-Balanced Independent Set}
($f$-BIS) and \emph{$f$-Balanced Dominating Set} ($f$-BDS). Let $G=(V,E)$ be a
vertex-colored interval graph with a $k$-coloring $\gamma \colon V \rightarrow
\{1,\ldots,k\}$ for some $k \in \mathbb N$. A subset of vertices $S\subseteq V$
is called \emph{$f$-balanced} if $S$ contains $f$ vertices from each color
class. In the $f$-BIS and $f$-BDS problems, the objective is to compute an
independent set or a dominating set that is $f$-balanced. We show that both
problems are \NP-complete even on proper interval graphs. For the BIS problem
on interval graphs, we design two \FPT\ algorithms, one parameterized by
$(f,k)$ and the other by the vertex cover number of $G$. Moreover, we present a
2-approximation algorithm for a slight variation of BIS on proper interval
graphs.

be solved in time $2^{\mathcal O(\ell k^3\log k + k^5\log k\log\ell)}\cdot

parameterized by $k$ and $\ell$. This algorithm can be seen as a far-reaching
generalization of the fixed-parameter tractability of {\sc Mixed Graph Feedback
Vertex Set} [Bonsma and Lokshtanov WADS 2011], which is already a common
generalization of the fixed-parameter tractability of (undirected) {\sc

classic results in parameterized algorithms. The algorithm requires significant
insights into the structure of graphs without directed cycles length longer

initially given only one side of the vertex set of a bipartite graph; the
vertices on the other side are revealed to the algorithm one by one, along with
its incident edges. The algorithm is required to maintain a matching in the
current graph, where the algorithm revises the matching after each vertex
arrival by reassigning vertices. Bernstein, Holm, and Rotenberg showed that an
online algorithm can maintain a matching of maximum cardinality by performing
amortized $O(\log^2 n)$ reassignments per arrival.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose to consider the general question of how requiring a
non-amortized hard budget $k$ on the number of reassignments affects the
algorithms' performances, under various models from the literature.
</p>
<p>We show that a simple, widely-used algorithm is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm for all these models. For the unweighted maximum-cardinality problem,
the algorithm is a $(1-\frac{2}{k+2})$-competitive algorithm, which is the best
possible for a deterministic algorithm both under vertex arrivals and edge
arrivals. Applied to the load balancing problem, this yields a bifactor online
algorithm. For the weighted problem, which is traditionally studied assuming
the triangle inequality, we show that the power of reassignment allows us to
lift this assumption and the algorithm becomes a $\frac{1}{2}$-competitive
algorithm for $k=4$, improving upon the $\frac{1}{3}$ of the previous algorithm
without reassignments. We show that this also is a best-possible deterministic
algorithm.

magical combat. Recently, several authors including Chatterjee and Ibsen-Jensen
(2016) and Churchill, Biderman, and Herrick (2019) have investigated the
computational complexity of playing Magic optimally. In this paper we show that
the ``mate-in-$n$'' problem for Magic is $\Delta^0_n$-hard and that optimal
play in two-player Magic is non-arithmetic in general. These results apply to
how real Magic is played, can be achieved using standard-size tournament legal
decks, and do not rely on stochasticity or hidden information. Our paper builds
upon the construction that Churchill, Biderman, and Herrick (2019) used to show
that this problem was at least as hard as the halting problem.

dimension of very high-dimensional tensors. Building upon classical results on
Gaussian random projections and Johnson-Lindenstrauss transforms~(JLT), we
propose two tensorized random projection maps relying on the tensor train~(TT)
and CP decomposition format, respectively. The two maps offer very low memory
requirements and can be applied efficiently when the inputs are low rank
tensors given in the CP or TT format. Our theoretical analysis shows that the
dense Gaussian matrix in JLT can be replaced by a low-rank tensor implicitly
represented in compressed form with random factors, while still approximately
preserving the Euclidean distance of the projected inputs. In addition, our
results reveal that the TT format is substantially superior to CP in terms of
the size of the random projection needed to achieve the same distortion ratio.
Experiments on synthetic data validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate
the superiority of the TT decomposition.

cutting plane (CP) algorithms for mixed-integer optimization. In particular, we
study the relative efficiency of BB and CP, when both are based on the same
family of disjunctions. We extend a result of Dash to the nonlinear setting
which shows that for convex 0/1 problems, CP does at least as well as BB, with
variable disjunctions. We sharpen this by giving instances of the stable set
problem where we can provably establish that CP does exponentially better than
BB. We further show that if one moves away from 0/1 sets, this advantage of CP
over BB disappears; there are examples where BB finishes in O(1) time, but CP
takes infinitely long to prove optimality, and exponentially long to get to
arbitrarily close to the optimal value (for variable disjunctions). We next
show that if the dimension is considered a fixed constant, then the situation
reverses and BB does at least as well as CP (up to a polynomial blow up), no
matter which family of disjunctions is used. This is also complemented by
examples where this gap is exponential (in the size of the input data).

daily life of end-users by providing several value-added services. However, IoT
systems may capture and store sensitive, personal data about individuals in the
cloud, thereby jeopardizing user-privacy. Emerging legislation, such as
California's CalOPPA and GDPR in Europe, support strong privacy laws to protect
an individual's data in the cloud. One such law relates to strict enforcement
of data retention policies. This paper proposes a framework, entitled IoT
Expunge that allows sensor data providers to store the data in cloud platforms
that will ensure enforcement of retention policies. Additionally, the cloud
provider produces verifiable proofs of its adherence to the retention policies.
Experimental results on a real-world smart building testbed show that IoT
Expunge imposes minimal overheads to the user to verify the data against data
retention policies.

Nisan showed in 1991 that the width of a smallest noncommutative single-(source,sink) algebraic branching program (ABP) to compute a noncommutative polynomial is given by the ranks of specific matrices. This means that the set of noncommutative polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is Zariski-closed, an important property in geometric complexity theory. It follows that approximations cannot help to reduce the required ABP width.

It was mentioned by Forbes that this result would probably break when going from single-(source,sink) ABPs to trace ABPs. We prove that this is correct. Moreover, we study the commutative monotone setting and prove a result similar to Nisan, but concerning the analytic closure. We observe the same behavior here: The set of polynomials with ABP width complexity at most $k$ is closed for single-(source,sink) ABPs and not closed for trace ABPs. The proofs reveal an intriguing connection between tangent spaces and the vector space of flows on the ABP.
We close with additional observations on VQP and the closure of VNP which allows us to establish a separation between the two classes.</div>

<p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/07/20/updated-python-library.html">My first post on this blog</a>, lo these nearly 15 years ago, discussed a program I had written to try to solve Sudoku puzzles deductively (rather than by the easier computational method, backtracking), with the goal of being able to automatically grade the puzzles and automatically generate explanations for how to solve a given puzzle. And a few months later I posted again, on <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2005/10/15/assuming-uniqueness-in.html">deduction rules that take advantage of the assumption that a puzzle has a unique solution</a>, by ruling out choices that would cause any solution consistent with them to become non-unique. Since then, that part of my solver has been relatively stable, although I have added other rules for <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2012/02/23/solving-single-digit-sudoku.html">Nishio</a> and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2009/04/26/sudoku-and-2sat.html">2SAT</a> and posted here about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/07/28/any-order-puzzle.html">more general uniqueness deduction rules in map-coloring puzzles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve also occasionally been using my program to generate puzzles for me to work on, and today it found an interesting test case, a puzzle that it thought would be much more difficult than it turned out to be for me. This mis-rating happened because the uniqueness deduction rules I’m using in my own deductions are stronger than the ones in my program (although some of its other rules are stronger than I typically apply myself). In its initial state, the puzzle looks like:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-givens.svg" alt="Sudoku puzzle" /></p>

<p>My program tells me that it’s at the second highest level of difficulty that it knows about: it has to resort to using 2SAT, but it can successfully solve it that way. (The highest level is for puzzles where it is forced to use backtracking.) Usually, for me, puzzles at that level require me to use written notes to keep track of the deductions, rather than doing it all in my head, but not this time. Using more-or-less standard reasoning, one can fill in the cells of the puzzle to reach the state:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-partial.svg" alt="Partially solved Sudoku puzzle" /></p>

<p>This is where my program gets stuck and has to resort to more powerful deduction rules. But as a human solving this puzzle, here is what I see: In row 3, the two empty cells must contain the pair of digits 3 and 5. In the center right block of nine cells, the two empty cells must again be 3 and 5. And in the center block of cells, the 5 digit is confined to three cells aligned with those two pairs of empty cells. If the 3 digit were also confined to the same three cells in the center block, it and the five would have to occupy the two diagonally aligned cells out of the three, because otherwise they would line up and prevent one of the other pairs of 3-5 cells from having any value. But then the 3-5 cells in row 3, the center block, and column 7 would form a closed system (shown by the red squares below): nothing else outside those cells could affect which of those six cells contains 3, and which contains 5. Within that closed system, there are two solutions, obtained from each other by swapping the locations of the 3 and the 5. But that would violate the assumption of uniqueness.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2020/ambig-sudoku-closed.svg" alt="Closed system of cells in a partially solved Sudoku puzzle" /></p>

<p>Even if the 7 in the center cell weren’t there, the same reasoning would apply. Since this closed system with a non-unique solution would happen automatically if we confine the digit 3 to the same three center-block cells as the digit 5, the digit 3 must be elsewhere in the center block, which can only mean that it is in column 4. Once we make this deduction, the rest of the puzzle falls into place.</p>

<p>My program only has built into it a couple of ad-hoc rules to prevent closed systems of four cells with two solutions, and it misses the one in this example because it involves six cells. It’s making me think that I need a more general description of the possible closed systems (at least the ones involving only two digit values, like this), in order to match the deductions I’m making by hand and make my program’s difficulty estimates more accurate.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>In this blog’s now 15-year-history, at Waterloo and then MIT and now UT Austin, I’ve tried to make it clear that I blog <em>always</em> as Scott, never as Dr. Aaronson of Such-and-Such Institution.  (God knows I’ve written a few things that a prudent dean might prefer that I hadn’t—though if I couldn’t honestly say that, in what sense would I even enjoy “academic freedom”?)  Today, though, for <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3167">only about</a> the second time, I’m also writing as a professor motivated by a duty of care toward his students.</p>



<p>A week ago, most of my grad students were in the Bay Area for a workshop; they then returned and spent a week hanging around the CS building like normal.  Yesterday I learned that at least one of those students developed symptoms consistent with covid19.  Of course, it’s much more likely to be a boring cold or flu—but still, in any sane regime, just to be certain, such a person would <strong>promptly get tested</strong>.</p>



<p>After quarantining himself, my student called the “24/7 covid19 hotline” listed in an email from the university’s president, but found no one answering the phone over the weekend.  Yesterday he finally got through—only to be told, flatly, that he couldn’t be tested due to insufficient capacity.  When I heard this, I asked my department chair and dean to look into the matter, and received confirmation that yeah, it sucks, but this is the situation.</p>



<p>If it’s true that, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/coronavirus-testing-new-york.html?fbclid=IwAR24o0pcDW2n6usYpyIC-bPhGUhoIkYAcvS_R4QvPv8yEdp0KsEF1XJWQv8">as I’ve read</a>, the same story is currently playing itself out all over the country, then this presumably isn’t the fault of anyone in UT’s health service or the city of Austin.  Rather, as they say in the movies, it goes all the way to the top, to the CDC director and ultimately the president—or rather, to the festering wound that now sits where the top used to be.</p>


<p>Speaking of movies, over the weekend Dana and I watched <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Contagion-Marion-Cotillard/dp/B006IVBSBU">Contagion</a>, as apparently many people are now doing.  I confess that I’d missed it when it came out in 2011.  I think it’s a cinematic masterpiece.  It freely violates many of the rules of movie narrative: characters are neither done in by their own hubris, nor saved by their faith or by being A-list stars.  But <em>Contagion</em> is also more than a glorified public service announcement about the importance of washing your hands.  It wants to show you the reality of the human world of its characters, and <em>also</em> the reality of a virus, and how the two realities affect each other despite obeying utterly different logic.  It will show a scene that’s important to the charaters for human reasons, and then it will show you the same scene again, except this time making you focus on whose hand touched which surface in which order.<br /></p>
<p>But for all its excellence and now-obvious prescience, there are two respects in which Contagion failed to predict the reality of 2020.  The first is just a lucky throw of the RNA dice: namely, that the real coronavirus is perhaps an order of magnitude less fatal than the movie virus, and for some unknown reason it spares children.  But the second difference is terrifying.  All the public health authorities in the movie are ultra-empowered and competent.  They do badass things like injecting themselves with experimental vaccines.  If they stumble, it’s only in deeply understandable ways that any of us might (e.g., warning their own loved ones to evacuate a city before warning the public).</p>
<p>In other words, when the scriptwriters, writing their disaster movie, tried to imagine the worst, they failed to imagine a US government that would essentially abandon the public, by</p>
<p>(1) botching a simple test that dozens of other countries performed without issue,<br />(2) preventing anyone else from performing their own tests, and then<br />(3) turning around and using the lack of positive test results to justify its own inaction.</p>
<p>They failed to imagine a CDC that might as well not exist for all it would do in its hour of need: one that <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1236967513008877568">didn’t even bother to update its website on weekends</a>, and stopped publishing data once the data became too embarrassing.  The scriptwriters <em>did</em> imagine a troll gleefully spreading lies about the virus online, endangering anyone who listened to him.  They failed to imagine a universe where that troll was the president.</p>


<p>“I mean, don’t get me wrong,” they told me.  “Trump is a racist con artist, a demagogue, the precise thing that Adams and Hamilton and Franklin tried to engineer our republic to avoid.  Just, don’t get so <em>depressed</em> about it all the time!  Moaning about how we’re trapped in a <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3294">freakishly horrible</a> branch of the wavefunction, blah blah.  I mean look on the bright side!  What an incredible run of luck we’ve had, that we elected a president with the mental horizons of a sadistic toddler, and yet <em>in three years he hasn’t caused even one apocalypse</em>.  You’re alive and healthy, your loved ones are alive and healthy.  It could be a lot worse!”</p>



<p>The above, I suspect, is a sentiment that will now forever date any writing containing it to January 2020 or earlier.</p></div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/03/theorist-paul-r-young-passed-away.html">Theorist Paul R Young passed away</a></h3>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
In the early days of theoretical computer science, say 1960-1990 the main tools used were logic.<br />
This made sense since, early on:<br />
<br />
a) Some of the basic notions like DTIME(T(n)), P, NP used Turing Machines in their definitions<br />
<br />
b) Some of the basic notions like reductions were modeled after similar concepts in<br />
computability theory.<br />
<br />
One of the people who did much work in the interface between Logic and TCS was Paul Young.<br />
He <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2020/03/05/remembering-paul-young-1936-2019/">passed away</a> in December. Here are some highlights of his work:<br />
<br />
1) One of the first books that covered both computability and complexity:<br />
<br />
An Introduction to the general theory of Algorithms<br />
by Machtey and Young.<br />
<br />
2) In Computability theory all many-one complete sets are computably isomorphic. Berman and<br />
Hartmanis conjectured that the poly-many-one degree of the NP-complete sets was the same. This<br />
would mean that all NP-complete sets were poly-isom (all of the known ones are).<br />
<br />
Mahaney and Young in the paper<br />
<br />
<i>Reductions Among Polynomial Isomorphism Types</i><br />
<br />
showed that every many-one poly degree either has one degree or has an infinite number of<br />
degrees in a very complicated way.<br />
<br />
3) Recall that a <i>Cook Reduction from A to B </i>allows many queries to B, whereas a <i>Karp Reduction</i><br />
only allows one query and your answer must be the same sense as the query.<br />
Are there  cases where a Cook reduction is faster? Yes, from the paper<br />
<br />
<i>Cook reducibility is faster than Karp Reducibility</i><br />
<br />
by Longpre and Young<br />
<br />
(The original title was going to be <i>Cook is Faster than Karp</i>, but it was changed since it invoked<br />
images of Cook and Karp in a footrace.  Hmmm. Which one would be faster?)<br />
<br />
<br />
4) The <i>Boolean Hierarchy </i>is a hierarchy of iterations of NP sets. What if instead of starting with P<br />
one started with RP (Randomized Poly time). What an intriguing notion! To find out read<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Generalized Boolean Hierarchies over RP</i><br />
<br />
by  Alberto Bertoni, Danilo Bruschi, Deborah Joseph, Meera Sitharam, Paul Young<br />
<br />
5) There are many more, mostly on the theme of the interaction of logic and computer science.<br />
<br />
                       I saw him speak on some of these topics and was inspired by how much one could<br />
take notions of computability and translate them into complexity theory.  The field has gone in a<br />
different direction since then (more combinatorial) but we still use many of the basic concepts<br />
like reducibility.  As such we all owe a debit to Paul Young.</div>

We study the algorithmic problem of multiplying large matrices that are rectangular. We prove that the method that has been used to construct the fastest algorithms for rectangular matrix multiplication cannot give optimal algorithms. In fact, we prove a precise numerical barrier for this method. Our barrier improves the previously known barriers, both in the numerical sense, as well as in its generality. We prove our result using the asymptotic spectrum of tensors. More precisely, we crucially make use of two families of real tensor parameters with special algebraic properties: the quantum functionals and the support functionals. In particular, we prove that any lower bound on the dual exponent of matrix multiplication $\alpha$ via the big Coppersmith-Winograd tensors cannot exceed 0.625.</div>

<p>As the coronavirus epidemic advances in Italy with a 25-30% growth rate (meaning that the numbers are doubling every 3-4 days), and after two weeks of “lockdown-lite” in Northern Italy seems to have made no difference, the Italian government imposed on Sunday morning a stricter lockdown on the region of Lombardy and some cities outside the region including Venice. Several people have reached out to ask how things are going, so here is a brief recap. </p>
<p><span id="more-4322"></span></p>
<p>First of all, I would like to give a shoutout to Taiwan, which is currently the country that has done the <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/other/pieces/how-taiwan-managed-to-avoid-a-coronavirus-outbreak/">best job stopping an outbreak</a>. The Taiwanese have several things going for them: the SARS scare made the government plan for the next epidemic, instead of making it up as it would go along, and their preparedness was impressive. The plan focused on isolation, contact-tracing, and people being careful: kudos to the Taiwanese for how well they complied. From the little that I have learned about Taiwan after living there for two months a couple of years ago, the Taiwanese are not rule-followers the way the Swiss or the Singaporean can be. But if they bend or break rules, they do that after a lot of consideration for how this impacts others. Basically, people <i>care about strangers</i>, a disposition that helps a lot in controlling an epidemic (and which is not a big part of the Italian national mood).</p>
<p>But let’s talk about me. This is my mood right now:<br />
<img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/self_isolate.png?w=584" alt="self_isolate" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4326" /></p>
<p>(Image credit: <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> by Randall Munroe)</p>
<p>Since we are past isolation-and-contact-tracing, the main goal is to reduce person-to-person contact so that we can stop the exponential growth. For the past two weeks, besides the usual recommendations (do not kiss hello and goodbye, do not shake hands, wash hands frequently, do not touch your face) the government recommended keeping a one-meter distance from other people. There has been some inventive ways to keep going under these requirements. For example cinemas (in the regions in which they were not required to shut down) sold tickets for at most a third of the seats, asking people to leave two empty seats between any occupied seats. </p>
<p>Last Saturday, before the newest set of regulations were in place, I went out for a drink. The bar had cordoned off the counter area</p>
<p> <img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/img_9383.jpg?w=584" alt="IMG_9383" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4328" /></p>
<p>They asked everybody who came in to seat down, at one of a few well-separated tables. Gloves-wearing servers took orders and brought some food (instead of the usual buffet). Once all tables were taken, a server stood outside preventing other people from coming in.</p>
<p>As we were drinking our aperitivi at a safe distance from each other, news began to leak of the new measures, which the government eventually announced at 2am Sunday morning. The leak suggested that Lombardy, Venice, and other places, would be included in the so-called <i>red zone</i>, which was a group of small towns that had been completely isolated for the past two weeks (nobody could go in and out except ambulances, trash collection trucks, and deliveries). In a development that might not have happened in Taiwan, a few hundred people rushed to train stations in Milan and Venice to flee South.</p>
<p>The actual regulations allowed travel in and out of the places affected by the new lockdown, but only for <i>demonstrated work or health reasons</i>. This is what the regulation said, but how would people prove their reason? The Italian genius for bureaucracy started cranking in the next few hours, and now, at train stations, people are required to sign an affidavit stating the existence of such a reason before boarding a train:</p>
<p><img src="https://lucatrevisan.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/affidavit.jpeg?w=584" alt="affidavit" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4329" /></p>
<p>In the locked-down cities, all bars and restaurants have to close by 6pm, and all places where people may congregate (including churches, gyms, swimming pools, in addition to museums, schools and universities which were already closed) are closed all day. Even funeral and weddings are banned. Grocery stores will have to ensure that people stay within a meter of each other, making people wait outside and enter in small groups if necessary.</p>
<p>What about me? I am procrastinating on writing blog posts about online optimization and on reviewing papers for ICALP, I have started reading William Gibson’s latest novel <i>Agency</i> and watching the tv series <i>Pose</i>, and I am cooking every meal. Considering that I like to sleep and that I am spending a fair amount of time on the phone, I have got the whole day covered.</p>
<p>What is next? At this point in Lombardy about a person in 2,500, or 0.04% of the population, is infected, and we have run out of ICU beds. The rate of infection in Wuhan peaked at about 0.6% of the population, and this was well past the point at which they had run out of hospital beds in general. Hopefully, here we will peak well below that. On the other hand, left to its own devices, in the absence of any containment measures, I have seen estimates that the disease would peak a bit higher than a flu epidemic, at 20% or even 60% of the population.</p>
<p>So, find the Taiwanese in yourself, think about others, and wash those hands.</p></div>

<p>
Maryam Aliakbarpour and Sandeep Silwal are PhD students at MIT. They have a joint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Testing Properties of Multiple Distributions with Few Samples.” Aliakbarpour is advised by Ronitt Rubinfeld. Silwal has a different advisor, Piotr Indyk. Could we test which advisor is better by sampling? Haha, not a chance…</p>
<p>
Today we will discuss this paper as an example of the power of computer science theory.<br />
<span id="more-16767"></span></p>
<p>
Aliakbarpour and Silwal (AS) prove results on property testing, which is of course a long studied area in statistics, in mathematics, and in complexity theory. Many problems of property testing are open; many are very hard problems, and some are really impossible—such as distinguishing slight differences between distributions. With all due respect, the brilliance of their paper is not in solving open problems. Rather it is how they modify property testing in a novel manner. </p>
<p>
Their proofs are clever, are technically strong, but we feel more importantly is how they change the problems. That is, they show how to add a new constraint to property testing, where: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The constraint is reasonable and appears to be natural; <p></p>
</li><li>
The constraint is powerful and allows efficient algorithms where previously none were possible.
</li></ol>
<p>Let’s look at this more closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Opening a Closed Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We all know about open problems and closed problems. There are however two kinds of closed problems: ones that have been settled and ones that have been proved impossible to settle. We also know that one can often take an open problem and define a meaningful subcase of it that can be solved. What may be less obvious is how one can do the same with the latter kind of closed problem.</p>
<p>
The work of AS is a perfect example of this phenomenon. They take a problem that is unsolvable and change it to one that is solvable. The details of their results are less important than their change to the underlying problem. One of the key insights throughout theory is that we often have made major progress by changing the ground rules. The AS work is a particularly clear case of this. </p>
<p></p><h2> The New Condition </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
AS call it the <i>structural condition</i>. They postulate a consistency type of condition on property testing. Suppose that one is interesting in testing whether or not a collection of slot-machines are fair. That is, are they set to cheat players or not? This is known to be hard to do with few tests. But after adding their new constraint it becomes quite efficient.</p>
<p>
Among some examples to convey their definition, they postulate a row of slot machines in a casino that are supposed to give the same distribution of prizes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" /> with known <em>fair</em> probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%28j%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(j)}" class="latex" title="{q(j)}" />. As usual with property testing we want to distinguish between two hypotheses that are some distance apart: one that the machines conform to the fair distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> and an alternative hypothesis that each is far from fair. There are two relevant factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
We do not get to make many tests on one machine of our choosing. The best we can do is watch people try the machines. They may try different machines and so give only a few sample results per machine. <p></p>
</li><li>
There are cases of this situation 1 where although each machine is far from fair the joint distribution of a few samples cannot be told apart from fair. The authors mention a trivial case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is uniform and we get just one result from each machine, results all different from each other. These cannot be told apart. But there are less-trivial cases.
</li></ol>
<p>
Such situations are common with real-word data. The authors mention cases of medical data when one gets just one or a few blood readings from patients with disparate situational factors that can bias their samples. The joint effect of the biases may completely mask the systematic population tendency one is trying to test for. This is the setting in which the problem of distinguishing has been regarded as impossible, case closed. In the slot-machine example, Aliakbarpour and Silwal state their structural condition informally as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Our goal is to test whether all the machines were fair … or they are far from being fair. In this case, we can naturally assume that if the machines are unfair, the house will assign a lower probability to the expensive prizes, and higher probability to cheap ones. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Of course, the house <em>could</em> cheat players without cheating in this uniform manner. More subtle rigging of the machines in different ways could mask the lowered expectation. But what AS are saying is: <i>Provided the house cheats in this consistent manner, then they can be discovered quickly</i>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Formal Definition and Proof Idea </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The formal definition is that each of the true source distributions is biased the same way in the same components as the expected (“fair”) distribution:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 1</b> <em> A sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E1%2C%5Cdots%2C+p%5Em%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" class="latex" title="{p^1,\dots, p^m}" /> of distributions on a discrete domain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" /> obeys the structural condition relative to the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> if there is a subset <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%5Csubset+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A \subset [n]}" class="latex" title="{A \subset [n]}" /> such that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi+%5Cin+%5Bm%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i \in [m]}" class="latex" title="{i \in [m]}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj+%5Cin+%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j \in [n]}" class="latex" title="{j \in [n]}" />: </em></p><em>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cbegin%7Bcases%7D+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cgeq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Bif+%7D+j+%5Cin+A%5C%5C+p%5Ei%28j%29+%5Cleq+q%28j%29+%26+%5Ctext%7Botherwise%7D.+%5Cend%7Bcases%7D+&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \begin{cases} p^i(j) \geq q(j) &amp; \text{if } j \in A\\ p^i(j) \leq q(j) &amp; \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} " /></p>
</em><p><em></em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The term “structural condition” is vanilla and perhaps saying the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> are “conformally biased” relative to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> would be more descriptive. A major point which the authors emphasize right afterward is that the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> is <em>unknown</em>. There are exponentially many possibilities for what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> could be—so we cannot try to guess it. Rather, proofs using this condition need to exploit how all the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5E%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^{i}}" class="latex" title="{p^{i}}" /> distributions conform to the same <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. The slot-machine example arguably does not reflect this point in full—because we can know in advance what the major and minor prizes of a slot machine are (including “no prize” among the latter). The medical-data examples and others certainly do, however.</p>
<p>
We can convey briefly and intuitively how this condition is used for the case where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> is uniform distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" />—which is quite general as testing for many distributions can be efficiently mapped into this case. A key property of uniform distribution is that among all distributions on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Bn%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[n]}" class="latex" title="{[n]}" />, it minimizes the probability of getting <em>collisions</em> from repeated samples. This idea has yielded the most effective test statistics for problems when there is only one distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />. When there are multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> the effectiveness can be blunted in instances like the one in the previous section—the instances that are impossible. </p>
<p>
However, AS show that their structural condition is just what’s needed to bridge the gap that keeps the impossible cases from being distinguished. Realizing that the compounded complications of having multiple <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Ei%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^i}" class="latex" title="{p^i}" /> can be resolved by this stroke is their act of brilliance. Their paper applies it successfully to two other problem settings—identity testing and closeness testing—and also shows meaningful instances that obey and are resolved by their definition but that escape an older condition involving product distributions. As usual, we say to see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07324.pdf">paper</a> for the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Consequences in Crypto and Inference? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
It remains our place to ask, in which other cases might the AS condition arise and what uses might it have? I can think first of one implication for adversarial strategies in cryptography. It goes like this:</p>
<p>
We can view the AS theorems as saying that anyone who wishes to cheat others should <b>not</b> be consistent. Being consistent according to some utility criterion—<em>even an unknown one</em>—makes it easier for others to detect that they are cheating. </p>
<p>
Following their slot-machine example suggests this: Arrange the machines in total to cheat players. But make it so that they are not consistent. They can set some prizes up in probability and some lower, and importantly, do this differently on different machines. They could even make some machines pay out more than the legal expectation—while still giving a small profit to the casino so it does not become too obvious to customers that those machines are “lucky.” There is safety in non-conformity alone. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5CS+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \S " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \S " /></p>
<p>
Ken notices a similarity to the chess-modeling situation he began describing in this recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/11/29/predicating-predictivity/">post</a>. Instead of prizes of known value, in chess we have distributions over possible moves whose values are <em>not</em> so readily apparent to the player—that’s what makes chess challenging to play. </p>
<p>
In his case, giving any chess position <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> and a player <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> having that position, he postulates a true distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^t}" class="latex" title="{p^t}" /> of moves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> would make and wants to compare that with the distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q^t}" class="latex" title="{q^t}" /> projected by his model. Now there can be many positions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> with different characteristics, but Ken can treat the distributions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q^t}" class="latex" title="{q^t}" /> coming from his model as one fixed point of reference <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" />, and he can give different positions the same ranks of legal moves <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> (best), then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%2C%5Cdots%2C+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2,\dots, n}" class="latex" title="{2,\dots, n}" />. If positions have different numbers of legal moves he can pad them out by treating illegal moves the same as completely losing blunders. </p>
<p>
So he has a situation like this: different <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%5Et%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p^t}" class="latex" title="{p^t}" /> and one <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" /> over a bunch of positions. Ken knows his model not only varies in accuracy but is biased in ways explained in that post. It appears that this bias is highly conformal. The model is trained to make the projection <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%281%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q(1)}" class="latex" title="{q(1)}" /> of the probability of the first move accurate on average. Then the tendency is that the projections of the second-best and third-best moves are off one way, and the projections of all the other moves are off the other way. This is like having <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA+%3D+%5C%7B2%2C3%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A = \{2,3\}}" class="latex" title="{A = \{2,3\}}" /> or its complement most of the time. The new statistical tests that Ken is crafting also live under the specter of impossibility. A co-worker has demonstrated that they <em>fail</em> in cases randomly generated from normal distributions. But so far they are appearing to succeed in Ken’s more-structured situations from his real-world chess data. On this we will stay tuned.</p>

</ul>

<p>There are many more I could include, but haven’t yet (including most of the <em>Aperiodical</em> list). Many of these books are award-winners, but to a large extent inclusion in this list is driven by my personal taste in books, so many of these are somewhat specialized rather than being general-audience books. But the main criterion for inclusion on Wikipedia is that everything must have multiple in-depth sources, and everything in the article must come from those sources. For books those sources are not the book itself, but (typically) published book reviews. The bare minimum is two reviews, but I’ve been aiming for books with at least four. So for instance I would have liked to include <em>Geometry: The Line and the Circle</em> (2019), by Maureen T. Carroll and Elyn Rykken, but I could find only <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/geometry-the-line-and-the-circle">one review of it</a>, and that’s not enough. To all the book reviewers out there: your efforts are appreciated, and helpful.</p>
