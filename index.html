We show that any $n$-variate polynomial computable by a syntactically multilinear circuit of size $\mathop{poly}(n)$ can be computed by a depth-$4$ syntactically multilinear ($\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi$) circuit of size at most $\exp\left({O\left(\sqrt{n\log n}\right)}\right)$. For degree $d = \omega(n/\log n)$, this improves upon the upper bound of $\exp\left({O(\sqrt{d}\log n)}\right)$ obtained by Tavenas (MFCS 2015) for general circuits, and is known to be asymptotically optimal in the exponent when $d &lt; n^{\epsilon}$ for a small enough constant $\epsilon$. Our upper bound matches the lower bound of $\exp\left({\Omega\left(\sqrt{n\log n}\right)}\right)$ proved by Raz and Yehudayoff (CC 2009), and thus cannot be improved further in the exponent. Our results hold over all fields and also generalize to circuits of small individual degree.  

More generally, we show that an $n$-variate polynomial computable by a syntactically multilinear circuit of size $\mathop{poly}(n)$ can be computed by a syntactically multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ of size at most $\exp\left(O\left(\Delta \cdot (n/\log n)^{1/\Delta} \cdot \log n\right)\right)$. It follows from the lower bounds of Raz and Yehudayoff (CC 2009) that in general, for constant $\Delta$, the exponent in this upper bound is tight and cannot be improved to $o\left(\left(n/\log n\right)^{1/\Delta}\cdot \log n\right)$.</div>

<div class="content">
I recently read an absurd article that speculated on who the Democratic VICE prez nominees will be. Yes, you read that right, VICE Prez. Gee, wouldn't knowing who the Prez nominees was first help. But leave it to Nate Silver and company to have a fascinating yet... premature article on this. Here is the link: <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-very-first-2020-vice-presidential-draft/">article on who will be Dem VP nominee</a>.  Its hard enough to pick the VP when the Prez is known! I did a blog on how badly intrade would do on predicting VP, <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/09/i-would-be-on-intrade-that-intrade-will.html">here</a>. I didn't predict that intrade would go out of business (`intrade' was short hand for `betting markets' just like `Uber' is shorthand for `hailing a car with your phone'- I wonder if the term `Uber' will still be used if they go out of business?)<br />
<br />
After reading I thought<br />
<br />
<i>Wow- there are so many If-Then clauses in this that I could make half a lecture about it for my Discrete Math class where we are talking about Prop. Logic.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
I emailed the students to read it, and we had a lively discussion. I made sure it was a non-partisan discussion. Realize that a statement like:<br />
<br />
<i>If the Prez is a female then the VP will likely be a male because it is thought, righly or wrongly, that all-female ticket can't win</i><br />
<br />
is not partisan or sexist, it is stating an opinion about how voters would go. It may be incorrect, but its not offensive.<br />
<br />
Here is what the class thought the article was saying (and I think they are right) expressed in Logic.<br />
<br />
Note one other thing-- the Prez nominees  might not be the choice of the party (Trump wasn't the choice of the Rep party in 2016, though not clear who was, see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2015/05/the-law-of-excluded-middle-of-road.html">here</a>) but the VP really will be since (I think) the party has more control over that.<br />
<br />
If the Prez Nominees is female then the Vice Prez nominee will be male. (I agree)<br />
<br />
If the Prez Nominees is white mail then the Vice Prez nominee will be either female or non-white but not both. (Great question to express that as symbols. Not sure what I think- the thought is that two white males will be odd since so many of the candidates are female or non-white. Having said that, in recent years the VP has NOT been someone else who ran:  Clinton-Keane, Keane had not been a candidate, Trump-Pence, Pence had not been a candidate, Romney-Ryan, Ryan had not been a candidate, Obama-Biden, Biden had been a candidate briefly in 2008, but this was not one of these `lets unite the party by picking by OPPONENT to be VP', McCain-Palin, Palin had not been a candidate. Kerry-Edwards. YES- Edwards had been a serious candidate in 2004, though some think he was running for VP all along since he never said an unkind word about his opponents)<br />
<br />
Prez from one of the coasts IFF VP from the center. (I won't go over the list again, but this has been less of a thing since Clinton-Gore were both from flyover states.)<br />
<br />
Ideology- If Prez is establishment then VP is leftists. (Not sure these terms are so well defined to say this, and their are other ideologies as well, not sure how they fit in.)<br />
<br />
If Prez lacks Fed Experience then VP should have Fed Exp. (Quite common: Obama-Biden, Romney-Ryan, Clinton-Gore, Bush-Cheney)<br />
<br />If Prez has fed experience than nothing can be deduced about VP Fed Exp.<br />
<br />
If Prez lacks gravitas then VP should have gravitas (tricky! Don't want the VP to outshine the Prez!)<br />
<br />
Absolute statement: VP should not outshine prez. A Kangaroo ticket is when the people prefer the VP to the Prez (Dukakis-Bentsen had this problem. Kerry-Edwards might have).<br />
<br />
If Prez is boring then VP should be exciting. But again tricky! (I think that was why McCain picked Palin. And she was exciting, but not really in a good way. Couldn't he have picked someone exciting, and perhaps female who was, you know, Qualified?)<br />
<br />
VP's like doctors: do no harm.<br />
<br />
VP from Swing state helpful but not necc.<br />
<br />
Bad to have a VP who is a senator from a state where the Governor is republican and picks the replacement senator.<br />
<br />
VP should be someone who the country can picture being president without laughing. I am not talking ideology I am talking about seriousness and experience. Palin was the only one in recent memory who even voters of her party worried that she was not up to being president. One pundit defending the choice talked about how McCain was healthy and hence Palin wouldn't become prez so don't worry about it. NOT reassuring! Quayle was also not seen as serious, though not as much as Palin.<br />
<br />
If Prez is old then VP mattes more(?)<br />
<br />
Many of the above depend on who the Prez is. And that is one of the points: one can write down a long prop formula with many IF-THEN's to determine who properties the VP will have, and then<br />
<br />
1) When the Prez is picked many of the variables are set and hence the formula becomes much easeier and<br />
<br />
2) Could STILL be wrong!<br />
<br />
MY prediction: my last two predictions have been wrong so I am reluctant go predict anything. But I will tell you my WRONG predictions and then my current one<br />
<br />
I predicted Paul Ryan would be the Prez Nominee in 2016. He didn't even run.<br />
<br />
I predicted that Al Franken would be the Prez Nominess in 2020- he understands TV and was an entertainer, so he could match Trump. Whoops.<br />
<br />
So with that sterling record I predict: Prez: Cory Booker, VP: Beto<br />
<br />
I am NOT a pundit- so what I predict is not what I hope happens.  What do I hope? In the interest of full disclosure (gee, shouldn't that have come at the beginning) I admit that I want to see Trump lose but I have no idea what makes someone `electable' nowadays.<br />

hamiltonian circuit. Determining whether such hamiltonian sequence exists in a
given graph is a NP-Complete problem. In this paper, a novel algorithm for
hamiltonian sequence problem is proposed. The proposed algorithm assumes that
$G$ have potential forbidden minors that prevent a potential hamiltonian
sequence P from being a hamiltonian sequence. The algorithm's goal is to
degenerate such potential forbidden minors in a two-phrase process. In first
phrase, the algorithm pass through $G$ constructing a potential hamiltonian
sequence $P$ with the aim of degenerating these potential forbidden minors. The
algorithm, in turn, try to reconstruct P in second phrase by using a
goal-oriented approach.

solving the approximate near-neighbor search problem. In particular, we develop
an online sketching algorithm that can compress $N$ vectors into a tiny sketch
consisting of small arrays of counters whose size scales as
$O(N^{b}\log^2{N})$, where $b &lt; 1$ depending on the stability of the
near-neighbor search. This sketch is sufficient to identify the top-$v$
near-neighbors with high probability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first near-neighbor search algorithm that breaks the linear memory ($O(N)$)
barrier. We achieve sub-linear memory by combining advances in locality
sensitive hashing (LSH) based estimation, especially the recently-published ACE
algorithm, with compressed sensing and heavy hitter techniques. We provide
strong theoretical guarantees; in particular, our analysis sheds new light on
the memory-accuracy tradeoff in the near-neighbor search setting and the role
of sparsity in compressed sensing, which could be of independent interest. We
rigorously evaluate our framework, which we call RACE (Repeated ACE) data
structures on a friend recommendation task on the Google plus graph with more
than 100,000 high-dimensional vectors. RACE provides compression that is orders
of magnitude better than the random projection based alternative, which is
unsurprising given the theoretical advantage. We anticipate that RACE will
enable both new theoretical perspectives on near-neighbor search and new
methodologies for applications like high-speed data mining, internet-of-things
(IoT), and beyond.

refine the well-known Weisfeiler-Leman method. They are parametrised by a
number k and a set Q of primes. The intuition is that two graphs G and H which
are equivalent with respect to k-Q-IM-equivalence cannot be distinguished by a
refinement of k-tuples given by linear operators acting on vector spaces over
fields of characteristic p, for any p in Q. These equivalences first appeared
in the study of rank logic, but in fact they can be used to delimit the
expressive power of any extension of fixed-point logic with linear-algebraic
operators. We define an infinitary logic with k variables and all
linear-algebraic operators over finite vector spaces of characteristic p in Q
and show that the k-Q-IM-equivalence is the natural notion of elementary
equivalence for this logic.
</p>
<p>By means of a new and much deeper algebraic analysis of a generalized
variant, for any prime p, of the CFI-structures due to Cai, F\"urer, and
Immerman, we prove that, as long as Q is not the set of all primes, there is no
k such that k-Q-IM-equivalence is the same as isomorphism. It follows that
there are polynomial-time properties of graphs which are not definable in the
infinitary logic with all Q-linear-algebraic operators and finitely many
variables, which implies that no extension of fixed-point logic with
linear-algebraic operators can capture PTIME, unless it includes such operators
for all prime characteristics. Our analysis requires substantial algebraic
machinery, including a homogeneity property of CFI-structures and Maschke's
Theorem, an important result from the representation theory of finite groups.

We call $P$
a simple histogram if its upper boundary is a single edge; and a double
histogram if it has a horizontal chord from the left boundary to the right
boundary. Two points $p$ and $q$ in $P$ are co-visible if and only if the
(axis-parallel) rectangle spanned by $p$ and $q$ completely lies in $P$. In the
$r$-visibility graph $G(P)$ of $P$, we connect two vertices of $P$ with an edge
if and only if they are co-visible.
</p>
<p>We consider routing with preprocessing in $G(P)$. We may preprocess $P$ to
obtain a label and a routing table for each vertex of $P$. Then, we must be
able to route a packet between any two vertices $s$ and $t$ of $P$, where each
step may use only the label of the target node $t$, the routing table and
neighborhood of the current node, and the packet header.
</p>
<p>We present a routing scheme for double histograms that sends any data packet
along a path whose length is at most twice the (unweighted) shortest path
distance between the endpoints. In our scheme, the labels, routing tables, and
headers need $O(\log n)$ bits. For the case of simple histograms, we obtain a
routing scheme with optimal routing paths, $O(\log n)$-bit labels, one-bit
routing tables, and no headers.

Extension problem, which takes in input an upward planar drawing $\Gamma_H$ of
a subgraph $H$ of a directed graph $G$ and asks whether $\Gamma_H$ can be
extended to an upward planar drawing of $G$. Our study fits into the line of
research on the extensibility of partial representations, which has recently
become a mainstream in Graph Drawing.
</p>
<p>We show the following results.
</p>
<p>First, we prove that the Upward Planarity Extension problem is NP-complete,
even if $G$ has a prescribed upward embedding, the vertex set of $H$ coincides
with the one of $G$, and $H$ contains no edge.
</p>
<p>Second, we show that the Upward Planarity Extension problem can be solved in
$O(n \log n)$ time if $G$ is an $n$-vertex upward planar $st$-graph. This
result improves upon a known $O(n^2)$-time algorithm, which however applies to
all $n$-vertex single-source upward planar graphs.
</p>
<p>Finally, we show how to solve in polynomial time a surprisingly difficult
version of the Upward Planarity Extension problem, in which $G$ is a directed
path or cycle with a prescribed upward embedding, $H$ contains no edges, and no
two vertices share the same $y$-coordinate in $\Gamma_H$.

method that solves it in linear time with respect to number of nodes and the
total size of all quorum slices. Moreover, we analyze the complexity of some of
these problems using the parametrized point of view.

$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution in $O(m^{1/3}\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon +
\log(m/\epsilon)/\epsilon^2)$ iterations, where $m$ is the number of rows of
the input matrix. Interestingly, this running time is independent of the
conditioning of the input, and the dominant term of the running time depends
only linearly in $\epsilon^{-1}$, despite the fact that the problem it is
solving is non-smooth, and the algorithm is not using any regularization.
</p>
<p>This improves upon the more complex algorithms of Chin et al. (ITCS '12), and
Christiano et al. (STOC '11) by a factor of at least $1/\epsilon^{5/3}$, and
yields a truly efficient natural algorithm for the slime mold dynamics
(Straszak-Vishnoi, SODA '16, ITCS '16, ITCS '17).

<p><b>Authors: </b>Gregory Rosenthal <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06380">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>For any fixed graph $G$, the subgraph isomorphism problem asks whether an
$n$-vertex input graph has a subgraph isomorphic to $G$. A well-known algorithm
of Alon, Yuster and Zwick (1995) efficiently reduces this to the "colored"
version of the problem, denoted $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$, and then solves
$G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ in time $O(n^{tw(G)+1})$ where $tw(G)$ is the treewidth of
$G$. Marx (2010) conjectured that $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ requires time
$\Omega(n^{\mathrm{const}\cdot tw(G)})$ and, assuming the Exponential Time
Hypothesis is true, proved a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\mathrm{const}\cdot
emb(G)})$ for a certain graph parameter $emb(G) = \Omega(tw(G)/\log tw(G))$.
With respect to the size of $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits solving
$G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$, Li, Razborov and Rossman (2017) proved an unconditional
average-case lower bound of $\Omega(n^{\kappa(G)})$ for a different graph
parameter $\kappa(G) = \Omega(tw(G)/\log tw(G))$.
</p>
<p>Our contributions are as follows. First, we show that $emb(G)$ is at most
$O(\kappa(G))$ for all graphs $G$. Next, we show that $\kappa(G)$ can be
asymptotically less than $tw(G)$; for example if $G$ is a hypercube, then
$\kappa(G)$ is $\Theta\left(tw(G)/\sqrt{\log tw(G)}\right)$. Finally, we
construct $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits of size $O(n^{\kappa(G)+\mathrm{const}})$
that solve $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$ in the average case, on a variety of product
distributions. This improves an $O(n^{2\kappa(G)+\mathrm{const}})$ upper bound
of Li et al, and shows that the average-case complexity of $G$-$\mathsf{SUB}$
is $n^{o(tw(G))}$ for certain families of graphs $G$ such as hypercubes.

distributed optimization? This problem is at the heart of training scalable
machine learning models and has been mainly studied in the unconstrained
setting. In this paper, we propose Quantized Frank-Wolfe (QFW), the first
projection-free and communication-efficient algorithm for solving constrained
optimization problems at scale. We consider both convex and non-convex
objective functions, expressed as a finite-sum or more generally a stochastic
optimization problem, and provide strong theoretical guarantees on the
convergence rate of QFW. This is done by proposing quantization schemes that
efficiently compress gradients while controlling the variance introduced during
this process. Finally, we empirically validate the efficiency of QFW in terms
of communication and the quality of returned solution against natural
baselines.

of two matroids in [Kleinberg and Wienberg STOC 12] model. We consider a simple
class of non adaptive vertex-additive policies that assign static prices to all
vertices in the graph and accept each edge only if its weight exceeds the sum
of the prices of the edge's endpoints. We show existence of a vertex-additive
policy with the expected payoff of at least one third of the prophet's payoff
and present gradient decent type algorithm that quickly converges to the
desired vector of vertex prices. This improves the adaptive online policy of
[Kleinberg and Wienberg STOC 12] for the intersection of two matroids in two
ways: our policy is non adaptive and has better approximation guarantee of $3$
instead of previous guarantee of $5.82$ against the prophet. We give a
complementary lower bound of $2.25$ for any online algorithm in the bipartite

appears in satellite images and may have implications for TC structure and
intensity. The diurnal pattern can be seen in infrared (IR) satellite imagery
as cyclical pulses in the cloud field that propagate radially outward from the
center of nearly all Atlantic-basin TCs. These diurnal pulses, a distinguishing
characteristic of the TC diurnal cycle, begin forming in the storm's inner core
near sunset each day and appear as a region of cooling cloud-top temperatures.
The area of cooling takes on a ring-like appearance as cloud-top warming occurs
on its inside edge and the cooling moves away from the storm overnight,
reaching several hundred kilometers from the circulation center by the
following afternoon. The state-of-the-art TC diurnal cycle measurement has a
limited ability to analyze the behavior beyond qualitative observations. We
present a method for quantifying the TC diurnal cycle using one-dimensional
persistent homology, a tool from Topological Data Analysis, by tracking maximum
persistence and quantifying the cycle using the discrete Fourier transform.
Using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite IR imagery data from
Hurricane Felix (2007), our method is able to detect an approximate daily
cycle.

collusion-resistant fingerprinting scheme [Tardos, STOC 2003], ultimately
resulting in a good understanding of what is the minimum code length required
to achieve collusion-resistance. In contrast, decreasing the cost of the actual
decoding algorithm for identifying the potential colluders has received less
attention, even though previous results have shown that using joint decoding
strategies, deemed too expensive for decoding, may lead to better code lengths.
Moreover, in dynamic settings a fast decoder may be required to provide answers
in real-time, further raising the question whether the decoding costs of
score-based fingerprinting schemes can be decreased with a smarter decoding
algorithm. In this paper we show how to model the decoding step of score-based
fingerprinting as a nearest neighbor search problem, and how this relation
allows us to apply techniques from the field of (approximate) nearest neighbor
searching to obtain decoding times which are sublinear in the total number of
users. As this does not affect the encoding and embedding steps, this decoding
mechanism can easily be deployed within existing fingerprinting schemes, and
this may bring a truly efficient joint decoder closer to reality. Besides the
application to fingerprinting, similar techniques can be used to decrease the
decoding costs of group testing methods, which may be of independent interest.

space mission planning and scheduling, where problem domains are modelled as
systems made of a number of independent but interacting components, whose
behaviour over time, the timelines, is governed by a set of temporal
constraints. This approach is different from the action-based perspective of
common PDDL-like planning languages. Timeline-based systems have been
successfully deployed in a number of space missions and other domains. However,
despite this practical success, a thorough theoretical understanding of the
paradigm was missing.
</p>
<p>This thesis fills this gap, providing the first detailed account of formal
and computational properties of the timeline-based approach to planning. In
particular, we show that a particularly restricted variant of the formalism is
already expressive enough to compactly capture action-based temporal planning
problems. Then, finding a solution plan for a timeline-based planning problem
is proved to be EXPSPACE-complete.
</p>
<p>Then, we study the problem of timeline-based planning with uncertainty, that
include external components whose behaviour is not under the control of the
planned system. We identify a few issues in the state-of-the-art approach based
on flexible plans, proposing timeline-based games, a more general
game-theoretic formulation of the problem, that addresses those issues. We show
that winning strategies for such games can be found in doubly-exponential time.
</p>
<p>Then, we study the expressiveness of the formalism from a logic point of
view, showing that (most of) timeline-based planning problems can be captured
by Bounded TPTL with Past, a fragment of TPTL+P that, unlike the latter, keeps
an EXPSPACE satisfiability problem. The logic is introduced and its
satisfiabilty problem is solved by extending a recent one-pass tree-shaped
tableau method for LTL.

Both the
agent and the treasure are modeled as points. This is a variant of the task
known as treasure hunt. The treasure is at a distance at most $D$ from the
initial position of the agent, and the agent finds the treasure when it gets at
distance $r$ from it, called the {\em vision radius}. However, the agent does
not know the location of the treasure and does not know the parameters $D$ and
$r$. The cost of finding the treasure is the length of the trajectory of the
agent. We investigate the tradeoffs between the amount of information held {\em
a priori} by the agent and the cost of treasure hunt. Following the
well-established paradigm of {\em algorithms with advice}, this information is
given to the agent in advance as a binary string, by an oracle cooperating with
the agent and knowing the location of the treasure and the initial position of
the agent. The size of advice given to the agent is the length of this binary
string.
</p>
<p>For any size $z$ of advice and any $D$ and $r$, let $OPT(z,D,r)$ be the
optimal cost of finding the treasure for parameters $z$, $D$ and $r$, if the
agent has only an advice string of length $z$ as input. We design treasure hunt
algorithms working with advice of size $z$ at cost $O(OPT(z,D,r))$ whenever
$r\leq 1$ or $r\geq 0.9D$. For intermediate values of $r$, i.e., $1&lt;r&lt;0.9D$, we
design an almost optimal scheme of algorithms: for any constant $\alpha&gt;0$, the
treasure can be found at cost $O(OPT(z,D,r)^{1+\alpha})$.

as an important formalism in multi-agent community due to their ability to
capture personal preferences. However, the existing search-based complete
algorithms for ADCOPs can only use local knowledge to compute lower bounds,
which leads to inefficient pruning and prohibits them from solving large scale
problems. On the other hand, inference-based complete algorithms (e.g., DPOP)
for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) require only a linear
number of messages, but they cannot be directly applied into ADCOPs due to a
privacy concern. Therefore, in the paper, we consider the possibility of
combining inference and search to effectively solve ADCOPs at an acceptable
loss of privacy. Specifically, we propose a hybrid complete algorithm called
PT-ISABB which uses a tailored inference algorithm to provide tight lower
bounds and a tree-based complete search algorithm to exhaust the search space.
We prove the correctness of our algorithm and the experimental results
demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art complete algorithms.

sequence is notoriously challenging, if not completely intractable.

<p>In this paper, we introduce adaptive sequence submodularity, a rich framework
that generalizes the notion of submodularity to adaptive policies that
explicitly consider sequential dependencies between items. We show that once
such dependencies are encoded by a directed graph, an adaptive greedy policy is
guaranteed to achieve a constant factor approximation guarantee, where the
constant naturally depends on the structural properties of the underlying
graph. Additionally, to demonstrate the practical utility of our results, we
run experiments on Amazon product recommendation and Wikipedia link prediction
tasks.

Minimum Circuit Size Problem (MCSP) asks to decide if a given truth table of an $n$-variate boolean function has circuit complexity less than a given parameter $s$. We prove that MCSP is hard for constant-depth circuits with mod $p$ gates, for any prime $p\geq 2$ (the circuit class $AC^0[p])$. Namely, we show that MCSP requires $d$-depth $AC^0[p]$ circuits of size at least $exp(N^{0.49/d})$, where $N=2^n$ is the size of an input truth table of an $n$-variate boolean function.  Our circuit lower bound proof shows that MCSP can solve the coin problem: distinguish uniformly random $N$-bit strings from those generated using independent samples from a biased random coin which is $1$ with probability $1/2+N^{-0.49}$, and $0$ otherwise. Solving the coin problem with such parameters is known to require exponentially large $AC^0[p]$ circuits. Moreover, this also implies that MAJORITY is computable by a non-uniform $AC^0$ circuit of polynomial size that also has MCSP-oracle gates. The latter has a few other consequences for the complexity of MCSP, e.g., we get that any boolean function in $NC^1$ (i.e., computable by a polynomial-size formula) can also be computed by a non-uniform polynomial-size $AC^0$ circuit with MCSP-oracle gates.</div>

Tetsuya Miyamoto is a mathematics teacher who divides his time between Tokyo and Manhattan. He is known for creating in 2004 the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KenKen">KenKen</a> puzzle, which the New York Times started running ten years ago. As with its sister puzzles Sudoku and Kakuro, unlimited-size versions of it are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-complete.</p>
<p>
Today we observe the 10th anniversary of this blog and ask what progress has been made on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> question.</p>
<p>
The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> is a question about <em>asymptotic</em> complexity. From time to time we have tried to raise corresponding questions about <em>concrete</em> complexity that might yield more progress. What catches our eye about the KenKen puzzles is that their generation is a full-blown application within concrete complexity. The NYT’s KenKen puzzles are all generated using software by David Levy that can tailor their hardness. Quoting the NYT anniversary <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/reader-center/kenken-puzzle-10th-anniversary.html">article</a> by Will Shortz:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em>[Levy’s] program knows every possible method for solving a KenKen, which he has rated in difficulty from easy to hard. Thus, when a KenKen has been made, the computer knows exactly how hard it is. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This seems to say there is a hardness measure that is objective—quite apart from the idea of having human testers try the puzzle and say how hard they found it to be. We surmise that it is lower for instances that have more forced plays at the start. We wonder whether Levy’s criteria can be generalized.</p>
<p>
Incidentally, this is the same Levy who won a challenge chess match in 1978 against the computer Chess 4.7 to complete his win of a famous ten-year $1,000+ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Levy_(chess_player)#Computer_chess_bet">bet</a>. He lost $1,000 back when he was defeated by Deep Thought in 1989. He later became president of the International Computer Games Association (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Computer_Games_Association">ICGA</a>), whose <a href="https://icga.org/?page_id=26"><em>Journal</em></a> published a nice <a href="https://www.cs.wmich.edu/elise/courses/cs431/icga2008.pdf">paper</a> on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-completess of the aforementioned puzzles and many others.</p>

<p></p><p>
GLL’s first <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/bait-and-switch-why-lower-bounds-are-so-hard/">post</a>, on 12 Feb. 2009, featured Stephen Rudich and his work on the “<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/natural.pdf">Natural</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_proof">Proofs</a>.” <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/is-np-too-big-or-p-too-small/">Two</a> other <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/02/12/a-nightmare-about-sat/">posts</a> that day covered other aspects of why the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> question is hard. Our question, dear readers, is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has anything happened in the past ten years to make any part of those posts out-of-date in the slightest way? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We won’t claim any such progress, though we have tried to stir ideas. In the meantime, we have written 806 other posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Some have featured our own work and ideas (considering Ken’s chess research in a separate vein); <p></p>
</li><li>
some have featured others’ direct attempts at breakthrough lower and upper bounds (with a few successes); <p></p>
</li><li>
many have featured other kinds of results by others; <p></p>
</li><li>
many have pulled “idea nuggets” from the past; <p></p>
</li><li>
many have been humor and social commentary.
</li></ul>
<p>
To date, we’ve had 18,575 comments plus trackbacks on these posts and just over 2.1 million views. We are less able to quantify impacts, beyond occasionally seeing citations of articles on the blog as sources. We try for precision as well as readability and are grateful for reader comments with fixes when we slip up on the former.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> P vs NP </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There continue to be claims of proofs that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" /> and some that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%3DNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P=NP}}" /> While these proofs do not seem to be correct, there is something that we wish to remark about them. Many argue as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> There is some problem say <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> that seems to require a search of exponentially many objects. Then the proof states that any algorithm for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BS%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{S}" class="latex" title="{S}" /> must actually look at all or most of the exponentially many objects. This of course is where the proof is not complete. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There is some sense to these proofs. They seem related to the oracle proofs that for example show that for some oracle set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> it is the case that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A}. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A}. " /></p>
<p>we have discussed these types of proofs before—we even said that we did not like them.</p>
<p>
The trouble with these results that are rigorous is that they change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}}" /> vs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" /> in a central manner, and this seems to make the results much less interesting. Roughly here is how they argue: Imagine that for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> we either put a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> or we do not. The point is that if we do this in a <i>unpredictable</i> manner then a polynomial time machine will not be able to decide whether for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> there is or is not a string of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. But a nondeterministic machine with just use its power and guess. This shows, essentially, that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%5E%7BA%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathsf{P}^{A} \neq \mathsf{NP}^{A} " /></p>
<p>is true.</p>
<p>
There is some relationship to many attempts to show <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" />. The proofs often argue that one must look at all the objects. The counterpart here is that a polynomial time machine will not have enough time to check the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{n}}" class="latex" title="{2^{n}}" /> strings of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> to see if they are in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" />. But this works in the oracle case because we allow the rule that decides whether or not a string is in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A}" class="latex" title="{A}" /> to be very complicated. In the real world, in the world where we study the real <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}}" /> question, we cannot assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BNP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{NP}" class="latex" title="{NP}" />-complete problems use a complicated rule. <i>That is precisely what we are trying to prove</i>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> State of the Game </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What can we say? Mostly the big open questions remain. We still have no non-linear lower bounds on circuit complexity and no progress of any definite kind on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP%7D%3D%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}}" />. What do you think?</p>
<p>
What is commonly hailed as one of the two biggest results in our field last year was a positive solution to what is intuitively a slightly weaker form of the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). For UGC we can refer you to Wikipedia’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_games_conjecture">article</a>:</p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/uniquegameswikipedia.png"><img src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/uniquegameswikipedia.png?w=400&amp;h=106" alt="" width="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-15648" height="106" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The note [2] is in turn a reference to a 2010 <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/unique-games-a-three-act-play/">post</a> here. The new <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2018/006/">paper</a> proves hardness for the relaxed situation where, roughly speaking, a trial assignment to a node in a constraint graph limits the other node on any connecting edge to at most two possible values, rather than a unique value as in UGC. This relaxation retains many properties that had caused disbelief in the original UGC, yet it was proved—in that sense a big deal. </p>
<p>
Nevertheless we note that UGC, at its core, is just asserting that for arbitrarily small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />, with our power to make other parameter(s) as large as desired, we can execute an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hardness proof. We have been executing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP}}" />-hardness proofs for almost fifty years. That is something we in the field have proven good at. True, these hardness results becomes lower bound proofs if and when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP+%5Cneq+P%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" class="latex" title="{\mathsf{NP \neq P}}" /> is proved, and true, we have been as vocal as any on the standpoint that significant lower bounds will come from constructions that are usually thought of as being for upper bounds. But the new proof from a year ago doesn’t feel like that. We invite readers to tell us connections from UGC to the possibility of actually constructing lower bounds.</p>

<div class="content">
Last Monday, 11 February, was the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/women-and-girls-in-science-day/" target="_blank">International Day of Women in Science</a>. I planned to post the answers I received from three junior female computer scientists to three questions I asked them. However, being a computer scientist who is short of time like everyone else, I asked for a one-week deadline extension to do so.<br /><br />The questions were <br /><ol><li>When did you become interested in science?</li><li>Why did you choose computer science?</li><li>Which advice would you give to a high-school student who is thinking about pursuing a career in science?  </li></ol>Here are the (unedited) answers in the order in which I received them, in case they might be of interest to (female) students of all ages. I have anonymized the answers as the message is more important than the messengers. <br /><br />Colleague #1<br /><br /><ol><li>I never had a sentence like "I am interested in science" in my mind, it  was just that I always in one way or another enjoyed learning about  things, school and education, and I wanted to continue being in that  type of surroundings after graduating from university. </li><li>I actually studied mathematics, I was not interested in computer  science. I had some algorithms and programming classes during my  studies, which I found cute but not much more than that. I started being  seriously interested in computer science only when I took a class on  mathematical theory of computation. This class combined the  mathematical/theoretical/<div>philosophical approach I liked so much with (for me) a new and refreshing set of questions. </div></li><li> Try it and see how it goes. </li></ol>Colleague #2<br /><br /><ol><li>My interest in science started when visiting the SMAU that is an     event where companies, investors and startups aim to promote the     Made in Italy Research and Innovation. It was simply amazing to     learn about startups, laboratories, research centres, universities     and small companies showing so many novel ideas and technologies in     one day, it really impressed me a lot. </li><li>Computer science was the alternative to Math (my preferred subject     at the scientific high school) but I thought it was too abstract and     full of theories, demonstrations and proofs, maybe too much.     Computer science has the theoretical part that is fascinating but it     also has some more practical implications, it is somehow more     concrete, and I like both sides. </li><li>Don't be afraid to fail, be afraid not to try. I think it is     worthwhile to try if you have any inclination to science because you     are exposed to problem solving reasoning, and these efforts can be     helpful for building a better society.<span class="im"></span> </li></ol>Colleague #3<br /><br /><ol><li style="margin-left: 15px;">From the junior secondary school, scientific subjects were my favorites, together with history.</li><li style="margin-left: 15px;">During the high school, I started to study computer science and also  laboratory of computer science where it was applied to other subjects  such as Math and Business Economics. I was really passionate of this  subject, which was among my favorite. When it was time to choose for the  University, computer science was naturally the first in the list. I  also had other alternatives but in the end I quickly decided to apply  for computer science.</li><li style="margin-left: 15px;">My advice is simply to do whatever he/she really likes and for which  he/she is good and has obtained good results, without thinking too much  about work opportunities or what other people (e.g., parents) want for  them. For each career, in science or not, passion is the main ingredient  to reach good results. Then, I also think that one can change his/her  mind and do something completely different after the university. The  important is to study what one really likes.</li></ol><br /><br /></div>

Porter</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05911">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>A crucial step in the analysis of persistent homology is transformation of
data into a simplicial complex. Modern packages for persistent homology often
construct Vietoris--Rips or other distance-based simplicial complexes on point
clouds because they are relatively easy to compute. We investigate alternative
methods of constructing these complexes and the effects of making associated
choices during simplicial-complex construction on the output of
persistent-homology algorithms. We present two new methods for constructing
simplicial complexes from two-dimensional geospatial data (such as maps). We
apply these methods to a California precinct-level voting data set,
demonstrating that our new constructions can capture geometric characteristics
that are missed by distance-based constructions. Our new constructions can thus
yield more interpretable persistence modules and barcodes for geospatial data.
In particular, they are able to distinguish short-persistence features that
occur only for a narrow range of distance scales (e.g., voting behaviors in
densely populated cities) from short-persistence noise by incorporating
information about other spatial relationships between precincts.

non-bipartite graphs. In earlier work we have described a 2/3-approximation
algorithm for the MVM on bipartite graphs (Dobrian, Halappanavar, Pothen and
Al-Herz, SIAM J. Scientific Computing, 2019). Here we show that a
2/3-approximation algorithm for MVM on non-bipartite graphs can be obtained by
restricting the length of augmenting paths to at most three. The algorithm has
time complexity $O(m \log \Delta + n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, $m$ is the number of edges, and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of a
vertex.
</p>
<p>The approximation ratio of the algorithm is obtained by considering failed
vertices, i.e., vertices that the approximation algorithm fails to match but
the exact algorithm does. We show that there are two distinct heavier matched
vertices that we can charge each failed vertex to. Our proof techniques
characterize the structure of augmenting paths in a novel way.
</p>
<p>We have implemented the 2/3-approximation algorithm and show that it runs in
under a minute on graphs with tens of millions of vertices and hundreds of
millions of edges. We compare its performance with five other algorithms: an
exact algorithm for MVM, an exact algorithm for the maximum edge-weighted
matching (MEM) problem, as well as three approximation algorithms. In our test
set of nineteen problems, there are graphs on which the exact algorithms fail
to terminate in 100 hours. The new 2/3-approximation algorithm for MVM
outperforms the other approximation algorithms by either being faster (often by
orders of magnitude) or obtaining better weights.

sample-access to an unknown target density $p$, find which of the $q_i$'s is
closer to $p$ in total variation.
</p>
<p>A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in
the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$
samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p)
\leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}=
\min\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class
of densities $\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best
density in $\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3.
</p>
<p>We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can
not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from
$\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary
densities (e.g.\ a mixture of densities from $\mathcal{Q}$), then the
approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this
demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup.
</p>
<p>We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of 2:
an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric
point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the
total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\it
Adaptive Data Analysis}.

matching is called a stable mechanism. One of the well-known stable mechanisms
is the man-oriented Gale-Shapley algorithm (MGS). MGS has a good property that
it is strategy-proof to the men's side, i.e., no man can obtain a better
outcome by falsifying a preference list. We call such a mechanism a
man-strategy-proof mechanism. Unfortunately, MGS is not a woman-strategy-proof
mechanism. Roth has shown that there is no stable mechanism that is
simultaneously man-strategy-proof and woman-strategy-proof, which is known as
Roth's impossibility theorem.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we extend these results to the stable marriage problem with
ties and incomplete lists (SMTI). Since SMTI is an extension of SM, Roth's
impossibility theorem takes over to SMTI. Therefore, we focus on the
one-sided-strategy-proofness. In SMTI, one instance can have stable matchings
of different sizes, and it is natural to consider the problem of finding a
largest stable matching, known as MAX SMTI. Thus we incorporate the notion of
approximation ratio used in the theory of approximation algorithms. We say that
a stable-mechanism is $c$-approximate-stable mechanism if it always returns a
stable matching of size at least $1/c$ of a largest one. We also consider a
restricted variant of MAX SMTI, which we call MAX SMTI-1TM, where only men's
lists can contain ties.
</p>
<p>Our results are summarized as follows: (i) MAX SMTI admits both a
man-strategy-proof 2-approximate-stable mechanism and a woman-strategy-proof
2-approximate-stable mechanism. (ii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a woman-strategy-proof
2-approximate-stable mechanism. (iii) MAX SMTI-1TM admits a man-strategy-proof
1.5-approximate-stable mechanism. All these results are tight in terms of
approximation ratios. Also, all these strategy-proofness results apply for
strategy-proofness against coalitions.

correlation clustering (CC), which we treat as an integer linear program (ILP).
We reformulate optimization in the ILP so as to admit efficient optimization
via Benders decomposition, a classic technique from operations research. Our
Benders decomposition formulation has many subproblems, each associated with a
node in the CC instance's graph, which are solved in parallel. Each Benders
subproblem enforces the cycle inequalities corresponding to the negative weight
edges attached to its corresponding node in the CC instance. We generate
Magnanti-Wong Benders rows in addition to standard Benders rows, to accelerate
optimization. Our Benders decomposition approach provides a promising new
avenue to accelerate optimization for CC, and allows for massive
parallelization.

<p><strong>Sierksma Conjecture:</strong> The number of Tverberg’s <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" />-partitions of a set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> is at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28r-1%29%21%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="((r-1)!)^d" class="latex" title="((r-1)!)^d" />.</p>
<p>Gerard Sierksma’s construction with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" /> Tverberg’s partition is obtained by taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)" class="latex" title="(r-1)" /> copies of each vertex of a simplex containing the origin in its interior, and adding the origin itself. A configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> with precisely <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28r-1%29%21%29%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="((r-1)!)^d" class="latex" title="((r-1)!)^d" /> Tverberg partitions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> parts is called a <strong>Sierksma Configuration</strong>.</p>
<h2>White’s Theorem</h2>
<p>In 2015 Moshe White proved the following theorem which was an open problem for many years. White’s construction was surprisingly simple.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 1 (White, 2015):</strong>  For any partition <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2Ca_2%2C%5Cdots+%2Ca_r%3A+1+%5Cle+a_i%5Cle+d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" class="latex" title="a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_r: 1 \le a_i\le d+1" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />, there exists a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X+%5Csubset+%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X \subset \mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="X \subset \mathbb R^d" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />  points, such that every Tverberg partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" />  induces the same partition on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> given by the parts <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ca_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="a_1,\dots,a_r" class="latex" title="a_1,\dots,a_r" />. Moreover, the number of Tverberg’s partitions of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="X" class="latex" title="X" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Five tree-like simple hypergraphs that correspond to configurations of 11 points in 4-dimensional space.</span></strong></p>
<p>Start with a tree-like hypergraph H of d+1 blocks of size r like the five examples in the Figure above. The intersection of every two blocks has at most one element. The union of all blocks has n=(d+1)(r-1)+1 elements.</p>
<p>A <strong>rainbow coloring</strong> of a r-uniform hypergraph H is a coloring of the vertices of H with r colors so that the vertices of every edge is colored by all r colors.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 2 (Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch):</strong> It is possible to associate to the vertices of each such hypergraph H a set X of n points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /> so that the Tverberg’s partitions of X correspond precisely to rainbow coloring of the hypergraph H. Moreover, the number of rainbow coloring is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%21%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)!^d" class="latex" title="(r-1)!^d" />. (Here, we consider two coloring as the same if they differ by a permutation of the colors.)</p>
<p>For a starlike hypergraph where all blocks have a vertex in common we get the original Sierksma’s example. (Example (d) above.) White’s examples are obtained by considering such hypergraphs where there exists an edge <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" /> such that all edges have non empty intersection with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="A" class="latex" title="A" />. (Examples (c), (d), and (e) above).</p>

<h2>Tverberg’s partitions for stretched points on the moment curve</h2>
<p>It is natural to consider $n$ points on the moment curve <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t%29%3D%28t%2Ct%5E2%2C%5Cdots%2C+t%5Ed%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x(t)=(t,t^2,\dots, t^d)" class="latex" title="x(t)=(t,t^2,\dots, t^d)" />. It turns out that the set of Tverberg’s partitions for points on the moment curve depend on the precise location of the points. By stretched points on the moment curve I mean that  you take the points <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%28t_1%29%2C+x%28t_2%29%2C+%5Cdots+x%28t_n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots x(t_n)" class="latex" title="x(t_1), x(t_2), \dots x(t_n)" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1+%3C%3C+t_2+%3C%3C+%5Cdots+t_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_1 &lt;&lt; t_2 &lt;&lt; \dots t_n" class="latex" title="t_1 &lt;&lt; t_2 &lt;&lt; \dots t_n" />, namely $t_2$ is much much larget than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_1" class="latex" title="t_1" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_3" class="latex" title="t_3" /> is much much much much larger than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t_2" class="latex" title="t_2" />, etc. etc. In this case, the configuration correspond to a <strong>path</strong> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />: you let the vertices be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C2%2C%5Cdots%2Cn%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" class="latex" title="\{1,2,\dots,n\}" /> and the edges are sets of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B%28k-1%29%28r-1%29%2B1%2C+%28k-1%29%28r-1%29%2B2%2C%5Cdots+%2C+k%28r-1%29%2B1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\{(k-1)(r-1)+1, (k-1)(r-1)+2,\dots , k(r-1)+1\}" class="latex" title="\{(k-1)(r-1)+1, (k-1)(r-1)+2,\dots , k(r-1)+1\}" />. A stretched configuration of points on the moment curve has the property that every subset is also a stretched configuration of points on the moment curve.</p>
<p>The importance of Tverberg’s partitions for stretched points on the moment curve was realized by Barany and Por, by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, and by Perles and Sidron (See their paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-016-9813-3">Tverberg Partitions of Points on the Moment Curve</a>), and perhaps by others.</p>
<h2>Por’s universality result</h2>
<p>Por’s universality theorem asserts that in terms of Tverberg partitions every large enough configuration of points in general position in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> contains a configuration whose Tverberg partitions are those of a stretched configuration of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> points on the moment curve! Por’s  universality result was conjectured independently by Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch, (and they gave some partial results) and by Por himself.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem 3 (Por’s universality result, 2018):</strong> Every long enough sequence of points in <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-15-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-91"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-92"><span class="msubsup" id="MathJax-Span-93"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-97"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb+R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\mathbb R^d" class="latex" title="\mathbb R^d" /></span></span></span></span></span> in general position contains a subsequence  of length <em><span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-16-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-98"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-99"><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-100">n</span></span></span></span></em> whose Tverberg partitions are exactly the so called rainbow partitions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Por actually proved an apparently stronger statement: We can find a subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> so the conclusion holds not only for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" /> but also for every subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Z&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Z" class="latex" title="Z" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="Y" class="latex" title="Y" />. </span></p>
<h2>Staircase Convexity</h2>
<p>The work of Bukh, Loh, and Nivasch relied on an important method of “staircase convexity”. An earlier 2001 application of the method (where it was introduced) was for lower bounds on weak epsilon nets by Bukh, Matousek, and Nivasch (Here are links to the paper, and to <a href="http://www.borisbukh.org/geomselthms_talk.pdf">slides from a talk by Boris Bukh</a>. See also <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/04/22/gil-kalai-the-weak-epsilon-net-problem/">this post</a> and <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/05/nathan-rubin-improved-the-bound-for-planar-weak-%CE%B5-nets-and-other-news-from-ein-gedi/">this one</a> of the weak epsilon net problem.) Roughly the idea is this: consider a stretched grid where the sequence of coordinates are very very fast growing. When you choose configuration of points in such a grid questions regarding their convex hulls translate to purely combinatorial problems.</p>

In their <a href="http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/CM/CM_1935__2_/CM_1935__2__463_0/CM_1935__2__463_0.pdf">seminal 1935 paper</a>, Erdős and Szekeres showed that <em>ES(n)</em> is finite.</p>
<p>The finiteness of ES(n) can be states as follows: Given a sequence of N points in general position in the plane <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x_1%2Cx_2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_N&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="x_1,x_2, \dots , x_N" class="latex" title="x_1,x_2, \dots , x_N" />  there is a subsequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1_i%2Cx_2%2C+%5Cdots+%2C+x_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="1_i,x_2, \dots , x_n" class="latex" title="1_i,x_2, \dots , x_n" /> such that the line segments <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bx_i%2Cx_k%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="[x_i,x_k]" class="latex" title="[x_i,x_k]" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Bx_j%2Cx_%5Cell+%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="[x_j,x_\ell ]" class="latex" title="[x_j,x_\ell ]" /> intersect. With this statement, the Erdős and Szekeres’ theorem can be seen as identifying a universal set of points in term of its <em>Radon partitions </em>(or equivalently in term of its <em>order type</em>).</p>
<h3>In high dimensions</h3>
<p>In higher dimension we can define <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" /> and replace “in convex position” by “in cyclic position”. The finiteness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" /> (with terrible bounds) follows easily from various Ramsey results.

<h3>Por’s result</h3>
<p>Por’s result can be seen as a far-reaching strengthening of the finiteness of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES_d%28n%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES_d(n)" class="latex" title="ES_d(n)" />.</p>
<h2>Further Discussion:</h2>
<h3>High order order types?</h3>
<p>Can you base a higher-order notion of “order types” on Tverberg partitions?</p>
<p>The <strong>order type</strong> of a sequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> points affinely spanning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" />, is the described by the vector of signs (0, 1 or -1) of volume of simplices described by subsequences of length <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+1" class="latex" title="d+1" />. Equivalently the order type can be described by the minimal Radon partitions of the points.</p>
<ol>
<li>We can first ask if we can base a notion of higher order types on Tverberg’s partitions to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> parts where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r%3E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r&gt;2" class="latex" title="r&gt;2" />.</li>
<li>Next we can ask for an associated notion of “highr order oriented matroids.” (Oriented matroids in the usual sense are abstract order types which coincide with Euclidean order types for every subsequence of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=d%2B3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="d+3" class="latex" title="d+3" /> points.)</li>
<li>A natural question regarding these “higher order types is: If a sequence of points in strong general position is Tverberg-equivalent to stretched points on the moment curve, does it apply to all of its subsequences?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to consider “higher” order types is to enlarge the family by to start with a family of points add to it all Radon points of minimal Radon’s partition and consider the order type of the new configuration. (This operation can be repeated <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="r" class="latex" title="r" /> times.) See <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00147418">this paper of Michael Kallay on points sets which contains their Radon points</a>.</p>
<h3>Staircase convexity order types</h3>
<p>Understanding order types of configuration of points on stretched grids of Bukh et al. is a very interesting problem. It is interesting to understand such configurations that are not in general position as well. (In particular, which matroids are supported on the stretched grid?) Of course, the method may well have many more application.</p>
<h3>Fantastically strong forms of Sierksma’s conjecture</h3>
<p>Is the following true: For every sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%3D%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="n=(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="n=(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> there is a Sierksma’s configuration <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> of $n$ points so that every Tverberg’s partition of  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="S" class="latex" title="S" /> is a Tverberg’s partition of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />?</p>
<p>An even stronger version is:</p>
<p>Does every sequence <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%28d%2B1%29%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="(r-1)(d+1)+1" class="latex" title="(r-1)(d+1)+1" /> points in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5Ed&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^d" class="latex" title="R^d" /> there is a tree-like simple hypergraphs so that all the rainbow coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> correspond to Tverberg partitions of the sequence? If true this will be a fantastically strong version of Sierksma’s conjecture.</p>
<h3>Is the Erdős-Szekeres’ conjecture outrageous?</h3>
<p>Erdős and Szekeres proved in 1935 that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29%5Cle+%7B%7B2n-4%7D%5Cchoose%7Bn-2%7D%7D%2B1%3D4%5E%7Bn-o%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n)\le {{2n-4}\choose{n-2}}+1=4^{n-o(n)}" class="latex" title="ES(n)\le {{2n-4}\choose{n-2}}+1=4^{n-o(n)}" />, and in 1960, they showed that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29+%5Cge+2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n) \ge 2^{n-2}+1" class="latex" title="ES(n) \ge 2^{n-2}+1" />, and conjectured this to be optimal. Despite the efforts of many researchers, until recently no improvement in the order of magnitude has ever been made on the upper bound over  81 years. A  recent breakthrough result by Andrew Suk (Here are links<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08657"> to the paper</a>, and to<a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2016/05/04/the-erdos-szekeres-polygon-problem-solved-asymptotically-by-andrew-suk/"> our post discussing the result</a>) asserts that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29%3D2%5E%7Bn%2Bo%28n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n)=2^{n+o(n)}" class="latex" title="ES(n)=2^{n+o(n)}" />. <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/259844/the-most-outrageous-or-ridiculous-conjectures-in-mathematics">Sometime ago I asked over MO a question on outrageous mathematical conjectures</a> and perhaps the conjecture that  <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=ES%28n%29+%3D+2%5E%7Bn-2%7D%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="ES(n) = 2^{n-2}+1" class="latex" title="ES(n) = 2^{n-2}+1" /> on the nose is an example.</p>

<h3>Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, Danylo Radchenko, and Maryna Viazovska: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05438">Universal optimality of the E8 and Leech lattices and interpolation formulas</a></h3>
<p><strong>Abstract: </strong>We prove that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=E_8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="E_8" class="latex" title="E_8" /> root lattice and the Leech lattice are universally optimal among point configurations in Euclidean spaces of dimensions 8 and 24, respectively. In other words, they minimize energy for every potential function that is a completely monotonic function of squared distance (for example, inverse power laws or Gaussians), which is a strong form of robustness not previously known for any configuration in more than one dimension. This theorem implies their recently shown optimality as sphere packings, and broadly generalizes it to allow for long-range interactions.</p>
<p>The proof uses sharp linear programming bounds for energy. To construct the optimal auxiliary functions used to attain these bounds, we prove a new interpolation theorem, which is of independent interest. It reconstructs a radial Schwartz function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> from the values and radial derivatives of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="f" class="latex" title="f" /> and its Fourier transform <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chat+f&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="\hat f" class="latex" title="\hat f" /> at the radii √2π for integers <em>n ≥ 1</em> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E8&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^8" class="latex" title="R^8" /> and <em>n ≥ 2</em> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R%5E%7B24%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="R^{24}" class="latex" title="R^{24}" />. To prove this theorem, we construct an interpolation basis using integral transforms of quasimodular forms, generalizing Viazovska’s work on sphere packing and placing it in the context of a more conceptual theory.</p></div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: In the subgraph counting problem, we are given a (large) graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%28V%2C+E%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G(V, E)" class="latex" title="G(V, E)" /> and a (small) graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> (e.g., a triangle), and the goal is to estimate the number of occurrences of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. Our focus in this talk is on designing sublinear-time algorithms for approximately computing number of occurrences of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> in the setting where the algorithm is given query access to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. This problem has been studied in several recent work which primarily focused on specific families of graphs H such as triangles, cliques, and stars. However, not much is known about approximate counting of arbitrary graphs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in the literature. This is in sharp contrast to the closely related subgraph enumeration problem in which the goal is to list all copies of the subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />. The AGM bound shows that the maximum number of occurrences of any arbitrary subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="m" class="latex" title="m" /> edges is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E%7Bp%28H%29%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(m^{p(H)})" class="latex" title="O(m^{p(H)})" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p%28H%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="p(H)" class="latex" title="p(H)" /> is the fractional edge cover number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />, and enumeration algorithms with matching runtime are known for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />.</p>
<p>In this talk, we bridge this gap between the subgraph counting and subgraph enumeration problems and present a simple sublinear-time algorithm that estimates the number of occurrences of any arbitrary graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="G" class="latex" title="G" />, denoted by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%23H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\#H" class="latex" title="\#H" />, to within a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%281+%5Cpm+%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="(1 \pm \varepsilon)" class="latex" title="(1 \pm \varepsilon)" />-approximation factor with high probability in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E%7Bp%28H%29%7D+%2F%5C%23H%29%5Ccdot+%5Ctext%7Bpoly%7D%28%5Clog+n%2C1%2F%5Cvarepsilon%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(m^{p(H)} /\#H)\cdot \text{poly}(\log n,1/\varepsilon)" class="latex" title="O(m^{p(H)} /\#H)\cdot \text{poly}(\log n,1/\varepsilon)" /> time. Our algorithm is allowed the standard set of queries for general graphs, namely degree queries, pair queries and neighbor queries, plus an additional edge-sample query that returns an edge chosen uniformly at random. The performance of our algorithm matches those of Eden et al. [FOCS 2015, STOC 2018] for counting triangles and cliques and extend them to all choices of subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" /> under the additional assumption of edge-sample queries. Our results are also applicable to the more general problem of database join size estimation problem and for this slightly more general problem achieve optimal bounds for every choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="H" class="latex" title="H" />.</p>

So you've got an iPhone XS in Space Grey. Congrats, so do 20 million other people. Maybe you have different cases but otherwise the hardware in all these phones are virtually identical. Yet you can tell with a glance that this is your phone. You can personalize apps and other elements of the home screen. It's your calendar and email and music.<br />
<br />
What? You've dropped your phone over Niagara falls. Luckily you've backed up your data. So you go back to Apple and buy another Space Grey iPhone XS and restore your data. Physically it's a completely different phone but for all practical purposes it's though you still had the original phone. Your phone is not defined by the device but the data that resides on it.<br />
<br />
It's not just phones. I can log into Google on anyone's Chrome browser and it will feel like my machine.<br />
<br />
Now we've all heard about a future world where nobody owns cars and we get driven around in self-driving Ubers, Lyfts and Waymos. One argument against this world is that people feel connected to their cars and unwilling to commute in some generic vehicle. But one can also imagine the car knows who you are, knows how you like your music, your lighting, how you adjust your seats even how your car drives. It becomes your car. Maybe even has electronic bumper stickers that change to support your political party.<br />
<br />
You can imagine the same for hotel rooms, your office, maybe even your apartment. It won't replicate your dog (or will it?) but as we get define more by our data than our things, do our things matter at all?</div>

<p>A few weeks ago, I was at <a href="http://jila.colorado.edu/qip2019/">QIP’2019</a> in Boulder, CO.  This week I was at <a href="http://physics.unm.edu/SQuInT/2019/index.php">SQuInT’2019</a> in Albuquerque, NM.  There were lots of amazing talks—feel free to ask in the comments section.</p>



<p>There’s an interview with me at the website “GigaOm,” conducted by Byron Reese and entitled <a href="https://gigaom.com/2019/01/17/quantum-computing-capabilities-and-limits-an-interview-with-scott-aaronson/">Quantum Computing: Capabilities and Limits</a>.  I didn’t proofread the transcript and it has some errors in it, but hopefully the meaning comes through.  In other interview news, if you were interested in my podcast with Adam Ford in Melbourne but don’t like YouTube, Adam has helpfully prepared transcripts of the two longest segments: <a href="http://www.scifuture.org/the-ghost-in-the-quantum-turing-machine-scott-aaronson/">The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine</a> and <a href="http://www.scifuture.org/the-winding-road-to-quantum-supremacy-scott-aaronson/">The Winding Road to Quantum Supremacy</a>.</p>



<p>The <em>New York Times</em> ran an article entitled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html">The Hard Part of Computer Science? Getting Into Class</a>, about the surge in computer science majors all over the US, and the shortage of professors to teach them.  The article’s go-to example of a university where this is happening is UT Austin, and there’s extensive commentary from my department chair, Don Fussell.</p>



<p>The <a href="http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2019/STOC%202019%20accepted%20papers.html">STOC’2019 accepted papers list</a> is finally out.  Lots of cool stuff!</p></div>

You've probably heard the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
               At first I didn't want to get an X but now that I have it, I can't imagine life without one.<br />
<br />
X could be telegraph, radio, TV, color TV, VCR, CD player, streaming, Netflix, Amazon prime, an uber account, Washer and Dryer, Car Phones (remember those), Cell Phones. If you go back in history  wrist watches or sun dials (or wrist-sun-dials!).<br />
<br />
This has happened to me recently though not with an object. I read an article someplace saying that ze can be used instead of he or she. It was referring to nonbinaries (using `they' never quite sounded right) but actually it would be great if this was a general genderless pronoun. I am not making a political statement here (although I doubt I have any readers who are against genderless pronouns).<br />
<br />
Once I came across the term ze I found places to use it and now I can't imagine not using it.<br />
<br />
In a recent article I wrote I needed to say that someone was probably confused, but I did not know their gender. I used<br />
<br />
                                                         Ze was probably confused<br />
<br />
which is much better than<br />
<br />
                                                         S/he was probably confused<br />
<br />
                                                         He or she was probably confused<br />
<br />
                                                         The student was probably confused<br />
<br />
                                                         They were probably confused.<br />
<br />
Note that the first two leave out nonbinaries.<br />
<br />
0) In the article I put in a footnote saying what ze meant. In the future I may not have to.<br />
<br />
1) Will ze catch on? This blog post is an attempt to hasten the practice.<br />
<br />
2) Is there a term for his/her that is non-gendered? If not then maybe zer.<br />
<br />
3) Will there be political pushback on this usage? If its phrased as a way to include nonbinaries than unfortunately yes. If its phrased as above as when you don't know the gender, what do you do, then no.<br />
<br />
4) Is <i> nonbinary </i>the correct term? If not then please politely correct me in the comments.<br />
<br />
5) Has Ms replaced Miss and Mrs?<br />
<br />
I have used the term ze several times since then- often when I get email from a student such that I can't tell from the first name what their gender is, and I need to forward the email, such as<br />
<br />
                   Ze wants to take honors discrete math but does not have the prerequisite, but<br />
                   since ze placed in the top five in the math olympiad, we'll let zer take it.<br />
<br />

<p>The other day I was derailed by this tweet from Fermat’s Library:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/inverse-factorial-tweet.png" height="385" width="592" alt="Inverse factorial tweet" border="0" class="aligncenter" /></p>
<p class="undent">The moment I saw it, I had to stop in my tracks, grab a scratch pad, and check out the formula. The result made sense in a rough-and-ready sort of way. Since the multiplicative version of \(n!\) goes to infinity as \(n\) increases, the “divisive” version should go to zero. And \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\) does exactly that; the polynomial function \(n^2\) grows slower than the exponential function \(n!\) for large enough \(n\):</p>
<p>\[\frac{1}{1}, \frac{4}{2}, \frac{9}{6}, \frac{16}{24}, \frac{25}{120}, \frac{36}{720}, \frac{49}{5040}, \frac{64}{40320}, \frac{81}{362880}, \frac{100}{3628800}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">But why does the quotient take the particular form \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\)? Where does the \(n^2\) come from?</p>
<p>To answer that question, I had to revisit the long-ago trauma of learning to divide fractions, but I pushed through the pain. Proceeding from left to right through the formula in the tweet, we first get \(\frac{n}{n-1}\). Then, dividing that quantity by \(n-2\) yields</p>
<p>\[\cfrac{\frac{n}{n-1}}{n-2} = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">Continuing in the same way, we ultimately arrive at:</p>
<p>\[n \mathbin{/} (n-1) \mathbin{/} (n-2) \mathbin{/} (n-3) \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} 1 = \frac{n}{(n-1) (n-2) (n-3) \cdots 1} = \frac{n}{(n-1)!}\]</p>
<p class="undent">To recover the tweet’s stated result of \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\), just multiply numerator and denominator by \(n\). (To my taste, however, \(\frac{n}{(n-1)!}\) is the more perspicuous expression.)</p>
<hr />
<p>I am a card-carrying factorial fanboy. You can keep your fancy Fibonaccis; <em>this</em> is my favorite function. Every time I try out a new programming language, my first exercise is to write a few routines for calculating factorials. Over the years I have pondered several variations on the theme, such as replacing \(\times\) with \(+\) in the definition (which produces triangular numbers). But I don’t think I’ve ever before considered substituting \(\mathbin{/}\) for \(\times\). It’s messy. Because multiplication is commutative and associative, you can define \(n!\) simply as the product of all the integers from \(1\) through \(n\), without worrying about the order of the operations. With division, order can’t be ignored. In general, \(x \mathbin{/} y \ne y \mathbin{/}x\), and \((x \mathbin{/} y) \mathbin{/} z \ne x \mathbin{/} (y \mathbin{/} z)\).</p>
<p>The Fermat’s Library tweet puts the factors in descending order: \(n, n-1, n-2, \ldots, 1\). The most obvious alternative is the ascending sequence \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\). What happens if we define the divisive factorial as \(1 \mathbin{/} 2 \mathbin{/}  3 \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} n\)? Another visit to the schoolroom algorithm for dividing fractions yields this simple answer:</p>
<p>\[1 \mathbin{/} 2 \mathbin{/}  3 \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} n = \frac{1}{2 \times 3 \times 4 \times \cdots \times n} = \frac{1}{n!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">In other words, when we repeatedly divide while counting up from \(1\) to \(n\), the final quotient is the reciprocal of \(n!\).  (I wish I could put an exclamation point at the end of that sentence!) If you’re looking for a canonical answer to the question, “What do you get if you divide instead of multiplying in \(n!\)?” I would argue that \(\frac{1}{n!}\) is a better candidate than \(\frac{n}{(n - 1)!}\). Why not embrace the symmetry between \(n!\) and its inverse?</p>
<p>Of course there are many other ways to arrange the <em>n</em> integers in the set \(\{1 \ldots n\}\). How many ways? As it happens, \(n!\) of them! Thus it would seem there are \(n!\) distinct ways to define the divisive \(n!\) function. However, looking at the answers for the two permutations discussed above suggests there’s a simpler pattern at work. Whatever element of the sequence happens to come first winds up in the numerator of a big fraction, and the denominator is the product of all the other elements. As a result, there are really only \(n\) different outcomes—assuming we stick to performing the division operations from left to right. For any integer \(k\) between \(1\) and \(n\), putting \(k\) at the head of the queue creates a divisive \(n!\) equal to \(k\) divided by all the other factors. We can write this out as:</p>
<p>\[\cfrac{k}{\frac{n!}{k}}, \text{ which can be rearranged as } \frac{k^2}{n!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">And thus we also solve the minor mystery of how \(\frac{n}{(n-1)!}\) became \(\frac{n^2}{n!}\) in the tweet.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that all of these functions converge to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity. Asymptotically speaking, \(\frac{1^2}{n!}, \frac{2^2}{n!}, \ldots, \frac{n^2}{n!}\) are all alike.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ta dah! Mission accomplished. Problem solved. Done and dusted. Now we know everything there is to know about divisive factorials, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe there’s one more question. What does the computer say? If you take your favorite factorial algorithm, and do as the tweet suggests, replacing any appearance of the \(\times\) (or <code>*</code>) operator with <code>/</code>, what happens? Which of the \(n\) variants of divisive \(n!\) does the program produce?</p>
<p>Here’s <em>my</em> favorite algorithm for computing factorials, in the form of a <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> program:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function mul!(n)
    if n == 1
        return 1
    else
        return n * mul!(n - 1)
    end
end
</code></pre>
<p>This is the algorithm that has introduced generations of nerds to the concept of recursion. In narrative form it says: If \(n\) is \(1\), then \(mul!(n)\) is \(1\). Otherwise, evaluate the function \(mul!(n-1)\), then multiply the result by \(n\). You might ask what happens if \(n\) is zero or negative. You might ask, but please don’t. For present purposes, \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).Starting with any positive \(n\), the sequence of recursive calls must eventually bottom out with \(n = 1\).</p>
<p>The function can be written more tersely using Julia’s one-liner style of definition:.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>mul!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : n * mul!(n - 1)</code></pre>
<p>The right side of the assignment statement is a conditional expression, or ternary operator, which has the form <code>a ? b : c</code>. Here <code>a</code> is a boolean test clause, which must return a value of either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>, clause <code>b</code> is evaluated, and the result becomes the value of the entire expression. Otherwise clause <code>c</code> is evaluated.</p>
<p>Just to be sure I’ve got this right, here are the first 10 factorials, as calculated by this program:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>[mul!(n) for n in 1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
       1
       2
       6
      24
     120
     720
    5040
   40320
  362880
 3628800</code></pre>
<p class="indent">Now let’s edit that definition and convert the single occurence of <code>*</code> to a <code>/</code>, leaving everything else (except the name of the function) unchanged.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>div!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : n / div!(n - 1)</code></pre>
<p>And here’s what comes back when we run the program for values of \(n\) from \(1\) through \(20\):</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>[div!(n) for n in 1:20]
20-element Array{Real,1}:
 1

<p>Huh? That sure doesn’t look like it’s converging to zero—not as \(\frac{1}{n!}\) or as \(\frac{n}{n - 1}\). As a matter of fact, it doesn’t look like it’s going to converge at all. The graph below suggests the sequence is made up of two alternating components, both of which appear to be slowly growing toward infinity as well as diverging from one another.</p>

<p class="indent">In trying to make sense of what we’re seeing here, it helps to change the output type of the <code>div!</code> function. Instead of applying the division operator <code>/</code>, which returns the quotient as a floating-point number, we can substitute the  <code>//</code> operator, which returns an exact rational quotient, reduced to lowest terms.</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>div!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : n // div!(n - 1)</code></pre>
<p class="undent">Here’s the sequence of values for <code>n in 1:20</code>:</p>

<p>The list is full of curious patterns. It’s a double helix, with even numbers and odd numbers zigzagging in complementary strands. The even numbers are not just even; they are all powers of \(2\). Also, they appear in pairs—first in the numerator, then in the denominator—and their sequence is nondecreasing. But there are gaps; not all powers of \(2\) are present. The odd strand looks even more complicated, with various small prime factors flitting in and out of the numbers. (The primes <em>have</em> to be small—smaller than \(n\), anyway.)</p>
<p>This outcome took me by surprise. I had really expected to see a much tamer sequence, like those I worked out with pencil and paper. All those jagged, jitterbuggy ups and downs made no sense. Nor did the overall trend of unbounded growth in the ratio. How could you keep dividing and dividing, and wind up with bigger and bigger numbers?</p>
<p>At this point you may want to pause before reading on, and try to work out your own theory of where these zigzag numbers are coming from. If you need a hint, you can get a strong one—almost a spoiler—by looking up the sequence of numerators or the sequence of denominators in the <a href="http://oeis.org">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s another hint. A small edit to the <code>div!</code> program completely transforms the output. Just flip the final clause, changing <code>n // div!(n - 1)</code> into <code>div!(n - 1) // n</code>. </p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>div!(n)  =  n == 1 ? 1 : div!(n - 1) // n</code></pre>
<p class="undent">Now the results look like this:</p>

<p>This is the inverse factorial function we’ve already seen, the series of quotients generated when you march left to right through an ascending sequence of divisors \(1 \mathbin{/} 2 \mathbin{/}  3 \mathbin{/} \cdots \mathbin{/} n\). </p>
<p>It’s no surprise that flipping the final clause in the procedure alters the outcome. After all, we know that division is not commutative or associative. What’s not so easy to see is why the sequence of quotients generated by the original program takes that weird zigzag form. What mechanism is giving rise to those paired powers of 2 and the alternation of odd and even?</p>
<p>I have found that it’s easier to explain what’s going on in the zigzag sequence when I describe an iterative version of the procedure, rather than the recursive one. (This is an embarrassing admission for someone who has argued that recursive definitions are easier to reason about, but there you have it.) Here’s the program:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function div!_iter(n)
    q = 1
    for i in 1:n
        q = i // q
    end
    return q
end</code></pre>
<p>I submit that this looping procedure is operationally identical to the recursive function, in the sense that if <code>div!(n)</code> and <code>div!_iter(n)</code> both return a result for some positive integer <code>n</code>, it will always be the same result. Here’s my evidence: </p>

<p>To understand the process that gives rise to these numbers, consider the successive values of the variables \(i\) and \(q\) each time the loop is executed. Initially, \(i\) and \(q\) are both set to \(1\); hence, after the first passage through the loop, the statement <code>q = i // q</code> gives \(q\) the value \(\frac{1}{1}\). Next time around, \(i = 2\) and \(q = \frac{1}{1}\), so \(q\)’s new value is \(\frac{2}{1}\). On the third iteration, \(i = 3\) and \(q = \frac{2}{1}\), yielding \(\frac{i}{q} \rightarrow \frac{3}{2}\). If this is still confusing, try thinking of \(\frac{i}{q}\) as \(i \times \frac{1}{q}\). The crucial observation is that on every passage through the loop, \(q\) is inverted, becoming \(\frac{1}{q}\).</p>
<p>If you unwind these operations, and look at the multiplications and divisions that go into each element of the series, a pattern emerges:</p>
<p>\[\frac{1}{1}, \quad \frac{2}{1}, \quad \frac{1 \cdot 3}{2}, \quad \frac{2 \cdot 4}{1 \cdot 3}, \quad \frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}{2 \cdot 4} \quad \frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5}\]</p>
<p class="undent">The general form is:</p>
<p>\[\frac{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot n}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)} \quad (\text{odd } n) \qquad  \frac{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot \cdots \cdot n}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)} \quad (\text{even } n).<br />
\]</p>
<hr />
<p>The functions \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots \cdot n\) for odd \(n\) and \(2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot \cdots \cdot n\) for even \(n\) have a name! They are known as double factorials, with the notation \(n!!\). Terrible terminology, no? Better to have named them “semi-factorials.” And if I didn’t know better, I would read \(n!!\) as “the factorial of the factorial.” The double factorial of <em>n</em> is defined as the product of <em>n</em> and all smaller positive integers of the same parity. Thus our peculiar sequence of zigzag quotients is simply \(\frac{n!!}{(n-1)!!}\).</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/math.mag.85.3.177">2012 article</a> by Henry W. Gould and Jocelyn Quaintance (behind a paywall, regrettably) surveys the applications of double factorials. They turn up more often than you might guess. In the middle of the 17th century John Wallis came up with this identity:</p>
<p>\[\frac{\pi}{2} = \frac{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 6 \cdots}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdots} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{((2n)!!)^2}{(2n + 1)!!(2n - 1)!!}\]</p>
<p class="undent">An even weirder series, involving the cube of a quotient of double factorials, sums to \(\frac{2}{\pi}\). That one was discovered by (who else?) Srinivasa Ramanujan.</p>
<p>Gould and Quaintance also discuss the double factorial counterpart of binomial coefficients. The standard binomial coefficient is defined as:</p>
<p>\[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">The double version is:</p>
<p>\[\left(\!\binom{n}{k}\!\right) = \frac{n!!}{k!! (n-k)!!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">Note that our zigzag numbers fit this description and therefore qualify as double factorial binomial coefficients. Specifically, they are the numbers:</p>
<p>\[\left(\!\binom{n}{1}\!\right) = \left(\!\binom{n}{n - 1}\!\right) = \frac{n!!}{1!! (n-1)!!}.\]</p>
<p class="undent">The regular binomial \(\binom{n}{1}\) is not very interesting; it is simply equal to \(n\). But the doubled version \(\left(\!\binom{n}{1}\!\right)\), as we’ve seen, dances a livelier jig. And, unlike the single binomial, it is not always an integer. (The only integer values are \(1\) and \(2\).)</p>
<p>Seeing the zigzag numbers as ratios of double factorials explains quite a few of their properties, starting with the alternation of evens and odds. We can also see why all the even numbers in the sequence are powers of 2. Consider the case of \(n = 6\). The numerator of this fraction is \(2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 48\), which acquires a factor of \(3\) from the \(6\). But the denominator is \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 15\). The \(3\)s above and below cancel, leaving \(\frac{16}{5}\). Such cancelations will happen in every case. Whenever an odd factor \(m\) enters the even sequence, it must do so in the form \(2 \cdot m\), but at that point \(m\) itself must already be present in the odd sequence.</p>
<hr />
<p>Is the sequence of zigzag numbers a reasonable answer to the question, “What happens when you divide instead of multiply in \(n!\)?” Or is the computer program that generates them just a buggy algorithm? My personal judgment is that \(\frac{1}{n!}\) is a more intuitive answer, but \(\frac{n!!}{(n - 1)!!}\) is more interesting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the mere existence of the zigzag sequence broadens our horizons. As noted above, if you insist that the division algorithm must always chug along the list of \(n\) factors in order, at each stop dividing the number on the left by the number on the right, then there are only \(n\) possible outcomes, and they all look much alike. But the zigzag solution suggests wilder possibilities. We can formulate the task as follows. Take the set of factors \(\{1 \dots n\}\), select a subset, and invert all the elements of that subset; now multiply all the factors, both the inverted and the upright ones. If the inverted subset is empty, the result is the ordinary factorial \(n!\). If <em>all</em> of the factors are inverted, we get the inverse \(\frac{1}{n!}\). And if every second factor is inverted, starting with \(n - 1\), the result is an element of the zigzag sequence.</p>
<p>These are only a few among the many possible choices; in total there are \(2^n\) subsets of \(n\) items. For example, you might invert every number that is prime or a power of a prime \((2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, \dots)\). For small \(n\), the result jumps around but remains consistently less than \(1\):</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/prime-powers.svg" height="" width="" alt="Prime powers" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">If I were to continue this plot to larger \(n\), however, it would take off for the stratosphere. Prime powers get sparse farther out on the number line.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here’s a question. We’ve seen factorial variants that go to zero as \(n\) goes to infinity, such as \(1/n!\). We’ve seen other variants grow without bound as \(n\) increases, including \(n!\) itself, and the zigzag numbers. Are there any versions of the factorial process that converge to a finite bound other than zero?</p>
<p>My first thought was this algorithm:</p>
<pre class="language-julia"><code>function greedy_balance(n)
    q = 1
    while n &gt; 0
        q = q &gt; 1 ? q /= n : q *= n
        n -= 1
    end
    return q
end</code></pre>
<p class="undent">We loop through the integers from \(n\) down to \(1\), calculating the running product/quotient \(q\) as we go. At each step, if the current value of \(q\) is greater than \(1\), we divide by the next factor; otherwise, we multiply. This scheme implements a kind of feedback control or target-seeking behavior. If \(q\) gets too large, we reduce it; too small and we increase it. I conjectured that as \(n\) goes to infinity, \(q\) would settle into an ever-narrower range of values near \(1\).</p>
<p>Running the experiment gave me another surprise:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/greedy_balance_linear.svg" height="" width="" alt="Greedy balance linear" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">That sawtooth wave is not quite what I expected. One minor peculiarity is that the curve is not symmetric around \(1\); the excursions above have higher amplitude than those below. But this distortion is more visual than mathematical. Because \(q\) is a ratio, the distance from \(1\) to \(10\) is the same as the distance from \(1\) to \(\frac{1}{10}\), but it doesn’t look that way on a linear scale. The remedy is to plot the log of the ratio:</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/greedy_balance.svg" height="" width="" alt="Greedy balance" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p>Now the graph is symmetric, or at least approximately so, centered on \(0\), which is the logarithm of \(1\). But a larger mystery remains. The sawtooth waveform is very regular, with a period of \(4\), and it shows no obvious signs of shrinking toward the expected limiting value of \(\log q = 0\). Numerical evidence suggests that as \(n\) goes to infinity the peaks of this curve converge on a value just above \(q = \frac{5}{3}\), and the troughs approach a value just below \(q = \frac{3}{5}\). (The corresponding base-\(10\) logarithms are roughly \(\pm0.222\). I have not worked out why this should be so. Perhaps someone will explain it to me.</p>
<p>The failure of this greedy algorithm doesn’t mean we can’t find a divisive factorial that converges to \(q = 1\). If we work with the logarithms of the factors, this procedure becomes an instance of a well-known compu­tational problem called the number partitioning problem. You are given a set of real numbers and asked to divide it into two sets whose sums are equal, or as close to equal as possible. It’s a certifiably hard problem, but it has also been called (<a href="http://bit-player.org/bph-publications/AmSci-2002-03-Hayes-NPP.pdf">PDF</a>) “the easiest hard problem.”For any given \(n\), we might find that inverting some other subset of the factors gives a better approximation to \(n! = 1\). For small \(n\), we can solve the problem by brute force: Just look at all \(2^n\) subsets and pick the best one.</p>
<p>I have computed the optimal partitionings up to \(n = 30\), where there are a billion possibilities to choose from.</p>
<p><img src="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/optimum_balance_graph.svg" height="" width="" alt="Optimum balance graph" border="0" class="centered" /></p>
<p class="undent">The graph is clearly flatlining. You could use the same method to force convergence to any other value between \(0\) and \(n!\).</p>
<p>And thus we have yet another answer to the question in the tweet that launched this adventure. What happens when you divide instead of multiply in n!? Anything you want.</p></div>

<p>I recently wrote here about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/09/05/big-convex-polygons.html">big convex polygons in grids</a>, a problem for which we know very precise answers. This naturally raises the question: what about higher dimensions? How many vertices can be part of a convex polyhedron in an  grid, or more generally a convex polytope in a -dimensional grid of side length ? Here we do still know some pretty good answers, at least up to constant factors in spaces of constant dimension.</p>

<p>The problem is included in a 2008 survey by Imre Bárány,<sup id="fnref:bar"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:bar" class="footnote">1</a></sup> according to whom the maximum number of vertices is</p>



<p>For instance, in three dimensional  grids the maximum number of vertices is .</p>

<p>One way to find polyhedra with this many vertices is to take the convex hull of the points in a ball,<sup id="fnref:bl"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:bl" class="footnote">2</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:bd"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:bd" class="footnote">3</a></sup> or in scaled copies of any fixed smooth convex body. Another way, which should generate polyhedra with a somewhat less irregular appearance and (up to constant factors) the same number of vertices, is to take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition">Minkowski sum</a> of all line segments (up to scaling and translation) that will fit into a smaller grid, of side length . For instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_rhombicuboctahedron">truncated rhombicuboctahedron</a> below<sup id="fnref:ruen"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:ruen" class="footnote">4</a></sup> is the Minkowski sum of all the line segments that fit into a unit cube. Its 96 vertices lie in a  grid. In general, this method produces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonohedron">zonohedron</a> whose complexity can be analyzed in terms of a -dimensional arrangement of  hyperplanes. As long as this arrangement is not too degenerate (which it appears not to be, but I haven’t worked out the details carefully) this should give
a number of vertices within a constant factor of the number coming from the convex hull construction.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/truncated-rhombicuboctahedron2.png" alt="Truncated rhombicuboctahedron" /></p>

<p>A matching upper bound comes from a 1963 paper by G. K. Andrews,<sup id="fnref:and"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:and" class="footnote">5</a></sup> and Bárány writes that although several more proofs have been published none of them is easy. I’m not sure whether the difficulty is in getting the exact bound or in the fact that Andrews and the later proofs allow more general shapes with volume  that don’t fit into a grid, but it’s not hard to get close to the right bound simply by counting the number of possible facets of a given volume . By using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm">lattice basis reduction</a> the integer vectors in the hyperplane through any facet have a nearly-orthogonal basis whose product of lengths is proportional to . By considering how this product of lengths can be broken down into factors of different scales, and counting how many integer vectors of those lengths exist, it follows that the number of possible facets of volume  is . Combining this with the  surface area of a grid polytope gives the correct upper bound on the number of vertices up to a polylog factor.</p>

<p>What about when the dimension is not constant? An easy construction for high dimensions is to take all points with a fixed distance  from the grid center. There are  possible values for the distance, so this construction produces a convex polytope with  vertices. It comes from a 1946 paper by Behrend, who uses this idea to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem%E2%80%93Spencer_set">dense sets of integers with no arithmetic progressions</a>.<sup id="fnref:beh"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:beh" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
It is never worse to use the convex hull of the ball than the points on a sphere,
and a celebrated paper by Elkin from 2011 (in the appendix of the published version) gives another proof of the  bound for convex hulls of balls (for ) in which the constant factor of the  is universal, not depending on . So when  is singly exponential in ,  becomes constant and the convex hull technique produces  vertices, improving Behrend’s construction for progression-free sets by the same  factor.<sup id="fnref:elk"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/02/09/big-convex-polyhedra.html#fn:elk" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
