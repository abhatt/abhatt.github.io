version of the edge-disjoint paths problem if the supply graph together with
the demand edges form a planar graph. By planar duality this is equivalent to
packing cuts in a planar graph such that each cut contains exactly one demand
edge. We also show that the natural linear programming relaxations have
constant integrality gap, yielding an approximate max-multiflow min-multicut
theorem.

an input graph pattern query in a large data graph. Such appearances are called
matches. In this paper, we are interested in finding matches of interaction
patterns in temporal graphs. To this end, we propose a hybrid approach that
achieves effective filtering of potential matches based both on structure and
time. Our approach exploits a graph representation where edges are ordered by
time. We present experiments with real datasets that illustrate the efficiency
of our approach.

adjacency-matrix model is given an approximation parameter $\epsilon \in (0,1)$
and query access to the adjacency matrix of a graph $G=(V,E)$. It is required
to output an estimate of the \emph{distance} between $G$ and the closest graph
$G'=(V,E')$ that satisfies $\mathcal{P}$, where the distance between graphs is
the size of the symmetric difference between their edge sets, normalized by
$|V|^2$. In this work we introduce property covers, as a framework for using
distance-approximation algorithms for "simple" properties to design
distance-approximation. Applying this framework we present
distance-approximation algorithms with $poly(1/\epsilon)$ query complexity for
induced $P_3$-freeness, induced $P_4$-freeness, and Chordality. For induced
$C_4$-freeness our algorithm has query complexity $exp(poly(1/\epsilon))$.
These complexities essentially match the corresponding known results for
testing these properties and provide an exponential improvement on previously
known results.

\emph{feedback vertex set problem} (FVSP) ask for a minimum set of arcs
$\varepsilon \subseteq E$ or vertices $\nu \subseteq V$ whose removal
$G\setminus \varepsilon$, $G\setminus \nu$ makes a given multi-digraph
$G=(V,E)$ acyclic, respectively. The corresponding decision problems are part
of the $21$ NP-complete problems of R. M. Karp's famous list. Though both
problems are known to be APX-hard, approximation algorithms or proofs of
inapproximability are unknown. We propose a new
$\mathcal{O}(|V||E|^4)$-heuristic for the directed FASP. While $r \approx
1.3606$ is known to be a lower bound for the APX-hardness, at least by
validation, we show that $r \leq 2$. Applying the approximation preserving
$L$-reduction from the directed FVSP to the FASP thereby allows computing
feedback vertex sets with the same accuracy.
</p>
<p>Benchmarking the algorithm with state of the art alternatives yields that,
for the first time, the most relevant instance class of large sparse graphs can
be solved efficiently within tight error bounds. Our derived insights might
provide a path to prove the APX-completeness of both problems.

two-dimensional domains. Our work follows two classic results: The
Rad\'o-Kneser-Choquet (RKC) theorem, which establishes the invertibility of
harmonic maps into a convex planer domain; and Tutte's embedding theorem for
planar graphs - RKC's discrete counterpart - which proves the invertibility of
piecewise linear maps of triangulated domains satisfying a discrete-harmonic
principle, into a convex planar polygon. In both theorems, the convexity of the
target domain is essential for ensuring invertibility. We extend these
characterizations, in both the continuous and discrete cases, by replacing
convexity with a less restrictive condition. In the continuous case,
Alessandrini and Nesi provide a characterization of invertible harmonic maps
into non-convex domains with a smooth boundary by adding additional conditions
on orientation preservation along the boundary. We extend their results by
defining a condition on the normal derivatives along the boundary, which we
call the cone condition; this condition is tractable and geometrically
intuitive, encoding a weak notion of local invertibility. The cone condition
enables us to extend Alessandrini and Nesi to the case of harmonic maps into
non-convex domains with a piecewise-smooth boundary. In the discrete case, we
use an analog of the cone condition to characterize invertible
discrete-harmonic piecewise-linear maps of triangulations. This gives an analog
of our continuous results and characterizes invertible discrete-harmonic maps
in terms of the orientation of triangles incident on the boundary.

time algorithm for checking if a given set of integers contains three distinct
elements that sum up to zero. A closely related problem is to check if a given
set of integers contains distinct $x_1, x_2, x_3$ such that $x_1+x_2=2x_3$.
This can be reduced to 3-SUM in almost-linear time, but surprisingly a reverse
reduction establishing 3-SUM hardness was not known.
</p>
<p>We provide such a reduction, thus resolving an open question of Erickson. In
fact, we consider a more general problem called 3-LDT parameterized by integer
parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$ and $t$. In this problem, we need to
check if a given set of integers contains distinct elements $x_1, x_2, x_3$
such that $\alpha_1 x_1+\alpha_2 x_2 +\alpha_3 x_3 = t$. For some combinations
of the parameters, every instance of this problem is a NO-instance or there
exists a simple almost-linear time algorithm. We call such variants trivial. We
prove that all non-trivial variants of 3-LDT are equivalent under subquadratic
reductions. Our main technical contribution is an efficient deterministic
procedure based on the famous Behrend's construction that partitions a given
set of integers into few subsets that avoid a chosen linear equation.

from diverse domains. Many of these problems are NP-hard and designing
efficient heuristics for them requires considerable time and experimentation.
On the other hand, the number of optimization problems in the industry
continues to grow. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been
explored to address this gap. We propose a framework for leveraging machine
learning techniques to scale-up exact combinatorial optimization algorithms. In
contrast to the existing approaches based on deep-learning, reinforcement
learning and restricted Boltzmann machines that attempt to directly learn the
output of the optimization problem from its input (with limited success), our
framework learns the relatively simpler task of pruning the elements in order
to reduce the size of the problem instances. In addition, our framework uses
only interpretable learning models based on intuitive features and thus the
learning process provides deeper insights into the optimization problem and the
instance class, that can be used for designing better heuristics. For the
classical maximum clique enumeration problem, we show that our framework can
prune a large fraction of the input graph (around 99 % of nodes in case of
sparse graphs) and still detect almost all of the maximum cliques. This results
in several fold speedups of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the model
used in our framework highlights that the chi-squared value of neighborhood
degree has a statistically significant correlation with the presence of a node
in a maximum clique, particularly in dense graphs which constitute a
significant challenge for modern solvers. We leverage this insight to design a
novel heuristic for this problem outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our
heuristic is also of independent interest for maximum clique detection and
enumeration.

framework for proving lower bounds for Massively Parallel Computation using
techniques from boolean function complexity. We extend their framework in two
different ways, to capture two common features of Massively Parallel
Computation:
</p>
<p>$\circ$ Adaptivity, where machines can write to and adaptively read from
shared memory throughout the execution of the computation. Recent work of
Behnezhad et al. (SPAA 19) showed that adaptivity enables significantly
improved round complexities for a number of central graph problems.
</p>
<p>$\circ$ Promise problems, where the algorithm only has to succeed on certain
inputs. These inputs may have special structure that is of particular interest,
or they may be representative of hard instances of the overall problem.
</p>
<p>Using this extended framework, we give the first unconditional lower bounds
on the complexity of distinguishing whether an input graph is a cycle of length
$n$ or two cycles of length $n/2$. This promise problem, 1v2-Cycle, has emerged
as a central problem in the study of Massively Parallel Computation. We prove
that any adaptive algorithm for the 1v2-Cycle problem with I/O capacity
$O(n^{\varepsilon})$ per machine requires $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ rounds,
matching a recent upper bound of Behnezhad et al.
</p>
<p>In addition to strengthening the connections between Massively Parallel
Computation and boolean function complexity, we also develop new machinery to
reason about the latter. At the heart of our proofs are optimal lower bounds on
the query complexity and approximate certificate complexity of the 1v2-Cycle
problem.

lower bounds on the competitive ratio are unknown and expected to be difficult
to describe in a short form. A good example is the Online Bin Stretching
problem, in which the task is to pack the incoming items online into bins while
minimizing the load of the largest bin. Additionally, the optimal load of the
entire instance is known in advance.
</p>
<p>The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide the first
non-trivial lower bounds for Online Bin Stretching with 6, 7 and 8 bins, and
increase the best known lower bound for 3 bins. We describe in detail the
algorithmic improvements which were necessary for the discovery of the new
lower bounds, which are several orders of magnitude more complex. The lower
bounds are presented in the form of directed acyclic graphs.
</p>
<p>Second, we use the Coq proof assistant to formalize the Online Bin Stretching
problem and certify these large lower bound graphs. The script we propose
certified as well all the previously claimed lower bounds, which until now were
never formally proven. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first use of a
formal verification toolkit to certify a lower bound for an online problem.

given in a data stream and the goal is to find the $k$ smallest congruent balls
whose union covers the $N$ most recent points of the stream. In this model,
input points are allowed to be examined only once and the amount of space that
can be used to store relative information is limited. Cohen-Addad et
al.~\cite{cohen-2016} gave a $(6+\epsilon)$-approximation for the metric
$k$-center problem using O($k/\epsilon \log \alpha$) points, where $\alpha$ is
the ratio of the largest and smallest distance and is assumed to be known in
advance. In this paper, we present a $(3+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
the Euclidean $1$-center problem using O($1/\epsilon \log \alpha$) points. We
present an algorithm for the Euclidean $k$-center problem that maintains a
coreset of size $O(k)$. Our algorithm gives a $(c+2\sqrt{3} +
\epsilon)$-approximation for the Euclidean $k$-center problem using
O($k/\epsilon \log \alpha$) points by using any given $c$-approximation for the
coreset where $c$ is a positive real number. For example, by using the
$2$-approximation~\cite{feder-greene-1988} of the coreset, our algorithm gives
a $(2+2\sqrt{3} + \epsilon)$-approximation ($\approx 5.465$) using $O(k\log k)$
time. This is an improvement over the approximation factor of $(6+\epsilon)$ by
Cohen-Addad et al.~\cite{cohen-2016} with the same space complexity and smaller
update time per point. Moreover we remove the assumption that $\alpha$ is known
in advance. Our idea can be adapted to the metric diameter problem and the
metric $k$-center problem to remove the assumption. For low dimensional
Euclidean space, we give an approximation algorithm that guarantees an even
better approximation.

composed of min-max regret versions of classical 0-1 optimization problems with
interval costs. We refer to them as interval 0-1 min-max regret problems. The
state-of-the-art exact algorithms for this class of problems work by solving a
corresponding mixed integer linear programming formulation in a Benders'
decomposition fashion. Each of the possibly exponentially many Benders' cuts is
separated on the fly through the resolution of an instance of the classical 0-1
optimization problem counterpart. Since these separation subproblems may be
NP-hard, not all of them can be modeled by means of linear programming, unless
P = NP. In these cases, the convergence of the aforementioned algorithms are
not guaranteed in a straightforward manner. In fact, to the best of our
knowledge, their finite convergence has not been explicitly proved for any
interval 0-1 min-max regret problem. In this work, we formally describe these
algorithms through the definition of a logic-based Benders' decomposition
framework and prove their convergence to an optimal solution in a finite number
of iterations. As this framework is applicable to any interval 0-1 min-max
regret problem, its finite optimal convergence also holds in the cases where
the separation subproblems are NP-hard.

Ginzburg-Landau theory. The Ginzburg-Landau functional has two terms: the
Dirichlet energy of the distribution and a term penalizing the mismatch between
the fixed and actual norm of the distribution. Directional fields on surfaces
are known to have a number of critical points, which are properly identified
with the Ginzburg-Landau approach: the asymptotic behavior of Ginzburg-Landau
problem provides well-distributed critical points over the 2-manifold, whose
indices are as low as possible. The central idea in this paper is to exploit
this theoretical background for crossfield computation on arbitrary surfaces.
Such crossfields are instrumental in the generation of meshes with quadrangular
elements. The relation between the topological properties of quadrangular
meshes and crossfields are hence first recalled. It is then shown that a
crossfield on a surface can be represented by a complex function of unit norm
with a number of critical points, i.e., a nearly everywhere smooth function
taking its values in the unit circle of the complex plane. As maximal
smoothness of the crossfield is equivalent with minimal energy, the crossfield
problem is equivalent to an optimization problem based on Ginzburg-Landau
functional. A discretization scheme with Crouzeix-Raviart elements is applied
and the correctness of the resulting finite element formulation is validated on
the unit disk by comparison with an analytical solution. The method is also
applied to the 2-sphere where, surprisingly but rightly, the computed critical
points are not located at the vertices of a cube, but at those of an anticube.

<div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">For someone based in the UK who works in any kind of international market, it looks reasonable to consider how his business strategy should be affected by leaving the EU. In the case of CS theory research, this perhaps runs counter to an idealised view in which all research is global, and should not be affected by squalid political considerations. The interest inherent in any specific problem or result ought to be independent of where it was studied. On a related note, it may be felt that it’s the research topic that chooses the researcher, not the researcher who chooses the topic. On the other hand, even in CS theory, ones political environment and associated social networks may have a stronger effect than we would like to acknowledge.<br /><br />When I was a graduate student, Algorithms and Computational Complexity was relatively under-represented in the UK, compared with today. The UK theory community was dominated by so-called “Euro-theory”, which at the time did not seem to exhibit obvious points of contact with algorithms research. People like me had to look west for assurance that our research was of wider interest than what was apparent in our own backyard. To further justify that west-looking approach, it was clear that the USA was, in terms of research, the undisputed world leader. Then as now, it collected the lion’s share of Nobel prizes. It had industrial research labs producing leading CS theory research, such as IBM, AT&amp;T, and NEC, while Europe had nothing similar. For me, this sowed the seeds of a defiantly Atlanticist attitude to CS theory research — appropriate for Brexit Britain, perhaps? — that the best way to pursue high-quality research was via links with colleagues in the USA.<br /><br />Fast-forward to about five years ago, and my attitude had softened. The UK’s algorithms-and-complexity community steadily grew, and is much larger than it was in the early 90’s. Travel within Europe is relatively quick and cheap, with no visa issues. The European research community became a bit of a comfort-zone, while the USA’s research ethic seemed comparatively intense and high-pressure. The perennial question of “Where’s my next STOC/FOCS paper going to come from?” has always seemed less urgent in Europe.<br /><br />The EU has attempted to unify Europe’s academic research activity, which is supported by diverse governments, and gives rise to diverse complaints among European colleagues. I am reminded of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle">unhappy families</a>” quote from <i>Anna Karenina</i>. In an attempt to give it a bit of unity, there’s some EU funding for research, concerning which we have this criticism from <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/geim_lecture.pdf">Andre Geim’s Nobel prize speech</a>:  “I can offer no nice words for the EU Framework programmes which, except for the  European Research Council, can be praised only by Europhobes for discrediting the whole idea of an effectively working Europe.” For my part, I recently tried to get a grant from the European Research Council but they turned me down. If I were a rational agent, I should at this point be one of Geim’s Europhobes; of course in reality things are not quite so simple. But at this point I reckon the US research funding system looks like the least worst. <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/athenedonald/2019/12/16/post-election-christmas-reading-list/">A recent article</a> at Athene Donald’s blog discusses the post-EU era and the idea of a DARPA-like research agency for the UK.<br /><br />So, leaving the EU looks like an opportune point to dust off the above-mentioned “Atlanticist attitude”. These days China is also becoming more important. But I hope that Europe will not give up on us, but will compete strenuously with them for our attention.</div></div>

I recently needed to look at what NP problems were possibly intermediary (neither in P nor NP-complete). So I went to Wikipedia and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-intermediate">this</a>.<br />
<br />
They had many problems, though some I had never heard of. Those that I had never heard of<br />
<br />
<i>should they be on the list?</i><br />
<i><br />
</i> That is, are they natural? That is hard to define rigorously, but I will take you through my train of thought as I read the first few:<br />
<br />
<b>Factoring Integers</b>. Yes, quite possibly intermediary: If  its NPC then PH collapses, and, at least so far, does not seem to be in P.  (the NPC--&gt; PH collapse result: We take<br />
<br />
FACT = { (n,x) : n has a nontrivial factor ≤ x }<br />
<br />
FACT is clearly in NP:<br />
a complete factorization of n provides evidence that some nontrivial factor is \le x.<br />
<br />
FACT is clearly in coNP:<br />
a complete factorization of n provides evidence that no nontrivial factor is \le x<br />
<br />
so if FACT is NP-complete then SAT is in coNP.<br />
<br />
Factoring is clearly an important and well studied problem. It even has its own Wikipedia entry!<br />
<br />
<b>Discrete Log</b>. Similar to Factoring. And it is also an important and well studied problem. It even has its own Wikipedia Entry!<br />
<br />
<b>Isomorphism Problems</b> They list Group and Ring isomorphism. They don't list Graph, which is odd. (ADDED LATER- my bad, they do mention Graph Isom in the section on Graph Algorithms) Anyway, if Graph Isom is NPC then PH collapses, and, at least so far, there is no algorithm for Graph Isom in P. (I do not think it is know if Group Isom NPC means PH collapses, or if Ring Isom NPC means PH collapses---if you know of such a proof leave a comment and a pointer to it.)<br />
<br />
Graph Isomorphism is a well studied problem and seems important and natural (I don't know if Graph Isomorphism has any real applications they way that factoring and DL do).  It even has its own Wikipedia entry! Group and Ring Isomorphism also seem important and natural. And they have their own Wikipedia entry!<br />
<br />
<b>Numbers in Boxes Problem </b>My first reaction-Gee, whats that? For the Factoring, DL, and Isomorphism they did not define the problem-- they gave pointers to the Wikipedia entries on them. For this one there was no Wikipedia entry. There was one reference. I went to it. <i>It was a blog entry of mine</i>! Here it is: <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2010/07/what-is-complexity-of-these-problems.html">her</a>e, and to save you time I'll say what it is:<br />
<br />
{ (1<sup>n</sup>,1<sup>k</sup>) : you can partition 1,...,n into k boxes so that no box has x,y,z with x + y = z }<br />
<br />
Is this problem important? Does it exist anywhere outside of my blog entry? Yes--- a special case of it was in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Eccos-Cyberpuzzles-Dennis-Shasha/dp/0393325415/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Dr.+Ecco&amp;qid=1577931523&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">Dr. Ecco's Cyperpuzzles by Dennis Shasha</a> (note- Dennis was a classmate of mine in graduate school at Harvard). I think the case was to try to partition {1,...,100} as best you can. Actually I first saw the case of the problem in his book and then generalized it.<br />
<br />
The problem is sparse so if it was NP-complete then P = NP, very good evidence that its not NPC. And its been studied for thousands of years, with people looking for poly time algorithms (I think Pythagoras studied it) without success, so its almost surely not in P. OR that last sentence was complete nonsense. Indeed, I don't think anyone has studied the problem computationally, or, for that matter, at all. So the evidence that its not in P is... sparse.<br />
<br />
But its worse than that. One could devise MANY sparse problems that are, since spares, likely NOT NPC, and hardly studied, so as-of-now, not in P. Should those count? Only if (a) more people study them so there is an attempt to point to to get it into P, and (b) the problem is natural (which is hard to define).<br />
<br />
Note that I can vary the problem: x+2y=z (this relates to lower bounds on VDW numbers)<br />
or any other combination of x,y,z or more that I like.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This raises a question:<br />
<br />
<b>When is a problem worthy of being put on lists of problems?</b><br />
<b><br />
</b> Here are some possibly criteria. One can take ANDS and ORS of them.<br />
<br />
1) The problem has a Wikipedia entry. This might fall victim to Goodhearts law: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a measure.  That is, I could make a Wikipedia entry on the Number-in-boxes problem and then say LOOK, its on Wikipedia!<br />
<br />
2) More than X people have worked on the problem for some value of X. But here is a reason this might not be a good criteria: look at the problem<br />
<br />
{ α : α is a reg expression that allows numbers (so a<sup>1000</sup> is fine, makes reg expressions  VERY succint) such that L(α)=Σ<sup>*</sup> }<br />
<br />
This problem looks natural, and was proven by Meyer and Stockmeyer to be EXPSPACE complete.<br />
That is the only paper on this problem, yet the problem really does look natural, and the result is rightly celebrated as a natural problem that is provably not in P.<br />
<br />
3) When people in the field look at the problem they say YEAH, thats a good problem.<br />
<br />
4) The problem relates to other problems or other fields.<br />
<br />
I doubt the Number-in-boxes problem satisfies any of these criteria. The variant with x+2y=z relates to Ramsey Theory. Great.<br />
<br />
NOW, back to the list-- I won't go through any more on the list, but I note that for some of them the only reference seems to be a conversation on stack-exchange.  Some of those end up referring to real papers so are more likely natural, but some do not.<br />
<br />
Having said that, is there any harm in the list having on it some problems that are not ... worthy? Is that even the right word to use?<br />
<br />
Note that I don't have strong opinions on any of these matters, I am just wondering what criteria Wikipedia, and other sources, uses, when they have lists of problems.<br />

arrive in random order. Once we observe an item we need to irrevocably decide
whether or not to accept it. The set of selected elements should form an
independent set of the matroid. The goal is to maximize the total sum of the
values assigned to these elements.
</p>
<p>We introduce a version of this problem motivated by the shortlist model in
[Agrawal et al.]. In this setting, the algorithm is allowed to choose a subset
of items as part of a shortlist, possibly more than $k=rk(\mathcal{M})$ items.
Then, after seeing the entire input, the algorithm can choose an independent
subset from the shortlist. Furthermore we generalize the objective function to
any monotone submodular function. Is there an online algorithm achieve a
constant competitive ratio using a shortlist of size $O(k)$? We design an
algorithm that achieves a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^2-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ competitive
ratio for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, using a shortlist of size $O(k)$. This is
especially surprising considering that the best known competitive ratio for the
matroid secretary problem is $O(\log \log k)$.
</p>
<p>An important application of our algorithm is for the random order streaming
of submodular functions. We show that our algorithm can be implemented in the
streaming setting using $O(k)$ memory. It achieves a
$\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^2-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ approximation. The previously best known
approximation ratio for streaming submodular maximization under matroid
constraint is 0.25 (adversarial order) due to [Feldman et al.], [Chekuri et
al.], and [Chakrabarti et al.]. Moreover, we generalize our results to the case
of p-matchoid constraints and give a
$\frac{1}{p+1}(1-1/e^{p+1}-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ approximation using $O(k)$ memory,
which asymptotically approaches the best known offline guarantee
$\frac{1}{p+1}$ [Nemhauser et al.]

fleet of identical vehicles aims at collecting rewards (prizes) available at
given locations, while satisfying restrictions on the travel times. In TOP,
each location can be visited by at most one vehicle, and the goal is to
maximize the total sum of rewards collected by the vehicles within a given time
limit. In this paper, we propose a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner
Team Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide, additionally, a subset
of mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total
sum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory
location must be visited. In this work, we propose a new commodity-based
formulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane scheme. The algorithm
benefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and
works by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some
general connectivity constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on
dual bounds and a class of conflict cuts. To our knowledge, the last class of
inequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art branch-and-cut
algorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to
evaluate the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational
experiments show the competitiveness of the new algorithm while solving several
STOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve, in total, 14 more
TOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new
optimality certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in
this work, our algorithm solves 30 more instances than the baseline.

constant $c_{d,k}&gt;0$ such that for every $n$-point set $X\subset \mathbb R^d$
there exists a $k$-flat that intersects at least $c_{d,k} n^{d+1-k} -
o(n^{d+1-k})$ of the $(d-k)$-dimensional simplices spanned by $X$. However, the
optimal values of the constants $c_{d,k}$ are mostly unknown. The case $k=0$
(stabbing by a point) has received a great deal of attention.
</p>
<p>In this paper we focus on the case $k=1$ (stabbing by a line). Specifically,
we try to determine the upper bounds yielded by two point sets, known as the
"stretched grid" and the "stretched diagonal". Even though the calculations are
independent of $n$, they are still very complicated, so we resort to analytical
and numerical software methods. Surprisingly, for $d=4,5,6$ the stretched grid
yields better bounds than the stretched diagonal (unlike for all cases $k=0$
and for the case $(d,k)=(3,1)$, in which both point sets yield the same bound).
The stretched grid yields $c_{4,1}\leq 0.00457936$, $c_{5,1}\leq 0.000405335$,
and $c_{6,1}\leq 0.0000291323$.

this paper, a lattice framework is proposed to handle the 3-CNF-SAT problems,

function ${\cal H}_\varphi$ for any 3-CNF-SAT problem $\varphi$ of size $n$, in
the sense that ${\cal H}_\varphi : \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ is such
that $Im \; {\cal H}_\varphi$ is the set of all the solutions of $\varphi$. A
new merge operation ${\cal H}_\varphi \bigwedge {\cal H}_{\psi}$ is defined,
where $\psi$ is a single 3-CNF clause. Given ${\cal H}_\varphi$ [but this can
be of exponential complexity], the complexity needed for the computation of $Im
\; {\cal H}_\varphi$, the set of all solutions, is shown to be polynomial for
hard 3-CNF-SAT problems, i.e. the one with few ($\leq 2^k$) or no solutions.
The third part uses the relation between ${\cal H}_\varphi$ and the indicator
function $\mathbb{1}_{{\cal S}_\varphi}$ for the set of solutions, to develop a
greedy polynomial algorithm to solve hard 3-CNF-SAT problems.

<p>Happy new year! And now for the last post of 2019 papers. We have found a diverse collection of six papers, ranging from classic property testing topics to new perspectives on sublinear computation. </p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Optimal Policy Value Estimation in Contextual Bandits</strong> by Weihao Kong, Gregory Valiant, Emma Brunskill (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06111">arXiv</a>). This isn’t our usual sublinear paper, but it is definitely of interest to us sublinear folk. Let’s start with a stripped down definition of the problem (or rather, game). There are \(K\) “arms”, where the \(i\)th arm is represented by an unknown vector in \(\beta_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\). We are presented with a “context”, which is a vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\). Our job is to choose an arm \(i \in [K]\). We get the reward \(x \cdot \beta_i\) (with some noise added). The contexts appears from a known distribution. To aid us, we observe the rewards of \(N\) iid contexts, so we observe a total of \(T = KN\) rewards. There has been much work on figuring out the minimum value of \(T\) required to learn the optimal policy. One requires at least \(d\) (the dimension) samples to estimate any of the arm vectors. This papers shows that one can actually estimate the expected reward of the optimal policy, without being able to describe it, with sublinear in \(d\) (technically, \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})\)) samples. We see this a lot in property testing, where producing the “optimal” solution for a problem requires linear-in-dimension samples, but estimating the optimal value is much cheaper (consider, for example, the situation of linearity testing, where we wish to find the closest linear function).</p>



<p><strong>Sublinear Time Numerical Linear Algebra for Structured Matrices </strong>by Xiaofei Shi and David P. Woodruff (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06060.pdf">arXiv</a>). This follows the recent linear of advances in sublinear time linear algebra. Given a matrix \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}\), the aim is to get algorithms that only look at \(o(nnz(A))\) entries (where \(nnz(A)\) is the number of non-zeroes, or the support). Consider the classic talk of low rank approximation. Unfortunately, suppose one entry is extremely large, and the others are extremely small. One has to find this large entry for any reasonable approximation, which (in the worst-case) requires \(nnz(A)\) queries into \(A\). Thus, previous papers make structural assumption (such as, \(A\) being a Vandermonde matrix) to get sublinear bounds. This paper gives a clean black box method to get a variety of such results. Basically, one can replace the usual \(nnz(A)\) term in many algorithms, by \(T(A)\), which is the time to compute the matrix-vector product \( Ay\), for \(y \in \mathbb{R}^d\). In many cases \(T(A) = \widetilde{O}(n)\), which can be significantly smaller than \(nnz(A)\). This paper gives such results for low-rank approximations and many regression problems.</p>



<p><strong>Robust and Sample Optimal Algorithms for PSD Low-Rank Approximation</strong> by Ainesh Bakshi, Nadiia Chepurko, and David P. Woodruff. Consider the low rank problem discussed above. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, we need structural assumptions on \(A\). Previous results gave sublinear time low-rank approximations assuming that \(A\) is positive semidefinite (PSD). The aim is to get a rank \(k\) matrix \(B\) such that \(\|A-B\|^2_2\) is at most \((1+\epsilon)\)-times the optimal such approximation. The previous algorithm of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03371">Musco-Woodruff</a> makes \(\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon^{2.5})\) queries in to \(A\), while there is a lower bound of \(\Omega(nk/\epsilon)\). This gap between the complexities is resolved in this paper with an upper bound of \(\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon)\) queries.</p>



<p><strong>Constructive derandomization of query algorithms </strong>by Guy Blanc, Jane Lange, and Li-Yang Tan (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03042">arXiv</a>). This paper discusses an intriguing angle to sublinear question: when can they be derandomized? Abstractly, consider a randomized algorithm \(R\) that makes \(q\) queries. Think of \(R\) as a function \(R(x,r)\), where \(x\) is the input, and \(r\) is the randomness. We would like to design a deterministic algorithm \(D\) making, ideally, close to \(q\) queries and approximates \(\mathop{E}_r[R(x,r)]\). For starters, consider some distribution over \(x\), and suppose we want \(\mathbb{E}_x[D(x) – \mathbb{E}_r[R(x,r)]] &lt; \epsilon\). By (the easy direction of) Yao’s minimax lemma, one can show the existence of such an algorithm \(D\) that makes \(O(q/\epsilon)\) queries. But how to explicitly construct it? Indeed, the first result of this paper gives a “meta-algorithm” that takes as input the description of \(R\) (which is of size \(N\)), has running time \(poly(N)2^{O(q/\epsilon)}\) and outputs a description of \(D\). When \(R\) satisfies the stronger property of “bounded error”, one can get a \(O(q^3)\)-query algorithm \(D\) that approximates \(\mathop{E}_r[R(x,r)]\) for all \(x\) (again, the existence is proven by a classic theorem of Nisan). Overall, this paper gives a method to derandomize sublinear time algorithms, and I wonder if there could be some applications of this method for proving lower bounds. After all, Yao’s minimax theorem is <em>the</em> tool for property testing lower bounds, and any perspective on Yao’s theorem is likely of relevance. </p>



<p><strong>Testing Membership for Timed Automata</strong> by Richard Lassaigne and Michel de Rougemont (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08277">arXiv</a>). Property testing for regular languages is a classic result in sublinear algorithms. This paper focuses on the more complex notion of timed automata. The technical definition is quite complicated, but here’s an overview. There is a finite automaton and a collection of “clocks”. Imagine a string being processed, where each alphabet symbol appears with a new timestamp. Thus, the input word is called a “timed word”. The transitions of the automaton involve the new symbol read, as well as constraints involving the clock times and the timestamp. Thus, we can enforce conditions like “only transition if another symbol is read within a single time unit”. In general, deciding whether a timed word is accepted by a timed automaton is NP-complete. This papers studies the property testing viewpoint. The paper gives a new definition of “timed edit distance” between timed words. The main result shows that one can distinguish time words accepted by a timed automaton from words that are far (according to timed edit distance), by querying a constant number of word positions.</p>



<p><strong>On the query complexity of estimating the distance to hereditary graph properties</strong> by Carlos Hoppen, Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, Richard Lang, Hanno Lefmann, and Henrique Stagni (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01081">arXiv</a>). This paper concerns the classic setting of property testing of dense graphs. It is well-known that all hereditary graph properties are testable, and are moreover, one can estimate the distance to the property in time that only depends on \(\varepsilon\). Unfortunately, the queries complexities have large tower dependencies on \(\varepsilon\), arising from the use of the Szemeredi regularity lemma. The question of property testing in dense graphs can be reduced to finding “removal” lemmas (such as the classic triangle remove lemma). Such a lemma states that if at least \(\varepsilon n^2\) edges need to be removed from \(G\) to destroy all “forbidden subgraphs”, then there must be “many” forbidden subgraphs in \(G\). There is much recent research on finding families of forbidden subgraphs, where the “many” (in the above statement) is at least \(poly(\varepsilon)\) times  the trivial upper bound. This paper shows that one can also estimate the distance to any hereditary property, in a query complexity that depends directly on the corresponding removal lemma parameters. As a compelling example, one can estimate the distance to being chordal in \(\exp(1/\varepsilon)\) queries, a significant improvement over standard tower bounds.</p></div>

<p>M. Night Shyamalan is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Night_Shyamalan">creator</a> of many wonderful horror movies, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_(2004_film)">The Village</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense">The Sixth Sense</a>. His films often have a twist ending.</p>
<p>
Today I thought I would try to apply math and logic to his latest creation, the TV show called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(TV_series)">Servant</a>.</p>
<p>
I am not kidding. No number theory, no complexity theory, no strange theorems today. I thought I would try and apply some logic to attempt and understand M. Night’s story. The story was created by Tony Basgallop but M. Night’s direction modulates what we can see and how we feel it. <em>Servant</em> is on cable, on Apple TV, and is close to the end. It is a series of ten short episodes and the last two are due out in the next few days. </p>
<p>
The story is strange, scary, and unusual. M. Night likes to play with his viewers and make stories that are difficult to understand. Like many of our problems: Think P=NP or the Riemann Hypothesis, or the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{3x+1}" class="latex" title="{3x+1}" /> function problem. Our problems are strange, scary, and unusual too. Our difficulty is that we do not have a date when all will be explained. As we discussed <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/22/predicting-when-pnp-is-resolved/">here</a>, we might be waiting a long time before we get the “last” episode for P=NP, for example.</p>
<p>
Take a look at the rest even if you have not watched the series. I would like to think that working out the “solution” to the Servant is possible, but probably hard. I am not likely to have the answer here, but I think I may be on the right track, at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Story in Short </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is a brief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_(TV_series)">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Six weeks after the death of their 13-week-old son, Philadelphia couple Dorothy and Sean Turner hire a young nanny, Leanne, to move in and take care of Baby Jericho, a reborn doll. The doll, which Dorothy believes is her real child, was the only thing that brought her out of her catatonic state following Jericho’s death. While Sean deals with the grief on his own, he becomes deeply suspicious of Leanne. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The players are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
The baby, Jericho. <p></p>
</li><li>
The mom, Dorothy <p></p>
</li><li>
The dad, Sean. <p></p>
</li><li>
The brother, Julian. <p></p>
</li><li>
The nanny, Leanne.
</li></ul>
<p>
I like this statement about <a href="https://netflixlife.com/2019/12/28/servant-s1e7-darkest-theory-jericho/">Servant</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <em>Servant</em> continues to frighten viewers while at the same time not providing audiences with answers. But have they been telling us more than we know? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> On-line Comments </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Like P=NP there is much debate and discussion about <em>Servant</em>. Here is a typical comment: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Never mind the mystery of whether Jericho is truly alive again or not, there’s also the fact that we have no idea how he died in the first place. New theory is that Dorothy killed him, either on accident or due to a bad postpartum depression episode. This would mean Julian and Sean covered it up. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There are lots of details in the story that may or may not be important. There are many theories about what could be going on. One thing seems clear is that what is happening is mystery. Is it one that we can shed any light on?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Jericho is the Key </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The discussions on-line about what is happening seem to miss the key: Is the baby, Jericho, a plastic baby or a real baby? Most seem to accept that the baby was plastic and then was replaced by a real baby. This is where I can apply logical analysis. Let’s walk through the possible cases:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho is a magical object. Than the whole story is a dream. Or the players are ghosts. Or some other magical possibility. This reflects the fact that we do not have precise rules or axioms. M. Night could do anything he wishes. But I like to think that he plays by some rules. So let’s agree that this case is out.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho was a plastic baby at first and then became a real baby. This is the consensus of almost all viewers. At least if we can rely on their comments. The issue here is how does this work? How can a living baby suddenly appear? How can the mom and the nanny not notice the baby has become real? </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho was always a plastic baby. This seems to not be considered as a plausible case. It does require that the father and the brother are crazy. I like this idea. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Perhaps Jericho was always a real baby. This seems to be the most unusual idea. I think M. Night might like this direction. It would be the biggest twist. The baby was always real. Here M. Night is laughing at us: he would get the biggest shock if Jericho is always real. It would explain much. Then the mom and the nanny are just fine, we do not need to assume that they are crazy at all. Then the father and the brother are nuts. </p>
<p>
I think the last is my favorite. I wish I could “prove” that the last is the case. In a few days we should know what M. Night selected for the answer. I feel that our methods at least forced us to consider all the logical possibilities. Is this the right answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I hope you did not mind this diversion from hard core math. I think that applying logic may be useful here. Too bad we do not have a reveal date for our problems like P=NP.</p>

<p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/1/241717-publish-and-perish/fulltext">Moshe Vardi’s latest insight in the Communications of the ACM </a>(whose title we adopt for this post) agrees with our previous post “<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2019/08/04/because-of-pollution-conferences-should-be-virtual/">Because of pollution, conferences should be virtual.</a>” Vardi calls for “sweeping policy change […] requiring that authors of accepted papers that must fly to  participate in a conference may opt out from in-person involvement and  contribute instead by video.”  Vardi gives some indication of the environmental impact of the travel-based system, and further suspects that in-person conference participation is “much less valuable than we would like to believe.”</p>



<p>These issues are closely related to the decades-old discussion of journals vs. conferences. <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia/">Several older posts on this blog </a>were devoted to that. Lance Fortnow, back in 2009, wrote that it’s <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/8/34492-viewpoint-time-for-computer-science-to-grow-up/abstract">Time for computer science to grow up</a>.  The full text of this article is premium content, but you can read a pre-publication version <a href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~fortnow/papers/growup.pdf">here</a>. Basically, he argues in favor of a journal-based publication system.</p>



<p>Apparently in response, judging from the title, Boaz Barak wrote a piece titled <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/6/202644-computer-science-should-stay-young/abstract">Computer science should stay young.</a> I can’t quickly find a link to the whole thing, but his bottom line is online “I disagree with the conclusion that we should transition to a classical journal-based model similar to that of other fields. I believe conferences offer a number of unique advantages that have helped make computer science dynamic and successful, and can continue to do so in the future.”</p>



<p>I disagree that conferences are young. They belong to the BI (before internet) era, and so look rather anchored in the past to me.  Historically, I also suppose in-person discussion predates writing, though this is irrelevant.  What is young is the health impact of pollution (Fortnow and Barak’s pieces don’t touch on health issues). (By health impact I include climate change, but I prefer not to use that term for various reasons.)</p>



<p>And what is young and cool is arxiv overlay journals, TCS+ talks, videoconferences,  <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/">ECCC</a>, etc.</p>



<p>Instead, we impose on our community most inconvenient transoceanic flights.  To end I’ll quote from <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/MC/269.html">Oded Goldreich’s my choices</a>:</p>



<p><b>Phoenix in June:</b> […] One must be out of their mind to hold a conference under such weather conditions. I guess humans can endure such weather conditions and even worse ones, but why choose to do so? Why call upon people from all over the world to travel to one of the least comfortable locations (per the timing)?</p>

We establish an exactly tight relation between reversible pebblings of graphs and Nullstellensatz refutations of pebbling formulas, showing that a graph $G$ can be reversibly pebbled in time $t$ and space $s$ if and only if there is a Nullstellensatz refutation of the pebbling formula over $G$ in size $t+1$ and degree $s$ (independently of the field in which the Nullstellensatz refutation  is made). We use this correspondence to prove a number of strong size-degree trade-offs for Nullstellensatz, which to the best of our   knowledge are the first such results for this proof system.</div>

Ben Orlin is a funny mathematician. His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Change-Only-Constant-Wisdom-Calculus/dp/0316509086/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=math0b2-20&amp;linkId=4b0342416ae54d5080032b8cc09bfc93&amp;language=en_US">book</a> title <i>Change Is the Only Constant</i> was <a href="https://math-frolic.blogspot.com/2019/12/books-closing-out-2019-with-some-faves.html">selected</a> by the blog <em>Math-Frolic</em> as the best mathematics book of 2019.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to try to get you to at least smile, if not laugh.</p>
<p>
Orlin is a funny chap—okay I just got back from London—so forgive me for using “chap”. Check Orlin’s site out for <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2015/12/30/a-mathematicians-new-years-resolutions/">proof</a> that he is funny. Here are some of his <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/13/literatures-greatest-opening-lines-as-written-by-mathematicians/">examples</a> of math types rewriting famous opening lines from books. We will make this into a kind of quiz. You must guess the book title from the modified quote:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The times had high variance. <p></p>
</li><li>
Up to isomorphism there is one happy family. <p></p>
</li><li>
It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were not mod 12. <p></p>
</li><li>
All this happened, but not with equality. <p></p>
</li><li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E2+%5Ccdot+31%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^2 \cdot 31}" class="latex" title="{2^2 \cdot 31}" /> was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom. <p></p>
</li><li>
It was zero at the leading ordinal of viewing.
</li></ol>
<p>
The third is the first hard one—I did not get it. The last one (of three from Ken not Ben) is probably unfair. All six of them, however, are on the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-Lines-Literature-Coffee-Slaughterhouse/dp/B01D6TGVHW">First Lines Literature Coffee Mug</a>” which Ken received a year ago as a Christmas present from his sister. I did not know this when I chose the first three.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Orlin’s Resolutions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Many of us make resolutions for the new year. Here are some examples from Orlin:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Be better at explaining what I do to family and friends. I, Dick, have trouble with this one.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Not to prove by contradiction what can be proved directly. Assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B1+%5Cneq+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1+1 \neq 2}" class="latex" title="{1+1 \neq 2}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /></p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Stop using the word “obviously.” Here at GLL we try to avoid this, at least when it is not obvious. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/02/28/phrases-that-drive-me-crazy/">posted</a> about phrases to avoid a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Our Resolutions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here are some of ours:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Stop doubting quantum computer claims. Unless, adds Ken, you have a possible concrete way of challenging them…</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Start trying to apply AI methods to complexity theory. Could there be a new learning approach to 3-SAT? Note that PAC learning kind-of came from there. See for instance the end of <a href="https://elmos.scripts.mit.edu/mathofdeeplearning/2017/05/08/mathematics-of-deep-learning-lecture-4/">this</a>.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Stop trying to understand proofs that Peano arithmetic is inconsistent. I still do not understand what logic they use to prove that Peano is inconsistent. What if that logic is inconsistent? </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> Start up some fundamental research ideas and attempts on hard problems again.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet }" class="latex" title="{\bullet }" /> And try to make GLL better, including making it appeal to a wider community. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The answers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens: “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy: “Happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unlike in its own way.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>1984</em> by George Orwell: “It was a bright cold day, and the clocks were striking thirteen.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> by Kurt Vonnegut: “All this happened, more or less.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Beloved</em> by Toni Morrison, who died this year: “124 was spiteful, full of a baby’s venom.” This <a href="https://www.shmoop.com/quotes/124-was-spiteful.html">explanation</a> of the line continues: “We know all about numbers being spiteful. We took high school algebra. We’ve experienced the pain. But in this instance, the quote isn’t actually referring to a number. There’s not some mysterious mathematical entity that’s come to wreak havoc on the characters in our story. Here, ‘124’ refers to…” <p></p>
</li><li>
<em>Lolita</em> by Vladimir Nabokov: “It was love at first sight…” But wait—this is not the first line of the novel. The first line is maybe not suitable for a coffee mug or family-friendly blog. Instead it is the first line of chapter 29 of part II. We did say it was unfair. <b>Update: Oops</b>—as noted <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/12/31/resolutions-for-2020/#comment-107459">here</a>, it is the first line of <em>Catch-22</em> by Joseph Heller.  Maybe Ken’s Google engine shares his tendency toward chess-playing authors…
</li></ol>
<p>
Have a happy new year, and make some fun resolutions. Please let us know some of them, or ideas for ours.</p>
<p></p><p><br />

They all appear to generate random tree-like mazes in a square grid, but with different probability distributions on the trees. E.g. Kruskal and Prim generate minimum spanning trees for random weights, different from the uniformly random trees of Aldous–Broder and Wilson, and many others appear quite different from both.
The alternative algorithm at the main link of the via link is probably not the best choice.</p>

As we move into the 2020s, we tend to look back and look forward. The 2010s will go down as the decade computing and data transformed society, for better and worse. Google turned 21 this year as its OG leadership stepped down. I turned 21 in 1984, but 1984 seems closer than ever.</div>

2019 was not quiet and we're about to head into an impeachment trial, Brexit and a critical US presidential election. The real challenges of the twenties will come from massive transformation from automation, climate change and deepening divisions in our society. How will academia cope with changing demographics, financial challenges and educating to manage the technological revolution?<br />

Let's all take a deep breath, roll up our sleeves and get the decade going.</div>

We significantly strengthen and generalize the theorem lifting Nullstellensatz degree to monotone span program size by Pitassi and  Robere (2018) so that it works for any gadget with high enough rank, in particular, for useful gadgets such as  equality and greater-than. We apply our generalized theorem to solve two open problems:

* We present the first result that demonstrates a separation in proof power for cutting planes with unbounded versus polynomially bounded    coefficients.
Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length and constant line space in cutting planes with unbounded coefficients, but for which there are no refutations in subexponential length and subpolynomial line space if coefficients are restricted to be of polynomial magnitude.

* We give the first explicit separation between monotone Boolean formulas and monotone real formulas. Specifically, we give an explicit family of functions that can be computed with monotone real formulas of nearly linear size but require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a non-explicit separation was known.  
  
An important technical ingredient, which may be of independent interest, is that we show that the Nullstellensatz degree of refuting the pebbling formula over a DAG $G$ over any field coincides exactly with the reversible pebbling price of $G$. 
In particular, this implies that the standard decision tree complexity and the parity  decision tree complexity of the corresponding falsified clause search problem are equal.</div>

<p>I am in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tau-theory-fest/home">Tel Aviv Theory Fest</a> this week – a fantastic collection of talks and workshops organized by Yuval Filmus , Gil Kalai, Ronen Eldan, and Muli Safra.</p>



<p>It was a good chance to catch up with many friends and colleagues. In particular I met Elchanan Mossel and Subhash Khot, who asked me to serve as a “witness” for their bet on the unique games conjecture. I am recording it here so we can remember it a decade from noe.</p>



<p>Specifically, Elchanan bets that the Unique Games conjecture will be proven in the next decade – sometime between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2029 there will be a paper uploaded to the arxiv with a correct proof of the conjecture. Subhash bets that this won’t happen. They were not sure what to bet on, but eventually agreed to take my offer that the loser will have to collaborate on a problem chosen by the winner, so I think science will win in either case. (For what it’s worth, I think there is a good chance that Subhash will lose the bet because he himself will prove the UGC in this decade, though it’s always possible Subhash can both win the bet and prove the UGC if he manages to do it by tomorrow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> )</p>

<p>The conference itself is, as I mentioned, wonderful with an amazing collection of speakers.  Let me mention just a couple of talks from this morning. Shafi Goldwasser talked about “Law and Algorithms”. There is a recent area of research studying how to regulate algorithms, but Shafi’s talk focused mostly on the other direction: how algorithms and cryptography can help achieve legal objectives such as the “right to be forgotten” or the ability to monitor secret proceedings such as wiretap requests. </p>



<p>Christos Papadimitriou  talked about “Language, Brain, and Computation”.  Christos is obviously excited about understanding the language mechanisms in the brain. He said that studying the brain gives him the same feeling that you get when you sit in a coffee shop in Cambridge and hear intellectual discussions all around you: you don’t understand why everyone is not dropping everything they are doing and come here. (Well, his actual words were “sunsets over the Berkeley hills” but I think the Cambridge coffee shops are a better metaphor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> )</p>

<p>I started out this decade with the project of writing a survey of the multi-armed bandit literature, which I had read thoroughly during the graduate studies that I was about to finish. At the time we resisted the temptation to name the survey “modern banditology”, which was indeed the right call given how much this “modern” picture has evolved over the decade! It is truly wonderful to now end the decade with two new iterations on the work we did in that survey: </p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf" class="lipdf">Bandit algorithms</a> by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07272" class="liinternal">Introduction to bandits</a> by Alex Slivkins</li>
</ol>
<p>These new references very significantly expand the 2012 survey, and they are wonderful starting points for anyone who wants to enter the field.</p>
<p>Here are some of the discoveries in the world of bandits that stood out for me this decade:</p>
<ol>
<li>We now understand very precisely Thompson Sampling, the first bandit strategy that was proposed back in 1933. The most beautiful reference here is the one by Dan Russo and Ben Van Roy: <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/14-087/14-087.pdf" class="lipdf">An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Thompson Sampling</a>, JMLR 2016. Another one that stands out is <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v23/agrawal12/agrawal12.pdf" class="lipdf">Analysis of thompson sampling for the multi-armed bandit problem</a> by S. Agrawal and N. Goyal at COLT 2012.</li>
<li>T^{2/3} lower bound for  *non-stochastic* bandit with switching cost by Dekel, Ding, Koren and Peres at <u><font color="#000121"><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997" class="liinternal">STOC 201</a></font></u><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2997" class="liinternal">4</a>. This is a striking result for several reasons. In particular the proof has to be based on a non-trivial stochastic process, since for the classical stochastic i.i.d. model one can obtain \sqrt{T} (very easily in fact). </li>
<li>We now know that bandit convex optimization is “easy”, in the sense that it is a \sqrt{T}-regret type problem. What’s more is that in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03084" class="liinternal">STOC 2017 paper</a> with Y.T. Lee and R. Eldan we introduced a new way to do function estimation based on bandit feedback, using kernels (I have written at length about this on <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2016/08/06/kernel-based-methods-for-bandit-convex-optimization-part-1/" class="liinternal">this blog</a>).</li>
<li>A very intriguing model of computation for contextual bandit was proposed, where one can access the policy space only through an offline optimization oracle. With such access, the classical Exp4 algorithm cannot be simulated, and thus one needs new strategies. We now have a reasonable understanding that \sqrt{T} is doable with mild assumptions (see e.g. this ICML 2014 paper on “<u><font color="#000117"><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0555" class="liexternal">Taming the Monster</a></font>“</u> by Hsu, Kale, Langford, L. Li and Schapire) and that it is impossible with no assumptions (work of Hazan and Koren at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02089" class="liinternal">STOC 2016</a>).</li>
<li>Honorable mentions also go to the work of Wei and Luo showing that very strong variation bounds are possible in bandits (see this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03265" class="liinternal">COLT 2018 paper</a>), and Zimmert and Seldin who made striking progress on the best of both worlds phenomenon that we discovered with Slivkins at the beginning of the decade (I blogged about it <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/06/10/amazing-progress-in-adversarially-robust-stochastic-multi-armed-bandits/" class="liinternal">here</a> already).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Life beyond bandits</h2>
<p>In addition to starting the decade with the bandit survey, I also started it with being bored with the bandit topic altogether. I thought that many (if not most) of the fundamental results were now known, and it was a good idea to move on to something else. Obviously I was totally wrong, as you can see with all the works cited above (and many many more for stochastic bandits, including much deeper understanding of best arm identification, a topic very close to my heart, see e.g., <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume17/kaufman16a/kaufman16a.pdf" class="lipdf">[Kaufmann, Cappe, Garivier, JMLR 16]</a>). In fact I am now optimistic that there is probably another decade-worth of exploration left for the bandit problem(s). Nevertheless I ventured outside, and explored the world of optimization (out of which first came <a href="http://sbubeck.com/Bubeck15.pdf" class="lipdf">a survey</a>, and more recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0oZPbS-UD_kwT4ePZQx_CiME" class="liinternal">video lectures</a>) and briefly networks (another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03511" class="liinternal">modest survey</a> came out of this too). </p>
<p>Here are some of the landmark optimization results of this decade in my view:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perhaps the most striking result of the decade in optimization is the observation that for finite sum problems, one can reduce the variance in stochastic gradient descent by somehow centering the estimates (e.g., using a slowly moving sequence on which we can afford to compute full gradients; but this is not the only way to perform such variance reduction). This idea, while very simple, has a lot of implications, both in practice and in theory! The origin of the idea are in the SAG algorithm of <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4633-a-stochastic-gradient-method-with-an-exponential-convergence-_ra" class="liexternal">[Schmidt, Le Roux, Bach, NIPS 2012]</a> and SDCA <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume14/shalev-shwartz13a/shalev-shwartz13a.pdf" class="lipdf">[Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, JMLR 2013]</a>. A simpler instantiation of the idea, called SVRG appeared shortly after in <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4937-accelerating-stochastic-gradient-descent-using-predictive-variance-reduction.pdf" class="lipdf">[Johnson and Zhang, NIPS 2013]</a> (and also independently at the same NeurIPS, in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4941-mixed-optimization-for-smooth-functions" class="liinternal">[M. Madhavi, L. Zhang, R. Li, NIPS 2013]</a>).</li>
<li>An intriguing direction that I pursued fervently is the use of convex optimization for problems that have a priori nothing to do with convex optimization. A big inspiration for me was the COLT 2008 paper by Abernethy, Hazan and Rakhlin, who showed how mirror descent naturally solves bandit problems. In this decade, we (this we includes myself and co-authors, but also various other teams) explored how to use mirror descent for other online decision making problems, and made progress on some long-standing problems (k-server and MTS), see for example this set of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAPSKVSdi0obG1b3w4k41JMLFbyBJS5AQ" class="liinternal">video lectures</a> on the “Five miracles of mirror descent”.</li>
<li>Arnak Dalalyan showed how to use ideas inspired from convex optimization to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7392" class="liinternal">analyze the Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm</a>. This was absolutely beautiful work, that led to many many follow-ups.</li>
<li>There has been a lot of rewriting of Nesterov’s acceleration, to try to demystify it. Overall the enterprise is not yet a resounding success in my opinion, but certainly a lot of progress has been made (again I have written a lot about it on this blog already). We now even have optimal acceleration for higher order of smoothness (see this 15 authors <u><font color="#000117"></font><font><a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v99/gasnikov19b/gasnikov19b.pdf" class="lipdf">paper at COLT 2019</a></font></u>), but these techniques are clouded with the same shroud of mystery as was Nesterov’s original method.</li>
<li>Yin Tat Lee and Aaron Sidford obtained an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08033" class="liinternal">efficient construction of a universal barrier</a>.</li>
<li>We now know that certain problems cannot be efficiently represented by SDPs (the so-called “extension complexity), see e.g. this work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6317" class="liinternal">Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer</a>.</li>
<li>We now know how to chase convex bodies, and we can even do so very elegantly with <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/imabandit/2019/11/05/convex-body-chasing-steiner-point-sellke-point-and-soda-2020-best-papers/" class="liinternal">the Steiner/Sellke point</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Some other things that captivated me</h2>
<p>The papers above are mostly topics on which I tried to work at some point. Here are some questions that I didn’t work on but followed closely and was fascinated by the progress:</p>
<ol>
<li>The stochastic block model was essentially solved during this decade, see for example <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~eabbe/publications/abbe_FNT_2.pdf" class="lipdf">this survey</a> by Emmanuel Abbe.</li>
<li>The computational/statistical tradeoffs were extensively explored, yet they remain mysterious. A nice impulse to the field was given by this <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1378386239" class="liinternal">COLT 2013 paper</a> by Berthet and Rigollet relating sparse PCA and planted clique. In a similar spirit I also enjoyed the more recent work by Moitra, Jerry Li, and many co-authors on computationally efficient robust estimation (see e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11366" class="liinternal">this recent paper</a>)</li>
<li>Adaptive data analysis strikes me as both very important in practice, and quite deep theoretically, see e.g. <a href="http://nematilab.info/bmijc/assets/091218_paper.pdf" class="lipdf">the reusable holdout by Dwork et al</a>. A related paper that I liked a lot is this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585" class="liinternal">ICML 2015 paper</a> by Blum and Hardt, which essentially explores the regularization effect of publishing only models that beat the state of the art significantly (more generally this is an extremely interesting question, of why we can keep using the same datasets to evaluate progress in machine learning, see this provokingly titled paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811" class="liinternal">Do ImageNet Classifiers Generalize to ImageNet?</a>“).</li>
<li>A general trend has been in finding very fast (nearly linear time) method for many classical problems. Sometimes these investigations even led to actually practical algorithm, as with this now classical paper by Marco Cuturi at NIPS 2013 titled “<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4927-sinkhorn-distances-lightspeed-computation-of-optimal-transport" class="liexternal">Sinkhorn Distances: Lightspeed Computation of Optimal Transport</a>“.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Oh, one last thing</h2>
<p>I also heard that, surprisingly, gradient descent can work to optimize highly non-convex functions such as training loss for neural networks. Not sure what this is about, it’s a pretty obscure topic, maybe it will catch up in the decade 2020-2029…</p>
<h2>Share some more in the comments!</h2>
<p>The above is only a tiny sample, there were many many more interesting directions being explored (tensor methods for latent variable models <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume15/anandkumar14b/anandkumar14b.pdf" class="lipdf">[Anandkumar, Ge, Hsu, Kakade, Telgarsky, JMLR 14]</a>; phenomenon of “all local minima are good” for various non-convex learning problems, see e.g., <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6048-matrix-completion-has-no-spurious-local-minimum" class="liexternal">[Ge, Lee, Ma, NIPS 2016]</a>; etc etc).

In many combinatorial games, one can prove that the first player wins under best play using a simple but non-constructive argument called strategy-stealing.
This work is about the complexity behind these proofs: how hard is it to actually find a winning move in a game, when you know by strategy-stealing that one exists? 
We prove that this problem is PSPACE-Complete already for Minimum Poset Games and Symmetric Maker-Maker Games, which are simple classes of games that capture two of the main types of strategy-stealing arguments in the current literature.</div>

<p><em>[The post below is by Dorit Aharonov who co-organized the wonderful school on quantum computing last week which I attended and greatly enjoyed. –Boaz] </em></p>



<p><strong>TL;DR: </strong> Last week we had a wonderful one-week intro course into the math of quantum computing at Hebrew U;  It included a one day crash course on the basics, and 7 mini-courses on math-oriented research topics (quantum delegation, Hamiltonian complexity, algorithms and more) by top-notch speakers. Most importantly – it is all online, and could be very useful if you want to take a week or two to enter the area and don’t know <a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where to start</a>.   </p>



<p><br /><br /><br /></p>



<p>Hi Theory people!  </p>



<p>I want to tell you about a 5-days winter school called “<a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mathematics of Quantum Computation</a>“, which we (me, Zvika Brakerski, Or Sattath and Amnon Ta-Shma) organized last week at the Institute for advanced studies (IIAS) at the Hebrew university in Jerusalem. </p>



<p>There were two reasons I happily agreed to Boaz’s suggestion to write a guest blogpost about this school. <br /><br />a) The school was really great fun. We enjoyed it so much, that I think you might find it interesting to hear about it even if you were not there, or are not even into quantum computation. <br /><br />And b), it might actually be useful for you or your quantum-curious friends. We put all material online, with the goal in mind that after the school, this collection of talks+written material will constitute all that is needed for an almost self-contained <strong>very-intensive-one-week-course of introduction into the mathematical side of quantum computation</strong>; I think this might be of real use for any theoretical computer scientist or mathematician interested in entering this fascinating but hard-to-penetrate area, and not knowing where to start.<br />Before telling you a little more about what we actually learned in this school, let’s start with some names and numbers. We had:  </p>



<ul><li>160 participants (students and faculty) from all over the world. </li><li>7 terrific speakers: Adam Bouland (UC Berkeley), Sergey Bravyi (IBM), Matthias Christandl (Coppenhagen), András Gilyén (Caltech), Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), Avishay Tal (Berkeley), and Thomas Vidick (Caltech); </li><li>2 great TAs:  András Gilyén (Caltech) and Chinmay Nirkhe (UC Berkeley)</li><li>4 busy organizers: myself (Hebrew U), Zvika Brakerski (Weizmann), Or Sattath (Ben Gurion U), and Amnon Ta-Shma (Tel Aviv U)</li><li>1 exciting and very intensive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcFzE1PHxBN4l87sOQB033FZLTgY934GHxnpVKi3NaM/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">program</a></li><li>5 challenging and fascinating days of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> talks</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problem sessions</a> and really <a href="https://shvil.im/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nice food</a>.   </li><li>1 great <a href="https://huji.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=599bc3e9-855e-42c1-ab1d-ab1f0062c481" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rabin’s lecture</a> by Boaz Barak (Harvard)</li><li>1 beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxrxXneg3lU&amp;list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb&amp;index=21&amp;t=0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quantum perspective lecture</a> by Sergey Bravyi (IBM)</li><li>8 panelists in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supremacy panel</a> we had on the fifth day: Sandy Irani (UC Irvine), our wise moderator, and 7 panelists on stage and online: myself, Scott Aaronson (Austin, online), Boaz Barak, Adam Bouland, Sergio Boixo (Google, online), Gil Kalai (Hebrew U), and Umesh Vazirani (UC Berkeley, online) </li><li>8 brave speakers in the gong show, our very last session, each talking for 3 minutes;    </li><li>1 group-tour to 1 UNESCO site (<a href="https://everything-everywhere.com/caves-of-maresha-and-bet-guvrin-in-the-judean-lowlands-as-a-microcosm-of-the-land-of-the-caves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tel Maresha</a>) and <a href="https://www.srigim-beer.co.il/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">6 beers tasted</a> by ~80 tour participants</li><li>3 problem sets with 43 <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems</a> and (!) their <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solution</a>s.   </li></ul>



<p>So why did we decide to organize this particular quantum school, given the many quantum schools around? Well, the area of quantum computation is just bursting now with excitement and new mathematical challenges; But there seems to be no easy way for theoreticians to learn about all these things unless you are already in the loop… The (admittedly) very ambitious goal of the school was to assume zero background in quantum computation, and quickly bring people up to speed on six or seven of the most interesting mathematical research forefronts in the area. </p>



<p>The first day of the school was intended to put everyone essentially on the same page: it included four talks about the very basics (qubits by Or Sattath, circuits, by myself, algorithms by Adam Bouland, and error correction by Sergey Bravyi). By the end of this first day everyone was at least supposed to be familiar with the basic concepts, and capable of listening to the mini-courses to follow. The rest of the school was devoted mainly to those mini-courses, whose topics included what I think are some of the most exciting topics on the more theoretical and mathematical side of quantum computation.</p>



<p>Yes, it was extremely challenging… the good thing was that we had two great TAs, András and Chinmay, who helped prepare problem sets, which people actually seriously tried to solve (!) during the daily one+ hour TA problem-solving sessions (with the help of the team strolling around ready to answer questions…). It seems that this indeed helped people follow, despite the fact that we did get into some hard stuff in those mini-courses… The many questions that were asked throughout the school proved that many people were following and interested till the bitter end. </p>



<p>So here is a summary of the mini-courses, by order of appearance. <br />I added some buzz words of interesting related mathematical notions so that you know where these topics might lead you if you take the paths they suggest.   <br /></p>



<ul><li> Thomas Vidick gave a three-lecture wonderfully clear mini-course providing an intro to the recently very active and exciting area of <strong>quantum verification and delegation</strong>, connecting cryptography and quantum computational complexity. [Thomas didn’t have time to talk about it, but down the road this eventually connects to  approximate representation theory, as well as to Connes embedding conjecture, and more.]</li><li> Sandy Irani gave a beautiful exposition (again, in a a three lecture mini-course) on <strong>quantum Hamiltonian complexity</strong>. Sandy started with Kitaev’s quantum version of the Cook Levin theorem, showing that the local Hamiltonian problem is quantum NP complete; she then explained how this can be extended to more physically relevant questions such as translationally invariant 1D systems, questions about the thermodynamical limit, and more. [This topic is related to open questions such as quantum PCP, which was not mentioned in the school, as well as to beautiful recent results about undecidability of the spectral gap problem, and more.]    </li><li> Matthias Christandl gave an exciting two-lecture mini-course on the fascinating connection between <strong>tensor ranks and matrix product multiplication</strong>. Starting from what seemed to be childish games with small pictures in his first talk, he cleverly used those as his building blocks in his second talk, to enable him to talk about Strassen’s universal spectral points program for approaching the complexity of matrix multiplication, asymptotic ranks, border ranks and more. That included also very beautiful pictures of polytopes! Matthias explained the connection that underlines this entire direction, between entanglement properties of three body systems, with these old combinatorial problems.  </li><li> Avishay Tal gave a really nice two-lecture exposition on his recent breakthrough result with Ran Raz, proving that <strong>quantum polynomial time computation is not contained in the polynomial Hierarchy, in the oracle model</strong>. This included talking about AC0, a problem called forrelation, Fourier expansion, Gaussians and much more.</li><li>  András Gilyén gave a wonderful talk about a recent development: the evolution of the <strong>singular value approach to quantum algorithms</strong>. He left us all in awe showing that essentially almost any quantum algorithm you can think of falls into this beautiful framework… Among other things, he mentioned Chebychev’s polynomials, quantum walks, Hamiltonian simulations, and more. What else can be done with this framework remains to be seen.</li><li>Sergey Bravyi gave two talks (on top of his intro to quantum error correction). The first was as part of a monthly series at Hebrew university, called  “quantum perspectives”; in this talk, Sergey gave a really nice exposition of his breakthrough result (with Gosset and Konig) demonstrating an <strong><em>information theoretical</em> separation between quantum and classical constant depth circuits</strong>; this uses in a clever way the well known quantum magic square game enabling quantum correlations to win with probability one, while classical correlations are always bounded away from one;  somehow this result manages to cleverly turn this game into a computational advantage. In Sergey’s last talk, he gave the basics of the beautiful topic of <strong>stoqaustic Hamiltonians </strong>–  a model in between quantum Hamiltonians and classical constrained satisfaction problems, which poses many fundamental and interesting open questions (and is tightly related to classical Markov chains, and Markov chain Monte Carlo). </li><li>Finally, Adam Bouland gave two superb talks on <strong>quantum supremacy</strong>, explaining the beautiful challenges in this area – including his recent average case to worst case hardness results about sampling using quantum circuits, which is related to Google’s supremacy experiment.  </li><li>Ah, I also gave a talk – it was about three of the many different equivalent models of quantum computation – <strong>adiabatic computation</strong>, <strong>quantum walks</strong>, and the <strong>Jones polynomial </strong>(I also briefly mentioned a differential geometry model). The talk came out way too disordered in my mind (never give a talk when you are an organizer!), but hopefully it gave some picture about the immense variety of ways to think about quantum computation and quantum algorithms.</li></ul>



<p>In addition to the main lectures, we also had some special events intertwined: </p>



<ul><li>Boaz Barak gave the distinguished annual Rabin lecture, joint with the CS colloquium; His talk, which was given the intriguing title  <strong>“Quantum computing and classical algorithms: The best of frenemies”</strong>, focused on the fickle relationships between quantum and classical algorithms. The main players in this beautiful talk were SDPs and sums of squares, and it left us with many open questions.     </li><li>Last but not least, we had an <strong>international panel about the meaning of Google’s recent experiment claiming supremacy</strong>, joined by Sergio Boixo from Google explaining the experiment, as well as Scott Aaronson and Umesh Vazirani who woke up very early in the US to join us. I feared we would have some friction and fist fights, but this actually became a deep and interesting discussion! We went with quite some depth into the most important question in my mind about the supremacy experiment, which is the issue of noise; Unbelievably, it all went well even from the technological aspect! I really recommend watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4t2G2gay7Q&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion</a>. </li></ul>



<p>So, we had a great time…. and as I said, one of the best things is that it is all recorded and saved. You are welcome to follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcFzE1PHxBN4l87sOQB033FZLTgY934GHxnpVKi3NaM/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">program</a>, watch the recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTn74Qx5mPsS2dqTpEq_2zxq8kWBmPUfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks</a>, consult the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1n6W3Yjq2TYsyRwrocbN2bWK-xpyzkqSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lecture notes, slides, and the problems sets and their solutions</a>, and also read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-DLl_M-Dpqh9RdSqn6f9l01e09AaLndMlbxDEmlPrw/edit?ts=5dc7c2b3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading material</a> if you want to extend your knowledge beyond what is covered in the school. In case you know of any math or TCS-oriented person who wants to enter the field and start working on some problem at the forefront of research, just send him or her this post, or the link of the <a href="https://iias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">school’s website</a>;  It will take a very intensive week (well, maybe two) of following lectures and doing the exercises, but by the end of that time, one is guaranteed to be no longer a complete amateur to the area, as the set of topics covered gives a pretty good picture of what is going on in the field.   <br />  </p>



<p>Last but not least, I would like to thank the Israeli quantum initiative, Vatat, and the IIAS, for their generous funding which enabled this school and the funding of students; the IIAS team for their immense help in organization;   and of course, thanks a lot to all participants who attended the school!<br /></p>



<p>Wishing everyone a very happy year of 2020,  </p>
