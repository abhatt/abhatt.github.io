Brendan Lucier and Csaba Szepesvári were consecutive speakers at this week’s <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/AutoAlg2019/">workshop</a> at the Toyota Technological Institute in Chicago on “Automated Algorithm Design.”</p>
<p>
Today I will discuss their talks, which I enjoyed greatly at the workshop.</p>
<p>
The workshop’s general theme was the use of machine-learning techniques to improve the tuning of algorithms. Indeed, the goal is to have the algorithm tune itself by selecting strategies from a collection of possible ones. Besides better performance with less human work, this promises better logical reliability than with hand-tuning programs and debugging. </p>
<p>
A common component of this work used in both talks is an interesting oracle model. Since oracles are familiar to many of us theorists this will give us an avenue into the talks and the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0dce/10ed863423e2e9b1b77a0becfc23111578be.pdf">two</a> recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00755.pdf">papers</a> they were based on.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Runtime Oracles </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The oracle has a nonnegative matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> of shape <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \times M}" class="latex" title="{n \times M}" />. Think of the entry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" title="{R(i,j)}" /> as the <i>runtime</i> of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%5E%7Bth%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i^{th}}" class="latex" title="{i^{th}}" /> program on the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%5E%7Bth%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j^{th}}" class="latex" title="{j^{th}}" /> input.

You may ask the oracle a question <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(i,j,t)}" class="latex" title="{(i,j,t)}" />:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Is the entry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" title="{R(i,j)}" /> less than or equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />?</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is a time bound. Further they assume that the oracle charges you 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmin%28R%28i%2Cj%29%2Ct%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \min(R(i,j),t). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \min(R(i,j),t). " /></p>
<p>Thus an algorithm is charged in total 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bt%7D+%5Cmin%28R%28i%2Cj%29%2Ct%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{t} \min(R(i,j),t), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \sum_{t} \min(R(i,j),t), " /></p>
<p>where the sum is over all questions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%2Ct%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(i,j,t)}" class="latex" title="{(i,j,t)}" /> you asked. 	 The rationale is that the oracle can run a program <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i}" class="latex" title="{i}" /> on a task <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" /> and stop after at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> steps. Thus returning the minimum is realistic. Since their research is motivated by practical problems, this is a useful model for studying questions about program performance. </p>
<p>
In passing I believe the reason this oracle model is new is that theorists do not often think about running arbitrary programs. Well those in recursion type did, but those designing classic algorithms do not. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> A Selection Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
This model to used to study a selection problem. Assume <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> is as above. The task is to find the row with the smallest row sum <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_%7Bi%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_{i}}" class="latex" title="{s_{i}}" />: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++s_%7Bi%7D+%3D+%5Csum_%7Bj%3D1%7D%5E%7BM%7D+R%28i%2Cj%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  s_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{M} R(i,j). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  s_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{M} R(i,j). " /></p>
<p>That is to find the program that takes the least total time on the inputs—hence the least average time.</p>
<p>
The trouble is that in the worst case this can require examining all the entries. So they introduce approximations to make the problem doable, but still useful in practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
The rows need only be a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281%2B%5Cepsilon%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(1+\epsilon)}" class="latex" title="{(1+\epsilon)}" /> approximation to the smallest row. <p></p>
</li><li>
The entries can be assumed to be truncated by a value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctau%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tau}" class="latex" title="{\tau}" />. That is you can assume that 	<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++R%28i%2Cj%29+%5Cle+%5Ctau.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  R(i,j) \le \tau. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  R(i,j) \le \tau. " /></p>
</li><li>
The governing algorithm can be randomized and need only meet the performance goal with high probability.
</li></ol>
<p>
Now we can state the problem formally. It is parameterized by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cepsilon%2C+%5Ctau%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\epsilon, \tau)}" class="latex" title="{(\epsilon, \tau)}" />:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The talks gave a variety of randomized algorithms that solve such problems for various parameter assumptions. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Fast and Slow </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
See their papers for details on the results. The algorithms they have are interesting not only from a theory viewpoint but also in practice. Indeed, they not only prove theorems but also give experimental timings.</p>
<p>
In order to establish some intuition, let’s look at the following simple case. Assume that all entries <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" title="{R(i,j)}" /> are either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> or some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha+%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha \gg 1}" class="latex" title="{\alpha \gg 1}" />. This is the “fast-or-slow” running time stipulation. As theorists we often are drawn to binary values, so this might be a good case to look at initially.</p>
<p>
The first observation is that we will always ask questions of the form 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28i%2C+j%2C+1.0001%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (i, j, 1.0001). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (i, j, 1.0001). " /></p>
<p>This gives us the value of the entry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(i,j)}" class="latex" title="{R(i,j)}" /> for almost unit cost: if it is the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%28i%2Cj%29+%5Cgg+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R(i,j) \gg 1}" class="latex" title="{R(i,j) \gg 1}" /> case then we are only charged <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1.0001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1.0001}" class="latex" title="{1.0001}" />. Thus, we have reduced the original problem to a classic oracle problem. There is no complicated oracle cost measure: the cost is just the number of entries we read. Well okay the cost is slightly higher, but we can make it as close as we wish.</p>
<p>
The selection problem then comes down to this: </p>
<ul>
<li>
We have a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \times M}" class="latex" title="{n \times M}" /> nonnegative matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> whose entries are all either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Calpha%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\alpha}" class="latex" title="{\alpha}" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
We must find a row sum that is within a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1+\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{1+\epsilon}" /> of the smallest.
</li></ul>
<p>
I believe that the analysis of this problem should be generally known. In any event it seems clear that randomly sampling each row is a good start.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Are there other natural problems where the runtime cost oracle is useful?</p>

edge weights that characterize performance metrics such as loss and delay.
Network tomography aims to infer these edge weights from their pathwise
versions measured on a set of intersecting paths between a subset of boundary
vertices, and even the underlying graph when this is not known. Recent work has
established conditions under which the underlying directed graph can be
recovered exactly the pairwise Path Correlation Data, namely, the set of
weights of intersection of each pair of directed paths to and from each
endpoint. Algorithmically, this enables us to consistently fused tree-based
view of the set of network paths to and from each endpoint to reconstruct the
underlying network.
</p>
<p>However, in practice the PCD is not consistently determined by path
measurements. Statistical fluctuations give rise to inconsistent inferred
weight of edges from measurement based on different endpoints, as do
operational constraints on synchronization, and deviations from the underlying
packet transmission model. Furthermore, ad hoc solutions to eliminate noise,
such as pruning small weight inferred links, are hard to apply in a consistent
manner that preserves known end-to-end metric values.
</p>
<p>This paper takes a unified approach to the problem of inconsistent weight
estimation. We formulate two type of inconsistency: \textsl{intrinsic}, when
the weight set is internally inconsistent, and \textsl{extrinsic}, when they
are inconsistent with a set of known end-to-end path metrics. In both cases we
map inconsistent weight to consistent PCD within a least-squares framework. We
evaluate the performance of this mapping in composition with tree-based
inference algorithms.

Plotkin [FOCS'89], are one of the key algorithmic tools in distributed graph
algorithms. We present an improved deterministic distributed algorithm for
constructing network decompositions of power graphs using small messages, which
improves upon the algorithm of Ghaffari and Kuhn [DISC'18]. In addition, we
provide a randomized distributed network decomposition algorithm, based on our
deterministic algorithm, with failure probability exponentially small in the
input size that works with small messages as well. Compared to the previous
algorithm of Elkin and Neiman [PODC'16], our algorithm achieves a better
success probability at the expense of its round complexity, while giving a
network decomposition of the same quality. As a consequence of the randomized
algorithm for network decomposition, we get a faster randomized algorithm for
computing a Maximal Independent Set, improving on a result of Ghaffari
[SODA'19]. Other implications of our improved deterministic network
decomposition algorithm are: a faster deterministic distributed algorithms for
constructing spanners and approximations of distributed set cover, improving
results of Ghaffari, and Kuhn [DISC'18] and Deurer, Kuhn, and Maus [PODC'19];
and faster a deterministic distributed algorithm for constructing neighborhood
covers, resolving an open question of Elkin [SODA'04].

tree that connects all of the vertices of the graph with minimum sum of edge
weights. In real world applications, network designers often seek to quickly
find a replacement edge for each edge in the MST. For example, when a traffic
accident closes a road in a transportation network, or a line goes down in a
communication network, the replacement edge may reconnect the MST at lowest
cost. In the paper, we consider the case of finding the lowest cost replacement
edge for each edge of the MST. A previous algorithm by Tarjan takes $O(m
\alpha(n, m))$ time, where $\alpha(n, m)$ is the inverse Ackermann's function.
Our algorithm is the first that runs in $O(n + m)$ time and $O(n + m)$ space.
Moreover, it is easy to implement and our experimental study demonstrates fast
performance on several types of graphs. The most vital edge is the graph edge
whose removal causes the largest increase in weight of the minimum spanning
tree. Our algorithm also finds the most vital edge in linear time.

algorithm that for every graph $G$ from the class, assigns bit strings (labels)
to vertices of $G$ so that for any two vertices $u,v$, whether $u$ and $v$ are
adjacent can be determined by a fixed procedure that examines only their
labels. It is known that planar graphs with $n$ vertices admit a labeling
scheme with labels of bit length $(2+o(1))\log{n}$. In this work we improve
this bound by designing a labeling scheme with labels of bit length
$(\frac{4}{3}+o(1))\log{n}$. In graph-theoretical terms, this implies an
explicit construction of a graph on $n^{4/3+o(1)}$ vertices that contains all
planar graphs on $n$ vertices as induced subgraphs, improving the previous best
upper bound of $n^{2+o(1)}$. Our scheme generalizes to graphs of bounded Euler
genus with the same label length up to a second-order term. All the labels of
the input graph can be computed in polynomial time, while adjacency can be
decided from the labels in constant time.

computing the permanent of 0-1 matrices, is an important combinatorial problem
that has been extensively studied by theoreticians and practitioners alike. The
permanent is #P-Complete; hence it is unlikely that a polynomial-time algorithm
exists for the problem. Researchers have therefore focused on finding tractable
subclasses of matrices for permanent computation. One such subclass that has
received much attention is that of sparse matrices i.e. matrices with few
entries set to 1, the rest being 0. For this subclass, improved theoretical
upper bounds and practically efficient algorithms have been developed. In this
paper, we ask whether it is possible to go beyond sparse matrices in our quest
for developing scalable techniques for the permanent, and answer this question
affirmatively. Our key insight is to represent permanent computation
symbolically using Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADDs). ADD-based techniques
naturally use dynamic programming, and hence avoid redundant computation
through memoization. This permits exploiting the hidden structure in a large
class of matrices that have so far remained beyond the reach of permanent
computation techniques. The availability of sophisticated libraries
implementing ADDs also makes the task of engineering practical solutions
relatively straightforward. While a complete characterization of matrices
admitting a compact ADD representation remains open, we provide strong
experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our approach for computing the
permanent, not just for sparse matrices, but also for dense matrices and for
matrices with "similar" rows.

We present a deterministic algorithm for reconstructing multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuits, i.e. multilinear depth-$4$ circuits with fan-in $k$ at the top $+$ gate. For any fixed $k$, given black-box access to a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}]$ computable by a multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuit of size $s$, the algorithm runs in time quasi-poly($n,s,{|\mathbb{F}|}$) and outputs a multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuit of size quasi-poly($n,s$) that computes $f$. 

Our result solves an open problem posed in \cite{GKL12} (STOC, 2012). Indeed, prior to our work, efficient reconstruction algorithms for multilinear $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi(k)$ circuits were known only for the case of $k=2$ \cite{GKL12, Volkovich17}.</div>

Lifting theorems are theorems that relate the query complexity of a function $f:\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^n\to \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$ to the communication complexity of the composed function $f\circ g^n$, for some “gadget” $g:\left\{ 0,1 \right\}^b\times \left\{ 0,1 \right\}^b\to \left\{ 0,1 \right\}$. Such theorems allow transferring lower bounds from query complexity to the communication complexity, and have seen numerous applications in the recent years. In addition, such theorems can be viewed as a strong generalization of a direct-sum theorem for the gadget $g$.

We prove a new lifting theorem that works for all gadgets $g$ that have logarithmic length and exponentially-small discrepancy, for both deterministic and randomized communication complexity. Thus, we significantly increase the range of gadgets for which such lifting theorems hold.

Our result has two main motivations: First, allowing a larger variety of gadgets may support more applications. In particular, our work is the first to prove a randomized lifting theorem for logarithmic-size gadgets, thus improving some applications of the theorem. Second, our result can be seen as a strong generalization of a direct-sum theorem for functions with low discrepancy.</div>

<p><i>Sign up for the new posts via the <a href="https://blog.ilyaraz.org/rss/">RSS feed</a></i>.</p>
<p>Below I show a neat application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_hash_function">perfect hashing</a>, which is one of my favorite (cluster of) algorithms. Amazingly, we use it to obtain a purely information-theoretic (rather than algorithmic) statement.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a finite universe $U$ of size $n$ and a $k$-element subset of it $S \subseteq U$ with $k \ll n$. How many bits do we need to encode it? The obvious answer is $\log_2 \binom{n}{k} = \Theta(k \cdot \log(n / k))$.<br />
Can we, however, improve this bound if we allow some approximation?</p>
<p>Even if $n = 2k$, it is not difficult to show the lower bound of $k \cdot \log_2(1 / \delta)$ bits if we allow to be wrong when answering queries “does $x$ belong to $S$?” with probability at most $\delta$ (hint: $\varepsilon$-nets). Can we match this lower bound?</p>
<p>One approach that does not quite work is to hash each element of $S$ to an $l$-bit string using a sufficiently good hash function $h \colon U \to \{0, 1\}^l$, and, when checking if $x$ lies in $S$, compute $h(x)$ and check if this value is among the hashes of $S$. To see why it does not work, let us analyze it: if $x \notin S$, then the probability that $h(x)$ coincides with at least one hash of an element of $S$ is around $k \cdot 2^{-l}$. To make the latter less than $\delta$, we need to take $l = \log_2(k / \delta)$ yielding the overall bound of $k \cdot \log_2(k / \delta)$ falling short of the desired size.</p>
<p>To get the optimal size, we need to avoid using the union bound in the above argument. In order to accomplish this, let us use perfect hashing on top of the above hashing scheme! It is convenient to use a particular approach to perfect hashing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing">Cuckoo hashing</a>. In short, there is a way to generate two simple hash functions $h_1, h_2 \in U \to [m]$ for $m = O(k)$ and place the elements of our set $S$ into $m$ bins without collisions so that for every $x \in S$, the element $x$ is placed either in $h_1(x)$ or in $h_2(x)$. Now, to encode our set $S$, we build a Cuckoo hash table for it, and then for each of the $m$ bins, we either store one bit indicating that it’s empty, or store an $l$-bit hash of an element that is placed into it. Now we can set $l = \log_2(2 / \delta)$, since we compare the hash of a query to merely two hashes, instead of $k$. This gives the overall size $m + k \cdot \log_2 (2 / \delta) = k \cdot (\log_2(1 / \delta) + O(1))$, which is optimal up to a low-order term. Of course, the encoding should include $h_1$, $h_2$ and $h$, but it turns out they can be taken to be sufficiently simple so that their size does not really matter.</p>
<p>Two remarks are in order. First, in this context people usually bring up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filters</a>. However, they require space, which is $1.44$ times bigger, and, arguably, they are more mysterious (if technically simple). Second, one may naturally wonder why anyone would care about distinguishing bounds like $k \cdot \log_2 (1 / \delta)$ and $k \cdot \log_2(k / \delta)$. In my opinion, there are two answers to this. First, it is just a cool application of perfect hashing (an obligatory link to <a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2010-12-09">one of my favorite comic strips</a>). Second, compressing sets is actually important in practice and constant factors do matter, for instance when we are aiming to transfer the set over the network.</p>
<p><b>Update</b> <a href="https://cs.au.dk/~larsen/">Kasper Green Larsen</a> observed that we can combine the naive and not-quite-working solutions to obtain the optimal bound. Namely, by hashing everything to $\log_2(k / \delta)$ bits, we effectively reduce the universe size to $n’ = k / \delta$. Then, the naive encoding takes $\log_2 \binom{n’}{k} \approx H(\delta) \cdot n’ = H(\delta) \cdot k / \delta \approx<br />
k \cdot \log_2 (1 / \delta)$ bits.</p></div>

graphs that allow for representations satisfying certain local geometric or

graph class for its maximum edge density, another parameter that is often
considered in the literature is the size of the largest complete or complete

<p>Overcoming the limitations of standard combinatorial arguments, we present a

the aforementioned parameter.

computational complexities. Enabling \emph{all OFDM-IM waveforms} maximizes the

computational overhead of the resulting mapper remains conjectured as
prohibitive across the OFDM-IM literature. For an $N$-subcarrier symbol, we
show that OFDM-IM needs a $\Theta(2^N/\sqrt{N})$-entry LUT to ensure that any
sequence of $N/2+\lfloor \log_2{N\choose N/2}\rfloor$ bits can be mapped in the
same asymptotic time of the classic OFDM mapper i.e., $O(N)$. We demonstrate
this trade-off between SE and computational complexity can be improved if one
stores $\Theta(N^2)$ binomial coefficients (the so-called Pascal's triangle)
instead of the classic LUT. With this, we show the OFDM-IM mapper can achieve
its maximal SE in the same time complexity of the OFDM's mapper under
polynomial (rather than exponential) space resources.

We consider two versions of the problem of testing graph isomorphism in the bounded-degree graph model: A version in which one graph is fixed, and a version in which the input consists of two graphs.
We essentially determine the query complexity of these testing problems in the special case of $n$-vertex graphs with connected components of size at most $\poly(\log n)$. 
This is done by showing that these problems are computationally equivalent (up to polylogarithmic factors) to corresponding problems regarding isomorphism between sequences (over a large alphabet). 
Ignoring the dependence on the proximity parameter, our main results are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
The query complexity of testing isomorphism to a fixed object (i.e., an $n$-vertex graph or an $n$-long sequence) is ${\widetilde{\Theta}(n^{1/2})$. 
\item 
The query complexity of testing isomorphism between two input objects is ${\widetilde{\Theta}}(n^{2/3})$. 
\end{enumerate}
Testing isomorphism between two sequences is shown to be related to testing that two distributions are equivalent, and this relation yields reductions in three of the four relevant cases. 
Failing to reduce the problem of testing the equivalence of two distribution to the problem of testing isomorphism between two sequences, we adapt the proof of the lower bound on the complexity of the first problem to the second problem.
This adaptation constitutes the main technical contribution of the current work. 

Determining the complexity of testing graph isomorphism (in the bounded-degree graph model), in the general case (i.e., for arbitrary bounded-degree graphs), is left open.</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>After <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/08/07/report-from-wads.html">WADS</a>, I stayed in Edmonton for <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~cccg2019/">CCCG</a>. The two conferences have not always been in the same places, but this year they were co-located, and the plan is to continue that pattern in odd years (when WADS is held). As far as I know there are no plans to move CCCG to Scandinavia for SWAT in the even years.</p>

<p>Like WADS, CCCG had three invited speakers. In past years, two were named the Paul Erdős Memorial Lecture and the Ferran Hurtado Memorial Lecture. This year, sadly, the third one has also been named, as the Godfried Toussaint Memorial Lecture.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Erdős Lecture was by Vida Dujmović, who spoke on her breakthrough work with several other Barbados workshop participants showing that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04791">every planar graph is a subgraph of a strong product of a path graph and a bounded-pathwidth graph</a>, from which it follows that these graphs have bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_number">queue number</a>, that they can be embedded into 3d grids of linear volume, and many other nice properties. The timing of the lecture invitation to Vida was good, as the breakthrough happened after she had already agreed to speak!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Toussaint Lecture was by Joseph O’Rourke. Joe spoke on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)">polyhedral unfolding</a>, the problem of cutting the boundary of a polyhedron into a surface that can unfold into a simple polygon in the plane. One of the points of his talk was to rationalize some of the terminology in this area. The standard version of the problem asks for (in his new terminology) an <em>edge-unfolding</em>, a set of cuts along edges of the polyhedron, forming a spanning tree for its vertices, such that the resulting cut surface unfolds to a flat polygon. But one can also ask for an anycut-unfolding, using cuts that do not have to follow the edges. Or one can ask for an edge-unzipping or anycut-unzipping, in which the cuts must form a single (Hamiltonian) path through the vertices of the polyhedron. In this terminology <a href="http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/d_urers_conjecture">Dürer’s conjecture</a> becomes the statement that every convex polyhedron has an edge-unfolding, and the example I recently posted of a <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/07/29/zipless-polycube.html">zipless polycube</a> shows that not every polycube has an edge-unzipping. Another well-known open question in this area asks whether every polycube whose boundary forms a topological sphere has an edge-unfolding. Joe conjectured that with high probability the convex hull of many random points on a sphere does not have an anycut-unzipping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mark de Berg presented the Hurtado Lecture. His topic involved subexponential algorithms for disk intersection graphs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_disk_graph">unit disk graphs</a>. At STOC 2018 he had a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10633">finding the maximum independent set in disk graphs</a> in time , matching the time for planar graphs. In planar graphs, you can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_separator_theorem">planar separator theorem</a>: for each of the  independent subsets of the separator, recurse on both sides. This turns out to work in disk graphs by replacing the usual size bound on the separator (it should have  vertices) with a decomposition into a union of cliques  with . The separators can be found analogously to classical circle-packing methods for planar separators. Each clique can contribute one vertex to any independent set from which it follows that the separator again has  independent subsets. The same idea works for other problems like dominating sets in unit disk graphs (where the unit assumption is used to get a bounded contribution from each clique), and generalizes to fat objects in higher dimensions. The time bound is optimal assuming the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>. And in FOCS 2018 de Berg obtained similar <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06933">ETH-tight time bounds for the Euclidean traveling salesperson problem</a> by using separators of point sets with the property that few points are very close to the separator boundary.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I can’t find links for all the contributed papers, but you can find them in the <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~cccg2019/cccg2019_proceedings.pdf">complete proceedings</a>. Among them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In “Three-Coloring Three-Dimensional Uniform Hypergraphs”, Biniaz, Bose, Cardinal, and Payne prove that, for  points in the plane and a fixed triangle shape, one can -color the points so that every scaled and translated copy of the triangle containing six or more points has more than one color. It was already known that if you change “six or more” to “two or more” you need four colors, and if you change it to “nine or more” you need only two colors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Audrey St. John’s talk on “Redundant Persistent Acyclic Formations for Vision-Based Control of Distributed Multi-Agent Formations” (with Burns, Klemperer, and Solyst) was beset by technical difficulties, but from it I learned that there is a theory of directed bar-and-joint frameworks, analogous to undirected rigidity theory, called “persistence theory”, and that the <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/12/07/kinematic-chains-and.html">pebble game</a> for testing rigidity of an undirected framework produces an orientation of the network that is persistent. She used the analogy of a flock of geese, walking in formation: each goose pays attention only to the other geese in front, but the whole formation can keep its shape as the leading goose moves arbitrarily. Her goal is to get robots to do the same thing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In “Chirotopes of Random Points in Space are Realizable on a Small Integer Grid”, Cardinal, Fabila-Monroy and Hidalgo-Toscano prove that, with high probability, random point sets in  can be rounded to a grid of polynomial size without changing their order type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We had enough folding and unfolding papers to spill out over more than one section. Among them, I particularly liked “Efficient Segment Folding is Hard” by Klute, Parada, Horiyama, Korman, Uehara and Yamanaka. The question they asked is: given disjoint line segments on a piece of paper, when can you make a sequence of simple folds (that is, for a given fold line, folding all the layers of the paper that are crossed by the line), with each fold on a line through one of the segments that misses all the other segments? It turns out to be -complete. If you do allow fold lines to pass through other segments, folding sequences can be infinite, and it’s unknown whether every set of segments has a finite sequence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pilar Cano spoke on generating triangulations of point sets in an affine-invariant way (“Affine invariant triangulations” with Bose and Silveira). The main trick is to use covariance to choose a canonical affine transformation for the points, after which you can use Delaunay, minimum weight, or your favorite other triangulation algorithm. But there are necessarily some general position assumptions (as there already are for using Delaunay triangulation without the affine invariance): for points in a parallelogram, there is no affine-invariant way of choosing which diagonal to use.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The excursion was to the <a href="https://royalalbertamuseum.ca/">Royal Alberta Museum</a>, where I skipped the special exhibit on Vikings (having gone to museum exhibits on them in Copenhagen a year earlier) and instead learned much about Great Plains geology and the historical mistreatment of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tis">Métis</a>, local people descending both from First Nations and Europeans. (The First Nations themselves were of course also badly mistreated, but I had more of an idea of that already.)</p>

<p>From the business meeting, we heard that the acceptance ratio was a little higher than last year, but still approximately . Two papers were withdrawn because the authors had visa issues, double the number from last year, and several others were presented by non-authors after their authors were unable to attend. One possible improvement would be to move the submission and acceptance dates earlier to provide authors more time to obtain visas. The main topic of discussion was the conference’s status as a conference: should papers at CCCG continue to count as publications (in which case why are they still limited to only six pages) or should they be considered as preliminary announcements of papers that can still be sent to other more prestigious symposia? One possible compromise involves giving authors a choice: either publish your paper in the proceedings or give up the proceedings slot but still present your work in some other way (possibly as a poster, as GD does).</p>

<p>The course is oriented to grad students (and faculty), with reasonable background in mathematics, and with interest in the connections between mathematical and computational aspects of quantum mechanics. Students who attend it will be awarded two N”Z after passing an exam. The goal of the course is to initiate and lead to new connections between the seemingly unrelated areas of quantum computation and symplectic geometry.</p>
<p>The topics will include:</p>
<p>– Introduction to quantum computation, quantum universality, quantum algorithms<br />
and quantum computational complexity classes such as BQP and Quantum NP (QMA)</p>
<p>– quantum measurement and quantum noise explained using the standard quantum computational model.</p>
<p>– questions about quantum error correction and quantum noise – fault tolerance,<br />
quantum error correcting codes, and the breakdown of robustness when the locality of<br />
the noise does not hold.</p>
<p>– quantum measurement/quantum information (noise and speed limit) having classical counterparts, studied from the symplectic geometry perspective.</p>
<p>– Konsevich theorem and quantization,</p>
<p>– towards a the semi classical approximation of quantum computers.</p>
<p>Examples of questions we would like to initiate research on are:</p>
<p>1) what would be a semi classical model of quantum computation, and what would be<br />
its computational power?</p>
<p>2) what is a good notion of complexity in a symplextic geometry computational model?</p>
<p>3) What can we learn from basic symplectic geometry results (such as non squeezing)<br />
about the limitations on quantum computation in the semi classical limit?</p>
<p>4) Can noise in quantum computation be related in any way with the semi classical limit<br />
of quantum computing systems?</p>
<p>5) can we learn anything about the possible noise models in quantum computers,<br />
using our knowledge from symplectic geometry?</p>
<p>Hope to see you in the course!</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Mathematics of Quantum Computation -The 4th Advanced School in Computer Science and Engineering</strong></span></h3>
<p>On 15-19 December 2019, we will be organizing a math-oriented quantum computation school in the IIAS at the Hebrew university. No prior knowledge on quantum will be assumed.  The school will introduce TCS and math students and faculty, who are interested in the more mathematical side of the area, to the beautiful and fascinating mathematical open questions in quantum computation, starting from scratch. We hope to reach a point where participants gain initial tools and basic perspective to start working in this area.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we will have several mini-courses, each of two or three hours, about central topics in the area.   These will include quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, quantum supremacy, delegation and verification, interactive proofs, cryptography, and Hamiltonian complexity. We will emphasize concepts, open questions, and links to mathematics. We will have daily TA sessions with hands-on exercises, to allow for a serious process of learning.</p>
<p>There will be two rounds of registration. The first deadline is 23rd of August. If there is room, there will be another deadline sometime in October; please follow <a href="http://ias.huji.ac.il/SchoolCSE4">this page</a> for further announcements.</p>
<p>Hope to see you this coming December!</p></div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/08/obstacles-to-improving-classical.html">Obstacles to improving Classical Factoring Algorithms</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="content">
In Samuel Wagstaff's excellent book The Joy of Factoring (see <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~fgreen/SIGACTReviews/bookrev/47-2.pdf">here</a> for a review) there is a discussion towards the end about why factoring algorithms have not made much progress recently. I<br />
paraphrase it:<br />
<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The time complexities of the fastest known algorithms can be expressed as a formula of the following form (where N is the number to be factored):<br />
<br />
(*)                      exp(c(ln N)^t (ln(ln N))^{1-t})<br />
<br />
for some constants c and for 0 &lt; t &lt; 1.  For the Quadratic Sieve (QS) and Elliptic Curve Method (ECM) t=1/2. For the Number Field Sieve (NFS) t=1/3. The reason for this shape for the time complexity is the requirement of finding one or more smooth numbers (numbers that have only small primes as factors).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This got me thinking: Okay, there may not be a drastic improvement anytime soon but what about just improving t? Is there a mathematical reason<br />
why an algorithm with (say) t=1/4 has not been discovered? In an earlier era I would have had to write a letter to Dr. Wagstaff to ask him. Buy an envelope, buy a  stamp, find his address, the whole nine yards (my younger readers should ask their grandparents what envelopes and stamps were). In the current era I emailed him. And got a response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Samuel Wagstaff:<br />
<br />
The fastest known factoring algorithms find smooth numbers subject to parameter choice(s).  In all these algorithms, one parameter choice is the smoothness bound B:  a number is smooth if all its prime factors are &lt; B. The NFS has the degree of a polynomial as an additional parameter.<br />
<br />
One analyzes the complexity of these algorithms by estimating the total work required (to find enough smooth numbers) for an arbitrary parameter choice using Dickman's function to predict the density of smooth numbers.  Then one uses calculus to find the parameter choice(s) that minimize the total work function.  Calculus also yields the optimal values for the parameter(s).<br />
<br />
If you have k parameters to choose, you will get the time complexity (*) with t = 1/(1+k).  If you have no parameters (k = 0),you get (*) with t = 1, basically exponential time N^c.  With one parameter to optimize, as in CFRAC  (continued fractions algorithm) and QS, you get t = 1/2.  NFS has two parameters, so t = 1/3. ECM also has t = 1/2 because it uses only one parameter, the smoothness bound B. If you want to get t = 1/4, you have to find a third parameter to optimize.  No one has found one yet. That is the answer to your question.<br />
<br />
Note that some choices made in some factoring algorithms don't count as parameters.  For example, the number of polynomials used in the multiple-polynomial quadratic sieve, and the upper bound on large primes kept, don't affect t.  They affect the running time only in making c smaller.  So you have to find a third parameter that matters in order to get (*) with t = 1/4.  Or find three completely different new parameters.<br />
<br />

<p>I’m in Edmonton, Canada for <a href="http://wads.org/">WADS</a>, which just finished, and <a href="http://cccg.ca/">CCCG</a>, which is just about to begin.</p>

<p>The three invited talks at WADS were by Rasmus Pagh, Bob Tarjan, and me. Pagh spoke on methods for representing sets of elements by concise sketches so that the size of intersections or unions of the sets could be rapidly and accurately estimated. A famous method for this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinHash">MinHash</a>, in which one represents a set by the  elements with the smallest values of some hash function; the size of the overlap in representations is then an accurate estimator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">Jaccard similarity</a> of pairs of sets. New to me were -bit variations of MinHash, in which you can get almost as accurate a representation in much less space by mapping each element of the MinHash set to  by another hash function. This works well when the Jaccard similarity is bounded away from both  and , and Pagh spoke about some recent research he and others had done on finding even more accurate methods when it is near  or near .</p>

<p>Tarjan spoke about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.06177">parallel algorithms for connected components in graphs</a>, an old area but one in which apparently there have been frequent published mistakes. He presented a modular analysis of the algorithms in this area according to some basic operations they perform (hooking together roots of trees on components, propagating that root information downwards through the trees, flattening the trees to make the information propagate more quickly, and the like) and showed that simple combinations of these operations lead to new, simple, efficient and more importantly provably-correct algorithms.</p>

<p>My talk, “Graphs in Nature”, was about finding graph-theoretic characterizations of surface-embedded graphs arising in natural processes, and using those characterizations to find algorithms to reconstruct synthetic geometric structures of the same type from their graphs. I also gave roughly the same talk a month earlier, at the Symposium on Geometry Processing in Milan. <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-WADS-19.pdf">I’ve put my talk slides online</a> in case anyone else is interested.</p>

<p>The best paper award went to Hüseyin Acan, Sankardeep Chakraborty, Seungbum Jo and Srinivasa Rao Satti for their paper “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09228">Succinct Data Structures for Families of Interval Graphs</a>”. I can’t tell you much about the talk because, unfortunately, I missed it. I didn’t know it was the best paper until the business meeting that evening, so I went to the other parallel session instead.</p>

<p>I think the contributed talk from Tuesday that most stood out to me was Bryce Sandlund’s, on offline dynamic graph algorithms. This is a type of problem <a href="https://doi.org/10.1006/jagm.1994.1033">I worked on long ago for minimum spanning trees</a> in which you get as input a whole sequence of edge insertions and deletions in a graph, and must produce as output the sequence of changes to the solution to whatever you’re trying to solve. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24766-9_40">Bryce’s new paper with Peng and Sleator</a> solves similar problems for higher-order graph connectivity. The main idea is to hierarchically decompose the update sequence into intervals, and then represent the non-dynamic part of the graph within each interval by a smaller equivalent replacement graph whose size is proportional to the interval length. At the end of his talk, Bryce hinted that he could also solve incremental problems (where the updates are given one at a time rather than all in advance, but are only insertions) using similar methods in a forthcoming paper.</p>

<p>I was inspired by Caleb Levy’s talk on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splay_tree">splay trees</a> (in which he showed that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06309">inserting elements in either the preorder or postorder of another binary search tree takes linear time</a>) to ask the following question: we know either by time-reversing the tree rotation operations or from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_of_binary_search_trees">geometric model of dynamic search trees</a> that any given access sequence should have the same optimal cost as its reverse. So from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_binary_search_tree">dynamic optimality conjecture</a> it should also be true that (up to constant factors) splay trees have the same performance on the reverse of any access sequence as they do on the unreversed sequence. Can this be proven?</p>

<p>From the business meeting, we learned that attendance and paper submissions were down by around 15% from the previous WADS. The acceptance rate is roughly the same, just under 50%. I suspect the smaller size is because the location is not as appealing, but it turns out to be a perfectly pleasant place to have a conference: the weather in Edmonton is pleasant this time of year (except for the thunderstorm), and there are abundant restaurants, good coffee shops, and lodging within walking distance of the conference center. WADS alternates with SWAT, which next year will be in the Faroe Islands. And then WADS 2021 (and CCCG 2021) will be in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which is both more touristy than Edmonton and easier to reach from the east coast and Europe. So I suspect the numbers will improve again.</p>

<p>WADS is moving towards a more democratically elected steering committee formed from some combination of past PC chairs and at-large elections. They have already started implementing the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~irani/safetoc.html">SafeTOC recommendations</a> for combatting harassment and discrimination in theory conferences. And in a show of hands at the business meeting, the attendees were strongly in favor of moving towards double blind peer review for submissions. The conference is not really open access, though (its proceedings are published by Springer LNCS with special issues in Springer’s <em>Algorithmica</em> and Elsevier’s <em>Computational Geometry</em>) and there seems to be little pressure for that to change any time soon.</p>

<p>On to CCCG!</p>

<p>
James Randi is a magician who has challenged paranormal claims of all kinds.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I want to make a suggestion to those who claim they have proved P=NP.<br />
<span id="more-16143"></span></p>
<p>
No the claim to have a proof that P=NP is not a paranormal claim. But such claims are related to Randi—or the Amazing Randi as he is called. We talked about him before <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/02/23/an-amazing-result/">here</a>.</p>
<p>
Randi once helped run a contest to see who could find gold with their dowsing rod. He explained why he doubted one contestant: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If they really could find gold, why were they dressed so poorly, and why were they so interested in winning the prize? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I have the same question about those who claim that they have a proof that P=NP. Usually the proof is constructive and I agree with Randi:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If they really could solve P=NP, why <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
You get the idea.</p>
<p>
Ken adds the obvious remark that if a foreign power or intelligence agency discovered P=NP, or factoring in P, they would still keep the lean-and-hungry look. But they are not the kind we are addressing here.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Coding Helps </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s look at a claims that P=NP is resolved. Yes, such a result is unlikely—many would say impossible. But we do get claims like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The following <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal H}" class="latex" title="{\cal H}" /> is known to be a NP-complete problem; the following <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal E}" class="latex" title="{\cal E}" /> is known to be a polynomial time problem. I can reduce <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+H%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal H}" class="latex" title="{\cal H}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+E%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal E}" class="latex" title="{\cal E}" /> in polynomial time. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Usually the reduction is the reason their proof fails. Their claims about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+H%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal H}" class="latex" title="{\cal H}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+E%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal E}" class="latex" title="{\cal E}" /> are usually correct, since they are in the literature. </p>
<p>
The reduction is often complicated, often poorly defined, often defined by example. Giving a precise definition for the reduction is critical. This is the reason we suggest the following: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Write the reduction down in code.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even better, write it as a program in a real language such as Python. </p>
<p>
There are two advantages in doing this. </p>
<ul>
<li>
Writing it as a program in a real language will likely force one to define it precisely. <p></p>
</li><li>
Writing it down will also allow one to run the program on examples.
</li></ul>
<p>
The later point is the key point. Even trying your method on tiny examples is useful. Even better if you can say the following we might read the proof: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>I have tried my code on the following public set of difficult SAT problems. The code solved all in less than three minutes each.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This claim would greatly improve the likelihood that people might take your claims seriously. That your code worked correctly, forgetting the running time, would improve confidence. Greatly. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Animal Farm View<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken worries that some NP-complete problems are more equal than others. That is some problems, even though they are NP-complete may require reductions that blow up when encoding SAT. </p>
<p>
We wrote about this <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/the-travelling-salesmans-power/">before</a> regarding the “Power Index” idea of Richard Stearns and Harry Hunt III. In their <a href="http://www.cs.albany.edu/~res/powerindex.pdf">paper</a> they gave evidence that the reductions from SAT <em>to</em> many familiar NP-complete problems <em>must</em> expand the size of instances quadratically, insofar as those problems have <em>power index</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0.5}" class="latex" title="{0.5}" />. This was based on their “SAT Hypothesis” which anticipated current forms of the Exponential Time Hypothesis, which we have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/06/01/puzzling-evidence/">discussed</a>.</p>
<p>
Ken ponders a related issue. Even problems with power index <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> run into the success of practical solvers. This means: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Anyone citing algorithmic success as evidence toward a claim of P=NP must compete with the real-world success of algorithms that do not represent claims of P=NP. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/practically-pnp/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/10/22/rankings-versus-ratings/">times</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/07/10/the-world-turned-upside-down/">discussed</a> the practical success of SAT-solvers on myriad real-world instances. </p>
<p>
This situation has become real in the argument over achieving quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy">supremacy</a>. One who claims that quantum is superior to classic must worry that that classical algorithms can improve without making P=NP. A headline example from last year was when Ewin Tang—as a high-school senior—<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.04271">found</a> a classical way to remove a plausible quantum advantage in a matrix-completion problem that <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/teenager-finds-classical-alternative-to-quantum-recommendation-algorithm-20180731/">underlies</a> recommender systems.  There are many “industrial strength” examples in this argument—see this May 2019 <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613507/the-new-benchmark-quantum-computers-must-beat-to-achieve-quantum-supremacy/">story</a> for a start.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> But… </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken’s insightful comments aside, the key point is still: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Coding up your claimed algorithm for that NP-complete problem will still enhance belief.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This will happen even if the algorithm only succeeds on tiny examples. Indeed, if you cannot do this then I suggest that you will have an impossible time getting anyone to listen.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
How useful is this advice for the vast majority of us who are <em>not</em> claiming P=NP or the opposite?</p>

<div class="content">
We give new algorithms in the annotated data streaming setting---also known as verifiable data stream computation---for certain graph problems. This setting is meant to model outsourced computation, where a space-bounded verifier limited to sequential data access seeks to overcome its computational limitations by engaging a powerful prover, without needing to trust the prover. As is well established, several problems that admit no sublinear-space algorithms under traditional streaming do allow protocols using a sublinear amount of prover/verifier communication and sublinear-space verification.  We give algorithms for many well-studied graph problems including triangle counting, its generalization to subgraph counting, maximum matching, problems about the existence (or not) of short paths, finding the shortest path between two vertices, and testing for an independent set. While some of these problems have been studied before, our results achieve new tradeoffs between space and communication costs that were hitherto unknown. In particular, two of our results disprove explicit conjectures of Thaler (ICALP, 2016) by giving triangle counting and maximum matching algorithms for $n$-vertex graphs, using $o(n)$ space and $o(n^2)$ communication.</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>Perhaps conferences made sense fifty years ago. We did not have internet, and the pollution was not as bad. Today, we can have effective virtual meetings, while the pollution has reached a level of crisis, see this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_school_strike_for_climate_save_the_world_by_changing_the_rules/transcript?language=en">moving talk by Greta_Thunberg</a>. Moving to a system of virtual conferences is I believe a duty of every scientist. Doing so will cut the significant air travel emissions that come from shipping scientists across the world. To attend a climate summit in the USofA, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/07/29/gretha-thunberg-will-sail-across-the-atlantic-to-attend-un-climate-conferences/#27e93f87c3b2">Greta will sail across the Atlantic ocean on a zero emission boat</a><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/greta_thunberg_school_strike_for_climate_save_the_world_by_changing_the_rules/transcript?language=en">.</a></p>
<p>We can keep everything the way it is, but simply give the talks online. This change doesn’t involve anybody higher up in the political ladder. It only involves us, the program chairs, the steering committees.</p>
<p>While we wait for that, we can begin by virtualizing the physical STOC/FOCS PC meetings,<a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/stocfocs-pc-meetings-does-nature-of-decisions-justify-cost/"> whose added value over a virtual meeting, if any, does not justify the cost</a>; and by holding conferences where the center of mass is, instead of exotic places where one can combine the trip with a vacation at the expense of tax payers’ money and everybody’s health. And that is also why I put a bid to hold the 2021 Conference on Computational Complexity in Boston.</p>
<p>NSF panels, making decisions worth millions, routinely have virtual panelists (I was the last few times). So why do we insist on shipping scientists across the globe multiple times a year to give 15-minute talks which to most people are less useful than spending 20 minutes reading the paper on the arxiv?</p></div>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The cover of Avi Wigderson’s book “Mathematics and computation” as was first exposed to the public in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zxctNw-mA3hOT1tktE_dYjnmvOzZmC_A/view">Avi’s Knuth Prize videotaped lecture</a>. (I had trouble with 3 of the words: What is EGDE L WONK 0?  what is GCAAG?GTAACTC ?  TACGTTC ?  I only figured out the first.)</span></p>
<p>Avi Wigderson’s book  “<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/avi/book">Mathematics and computation, a theory revolutionizing technology and science</a>” is about to be published by Princeton University Press. The link is to a free copy of the book which will always be available on Avi’s homepage. (See also <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2017/10/27/must-read-book-by-avi-wigderson/">this re-blogged post here</a> of Boaz Barak.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One main theme of the book is the rich connection between the theory of computing and other areas (in fact, most areas) of mathematics. See also this self contained survey (based on Chapter 13 of the book) by Avi <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09780">Interactions of Computational Complexity Theory and Mathematics,</a> which in 27 pages overviews relations to number theory, Geometry, Operator Theory, Metric Geometry, Group Theory, Statistical Physics, Analysis and Probability, Lattice Theory and Invariant Theory. Of course, Avi himself is among the main heroes in finding many paths between mathematics and the theory of computing over the last four decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Another theme of the book and of several talks by Avi is that the theory of computing has revolutionary connections with many fields of science and technology. Again, this theme is present in the entire book and is emphasized in Chapter 20, which also appeared as a self contained paper  “<a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/~avi/PUBLICATIONS/Wigderson2018.pdf">On the nature of the Theory of Computation (ToC).</a>”  Let me quote one sentence from Avi’s book that I propose for discussion. (For the complete quote see the end of the post.)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The intrinsic study of computation transcends human-made artifacts, and its expanding connections and interactions with all sciences, integrating computational modeling, algorithms,  and complexity into theories of nature and society, marks a new scientific revolution!</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, <span style="color: #000000;">similar ideas were also expressed by several other prominent scientists, and let me mention Bernard Chazelle’s essay: <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/algorithm.html">The Algorithm: Idiom of Modern Science</a>. (Feel free to give further examples and links in the comment section.)</span></p>
<h3>Let’s discuss:  Integrating computational modeling, algorithms,  and complexity into theories of nature, marks a new scientific revolution!</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I propose to discuss in the comment section the idea that the theory of computing offers a scientific revolution. Very nice cases to examine are the computational study of randomness and connections to statistics, connections with economy and connections with biology. Comments on the relations between the theory of computation and other areas of mathematics are also very welcome.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/avi-c-3.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/avi-c-3.png?w=640&amp;h=329" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17795" height="329" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Avi’s concluding slide compared these three great theories of human understanding.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Avi promotes the idea of the central place of the theory of computing in his talks and writings</span><span id="more-17603"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/avi-c2.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/avi-c2.png?w=640&amp;h=229" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17639" height="229" /></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">And at the same time he is also humorously skeptical about it. (And mainly emphasizes that his far reaching claim requires careful discussion and ample evidence.)   </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The full quote of Avi:</h3>
<blockquote><p><em>The Theory of Computation is as revolutionary, fundamental and beautiful as major theories of mathematics, physics, biology, economics… that are regularly hailed as such. Its impact has been similarly staggering. The mysteries still baffling ToC are as challenging as those left open in other fields. And quite uniquely, the theory of computation is central to most other sciences. In creating the theoretical foundations of computing systems ToC has already played, and continues to play a major part in one of the greatest scientific and technological revolutions in human history. But the intrinsic study of computation transcends man-made artifacts. ToC has already established itself as an important mathematical discipline, with growing connections to nearly all mathematical areas. And its expanding connections and interactions with all sciences, naturally integrating computational modeling, algorithms and complexity into theories of nature and society, marks the beginning of another scientific revolution!</em></p></blockquote>

<p>We saw quite an activity last month, with a total of 9 papers on property testing or related areas.</p>



<p>Let’s start with a paper on PCPs:<br /><strong>Revisiting Alphabet Reduction in Dinur’s PCP</strong>, by Venkatesan Guruswami, Jakub Opršal, and Sai Sandeep  (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/092/">ECCC</a>). As mentioned in the title, this work provides an alternate proof of one of the two parts of the Dinur’s PCP theorem proof. In that proof, the argument goes by alternating two main steps: (i) amplifying the soundness gap, at the price of increasing the alphabet size (and the instance size); (ii) reducing the alphabet size, at the price of increasing the  instance size. From the observation that step (i) creates some structure in the instances that can be leveraged, the authors provide an alternative construction for (ii), leading to an arguably simpler analysis of the soundness of the underlying test. A nice throwback to some of the roots of property testing.</p>



<p>Then, four papers on distribution testing:<br /><strong>Testing Mixtures of Discrete Distributions</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Ravi Kumar, Ronitt Rubinfeld (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03190">arXiv</a>). One of the most studied problems in distribution testing is <em>identity testing</em> (a.k.a., goodness-of-fit): given a reference distribution \(q\) over a domain of size \(n\) and i.i.d. samples from an unknown \(p\), decide between \(p=q\) and \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &gt; \varepsilon\). While this is now well-understood and can be done with a strongly sublinear number of samples (namely, \(\sqrt{n})\)), the case of <em>tolerant</em> testing is much sadder: Valiant and Valiant proved that \(\Theta(n/\log n)\) samples were required for distinguishing \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &lt; \varepsilon/2\) from \(d_\textrm{TV}(p,q) &gt; \varepsilon\). So, noise-tolerance is almost as hard as it gets… <em>except</em>, as this works suggests and studies, if one has some guarantees on the noise! What if the noise in the completeness case was just that \(q\) is perturbed by some (known, or available via samples as well) noise coming from a second distribution \(\eta\)? I.e., the question is now to test whether \(p\) if of the form \(\alpha q + (1-\alpha) \eta\) for some \(\alpha\in [0,1]\), or if it is \(\varepsilon\)-far from all mixtures of \(q\) and \(\eta\). The authors have various results on this question and some extensions, but the upshot is: “with structured noise, strongly sublinear sample complexity is once again possible.”<br /><strong><br />Can Distributed Uniformity Testing Be Local?</strong>, by Uri Meir, Dor Mintzer, and Rotem Oshman (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3331613">ACM PODC Proceedings</a>). More on identity testing, specifically uniformity testing. No noise here, but another constraint: the samples are distributed. There are \(k\) players, each holding \(q\) i.i.d. samples from a distribution \(p\) over \([n]\); each can send \(\ell=1\) bit to a central referee, in a non-interactive fashion. Is \(p\) the uniform distribution, or is it \(\varepsilon\)-far from it? The authors here consider the case where \(k,n,\varepsilon\) are fixed, and prove lower bounds on the number \(q=q(k,n,\varepsilon)\) of samples each player must hold in order to perform this uniformity testing task. (Note: their lower bounds hold even in the public-randomness setting.) Motivated by the LOCAL model, they focus on 3 cases of interest, for which they obtain tight or near-tight bounds on \(q\) (in view of upper bounds from previous work of a subset of the authors): (1)  when the referee’s decision has to be the \(\textsf{AND}\) of all \(n\) bits she receives; (2) when the referee can do something more involved, and use a threshold function; and (3) when the referee can use an arbitrary function of those \(n\) messages. Underlying those lower bounds is a neat application of Boolean Fourier analysis, recasting the analysis of the standard “Paninski” lower bound instance and the player’s decision functions as a question on Boolean functions.<br /><br /><strong>Domain Compression and its Application to Randomness-Optimal  Distributed Goodness-of-Fit</strong>, by Jayadev Acharya, Clément Canonne, Yanjun Han, Ziteng Sun, and Himanshu Tyagi (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08743">arXiv</a>,<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/098/">ECCC</a>). Remember the paper just above? Now, focus on the case (3), where the referee can use any function of the message, allow each player to send \(\ell\) bits instead of one, but give only one sample (instead of \(q\)) to each player. This becomes a setting we have talked about before on this blog (specifically, with three papers on <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=990">these</a> <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1030">three</a> <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=1075">months</a>). Those three papers established the optimal number of player \(k\), in terms of  the domain size \(n\), the distance parameter \(\varepsilon\), and the number of bits per player \(\ell\), in both the private-coin and public-coin settings. This new work interpolates between those two extremes, and gives the tight answer to the general question: if there are \( 0\leq s \leq \log n\) bits of public randomness available, what is the optimal number of players to perform identity testing? Behind the upper bounds is a new notion of (randomness-efficient) <em>domain compression</em> they introduce: how to reduce the domain size of the probability distributions while preserving the \(\ell_1\) distances between them as much as possible?<br /><br /><strong>Towards Testing Monotonicity of Distributions Over General Posets</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour, Themis Gouleakis, John Peebles, Ronitt Rubinfeld, and Anak Yodpinyanee (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03182">arXiv</a>). Away from identity testing, let’s now consider another central question, testing <em>monotonicity</em> of distributions. Specifically, a distribution \(p\) over a given poset \((\mathcal{X}, \prec)\) is said to be monotone if \(p(x) \leq p(y)\) whenever \(x\prec y\). While the question is fully understood for the familiar case of the line \(\mathcal{X} = \{1,2,\dots,n\}\), the case of general posets is much murkier, and more or less uncharted. This paper initiates a general study of the question, improving on previously known bounds for the matching poset and Boolean hypercube, and providing several new results and techniques for the general case, to establish both upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity.</p>



<p>And now… graphs!<br /><strong>Expansion Testing using Quantum Fast-Forwarding and Seed Sets</strong>, by Simon Apers (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02369">arXiv</a>). This paper is concerned with (bicriteria) testing of vertex expansion of a given graph \(G=(V,E)\) in the bounded-degree graph model. Loosely speaking, given a value \(\Phi\) and query access <em>(i.e., sampling a node u.a.r., querying the degree of a node, and querying the \(i\)-th neighbor of a node) </em>to a graph \(G\) with maximum degree \(d=\Theta(1)\), the goal is to distinguish between (i) \(G\) has vertex expansion at most \(\Phi\) and (ii) \(G\) is \(\varepsilon\)-far from any \(G’\) with vertex expansion at most \(\Phi^2\) <em>(simplifying and dropping some technicalities)</em>. The previous state-of-the-art was a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/2}/\Phi^2)\) query complexity for classical algorithms, and a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(\min(n^{1/3}/\Phi^2),n^{1/2}/\Phi^2))\) query complexity upper bound for quantum testers. The current work improves on this by providing a \(\tilde{O}_{\varepsilon}(n^{1/3}/\Phi)\) quantum tester. Graphs expand—and so does the gap between classical and quantum testing.<br /><br /><strong>Walking Randomly, Massively, and Efficiently</strong>, by Jakub Łącki, Slobodan Mitrović, Krzysztof Onak, and Piotr Sankowski  (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05391">arXiv</a>). One very useful primitive, in many graph property testing results and of course well beyond property testing, is the ability to perform random walks on graphs. In the case of large, distributed (or merely impractically massive) graphs, however, it is not clear how to implement this primitive efficiently. This work addresses this question in the MPC (Massive Parallel Computation) model, and shows how to perform independently, from all of the \(n\) nodes of a graph (i.e., machine), an \(\ell\)-length random walk with only \(O(\log \ell)\) rounds of communication and \(O(n^\alpha)\) space per machine, for any constant \(\alpha \in(0,1)\). This round complexity matches a known (conditional) lower bound, and thus the result is as good as it gets — further, the authors obtain such MPC algorithms for both undirected and directed graph, somehow leveraging the latter case to handle the (significantly more complicated) directed case. As an application of this efficient random walk primitive, they provide MPC property testing algorithms for both bipartiteness and vertex expansion<em> (same definition as in the paper above: vertex expansion \(\Phi\) vs. \(\varepsilon\)-far from any \(G’\) with vertex expansion \(\Phi^2\))</em> in the general graph model. (Beyond property testing, another application—the main one in the paper— is computing PageRank in both graphs and directed graphs.)<br /><strong><br />A Lower Bound on Cycle-Finding in Sparse Digraphs</strong>, by Xi Chen, Tim Randolph, Rocco Servedio, and Timothy Sun (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12106">arXiv</a>). In this paper, the authors tackle the problem of one-sided testing of acyclicity of directed graphs, in the bounded-degree graph model (equivalently, on the task of finding a cycle in a digraph promised to be far from acyclic). Previously, an \(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\) lower bound for this task had been shown by Bender and Ron, based on a birthday-paradox-type argument; this work improves on this hardness result, showing that \(\tilde{\Omega}(n^{5/9})\) queries are necessary. Interestingly, whether achieving any \(o(n)\) query complexity is possible remains open.<br /><br /><strong>Constant-Time Dynamic \((\Delta+1)\)-Coloring and Weight Approximation for  Minimum Spanning Forest: Dynamic Algorithms Meet Property Testing</strong>, by Monika Henzinger and Pan Peng (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04745">arXiv</a>). Finally, the last paper covered this month is concerned with <em>dynamic graph algorithms</em>: where updates to a graph (which can be both edge additions <em>and</em> deletions) come sequentially, and the objective is to maintain, e.g., a coloring, or an approximation of some function of the graph, at any time using as little time per update. This paper advocates the use of techniques from property testing <em>(loosely speaking, as their locality and query-efficiency translates to fast update times)</em> to design better dynamic graph algorithms. It illustrates this idea by obtaining several new results, in particular an (amortized) \(O(1)\)-update-time randomized algorithm to maintain a \((\Delta+1)\)-coloring in a graph with degree bound \(\Delta\). The algorithm relies on a random ranking of the nodes which, combined with a suitable randomized update rule for recoloring a vertex when needed, ensure that the recolorings will not (with high probability) “propagate” to much. This is the first time that this idea, previously used in several testing and sublinear-time papers, is used in the context of dynamic graph algorithms—adding an edge between the two areas, hopefully only the first of many.<br /></p>

<p>
Alexander Hamilton was a framer of the U.S. Constitution. He wrote the bulk of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers">Federalist Papers</a> (FP) defending the Constitution. Today he is best known for the playbill—the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)">musical</a> on his life—and the bill, the US ten dollar bill.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we would discuss the U.S. electoral college (EC).<br />
<span id="more-16133"></span></p>
<p>
We are in the midst of the run-up to next year’s President election. An on-going discussion is the issue of the EC. Should it be modified? Should it be replaced? Is it a good idea? </p>
<p>
So let’s recall how the EC works. Then we will look at it from a theory viewpoint. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The College </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The electoral college is how every four years we elect the President of the United States. It is not a direct popular vote. The Constitution created it as a compromise between a direct popular vote and a vote by the members of Congress. Back then, the framers of the Constitution, including Hamilton, did not trust the electorate. Hence, the rationale for the EC.</p>
<p>
Today the EC consists of 538 electors. Voters in each state pick electors, who then vote in EC for the President. Thus by high math, 270 electors are required to win. A state gets one electoral vote for each member in the House of Representatives plus two. The latter rule ensures that no state gets too few votes. It is some times called the “two-plus rule”.</p>
<p>
The arguments for the EC are distilled in FP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68">No. 68</a>. Although the collaboration/authorship status of numerous FP remains unclear, Hamilton’s claim in his last testament to sole authorship of FP 68 is not seriously disputed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._68">Quoting</a> Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Entitled “The Mode of Electing the President”, No. 68 describes a perspective on the process of selecting the Chief Executive of the United States. In writing this essay, the author sought to convince the people of New York of the merits of the proposed Constitution. Number 68 is the second in a series of 11 essays discussing the powers and limitations of the Executive branch and the only one to describe the method of selecting the president. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Opponents today argue against the EC. They point out that it allows one to win without getting the most votes. This has happened in two of the last five elections, in 2000 and 2016. The EC rewards uneven allocations of campaigning to the few “swing-states”. It also gives voters in less populated states more voting power. A vote from Wyoming has over three times the influence on the EC tally as a vote from California. The battle over FP 68 has even been <a href="https://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/hamilton-68">internationalized</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My College </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Years ago. Decades ago. Eons ago. When I was in college, I almost flunked a required one-credit course in my senior year. The course was on issues of the election that year of the President. No it did not involve Hamilton. </p>
<p>
The grade of the course was based on a term paper. Mine, which got a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal D}" class="latex" title="{\cal D}" />, was based on an argument for the EC. Thankfully, the grade was just enough to get me a pass in the course, and allow me to graduate. I did not take the course seriously—my attendance was spotty, at best.</p>
<p>
My idea was that there was an argument for the EC based on a connection with the ability to manage elections. My central thesis was: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>The ability to accurately predict the outcome of a Presidential election is inherently undesirable</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Let’s agree that we will call this the <i>Prediction Assumption</i> (PA). Predicting the outcome of elections may not be a good idea. If predictions could be accurate, then one could argue that this would allow candidates to manipulate the election. I think you could make the case that this could be a problem. Candidates would be able to manage their opinions to optimize their chances of winning the election. </p>
<p>
In any event I then proved a result that showed that given PA, one could argue that the EC was better than a popular election. Note, the usual math arguments against the EC are based on the power of individual voters. See <a href="https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Publications/SIURO/Vol12/S01616.pdf?ver=2019-02-12-215230-620">here</a> and <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-funky-math-of-the-electoral-college/">here</a> for some of their insights.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> My College Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The central point of my paper was informally this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Theorem:</b> <em> Prediction of an election using EC is more difficult than one using the popular vote. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
A simple example should help. Imagine an election with three states: Northeast, West, and South. Let them each have one electoral vote. Clearly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> are needed to win. Suppose the states are arranged like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Northeast: Almost all for A; <p></p>
</li><li>
West: Almost all for B; <p></p>
</li><li>
South: Close between A and B.
</li></ul>
<p>
Then prediction requires the polling to be able to tell the outcome of the South vote. The point is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The smaller the number of voters in the ensemble being predicted, the more uncertain the prediction. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Ken argues that simply having a multiplicity of component elections—one in each state plus DC—also increases the uncertainty. This may happen technically just because the result is a kind of average over unequal-sized averages. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Their Papers </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Modern results in Boolean function theory actually have studied the noise sensitivity of the EC. They have studied how errors in voting can flip an election. Look at Gil Kalai’s 2010 <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~kalai/CHAOS.pdf">paper</a>, “Noise Sensitivity And Chaos In Social Choice Theory.” He shows that majority is more stable in the presence of noise than the EC. Look at Ryan O’Donnell’s <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~odonnell/papers/analysis-survey.pdf">paper</a>, “Some Topics in Analysis of Boolean Functions.” He shows a related point that errors in EC—in a simple model—can increase the chance that errors flip the election factor of about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5.7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5.7}" class="latex" title="{5.7}" />.</p>
<p>
Neither paper strikes me as studying whether predictions are easier with the simple majority rule than with the EC.<br />
I believe that their new results can be used to prove the same type of theorems on prediction. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Did I deserve a better grade than a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal D}" class="latex" title="{\cal D}" />? Or should I have flunked? Should I have published something?</p>
<p>
For comparison, the college term paper which eventually became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">27th Amendment</a> to the Constitution received a better grade: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ccal+C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\cal C}" class="latex" title="{\cal C}" />. Oh well.</p>

An interesting comparison of different museum policies on re-use of images of their artworks, and availability of high-resolution images, when the art itself is old enough to be out of copyright but photos of the art might still be copyrighted depending on different national laws.

<p><strong>Update</strong>: and here is a <a href="http://www.careeryoga.life/440ebcdf?fbclid=IwAR2BWeyMdhTg2fbdHp5U-D9gCy2oqLZBk2ljRBMhjtyAEtSgqBCt7kMlSFk">great interview</a> of Noga in English and the interviewer is Narkis Alon, Noga’s youngest daughter and Amalya Duek.</p>
<p>I was very happy to interview my academic doctoral  twin and long-time friend Noga Alon.  <a href="https://youtu.be/9PhckP9eJhg">The interview</a> is an initiative of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. (This is my second interview of this kind. See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/06/15/an-interview-with-yisrael-robert-aumann/">here</a> for an interview with Yisrael Aumann.) The interview is in Hebrew. (Update: Automatically-produced  English subtitles are available.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For our English speaking readers here is a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/rwiEiGqgetU">Numberphile video</a> with Noga.</p>
<p>We agreed in advance that most of the interview would be about mathematics, and  most of the time  we courageously (and perhaps somewhat recklessly)  tried to explain to a large audience  (starting from scratch) some of Noga’s research directions and results. We hope that people will enjoy the beauty of it even with the missing details and background.</p>
<h3>Noga’s parents, family and childhood</h3>
<p>In the first part of the  interview  Noga talked about his family, his parents, Dror and Hemda, his great uncle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Allon">Yigal Alon</a>, his early childhood, and his early interest in mathematics. Noga liked to solve mathematical riddles from a young age. One reason Noga was drawn to mathematics is that unlike other topics, in mathematics there are absolute truths, and a mathematical proof (when such exists)  is perhaps the only way you can settle a debate. Noga gave an amusing example from his youth regarding the Eurovision song context. Then he mentioned the <a href="https://www.reali.org.il/en/%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%94-%d7%a9%d7%a0%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%a8%d7%99%d7%90%d7%9c%d7%99/">Hebrew Reali school in Haifa</a>, a mathematics teacher there, Yaakov Kaplan,  newly immigrated from the former Soviet Union, who greatly influenced Noga. Noga also talked about his participation in the Israeli Mathematical Olympiad where the two of us first met 45 years ago.  Next, the two of us met during our military service, and in parallel to his service, Noga finished his M. Sc. and Ph. D with Micha A. Perles, who was also my supervisor.</p>
<h3>An hour of mathematics</h3>
<p>The mathematical part of the video starts with Noga’s  overview of combinatorics. Then we moved to specific topics.</p>
<p>(22:40- 33:30) Noga’s negative solution to Shannon’s conjecture about the capacity of two graphs (and a little about Claude Shannon and information theory)</p>
<p>(33:30- 40:25) The combinatorial nullstellensatz and the polynomial method and a little about the game SET</p>
<p>(40:25 – 46:50) The probabilistic method and a little on the history of probability and about Paul Erdos.</p>
<p>(46:50-  54:50)  Streaming algorithms, a topic introduced by Noga Alon, Yossi Matias, and Mario Szegedy, and more generally, about positive and negative results in computer science, and their practical applications.</p>
<p>(54:50 – 59:25)    Expander graphs and “spectroscopy of graphs”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/noga1.png?w=640&amp;h=326" alt="" width="640" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17717" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>59:25  -1:05:40 Ramsey theory</p>
<p>1:05:40-1:12:20 Factoring integers with quantum computers and with classical methods</p>
<p>1:12:00-1:20:00 Combinatorics, economics and game theory:  Noga’s theorem that large committees require a large budget!</p>
<h3>Going back from mathematics to life itself</h3>
<p>After a full hour of mathematics, we returned to life itself. Memories from our years as postdocs at MIT, and our 1993 conference in Jerusalem. Noga talked a little about women in science and in society, about his three daughters, about  the possibility that science, like sport,  can bridge different groups and different peoples, and about politics and prospects for better relations with our Arab neighbors and Iran (Noga is somewhat optimistic and so am I),  prospects about getting old (we are hopeful about it), and advice to young researchers. Noga’s message at the end was that there are many paths to mathematical research and he encouraged young people that like mathematics to follow and enjoy them.</p>

Inspired by Nisan's characterization of noncommutative complexity (Nisan 1991), we study different notions of nonnegative rank, associated complexity measures and their link with monotone computations. In particular we answer negatively an open question of Nisan asking whether nonnegative rank characterizes monotone noncommutative complexity for algebraic branching programs. We also prove a rather tight lower bound for the computation of elementary symmetric polynomials by algebraic branching programs in the monotone setting or, equivalently, in the homogeneous syntactically multilinear setting.</div>
