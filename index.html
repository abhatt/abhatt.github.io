<p><em>[Cross posted on <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/2021/12/20/mini-course/">Chi-Ning’s blog</a>,  the course is open also to non-Harvard people. <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/">Chi-Ning</a> is my amazing grad student, who has worked on several aspects related to the course, including quantum computation and neurally-plausible computation. He assembled <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/mini-course/">a great collection of guest speakers</a> and so this course looks like it will be very exciting. . –Boaz]</em></p>



<p>In the following January, Harvard GSAS kindly supports me to offer a <a href="https://cnchou.github.io/mini-course" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mini-course on <em>“What is Computation? From Turing Machines to Blackholes and Neurons”</em></a>. In this blog post, I’m going to share the motivation for teaching this mini-course and give an overview on what you will learn if you are interested in participating!</p>



<p>Computation is not an exotic word for people living in the 21st century. In high school, kids have to learn and do all sorts of computations in arithmetics (and some even start to write computer programs!). For scientists, computational methods become more and more common and sometimes even completely change the paradigm of a field. There are computers of different forms hiding in our daily life ranging from your smartphones to the toy of your pets. Also, from time to time we see excitement on the news about the development of quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Computation has become central in human civilization, however, do we really understand what computation is?</p>



<p>Let me first convince you why asking and attempting to answer this question is important.</p>



<p>Traditionally, at least on Wikipedia, computation is defined as <em>“any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps and which follows a well-defined model (e.g. an algorithm)”</em>. Indeed, for computer scientists and mathematicians, computation is about solving <em>computational problems</em> via an abstract mathematical model known as <em>Turing machine</em>. In particular, the <em>Church-Turing Thesis</em>, which can be viewed as Newton’s laws in computer science, asserts that all effective computational methods in the world can be captured by Turing machines. That is to say, in the mathematical world, computation is something axiomatized and can be studied and understood parallel to the empirical world.</p>



<p>On the other hand, for the majority of people, computation is something more concrete and has a physical realization such as a digital computer. The rise of computer science in the past few decades is certainly owing to the great technological success of building up modern computers. The fascinating advances of technology seem to close the gap between theory and reality (similar to Newton’s laws!). Nevertheless, in the frontier of scientific research, the recent surging developments of quantum computing and artificial neural networks started to challenge our understanding in computation – the ways they compute are so different from the traditional Turing machines and we don’t really know why and how they work so well!</p>



<p>In my opinion, we need to revisit the notion of computation in order to attack these mysteries. Specifically, the approach should be interdisciplinary.</p>



<p>As computer scientists are used to think of computations as composing different <em>resources</em> and <em>subroutines</em>, the computations in physics and biology tend to be rather <em>holistic</em> and <em>open-ended</em>. When talking about computations, people from different fields often think a bit differently. Such distinctions across fields should not be barriers or problems, instead, it could potentially serve as seeds to enrich our understanding in the essence of computation.</p>



<p>This mini-course is an invitation to rethink about what computation is through different angles. We will focus on but not limit to three perspectives including mathematics, physics, and biology. Through theories, examples, and experiments, we are going to see the similarities and differences between these disciplines. Six guest speakers coming from a diverse background (from computer science and physics to neuroscience and modern art) will join us and provide lots of examples and stories from their home field. The aim of this mini-course is to remind people of the diverse nature of computation and envision the possibilities of future interdisciplinary research.</p>



<p>There will be three modules and each contains three 50-minute interactive lectures and 1-3 guest talk(s). The first module focuses on the mathematical foundation of computations in which the students will learn the concept of Turing machines, computability, reductions, and most importantly, the underlying philosophy. The second module is about the computations in the physical world where we will launch from classical mechanics, to statistical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and gravity. The third module looks into the computations in biology, ranging from genomes, evolution, to neuroscience. The mini-course will end with a panel discussion with all the guest speakers and students.</p>

first importance. To this end, it is classical in Digital Geometry to assume
the shape borders to be par-regular. Par-regularity was proved to be equivalent
to having positive reach or to belong to the class C 1,1 of curves with
Lipschitz derivative. Recently, we proposed to use a larger class that
encompasses polygons with obtuse angles, the locally turn-bounded curves. The
aim of this technical report is to define the class of par-regular curves
inside the class of locally turn-bounded curves using only the notion of turn,
that is of integral curvature. To be more precise, in a previous article, we
have already proved that par-regular curves are locally turn-bounded.
Incidentally this proof lead us to show that the turn of par-regular curves is
a Lipschitz function of their length. We call the class of curves verifying
this latter property the curves with Lipschitz turn. In this technical report,
we prove the converse assertion : locally turn-bounded curves with Lipschitz
turn are par-regular. The equivalence is stated in Theorem 3.1 and the converse
assertion is proved in Lemma 3.2. In section 1, we recall the definition of
par-regularity and equivalently of sets with positive reach. In section 2, we
present the notions of curves locally turn-bounded and of curves with Lipschitz
turn. Throughout this latter section, some of intermediate steps (Lemmas 2.3
and 2.11) are proved just after the introduction of their related notions. The
last section (section 3) is dedicated to the proof of the equivalence of the
notions.

complexity landscape for a family of fundamental graph problems on trees. We
present a general method that solves most locally checkable labeling (LCL)
problems exponentially faster in the low-space MPC model than in the LOCAL
message passing model. In particular, we show that all solvable LCL problems on
trees can be solved in $O(\log n)$ time (high-complexity regime) and that all
LCL problems on trees with deterministic complexity $n^{o(1)}$ in the LOCAL
model can be solved in $O(\log \log n)$ time (mid-complexity regime). We
emphasize that we solve LCL problems on constant-degree trees, our algorithms
are deterministic and they work in the low-space MPC model, where local memory
is $O(n^\delta)$ for $\delta \in (0,1)$ and global memory is $O(m)$.
</p>
<p>For the high-complexity regime, there are two key ingredients. One is a novel
$O(\log n)$-time tree rooting algorithm, which may be of independent interest.
The other ingredient is a novel pointer-chain technique and analysis that
allows us to solve any solvable LCL problem on trees in $O(\log n)$ time. For
the mid-complexity regime, we adapt the approach by Chang and Pettie [FOCS'17],
who gave a canonical LOCAL algorithm for solving LCL problems on trees. For the
special case of 3-coloring trees, which is a natural LCL problem with LOCAL
time complexity $n^{o(1)}$, we show that our analysis is (conditionally) tight,
as it matches the conditional $\Omega(\log \log n)$-time lower bound for
component-stable algorithms.

deterministic context-free (dcf) languages. Earlier, Wotschke [J. Comput.
System Sci. 16 (1978) 456--461] demonstrated that intersections of $(d+1)$ dcf
languages are in general more powerful than intersections of $d$ dcf languages
for any positive integer $d$ based on the intersection hierarchy separation of
Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185--192]. The argument of Liu
and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and
therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to disprove any given
language to be written in the form of $d$ intersection of dcf languages. To
deal with the non-membership of a wide range of languages, we circumvent the
specialization of their proof argument and devise a new and practical technical
tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family
of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection
with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish a non-membership
relation of languages formed by finite intersections of non-bounded languages
as well. We also refer to a relationship to deterministic limited automata of
Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196--238] in this regard.

complicated system with several interactive modular parts. Quantum computing,
as the most generic usage of quantum information, follows a hybrid architecture
so far, namely, quantum algorithms are stored and controlled classically, and
mainly the executions of them are quantum, leading to the so-called quantum
processing units. Such a quantum-classical hybrid is constrained by its
classical ingredients, and cannot reveal the computational power of a fully
quantum computer system as conceived from the beginning of the field. Recently,
the nature of quantum information has been further recognized, such as the
no-programming and no-control theorems, and the unifying understandings of
quantum algorithms and computing models. As a result, in this work we propose a
model of universal quantum computer system, the quantum version of the von
Neumann architecture. It uses ebits (i.e., Bell states) as elements of the
quantum memory unit, and qubits as elements of the quantum control unit and
processing unit. As a digital quantum system, its global configurations can be
viewed as tensor-network states. Its universality is proved by the capability
to execute quantum algorithms based on a program composition scheme via a
universal quantum gate teleportation. It is also protected by the uncertainty
principle, the fundamental law of quantum information, making it quantum-secure
distinct from the classical case. In particular, we introduce a few variants of
quantum circuits, including the tailed, nested, and topological ones, to
characterize the roles of quantum memory and control, which could also be of
independent interest in other contexts. In all, our primary study demonstrates
the manifold power of quantum information and paves the way for the creation of
quantum computer systems in the near future.

subgraph-restricted matchings in graphs, Discrete Mathematics, 293 (2005) 129 -

of a matching whose vertex set induces a disconnected graph. In this paper we
answer this question. In fact, we consider the generalized problem of finding
$c$-disconnected matchings; such matchings are ones whose vertex sets induce
subgraphs with at least $c$ connected components. We show that, for every fixed
$c \geq 2$, this problem is NP-complete even if we restrict the input to
bounded diameter bipartite graphs, while can be solved in polynomial time if $c
= 1$. For the case when $c$ is part of the input, we show that the problem is
NP-complete for chordal graphs, while being solvable in polynomial time for
interval graphs. Finally, we explore the parameterized complexity of the
problem. We present an FPT algorithm under the treewidth parameterization, and
an XP algorithm for graphs with a polynomial number of minimal separators when
parameterized by $c$. We complement these results by showing that, unless NP
$\subseteq$ coNP/poly, the related Induced Matching problem does not admit a
polynomial kernel when parameterized by vertex cover and size of the matching
nor when parameterized by vertex deletion distance to clique and size of the
matching. As for Connected Matching, we show how to obtain a maximum connected
matching in linear time given an arbitrary maximum matching in the input.

<p>Ordinary radix systems for representing numbers, like binary or decimal, use fixed finite sets of digits. The same is true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijective_numeration">bijective numeration</a>, used for columns of spreadsheets. In bijective numbering, every string of digits represents a unique number, shorter strings represent smaller numbers, and strings of equal length have the usual order. In spreadsheets, the digits are letters A–Z, one-letter strings represent numbers \(1\) through \(26\), two-letter strings represent \(27\) through \(26+26^2=702\), etc. Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_radix">mixed radix</a> systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system">factorial number system</a> have position-varying digit sets.  In factorial numbering, the \(i\)th digit can range from \(0\) to \(i-1\), with place value \((i-1)!\). The value of a digit string is the sum of digits times place values. One could combine these ideas and get a bijective factorial number system, in which strings of at most \(i\) digits can represent numbers up to the <a href="https://oeis.org/A007489">sum of the first \(i\) factorials</a>. But in all of these mixed radix systems, the digits are not drawn from a finite set. Maybe we need another numbering system just to describe each digit of a mixed-radix number? This leads to the idea of a <em>recursive</em> numbering system, where the digits of a mixed-radix system are themselves numbers in the same system.</p>

<p>An example might clarify this idea. Let’s start with a recursive numbering system based on binary. Like other mixed-radix systems, we’ll number the digit positions starting with \(i=0\) at the right. Each position has a place value, the product of the numbers of choices for earlier digits, and the value of a sequence of digits is the sum of digits times place value. We’ll start with two choices of digit in position \(0\), like binary, and in later positions we’ll use the values we’ve already constructed as allowable digits.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), the two available digits given in the base case are \(0\) and \(1\), allowing us to represent only the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) as one-digit strings.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are still only two digits available, the two numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that have shorter representations. In this position, they have place value \(2\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(3\) to be represented as a two-digit string.</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), we now have four digits available, the numbers from \(0\) to \(3\). These have place value \(4\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(15\) to be represented with three digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>At each successive level of this structure, the number of available digits and place values will be equal. Each new digit squares the range of representable numbers. In any position \(i&gt;0\), we will have \(2^{2^{i-1}}\) digits available, with place value \(2^{2^{i-1}}\), allowing any number from \(0\) to \(2^{2^{i}}-1\) to be represented. In some sense, though, we haven’t done anything very interesting yet. Like binary, we just get powers of two. The recursive-binary representation of a number can be obtained in a trivial way from its binary representation, by partitioning the bits into groups of 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, … bits.</p>

<p>Instead, a bijective numbering system leads to more interesting results when handled recursively. For recursive bijective numbering, we can start with a much simpler base case, the empty string, which can be interpreted in any bijective numbering system as representing the number \(0\). With this base case, we can define a bijective numbering system in which the available digits in position \(i\) (starting from \(i=0\) in the rightmost digit) are the numbers that can be represented by strings of length at most \(i\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>In position \(i=0\), there is only one available digit, the number \(0\) (already represented by the empty string), producing only one single-digit value, representing the number \(1\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=1\), there are two available digits, the numbers \(0\) and \(1\) that we have already represented, so there are two two-digit sequences possible, representing two more numbers \(2\) and \(3\).</li>
  <li>In position \(i=2\), there are four available digits, providing eight three-digit sequences that can represent the numbers \(4\) through \(11\).</li>
</ul>

<p>If we let \(n_i\) denote the number of values that can be obtained by strings of exactly \(i\) digits, then we obtain a recurrence \(n_0=1\) (the zero-length strings represent only one value, zero) and \(n_i=n_{i-1}\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) (there are \(n_{i-1}\) choices for the string up to its last digit, and \(\sum_{j&lt;i}n_j\) choices for the last digit). This recurrence has the sequence of values <a href="http://oeis.org/A001697">1, 1, 2, 8, 96, 10368, 108615168, …</a> and its partial sums <a href="http://oeis.org/A001696">1, 2, 4, 12, 108, 10476, 108625644, …</a> give the total number of values that can be represented by strings of up to \(i\) digits.</p>

<p>The same idea can be represented graphically. Given a number represented by this recursive bijective numbering system, draw an ordered tree, where an \(i\)-digit number is represented by a tree whose root has \(i\) children, one for each digit, and where each digit is represented in the same way by a subtree. Conversely, if we have an ordered tree, we can think of it as representing a recursive bijective number, whose digits are computed recursively from the children of the root. In our recursive bijective numbers, we required that each digit be representable as a string of length at most its position; translating this requirement into tree terminology, each node that is the \(i\)th child of its parent (again starting with \(i=0\) on the right) must have degree at most \(i\).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img width="60%" alt="Equivalence between recursive bijective numbering and tree enumeration" src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/recursive-bijective.svg" /></p>

<p>It follows that the sequences of numbers of representable values for \(i\)-digit strings and for \(\le i\)-digit strings, above, also give the numbers of ordered trees that obey this degree constraint, with root degree \(i\) or \(\le i\), respectively.</p>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>I’m about to leave for a family vacation—our first such since before the pandemic, one planned and paid for literally the day before the news of Omicron broke.  On the negative side, staring at the case-count graphs that are just now going vertical, I estimate a ~25% chance that at least one of us will get Omicron on this trip.  On the positive side, I estimate a ~60% chance that in the next 6 months, at least one of us would’ve gotten Omicron or some other variant even <em>without</em> this trip—so maybe it’s just as well if we get it now, when we’re vaxxed to the maxx and ready and school and university are out.</p>



<p>If, however, I <em>do</em> end this trip dead in an ICU, I wouldn’t want to do so without having clearly set out my values for posterity.  So with that in mind: in the comments of my <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6146">previous post</a>, someone asked me why I identify as a liberal or a progressive, if I passionately support educational practices like tracking, ability grouping, acceleration, and (especially) <em>encouraging kids to learn advanced math whenever they’re ready for it</em>.  (Indeed, that might be my single stablest political view, having been held, for recognizably similar reasons, since I was about 5.)</p>



<p>Incidentally, that previous post was guest-written by my colleagues Edith Cohen and Boaz Barak, and linked to an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> that now has almost 1500 signatories.  Our goal was, and is, to fight the imminent dumbing-down of precollege math education in the United States, spearheaded by the so-called “California Mathematics Framework.”  In our joint efforts, we’ve been careful with every word—making sure to maintain the assent of our entire list of signatories, to attract broad support, to stay narrowly focused on the issue at hand, and to bend over backwards to concede much as we could.  Perhaps because of those cautions, we—amazingly—got some actual traction, reaching people in government (such as Rep. Ro Khanna, D – Silicon Valley) and technology leaders, and forcing the “no one’s allowed to take Algebra in 8th grade” faction to respond to us.</p>



<p>This was disorienting to me.  On this blog, I’m used just to howling into the wind, having some agree, some disagree, some take to Twitter to denounce me, but in any case, having no effect of any kind on the real world.  </p>



<p>So let me return to howling into the wind.  And return to the question of what I “am” in ideology-space, which doesn’t have an obvious answer.</p>



<p>It’s like, what do you call someone who’s absolutely terrified about global warming, and who thinks the best response would’ve been (and actually, still is) a historic surge in nuclear energy, possibly with geoengineering to tide us over?</p>



<p>… who wants to end world hunger … and do it using GMO crops?</p>



<p>… who wants to smash systems of entrenched privilege in college admissions … and believes that the SAT and other standardized tests are the best tools ever invented for that purpose?</p>



<p>… who feels a personal distaste for free markets, for the triviality of what they so often elevate and the depth of what they let languish, but tolerates them because they’ve done more than anything else to lift up the world’s poor?</p>



<p>… who’s happiest when telling the truth for the cause of social justice … but who, if told to <em>lie</em> for the cause of social justice, will probably choose silence or even, if pushed hard enough, truth?</p>



<p>… who wants to legalize marijuana and psychedelics, and <em>also</em> legalize all the promising treatments currently languishing in FDA approval hell?</p>



<p>… who feels little attraction to the truth-claims of the world’s ancient religions, <em>except</em> insofar as they sometimes serve as prophylactics against newer and now even more virulent religions?</p>



<p>… who thinks the covid response of the CDC, FDA, and other authorities was a historic disgrace—not because it infringed on the personal liberties of antivaxxers or anything like that, but on the contrary, because it was weak, timid, bureaucratic, and slow, where it should’ve been like that of a general at war?</p>



<p>… who thinks the Nazi Holocaust was <em>even worse</em> than the mainstream holds it to be, because in addition to the staggering, one-lifetime-isn’t-enough-to-internalize-it human tragedy, the Holocaust <em>also</em> sent up into smoke whatever cultural process had just produced Einstein, von Neumann, Bohr, Szilard, Born, Meitner, Wigner, Haber, Pauli, Ulam, Tarski, Erdös, and Noether, and with it, one of the wellsprings of our technological civilization?</p>



<p>… who supports free speech, to the point of proudly tolerating views that <em>really, actually</em> disgust them at their workplace, university, or online forum?</p>



<p>… who believes in patriotism, the police, the rule of law, to the extent that they don’t understand why all the enablers of the January 6 insurrection, up to and including Trump, aren’t currently facing trial for treason against the United States?</p>



<p>… who’s (of course) disgusted to the core by Trump and everything he represents, but who’s <em>also</em> disgusted by the elite virtue-signalling hypocrisy that made the rise of a Trump-like backlash figure predictable?</p>



<p>… who not only supports abortion rights, but also looks forward to a near future when parents, if they choose, are free to use embryo selection to make their children happier, smarter, healthier, and free of life-crippling diseases (unless the “bioethicists” destroy that future, as a previous generation of Deep Thinkers destroyed our nuclear future)?</p>



<p>… who, when reading about the 1960s Sexual Revolution, instinctively sides with free-loving hippies and against the scolds … even if today’s scolds are themselves former hippies, or intellectual descendants thereof, who now clothe their denunciations of other people’s gross, creepy sexual desires in the garb of feminism and social justice?</p>



<p>What, finally, do you call someone whose image of an ideal world might include a young woman wearing a hijab, an old Orthodox man with black hat and sidecurls, a broad-shouldered white guy from the backwoods of Alabama, and a trans woman with purple hair, face tattoos and a nose ring … all of them standing in front of a blackboard and arguing about what would happen if Alice and Bob jumped into opposite ends of a wormhole?</p>



<p>Do you call such a person “liberal,” “progressive,” “center-left,” “centrist,” “Pinkerite,” “technocratic,” “neoliberal,” “libertarian-ish,” “classical liberal”?  Why not simply call them “correct”? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /></p></div>

Jonathan Borwein passed away a few years ago. He had been one of the top experts on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%3D3.141592653%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi=3.141592653\dots}" class="latex" /> and especially its computation. He also was a close associate of David Bailey, and they had been prominent advocates of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_mathematics">experimental</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uexm20">mathematics</a>. </p>
<p>
Today we talk about the hardness of predicting mathematical and computational advances.</p>
<p>
Borwein wrote a wonderful <a href="https://www.carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/future.pdf">article</a> on the future of mathematics. It was titled “The Future of Mathematics: 1965 to 2065” and was written for the 2015 centenary of the <a href="https://www.maa.org/">MAA</a>, midway in his range of time. </p>
<p>
Thus, his article looked forward by first looking backward at what would have been looking forward back then. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Prediction is Hard </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Borwein talks about predicting the future and how hard it is. He does this by listing a few predictions that were not correct: </p>
<ul>
<li>
“Radio has no future. Heavier than air flying machines are impossible. X-rays will prove to be a hoax.” — William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), English physicist and inventor, 1899. <p></p>
</li><li>
“This telephone has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.” — Western Union internal memo, 1876. <p></p>
</li><li>
“Folks, the Mac platform is through— totally.” — John Dvorak, <em>PC Magazine</em>, 1998. <p></p>
</li><li>
“The problem with television is that people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn’t time for it.”— New York Times, 1949. <p></p>
</li><li>
“Where … the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weights 30 tons, computers in the future may have only 1,000 vacuum tubes and weigh only 1.5 tons.” — <i>Popular Mechanics</i>, 1949.
</li></ul>
<p>
Ken’s favorites are ones that have long been technologically feasible but never became economical. An example is that in 1959, Arthur Summerfield—then US Postmaster General—<a href="https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/missile-mail.pdf">predicted</a> that in a a few years, bulk canisters of air mail would be sent across oceans in hours by intercontinental missile. This was said without any inkling of e-mail. And whereas e-mail is “non-physical,” our physical packages arrive no faster than 60 years ago—indeed slower with this year’s supply-chain issues at Pacific ports. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/missilemail2/" rel="attachment wp-att-19432"><img width="277" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MissileMail2.jpg?resize=277%2C240&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19432" height="240" /></a></p>
<p></p><h2> Why Are Predictions Hard? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
One reason the future is hard to predict is that we tend to make predictions that are too conservative. For example: replace the last prediction by:</p>
<p>
“Where … the ENIAC is equipped with 18,000 vacuum tubes and weights 30 tons, computers in the future may weigh <b>one</b> pound.”</p>
<p>
The trouble is people would have laughed at this as ridiculous. How could 30 tons be reduced to a single pound? Indeed.</p>
<p>
Of course today people are talking about computers that weight almost nothing and can flow through your bloodstream. See <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/these-tiny-robots-could-be-disease-fighting-machines-inside-body-ncna861451">nanobots</a>. </p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/nano/" rel="attachment wp-att-19420"><img width="160" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nano.png?resize=160%2C80&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19420" height="80" /></a></p>
<p>
A year ago, we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/10/the-future-of-mathematics/">covered</a> a paper and <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/slides/fomm_buzzard.pdf">slides</a> by Kevin Buzzard titled, “The future of mathematics?” His third slide embeds a hint on what makes prediction hard:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/19/favorite-theorems-of-the-next-ten-years/s/" rel="attachment wp-att-19421"><img width="320" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/s.png?resize=320%2C205&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19421" height="205" /></a></p>
<p>
The key is what he says about AI advances coming in a <em>phase change</em>. A phase change is different from a bolt-from-the-blue. Before the change, the situation seems to be one that is well understood to be progressing slowly. Then a year passes, and boom. Again what happens is that predictions that seemed to be well-founded are exposed as too conservative. </p>
<p>
Understanding how this supplements the bolt-from-the-blue kind of event leads to the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The future is whippy. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
And that is why predictions are hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Predictions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Nevertheless, we wish to make a few predictions ourselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The P versus NP problem will be solved by the following date: 2032 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" /> years. We make no prediction which way it is resolved. (This is squarely within the 2030-to-2040 range that Ken gave in 2002 in Bill Gasarch’s first P=NP <a href="https://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs4104/heath/Spring2006/Resources/PversusNPpoll.pdf">poll</a>.) <p></p>
</li><li>
We do not believe that factoring and graph isomorphism will be resolved in the same period: 2032 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpm+10%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pm 10}" class="latex" /> years. That is, no polynomial algorithm will be found. At least, not found by anyone in the public domain. <p></p>
</li><li>
Quantum computers will be able to factor all numbers up to one million <em>purely</em> via Peter Shor’s algorithm by 2030. This may not seem impressive—and it isn’t—but compare what Wikipedia summarizes about the past decade <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_records#Records_for_efforts_by_quantum_computers">here</a>. <p></p>
</li><li>
The Bitcoin protocol will be broken in at most five years. This will have a huge impact of course on the real markets. <p></p>
</li><li>
A super-linear lower bound on Boolean complexity will be found for some concrete problem.
</li></ul>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We predict that we will be way off. Completely wrong. That sounds safe. What do you think?</p>
<p>
Ken adds that his impression from holiday shopping in Barnes and Noble is that the pandemic has been productive for books.  How much so for research?  When will we be able to say?</p></font></font></div>

<p>The chain rule is a fundamental result in calculus. Roughly speaking, it states that if a variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> is a differentiable function of intermediate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_n" class="latex" />, and each intermediate variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" /> is itself a differentiable function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, then we can compute the derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} a}" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>

<p>Besides being a handy tool for computing derivatives in calculus homework, the chain rule is closely related to the backpropagation algorithm that is widely-used for computing derivatives (gradients) in neural network training. This <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">blog post</a> by Boaz Barak is a beautiful tutorial on the chain rule and the backpropagation algorithm.</p>



<p>As in Barak’s post, the backpropagation algorithm is usually taught as an application of the chain rule in machine learning classes. This leads to a common belief that “backpropagation is just applying the chain rule repeatedly”. While this is in a sense true, we wish to point out in this blog post that this belief is over-simplifying and can lead to incorrect implementations of the backpropagation algorithm. It has been discussed in many <a href="https://timvieira.github.io/blog/post/2017/08/18/backprop-is-not-just-the-chain-rule/">blog</a> <a href="https://wordpress.cs.vt.edu/optml/2018/04/28/backpropagation-is-not-just-the-chain-rule/">posts</a> that backpropagation is not just the chain rule, but we want to focus on a simple and basic difference here.</p>

<p>Consider the “neural network” above: it consists of an input variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" />, an output variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" />, and two intermediate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_2" class="latex" />. The neural network describes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c" class="latex" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="a" class="latex" /> in the following way:</p>

<p>Using the chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a> twice, we can compute the derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} a}" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>

<p>In the calculations above, note the difference between partial and full derivatives. For example, the partial derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_2%7D%7B%5Cpartial+a%7D+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial b_2}{\partial a} = 3" class="latex" />, whereas the full derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_2%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+a%7D+%3D+3%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+2+%3D+5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} b_2}{{\mathrm d} a} = 3\times 1 + 1\times 2 = 5" class="latex" />. Similarly, the partial derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_1%7D+%3D+4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial c}{\partial b_1} = 4" class="latex" />, whereas the full derivative <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+c%7D%7B%7B%5Cmathrm+d%7D+b_1%7D+%3D+5%5Ctimes+1+%2B+1%5Ctimes+4+%3D+9&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{{\mathrm d} c}{{\mathrm d} b_1} = 5\times 1 + 1\times 4 = 9" class="latex" />. Intuitively, for every edge in the graph, we can compute the corresponding partial derivative locally (after the <em>forward pass</em>, to be precise), but a full derivative may require longer calculations.</p>



<p>Now it should be clear that equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> cannot be <em>directly</em> explained as the standard chain rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a>. The key difference is that in the chain rule, we need partial derivatives of a single variable w.r.t. multiple other variables, whereas in <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a>, we need partial derivatives of multiple variables w.r.t. the same variable.</p>



<p>Of course, one can prove the correctness of backpropagation using the chain rule in various ways, but the simple proof “backpropagation uses the standard chain rule at every step” is incomplete. Also, it is certainly possible to compute derivatives (gradients) on a neural network directly using the chain rule similarly to <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-2">(2)</a>, but in neural network training one typically wants to calculate the derivatives of a single output variable w.r.t. a large number of input variables, in which case backpropagation allows a more efficient implementation than using the standard chain rule directly.</p>



<h2 id="the-real-chain-rule-in-actual-backpropagation">The real chain rule in actual backpropagation</h2>



<p>When implementing the backpropagation algorithm, it is more convenient and efficient to add in the two terms (or any number of terms in general) on the right-hand-side of <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> at <em>different</em> steps of the algorithm. This is described in Barak’s <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2020/11/03/yet-another-backpropagation-tutorial/">tutorial</a>, which also has an actual Python implementation! In contrast to the failure of naively explaining equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-3">(3)</a> as the chain rule, there is a way to explain this implementation using the chain rule directly.</p>



<p>To describe the implementation, suppose <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_n" class="latex" /> are all the variables, including input variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_m" class="latex" />, intermediate variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%7Bm%2B1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bn-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_{m+1},\ldots,b_{n-1}" class="latex" />, and the only output variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+b_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c = b_n" class="latex" />. Assume the variables are arranged in topological order: for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+m%2B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i = m+1,\ldots,n" class="latex" />, variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" /> is locally a function of variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_j" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" />. We can write this as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i+%3D+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i = b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})" class="latex" />. Note that some variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_j" class="latex" /> with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" /> may not have an edge to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />, in which case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} = 0" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>For each variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />, backpropagation stores in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_i" class="latex" /> a “temporary derivative/gradient” w.r.t. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />. Initially, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_n+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_n = 1" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_i = 0" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3C+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i &lt; n" class="latex" />. The backpropagation algorithm iterates over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+n%2Cn-1%2C%5Cldots%2Cm%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i = n,n-1,\ldots,m+1" class="latex" /> and performs the following updates in each iteration:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-4"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%5Cgets+%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%2B+%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_i+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%2C%5C+%5Ctextnormal%7Bfor+all%7D%5C+j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2Ci-1.+%26%26+%284%29+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned}{\mathsf {grad}}_j \gets {\mathsf {grad}}_j + {\mathsf {grad}}_i \cdot \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} ,\ \textnormal{for all}\ j = 1,\ldots,i-1. &amp;&amp; (4) \end{aligned}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>Of course, it suffices to update <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" /> only when there is an edge from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_j" class="latex" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i" class="latex" />, because otherwise <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j} = 0" class="latex" /> and the update does not change <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" />.</p>



<p>The update rule <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-4">(4)</a> can be explained as a direct application of the chain rule as follows. If we know the values of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_i" class="latex" />, we can evaluate the remaining variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_%7Bi%2B1%7D%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_{i+1},\ldots,b_n" class="latex" /> one by one, so in this sense, the output variable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+b_n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c = b_n" class="latex" /> is a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_1,\ldots,b_i" class="latex" />. Using the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=b_i+%3D+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="b_i = b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})" class="latex" />, we can relate functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c_i" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c_%7Bi-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c_{i-1}" class="latex" /> as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7Dc_%7Bi-1%7D%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29+%3D+c_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%2C+b_i%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_%7Bi-1%7D%29%29.%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned}c_{i-1}(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1}) = c_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1}, b_i(b_1,\ldots,b_{i-1})).\end{aligned}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>By the chain rule,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center" id="eq-5"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Baligned%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_%7Bi-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D+%2B+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D+%5Ccdot+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+b_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D%2C%5C+%5Ctext%7Bfor+all%7D%5C+j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2C+i-1.+%26%26+%285%29+%5Cend%7Baligned%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\begin{aligned}\frac{\partial c_{i-1}}{\partial b_j} = \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_j} + \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_i} \cdot \frac{\partial b_i}{\partial b_j},\ \text{for all}\ j = 1,\ldots, i-1. &amp;&amp; (5) \end{aligned}" class="latex" /></p>



<p>The correspondence between <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-4">(4)</a> and <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-5">(5)</a> completes the explanation: if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_i%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j = \frac{\partial c_i}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%5Cle+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j \le i" class="latex" /> before the update, we have <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_%7Bi-1%7D%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j = \frac{\partial c_{i-1}}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3C+i&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j &lt; i" class="latex" /> after the update. By induction, after the final iteration with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=i+%3D+m%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="i = m+1" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf+%7Bgrad%7D%7D_j&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf {grad}}_j" class="latex" /> contains the desired value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+c_m%7D%7B%5Cpartial+b_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\frac{\partial c_m}{\partial b_j}" class="latex" /> for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=j+%3D+1%2C%5Cldots%2Cm&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="j = 1,\ldots,m" class="latex" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=c+%3D+c_%7Bm%7D%28b_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cb_m%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="c = c_{m}(b_1,\ldots,b_m)" class="latex" /> is exactly the function whose derivatives we want to compute.</p></div>

<p>A few hours ago <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/combinatorial_theory">the first issue of <em>Combinatorial Theory</em></a> was published. I am happy and proud to take part in this new endeavor. The editorial speaks for itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This is the first issue of our new journal, </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. It is owned by mathematicians, dedicated to Diamond Open Access publishing with no fees for authors or readers, and committed to an inclusive view of the vibrant worldwide community in Combinatorics. The journal shares a similar scope with the long-running </em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A<em>(JCT A), owned by Elsevier. In 2020, almost all of the editors of JCT A resigned, deciding that it was the time to found a premier Combinatorics journal owned by mathematicians, not by a commercial publisher. Thus was born </em>Combinatorial Theory<em>. That birth has allowed us to rethink how and what we publish. We are proud to have assembled a broad and diverse team of editors. We are also pleased with two new features in our editorial process: </em>doubly-anonymous refereeing<em> to mitigate implicit biases during peer review, and the inauguration of </em>Expository Article<em> submissions to encourage inclusion of valuable well-written expositions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have warm feelings toward <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory Ser. A</em> and the earlier <em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory</em> (before it split to Ser A and Ser B), which was among the first journals of combinatorics, had important role for the development of our field, and which is still running under new editors.</p>

<p>If you are interested in graph colouring, and specifically in distributed algorithms for that classic problem, I strongly recommend the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00604" target="_blank">recent paper</a> posted by Magnús M. Halldórsson, Fabian Kuhn, Alexandre Nolin and Tigran Tonoyan. (For the record, three of the authors work, or have worked, in my department at Reykjavik University, so I am biased.) </p><p>The above-mentioned paper addresses the problem of finding a proper colouring of a graph when each node <i>v</i> has a palette of degree(<i>v</i>)+1 colours at its disposal. The paper resolves an open problem in distributed colouring and simplifies known results in doing so. As a byproduct of their results, the authors obtain improved streaming and sub-linear time algorithms.   See the paper for much more information on the context for this result and the technical details. </p><p>Congratulations to the authors!</p></div>

<p>I’m on the ICALP 2022 program committee (PC) and was apparently the first to complain when I saw the draft call for papers, and I asked that the requirement that <a href="https://icalp2022.irif.fr/?page_id=17">submissions must be in LIPIcs style</a> be put to a vote.  Despite substantial support among the PC for not requiring the majority of authors to squander their time formatting in an exotic style submissions that will be rejected, the Supreme Court blocked the vote.  Their main rationale seems to be ensuring correspondence between submissions and proceedings.  Ironically, at the same time other conferences are allowing authors to publish in proceedings an <em>abridged </em>version of the (accepted) submission, to make it easier to publish the paper in a journal (which may not want to have a full version already in a conference).  We are at the nadir in history where human effort is systematically wasted to produce versions that do not even pretend to be useful for readers — only to check boxes.</p>



<p>When I was at the IAS and was briefed about logistics, I was stunned when they asked me if I type my own papers, or if I needed help with that.  I guess the next level will be if you need help with formatting your submissions.</p>



<p>Picture a 100-year old retired scientist who followed the field for 75 years, and who wants to make one more contribution.  Even though they are no match for the raw power of a 15-year old, their ability to draw connections almost makes up for it, and their perspective is invaluable to the community.  This scientist, whose equipment consists of a desktop from two human generations ago, miraculously held together and kept working through sheer love and intimate knowledge, is now being asked to format their paper in LIPIcs style… or to ask someone else to do it for them (talk about fostering collaboration).</p>



<p>Here’s a non-exclusive list of true, terrible things about conferences, most of which were discussed earlier on this blog (see tag <a href="https://emanueleviola.wordpress.com/tag/utopia-tcs/">utopia-tcs</a>):</p>



<ol><li>Requiring submissions in proceedings format.</li><li>Pre-registering papers by a deadline different than the submission deadline.</li><li>Requiring authors to submit a separate 2-page summary of the paper.</li><li>Ultra-strict page limits, summary rejection for any deviation.</li><li>Suddenly being forced on a short notice to submit a dummy .pdf so that PC assignments can be made.</li><li>Extending the list of topics two days before the deadline.</li><li>Moving deadlines.</li><li>Forcing authors to check multiple times the call for papers and/or constantly monitor email for any of these last-minute changes.</li><li>In the lucky case of acceptance, following up with a barrage of emails involving minutiae such as underfull \hbox.</li><li>Writing “this only takes 60 seconds.”  For me (and, apparently, many others — otherwise why delay answering emails that take 10 seconds to answer?) attending to <em>any</em> task, following <em>any</em> instruction, even “blink” or “say yes” has a huge fix cost, maybe 30 minutes.  So I translate 60 seconds to 31 minutes.</li><li>Hosting the conference in places which are inconvenient, for the attendees and planet earth.</li><li>Hosting the conference at times which are inconvenient for the attendees.</li><li>Requiring in-person PC meetings whose outcome does not justify the costs.</li></ol>



<p>As usual, people in a position of power do not have much incentive to fight to change the very practices that put them in that position in the first place.  But even this cynical remark doesn’t tell the whole story, since the practices got <em>worse</em> with time, unlike the case of journals.  One impression I have is that people have gotten so used to buggy software, constant updates, and general techno slavery that they just accept all of this as another inevitable misery in life… and by far not the worst!  This last point is important, as I think a seeping philosophy that permeates much of the discussion and the decisions is that much more important things are at stake, so who cares about this?  If you really want to spend cycles fixing something, then what about X?  (It’s fun to think where you end up if you stretch this point.)  But another life is possible.</p>



<p>One day, I will throw in my two cents and launch a new journal.  Besides being electronic and free (like ToC) it will have the following features.</p>



<ol><li>Papers, if accepted, will appear in the authors’ chosen format.  No conversion, and no additional effort, will be required for publication.  All the effort will be exclusively directed at improving the content of the paper.</li><li>Submissions can be by pdf attachment or by overlay, but not only to arxiv: to *any* repository.  In particular, authors will not be required to get their paper to compile on the arxiv.</li><li>The identities of the reviewers will be made public (in case of acceptance).  This I am still debating, but so far I am leaning towards it.  The problem that this is trying to address is that while you get reputation points for being on a program committee or on an editorial board, you don’t get many for being an unknown journal referee who is actually supposedly doing the hard work or finally really checking the proofs.  Instead with public identities people can show off the hard work and their role in the community, as happens on more recent platforms like say stackexchange.</li><li>Authors will be free to submit anonymously, or not.  This choice will be made by the authors, not dictated by a committee.</li><li>And perhaps the most consequential thing that I am still debating, should all submissions be public? (Maybe not.)</li></ol>



<p></p>



<p>To finish on a high note, a great thing about conferences is the fast turn-around.  It is really depressing — in other fields — to have to wait so long for any quantifiable feedback on your work, and this is definitely something which I liked about the TCS community.  But, to come back to the mood of the post, this good aspect (and others) of conferences can probably be kept while rethinking the not so good.  (For example, there could be a journal with deadlines similar to conferences, which is also what happens for grant proposals etc.)</p>

<div class="content">
This paper aims to derandomize the following problems in the smoothed analysis of Spielman and Teng. Learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), invert Fourier Transforms (FT), and verify small circuits' unsatisfiability. Learning algorithms must predict a future observation from the only $m$ i.i.d. samples of a fixed but unknown joint-distribution $P(G(x),y)$ to explain an $\eta$-noisy target. Inverters must retrieve the hidden parameter $\theta$. The smoothed analysis can weaken the adversarial distribution $P(x,y)$ by injecting an appropriate perturbation $G$ with larger min-entropy $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G)$.  We will establish 1--10 for planted functions (Goldreich's PRG) $f_\theta(x) = f(\theta \circ x_1,\ldots,\theta \circ x_d)$ with variables $x_i \in \{0,1,\ldots,2n-1\}$ plugged into $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor)\oplus x_i$ in 1--4, $\theta\circ x_i := \theta_i \cdot \lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor \cdot (-1)^{x_i}\in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 5--6, and $\theta\circ x_i := \theta(\lfloor{x_i/2}\rfloor) \cdot (-1)^{x_i} \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ in 7. 8--10 will verify the unsatisfiability of small circuits in the worst case analysis (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$). Suppose $\log n \gg \log (ds/\varepsilon) + k$ in 1--4. Randomly pick an example $(X,Y)$ from the observed $m$ data in 4.

1. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = 0$, $\mathrm{Max}k\mathrm{CSP}$ of any $k$-variate predicate $f$ requires the sample size $\Omega(n^{(k-\epsilon)/2}) \le m \le \tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ to distinguish between $|\max_\theta P(y=f_\theta(x)) - \max_\theta P'(y=f_\theta(x))| \ge \Omega(1)$ and $P(x,y) \equiv P'(x,y)$ in $n^{O(k)}$ time by given access to both samplers $P(x,y)$ and $P'(x,y)$.
2. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log s$, the planted $s$-term DNF demands $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log s)}$ for $c$ less than 1, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log s + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than 1, to make $n^{O(\log s)}$-time PAC learning (even under a slight noise).
3. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = c\log 1/\varepsilon$, the $\mathrm{planted}$ $\mathrm{AND}$ needs $m \ge n^{\Omega(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$ for $c$ less than $1$, and $m \le n^{1/2 \log(1/\varepsilon) + O(1)}$ for $c$ greater than $1$, to make $(\eta+\varepsilon)$-accurate agnostic learning in $n^{O(\log 1/\varepsilon)}$-time.
4. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(\log s)$, the $\mathrm{monotone}$ $\mathrm{DNF}$ with expanding $s$-terms is PAC learnable from $m = n\cdot \mathrm{poly}(s)$ data with $\mathrm{Pr}[\lfloor{{X_{i}/2}}\rfloor, \lfloor{{X_{i'}/2}}\rfloor] \ge {1}/{n^{1+\epsilon}}$  in $n \cdot \tilde{O}(s^{\log d})$ time.
5. LPN and LWE over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ of $p\ge n^{\Omega(1)}$ hiding small secrets $\forall i, |\theta_i| = O(1)$ are breakable in polynomial time. 
6. GapSVP$_{\tilde{O}(n^2)}$ is breakable within polynomial time.
7. At $\mathrm{H}_\infty(G) = O(n)$, any $2^{n/2}$ by $2^{n/2}$ matrix with sparsity $2^{n-n^{\epsilon}}$ demands $\exp(n^{\Omega(1)})$ size $\mathrm{PH^{cc}}$ protocol unless it is learnable from $m = \exp(n^{\epsilon})$ data in $\exp(n^{\epsilon})$ time.
8. $\mathrm{VP} \ne \mathrm{VNP}$ or $\forall k, \mathrm{quasi}$-$NP \not\subset \mathrm{NC}^k$.
9. $\mathrm{PIT} \in \mathrm{DTIME}[n^{\mathrm{poly}(\log \log n)}]$ or $\forall \epsilon, \forall k, \mathrm{NTIME}[2^{n^{\epsilon}}] \not\subset \mathrm{SIZE}[n^k]$.
10. $\mathrm{quasi}$-$\mathrm{NP} \not\subset \mathrm{TC}^0$.</div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/12/did-lane-hemaspaandra-invent-fib-numbers.html">Did Lane Hemaspaandra invent the Fib numbers?</a></h3>

<p> (I abbreviate Fibonacci by Fib throughout. Lane Hemaspaandra helped me with this post.) </p><p>We all learned that Fib invented or discovered the Fib Numbers:</p><p>f_0=1,</p><p>f_1=1, and</p><p>for all n\ge 2, f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}.</p><p>We may have learned that they come up in nature (NOT true, see <a href="https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/fibonacc.htm">here</a>) or that they were important in mathematics (questionable--see this blog post <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2012/01/how-important-are-fib-numbers-in-math.html">here</a> which says no, but some comments give good counterarguments). You also learned that Fibonacci was the mathematician who first studied them. Also not true!  This one surprised me. </p><p>1) I came across this blog post: <a href="https://mathenchant.wordpress.com/2021/11/16/why-names-matter/">here</a> that says they were invented by Hemachandra first. Wow--I then recalled that Lane Hemaspaandra's birth surname  was Lane Hemachandra (he married Edith Spaan and they are now both Hemaspaandra). So naturally I emailed him to ask how a 20th-century person could invent something earlier than 1170. He told me a picture of him in the basement ages while he stays young. </p><p>2) It would be nice to say OH, let's call them Hemachandra numbers (would that be  easier than convincing the world to use tau instead of pi,? See <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto">The Tau Manifesto</a>) and let students know that there were people other than Europeans who did math back then. But even that story is not as simple as it seems. Lane emailed me this article: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/fibfibs.pdf">here</a> that tells the whole muddled story. (In what follows I leave out the accents.)</p><p>Virahanka seems to be the formulator of the Fib recurrence, though not quite the numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry.  He did this between 600 and 800 AD.</p><p>Gopala, in work prior to 1135, was aware of Virhanka's work. In particular he know about the inductive rule. But he also set the initial values and generated numbers, so he was the first to have the sequence we now call the Fib numbers. His motivation was Sanskrit Poetry. </p><p>Hemachandra in 1150 also formulated them, independently.  His motivation was Sanskrit poetry.</p><p>(I will learn some Sanskrit poetry the next time I teach Discrete Math so I can give the students an application of the material!)</p><p>So does Virhanka win? Hardly:</p><p>Acarya Pingala's writings from the 5th or 6th century BC (YES- BC!) indicate that he knew about the Fib numbers in the context of (you guessed it!) Sanskrit poetry. </p><p>3) I would support changing the name of the Fib Numbers to the Pingala numbers. This is both good and bad news for Lane:</p><p>a) Bad news in that he does not get a sequence of number that shares his pre-marriage name.</p><p>b) Good news in that if I settled on Hemachandra numbers then Lane and Edith would have to decide if 0 or 1 or 2 of them want to change their name to Hemachandra. I would guess not--too complicated. Plus one name change in a life is enough. </p><p>4) The story (especially  the articles I pointed to) shows just how complicated history can get. Even a straightforward question like:</p><p><i>Who first formulated the Fib Numbers?</i></p><p>might not have a well-defined answer. Perhaps this is  the wrong question since if people formulate the concept independent of each other, they should all get some credit.  Even if the authors are 1000 years apart. </p><p><i>Side note</i>: Independent Discovery may be harder to assert now since, with the web,  Alice could have seen Bob's paper so it may be hard to call Alice's discovery independent. As I have mentioned before on this blog, my students have a hard time with the notion of Cook and Levin coming up with NP-completeness independently  since  surely one would have posted it and the other would have seen it. An era before posting was possible! Unimaginable to them. Sometimes even to me. </p></div>

k-median and k-means are the two most popular objectives for clustering algorithms. Despite intensive effort, a good understanding of the approximability of these objectives, particularly in $\ell_p$-metrics, remains a major open problem. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of approximation factors known in literature for these objectives in $\ell_p$-metrics. 
 
We introduce a new hypothesis called the Johnson Coverage Hypothesis (JCH), which roughly asserts that the well-studied k-max coverage problem on set systems is hard to approximate to a factor greater than $1-\frac{1}{e}$, even when the membership graph of the set system is a subgraph of the Johnson graph. We then show that together with generalizations of the embedding techniques introduced by Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19), JCH implies hardness of approximation results for k-median and k-means in $\ell_p$-metrics for factors which are close to the ones obtained for general metrics. In particular, assuming JCH we show that it is hard to approximate the k-means objective:

$\bullet$ Discrete case: To a factor of 3.94 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.73 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.56 and 1.17 respectively, obtained under the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC).

$\bullet$ Continuous case: To a factor of 2.10 in the $\ell_1$-metric and to a factor of 1.36 in the $\ell_2$-metric; this improves upon the previous factor of 1.07 in the $\ell_2$-metric obtained under UGC (and to the best of our knowledge, the continuous case of k-means in $\ell_1$-metric was not previously analyzed in literature).
 
We also obtain similar improvements under JCH for the k-median objective. Additionally, we prove a weak version of JCH using the work of Dinur et al. (SICOMP'05) on Hypergraph Vertex Cover, and recover all the results stated above of Cohen-Addad and Karthik (FOCS '19) to (nearly) the same inapproximability factors but now under the standard NP$\neq$P assumption (instead of UGC).

Finally, we establish a strong connection between JCH and the long standing open problem of determining the Hypergraph Turan number. We then use this connection to prove improved SDP gaps (over the existing factors in literature) for k-means and k-median objectives.</div>

<p>Gerhard Ringel considered in 1959 the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider a finite family of circles such that every point in the plane is included in at most two circles. What is the minimum number of colors needed to color the circles so that tangent circles are colored with different colors?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ringel 1959 circle problem</strong> is the question if this minimum number of colors is bounded.</p>
<p>I mentioned the problem in a post about <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/coloring-problems-for-arrangements-of-circles-and-pseudocircles/">eight coloring problems for arrangements of circles and pseudocircles</a>, three years ago.

<p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">recent arXiv paper</a> James Davies, Chaya Keller, Linda Kleist, Shakhar Smorodinsky, and Bartosz Walczak solved the problem and showed that any finite number of colors does not suffices. In fact the proved considerably more. The paper is</p>
<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05042">A solution to Ringel circle problem,</a></h3>
<p>and here is the abstract</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We construct families of circles in the plane such that their tangency graphs have arbitrarily large girth and chromatic number. This provides a strong negative answer to Ringel’s circle problem (1959). The proof relies on a (multidimensional) version of Gallai’s theorem with polynomial constraints, which we derive from the Hales-Jewett theorem and which may be of independent interest.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the authors.</p>

We show a quadratic separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus width. We use this gap to get, for the first time, first, a super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus for refuting CNF formulas, and secondly, a quadratic separation between resolution width and monomial space in polynomial calculus with resolution.  Our super-polynomial separation between resolution and cut-free sequent calculus only applies when clauses are seen as disjunctions of unbounded arity; our examples have linear size cut-free sequent calculus proofs writing, in a particular way, their clauses using binary disjunctions. Interestingly, this shows that the complexity of sequent calculus depends on how disjunctions are represented.</div>

<p>When the Wall Street Journal's <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/defending-mathematics-science-stem-equity-education-california-k12-math-matters-11638728196?reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">editorial board</a> and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/07/hundreds-of-college-professors-blast-woke-math-movement/">New York Post</a> endorse your efforts, that should ring warning bells.</p><p>Several members of the theory and mathematics community and have written and endorsed an <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">Open Letter on K-12 Mathematics</a> that attacks the proposed revisions to the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Mathematics Framework</a>. I have mixed feelings about these efforts. </p><p>Certainly the CMF has its issues, and the FAQs <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/mathfwfaqs.asp">protest too much</a>. But the letter goes too far in the other direction, arguing mainly for the status quo that worked well for those who signed the letter, very few of which have significant experience in K-12 education. The open letter allows for only incremental change unlikely to lead to any significant improvements.</p><p>Before you sign the letter, take a look at the CMF <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter1.docx">introduction</a></p><p></p><blockquote><p>To develop learning that can lead to mathematical power for all California students, the framework has much to correct; the subject and community of mathematics has a history of exclusion and filtering, rather than inclusion and welcoming. There persists a mentality that some people are “bad in math” (or otherwise do not belong), and this mentality pervades many sources and at many levels. Girls and Black and Brown children, notably, represent groups that more often receive messages that they are not capable of high-level mathematics, compared to their White and male counterparts. As early as preschool and kindergarten, research and policy documents use deficit-oriented labels to describe Black and Latinx and low-income children’s mathematical learning and position them as already behind their white and middle-class peers. These signifiers exacerbate and are exacerbated by acceleration programs that stratify mathematics pathways for students as early as sixth grade.</p><p>Students internalize these messages to such a degree that undoing a self-identity that is “bad at math” to one that “loves math” is rare. Before students have opportunities to excel in mathematics, many often self-select out of mathematics because they see no relevance for their learning, and no longer recognize the inherent value or purpose in learning mathematics.</p></blockquote><p>You may or may not agree with the CMF approach, but it's hard to deny the real challenges they are trying to address and students they are trying to help. If you don't agree with the CMF, work with them to come up with a good alternative that helps create a more inclusive mathematical citizenry. An outright rejection of the approach won't fix problems and probably won't be taken seriously, except from the conservative press.</p></div>

<p>The SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award recognizes an outstanding dissertation in the field of economics and computation. The award is conferred annually at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation and includes a certificate, complimentary conference registration, and an honorarium of $1,500. A certificate may further be given to up to two runners-up. No award may be conferred if the nominations are judged not to meet the standards for the award.</p>



<p>To be eligible, a dissertation must be on a topic related to economics and computation and must have been defended successfully during the calendar year preceding the year of the award presentation.</p>



<p>The next SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award will be given for dissertations defended in 2021. Nominations are due by <em>February 28th, 2022</em> (Anywhere on Earth), and must be submitted <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">by email to the Award Committee</a> with “2021 SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award” in the subject. A dissertation may be nominated simultaneously for both the SIGecom Doctoral Dissertation Award and the ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.</p>



<p>Nominations may be made by any member of SIGecom and will typically come from the dissertation supervisor. Self-nomination is not allowed. Nominations for the award <em>must include the following</em>, preferably having items 1, 3, and 4 in a single PDF file:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>A two-page summary of the dissertation, written by the nominee, including bibliographic data and links to publicly accessible versions of published papers based primarily on the dissertation.</li><li>An English-language version of the dissertation in a separate file.</li><li>An endorsement letter of no more than two pages by the nominator, arguing the merit of the dissertation, potential impact, and justification of the nomination. This document should also certify the dissertation defense date.</li><li>The names, email addresses, and affiliations of at least two additional endorsers.</li></ol>



<p>The additional endorsement letters themselves should be <a href="mailto:sigecom-awards-diss@acm.org">sent directly by email</a>, by the same deadline. These endorsements should be no longer than 500 words and should specify the relationship of the endorser to the nominee, contributions of the dissertation, and its potential impact on the field.</p>



<p>It is expected that a nominated candidate, if selected for the award, will attend the next ACM Conference on Economics and Computation on July 11–15, 2022, to accept the award and give a presentation on the dissertation work. The conference will tentatively be held in Boulder, Colorado. The award includes complimentary registration but does not cover travel or accommodation expenses to attend the conference.</p>
