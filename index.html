<div class="content">
In continuation to our recent work on noncommutative
 polynomial factorization, we consider the factorization problem for
 matrices of polynomials and show the following results.
\begin{itemize}  
\item Given as input a full rank $d\times d$ matrix $M$ whose entries
  $M_{ij}$ are polynomials in the free noncommutative ring
  $\mathbb{F}_q\langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$, where each $M_{ij}$ is given by a
  noncommutative arithmetic formula of size at most $s$, we give a
  randomized algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $d,s, n$ and
  $\log_2q$ that computes a factorization of $M$ as a matrix product
  $M=M_1M_2\cdots M_r$, where each $d\times d$ matrix factor $M_i$ is
  irreducible (in a well-defined sense) and the entries of each $M_i$
  are polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_q \langle x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ that are output
  as algebraic branching programs. We also obtain a deterministic
  algorithm for the problem that runs in $poly(d,n,s,q)$.
\item A special case is the efficient factorization of matrices whose
  entries are univariate polynomials in $\mathbb{F}[x]$. When $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite
  field the above result applies. When $\mathbb{F}$ is the field of rationals
  we obtain a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.

<p><em>This is first guest post by Deb. More to come!</em></p>

<p>In “<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2104626">The clinician and dataset shift in artificial intelligence</a>,” published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a set of physician-scientists describe how a popular sepsis-prediction system developed by the company Epic needed to be deactivated. “Changes in patients’ demographic characteristics associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic” supposedly caused spurious alerting arising from the system, rendering it of little value to clinicians. For the authors, this is a clear illustration of distribution shift, a change in training and test data that, in this case, made it difficult to distinguish between fevers and bacterial sepsis. They go into detail about what this means: distribution shift is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, and whenever we attempt to deploy machine learning in the real world without considering the way in which that real world environment can change (whether its changes in technology (e.g., software vendors), changes in population and setting (e.g., new demographics), or changes in behavior (e.g., new reimbursement incentives), then we fail to properly consider the ways in which the data can change or shift between train and test environments. If not considered, the model will inevitably fail.</p>

<p>And why not? If the underlying test data diverges from the data used in the development of the model, we should expect disappointing results. But the distribution shift problem is so common that ML researchers and practitioners have started seeing it everywhere they look. In fact, in many cases, they will inappropriately characterize any failure of deployed ML models as a distribution shift. This both muddles our understanding of what exactly distribution shift means, and limits our vocabulary for the range of failures that can show up in deployment. In this blog post, I’ll use Epic’s sepsis-detector to illustrate some of the current confusion about distribution shift, and why the notion of “external validity”, a description of generalization problems used widely in other fields, is perhaps more relevant.</p>

<p>The terminology of distribution shift is both too specific and not specific enough. A “change in distribution” could be characterized as anything from a variation in source to a re-sampling. <a href="https://rtg.cis.upenn.edu/cis700-2019/papers/dataset-shift/dataset-shift-terminology.pdf">These changes could involve changes to the input features (ie. covariate shift), changes to the labels (ie. prior probability shift) or both (ie. concept drift).</a></p>

<p>The notion of “data distributions” themselves assumes data comes from an imagined data generating function. In that world of infinitely abundant independent data points samples from a bespoke probability distribution (ie. the “independent and identically distributed” i.i.d. assumption), describing data in terms of how it’s distributed makes a lot of sense. But as Breiman describes in <a href="http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf">“Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures”</a>, that assumption doesn’t often hold for real world data. Very rarely does one actually know the data generating function, or even a reasonable proxy - real world data is disorganized, inconsistent, and unpredictable. As a result, the term “distribution” is vague enough to not address the additional specificity necessary to direct actions and interventions. When we talk about a hypothetical distribution shift, we talk about data changes but are not specific about which data changes happen and why they happen. We’re also constraining our discourse by just looking at changes in the data in the first place, when in fact, many other changes occur between development and deployment (such as changes in interactions with the model, changes in the interpretation of model results, etc.). Specifying the type of distribution shift is one solution, but more importantly, we need to understand specific distribution shifts as part of a broader phenomenon of external validity that we need to begin to articulate as a field.</p>

<p>The most significant consequence of the myopic obsession with distributions is how it constrains ML evaluations. The benchmarking paradigm that dominates ML at the moment is a by-product of its obsession with detecting shifts in data - the evaluation of models on static data test sets are tied to assumptions about failures being due to shifts in data distribution and not much else. A myopic view on distribution shift confuses the discourse on how to evaluate models for deployment. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01312-x">Several</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1872">studies</a> on <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0">regulatory approvals</a> of ML-based tools in healthcare already demonstrate how over-emphasis on data distribution shift failures has led ML practitioners and even regulators within the healthcare space to inappropriately prioritize the use of <em>retrospective studies</em> (ie. evaluations on static collections of past data) rather than <em>prospective studies</em> (ie. examinations of the system within its context of use). Things like multi-site assessment, median evaluation sample size, demographic subgroup performance and
“side-by-side comparison of clinicians’ performances with and without AI” are also exceedingly rare in the evaluation of ML-based healthcare tools, as they don’t fit our current narrow perception of what can go wrong when you throw an ML model into the real world. Of course distribution shift matters but the nature in which we focus on it to the exclusion of everything else is regrettable. For better regulation and evaluation methodology for machine learning deployments, we need to expand our thinking and align ourselves with the other fields attempting to understand performance gaps between the theory and practice of interventions.</p>

<p>This broader notion of validity characterizes the accuracy of the claims being made in a specific context. The related notion of reliability has to do with reproducibility and the consistency of results (think of measurement precision), but validity is concerned with some notion of truthfulness and how close claims get to the target of describing the real relationship between inputs and outputs. There are various notions of validity discussed in measurement theory, evaluation science, program evaluation and experiment design literature, but there are common core concepts. For example, internal validity is about assessing a consistent causal relationship between the inputs and outputs within the experiment and construct validity is related to the evaluation of how well experimental variables represent the real world phenomena being observed. When discussing generalization issues, we are most interested in external validity, which analyzes if  the causal relationship between inputs and outputs observed in experiments holds for inputs and outputs outside the experimental setting.</p>

<p>To understand how external validity differs from the current discourse on distribution shift, let’s go back to the sepsis monitoring example. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2781307">“External Validation of a Widely Implemented Proprietary Sepsis Prediction Model in Hospitalized Patients,”</a>, published in JAMA, describes a retrospective study on the use of the sepsis tool between December 2018 and October 2019 (notably well before the pandemic began). They examined 27,697 patients undergoing 38,455 hospitalizations and found that the Epic Sepsis Model predicted the onset of sepsis with an area under the curve of 0.63, “which is substantially worse than the performance reported by its developer”. Furthermore, the tool “did not identify 1,709 patients with sepsis (67%) despite generating alerts… for 6,971 of all 38 455 hospitalized patients (18%), thus creating a large burden of alert fatigue.” These researchers rightfully describe these issues as “external validity” issues, and go into detail examining a range of problems far beyond the data-related “shifts” described in the “Clinician and Dataset Shift” oped. They don’t pretend that this doesn’t have to do with changes in the data - of course it does. Epic’s system evaluation was on data from 3 US health systems from 2013 to 2015, and that’s certainly a different dataset than University of Michigan’s 2018-2019 patient records. But they also comment on changes to the interactions doctors had with the model and how that modified outcomes, as well as other external validity factors that had very little to do with data at all, much less “data distribution shift.” Even when discussing substantive data changes, they are specific in characterizing what it is and breaking down the differences that occurred upon deployment at their hospital.</p>

<p>As this study shows, machine learning needs some clean guidelines for evaluating external validity.
To begin scaffolding such frameworks, we can learn from the social sciences. For example, Erin Hartman, a UC Berkeley colleague in political science, and her co-author Naoki Egami <a href="https://erinhartman.com/publication/elements/">propose a taxonomy that provides an interesting start to this discussion</a>. Their interest is in assessing external validity in scenarios where a population is given a policy treatment (eg. sending out voting reminders, updating the tax code, giving out free vaccines, etc.) and the impact of this treatment as measured within the experiment and also once implemented in the real world. If we consider the treatment to be an ML model’s integration into a broader system, we can begin to articulate what external validity could mean in the algorithmic context.  In my next blog post, I’ll try to work through Hartman and Egami’s framework and other specific proposals from other fields on how we could begin to taxonomize external validity issues, and see which of the external validity problems they describe are actually quite relevant to machine learning.</p></div>

question of Sealfon (PODS'16), who asked whether a $o(n)$-error algorithm
exists. We also show that an additive error of $\Omega(n^{1/6})$ is necessary
for any sufficiently small $\epsilon, \delta &gt; 0$.

<p>Finally, we consider a relaxed setting where a multiplicative approximation
is allowed. We show that, with a multiplicative approximation factor $k$, %$2k

points that are evolving over the course of time, we consider the problem of
maintaining a set of labels assigned to the vertices of a tree, where the
locations of these labels change over time. We study the problem in the
evolving data framework, where labels change over time due to the action of an
agent called the evolver. The algorithm can only track these changes by
explicitly probing individual nodes of the tree. This framework captures the
tradeoff between the complexity of maintaining an up-to-date view of the
structure and the quality of results computed with the available view. Our
results allow for both randomized and adversarial evolution of the data,
subject to allowing different speedup factors between the algorithm and the
evolver. We show that in the limit, our algorithm maintains labels to within an
average distance of $O(1)$ of their actual locations. We also present nearly
matching lower bounds.

<p><b>Authors: </b>Emil Junker <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16151">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>The group identification problem asks to identify a socially qualified
subgroup among a group of individuals based on their pairwise valuations. There
are several different rules that can be used to determine the social
qualification status. In this work, we consider the consent rules, the
consensus-start-respecting rule, and the liberal-start-respecting rule.
</p>
<p>In the context of group identification, a manipulative attack is the attempt
by an outsider to influence the outcome of the selection process through
certain means of manipulation. These means include adding, removing, or
partitioning individuals, as well as bribing individuals to change their
opinion.
</p>
<p>In this work, we provide an overview of manipulative attacks in group
identification as well as group identification with partial profiles. In
particular, we study the computational complexity of the corresponding
problems. Most results presented in this work are aggregated from the
literature, but we also show results for previously unstudied problems; these
include general and exact group control in binary profiles and in ternary
profiles, as well as constructive group control in $r$-profiles. For many
considered problems, we also study the parameterized complexity.

in temporal graphs -- graphs whose edge set changes over discrete time steps. A
core problem here is the NP-hard Short Restless Temporal Path: given a temporal
graph $\mathcal G$, two distinct vertices $s$ and $z$, and two numbers $\delta$
and $k$, is there a $\delta$-restless temporal $s$-$z$ path of length at most
$k$? A temporal path is a path whose edges appear in chronological order and a
temporal path is $\delta$-restless if two consecutive path edges appear at most
$\delta$ time steps apart from each other. Among others, this problem has
applications in neuroscience and epidemiology. While Short Restless Temporal
Path is known to be computationally hard, e.g., it is NP-hard for only three
time steps and W[1]-hard when parameterized by the feedback vertex number of
the underlying graph, it is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the
path length $k$. We improve on this by showing that Short Restless Temporal
Path can be solved in (randomized) $4^{k-d}|\mathcal G|^{O(1)}$ time, where $d$
is the minimum length of a temporal $s$-$z$ path.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Reproducibility is vital to ensuring scientific conclusions are reliable, but failures of reproducibility have been a major issue in nearly all scientific areas of study in recent decades. A key issue underlying the reproducibility crisis is the explosion of methods for data generation, screening, testing, and analysis, where, crucially, only the combinations producing the most significant results are reported. Such practices (also known as p-hacking, data dredging, and researcher degrees of freedom) can lead to erroneous findings that appear to be significant, but that don’t hold up when other researchers attempt to replicate them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new notion of reproducibility for randomized algorithms. This notion ensures that with high probability, an algorithm returns exactly the same output when run with two samples from the same distribution. Despite the exceedingly strong demand of reproducibility, there are efficient reproducible algorithms for several fundamental problems in statistics and learning. We show that any statistical query algorithm can be made reproducible with a modest increase in sample complexity, and we use this to construct reproducible algorithms for finding approximate heavy-hitters and medians. Using these ideas, we give the first reproducible algorithm for learning halfspaces via a reproducible weak learner and a reproducible boosting algorithm. We initiate the study of lower bounds and inherent tradeoffs for reproducible algorithms, giving nearly tight sample complexity upper and lower bounds for reproducible versus non-reproducible SQ algorithms. Finally, we discuss connections to other well-studied notions of algorithmic stability, such as differential privacy.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://meyn.ece.ufl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Meyn</a> (University of Florida) and <a href="http://cs.bme.hu/~gergo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gergely Neu</a> (Pompeu Fabra University)</p>



<p>One theoretical foundation of reinforcement learning is optimal control, usually rooted in the Markovian variety known as Markov decision processes (MDPs). The MDP model consists of a state process, an action (or input) process, and a one-step reward that is a function of state and action. The goal is to obtain a policy (function from states to actions) that is optimal in some predefined sense. Chris Watkins introduced the Q-function in the 1980s as part of a methodology for reinforcement learning. Given its importance for over three decades, it is not surprising that the question of the true meaning of <em>Q</em> was a hot topic for discussion during the Simons Institute’s Fall 2020 program on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/rl20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Theory of Reinforcement Learning</a>.</p>



<p>This short note focuses on interactions at the start of the program, and research directions inspired in part by these interactions. To start with, <em>who is Q</em>? Was this code for one of Watkins’ friends at Cambridge? The question was posed early on, which led to an online investigation. The mystery was shattered through a response from Chris: we now know that the letter <em>Q</em> stands for <em>quality</em>, not Quinlyn or Quincy. To discuss further questions and potential answers requires some technicalities.</p>



<p>The discounted-cost optimality criterion is a favorite metric for performance in computer science and operations research, and is the setting of the original Q-function formulation. The definition requires a state process <span class="math inline">\(\{X_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span> and an action (or input) process <span class="math inline">\(\{A_k : k\ge 0\}\)</span>, evolving on respective spaces (which are assumed discrete in this note). There is a controlled transition matrix <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> that describes dynamics: <span class="math inline">\(X_{k+1}\)</span> is distributed according to <span class="math inline">\(P(\cdot|x,a)\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(X_k=x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_k=a\)</span>, for any action sequence that is adapted to the state sequence.</p>



<p>With <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> denoting the discount factor, the Q-function is the solution to a nonlinear fixed-point equation <span class="math inline">\(T^*Q = Q\)</span> in which <span class="math inline">\(T^*\)</span> is the Bellman operator: <span class="math display">\[\left(T^*Q\right)(x,a) = r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\]</span> This must hold for each state-action pair <span class="math inline">\((x,a)\)</span>, with the maximum over all possible actions. This is a version of the dynamic programming (DP) equation that has been with us for about seven decades.</p>



<p>The magic of Q-learning, which is based on this DP equation, is that the maximum appears within an expectation. This makes possible the application of Monte Carlo methods to obtain an approximate solution based solely on observations of the actual system to be controlled, or through simulations.</p>



<p>One core idea of modern reinforcement learning (RL) is to find approximate solutions of the DP equation within a function class (e.g., neural networks, as popularized by the deep Q-learning approach of Mnih et al., 2015). While success stories are well-known, useful theory is scarce: we don’t know if a solution exists to an approximate DP equation except in very special settings, and we don’t know if a good approximation will lead to good performance for the resulting policy. We don’t even know if the recursive algorithms that define Q-learning will be stable — estimates may diverge to infinity.</p>



<p>There are many ways to read these negative results, and indeed many articles have been written around this subject. Our own reading is probably among the most radical: without understanding the issues around the existence of solutions to these DP equation approximations or their interpretation, we should search for alternative approximations of dynamic programming suitable for application in RL.</p>



<p>These concerns were raised at Sean Meyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUaFu3WzW7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boot camp lecture</a>, where he called on listeners to revisit an alternate foundation of optimal control: the linear programming (LP) approach introduced by Manne (1960) and further developed by Denardo (1970) and d’Epenoux (1963). The message was greeted with enthusiasm from some attendees, including Gergely Neu, who responded, “You have blown my mind!” He had been working on his own formulation of this idea, which became logistic Q-learning (more on this below).</p>



<span id="more-636"></span>



<p>The least-squares approach that is central to most traditional RL algorithms (such as DQN) is replaced by an LP, so that we move from <span class="math inline">\(L_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> approximation. There is ample motivation for this point of view:</p>



<ul><li>
		<p>Lyapunov theory and the theory of inverse dynamic programming provide firm motivation: a good approximation of the DP equation in an <span class="math inline">\(L_\infty\)</span> sense implies strict bounds on closed-loop performance of the resulting policy. You can learn more about this theory in standard RL texts, and Meyn’s new RL monograph to appear this year.</p>
	</li><li>
		<p>The LP approach reframes the DP approximation as a numerical optimization problem rather than a root-finding problem. Existence of a solution is guaranteed under minimal assumptions, even when working with a restricted set of candidate solutions.</p>
	</li></ul>



<p>Despite these advantages, LP-based approaches were left out of the mainstream RL tool kit until recently. One reason may be a glaring gap in the framework: the classical LPs are phrased in terms of state-value functions and not Q-functions! This means it was not obvious how to bring in Monte Carlo methods for algorithm design.</p>



<p>In 2020, we independently discovered the following LP that can be used to cast Q-learning as a constrained optimization problem — the so-called DPLP: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned} \mbox{minimize } \qquad &amp; \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_{a} Q(X,a)\right] \\ \mbox{subject to } \qquad &amp; Q(x,a) \ge r(x,a) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|x,a)}\left[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)\right]\end{aligned}\]</span> Without any constraints on the function class, the optimizer is the solution to the DP equation. The constraints amount to the DP inequality <span class="math inline">\(Q \ge T^* Q\)</span>, which tells us only <em>negative</em> deviations should be penalized! This is to be contrasted with the commonly used squared Bellman error criterion that penalizes deviations of both signs. In seeking an approximation within a function class <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span>, it is not at all difficult to ensure a feasible solution exists, even when there is no theory to ensure that an approximate Bellman optimality operator has a fixed point.</p>



<p>There are a variety of possible ways of turning <span> this</span> insight into practical algorithms. One path (taken by Bas-Serrano et al., 2021) is to replace the hard constraint in the LP with a smooth upper bound on the expected constraint violations, resulting in the following unconstrained minimization problem: <span class="math display">\[%  \mbox{minimize } \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}[\max_a Q(X,a)] + \frac 1\eta \log 
% \mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}[e^{\eta(r(X,A) + \gamma \mathbb{E}_{X’\sim P(\cdot|X,A)}[\max_{a’} Q(X’,a’)] – Q(X,A))}].
\mbox{minimize} \;\;\;\;\;\;\,\, \mathbb{E}_{X\sim\nu_0}\left[\max_a Q(X,a)\right] + \frac 1\eta \log 
\mathbb{E}_{(X,A)\sim\mu}\left[e^{\eta((T^*Q)(X,A) – Q(X,A))}\right].\]</span> Bas-Serrano et al. (2021) dubbed the above objective function the “logistic Bellman error” and have shown that it enjoys several favorable properties that make it an ideal objective for stochastic optimization. Interactions at the Simons Institute led to the development of another related algorithmic framework called “convex Q-learning,” in which the hard constraints in the LP are replaced with a different continuous approximation (Lu et al., 2021).</p>



<p>It is straightforward to derive practical algorithms from both approaches by replacing the expectations with sample averages. This approach led to good empirical performance, along with the beginnings of theory for convergence and performance bounds.</p>



<p>The LP approach had been simmering in the background over the prior decade: de Farias and Van Roy (2003) proposed an LP approach for approximate dynamic programming, and Mehta and Meyn (2009) contains foundations for convex Q-learning, including a variant of the DPLP for deterministic systems in continuous time.</p>



<p>The new techniques bring challenges that must be overcome before these LP-based approaches can take on the world. One is that these optimization problems can be very poorly conditioned. Another is that the approximation may greatly underestimate the true Q-function when using a poor choice of function class for approximation. We remain optimistic: just like the RL community has successfully developed numerical recipes for addressing the much more severe issue of nonexistence of fixed points to the approximate Bellman operators, we believe that similar know-how can be developed for LP-based methods if theorists and practitioners join forces. Now that we understand where Q comes from, let us decide together where it will go next!</p>



<p><em>Acknowledgment</em>. The authors owe a great debt to the Simons Institute for providing inspiration and interactions throughout the fall program. In particular, our joint work (Lu et al., 2021) was in large part an outcome of discussions at the meeting. The LP approach is one theme of the new textbook (Meyn, 2022), and the impact of the program is seen throughout the book.</p>

Keith Kirkpatrick is the author of an interesting CACM <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2022/4/259392-still-waiting-for-self-driving-cars/fulltext">article</a> on self-driving cars. It is titled “Still Waiting For Self-Driving Cars” and appears in the news section of this month’s issue. </p>
<p>
Today we discuss why it has been so difficult to get self-driving cars started.</p>
<p>
Kirkpatrick’s article starts:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>Over the past decade, technology and automotive pundits have predicted the “imminent” arrival of fully autonomous vehicles that can drive on public roads without any active monitoring or input from a human driver. Elon Musk has predicted his company Tesla would deliver fully autonomous vehicles by the end of 2021, but he made similar predictions in 2020, 2019, and 2017. Each prediction has fallen flat, largely due to real-world safety concerns, particularly related to how self-driving cars perform in adverse conditions or situations.</i> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> An Issue </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
As printed in the current CACM issue, his article says the following on page 13:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A potential intermediate solution currently being tested in Germany is to utilize remote drivers to control vehicles. Vay, a Berlin-based startup, has been testing a fleet of remote-controlled electric vehicles in that city and plans to roll out a mobility service in Europe and potentially the U.S. this year. The service will allow customers to order a remote-controlled car and have it drive them to their desired destination; on arrival, they get out if the vehicle and leave it to a human teledriver miles away to either park the vehicle or steer it to the next client. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I claim this shows the issue that we have with automatic driving systems. There is a typo in the above paragraph. A typo that shows what we are up against in the attempt to make automatic driving systems. </p>
<p>
<b>DO YOU SEE IT?</b></p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/cacmifoftypo/" rel="attachment wp-att-19792"><img width="253" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CACMifoftypo.jpg?resize=253%2C36&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19792" height="36" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
We claim that a typo like this in a CACM article is part of the reason it is so hard to make self-driving cars. Do you agree? Or is the typo not critical? While we’re at it, does the title of this post have a typo?  Read on…</p>
<p>
Ken contributes a more difficult example of this kind, one he used while addressing the same issue of AI advances in his department’s Freshman Seminar. It relates to a later section in Kirkpatrick’s article, where he discusses the issue of</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> …testing to ensure vehicle navigation systems understand the complex social interactions that often occur between oncoming and adjacent drivers, or drivers and pedestrians. Generally, if a pedestrian is about to cross or is crossing a street, the driver and pedestrian will make eye contact, and will use nonverbal cues to indicate the direction and speed of their movement. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Over to Ken:</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ken’s Example </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is the relevant portion of the White House <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia">transcript</a> of Barack Obama’s July 2012 campaign speech in Roanoke, Virginia—the one with the notorious phrase “you didn’t build that”:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/26/waiting-for-self-deriving-cars/youdidntbuildthat/" rel="attachment wp-att-19798"><img width="363" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/YouDidntBuildThat.jpg?resize=363%2C229&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19798" height="229" /></a></p>
<p>
The question we could submit to Google—whose own automated-driving efforts have had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/personaltech/google-says-its-not-the-driverless-cars-fault-its-other-drivers.html">difficulties</a> with interpreting rules—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> What does the word “that” in “you didn’t build that” refer to? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
By rules of linguistic derivation, the answer seems clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The word “that” refers to the most recent noun, which is “business.” <p></p>
</li><li>
The dashes ‘- -‘ connect two parts that refer to each other. <p></p>
</li><li>
The word cannot anyway refer to “roads and bridges” because that is plural whereas “that” is singular, like “business.” <p></p>
</li><li>
(The preceding point is not a self-contradiction because in quotes, “roads and bridges” is a phrase—singular.)
</li></ul>
<p>
Now please take a minute-plus to listen to the actual delivery of this part of the speech (you may need to click back from 0:00:08 to 0:00:00 to get the start):</p>
<p></p><center><br />
<br />
</center><p></p>
<p></p><p><br />
First, the transcript is missing a word: Obama actually said “<em>that</em>—you didn’t build <em>that</em>.” Perhaps having a rhetorically emphasized <em>that</em> right after “business” makes the semantic designation even clearer? But then notice that the part “if you’ve got a business” was delivered in a quick and parenthetical manner inside the full phrase “Somebody invested in roads and bridges … you didn’t build that.” </p>
<p>
The interpretation that the “that” refers to <em>infrastructure</em> is supported by the speech’s immediate segue to the Internet, sandwiched around “somebody else made that happen.” Going out to sources, Obama was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/an-unoriginal-obama-quote-taken-out-of-context/2012/07/20/gJQAdG7hyW_blog.html">channeling</a> a point already notoriously made by Elizabeth Warren in a 2011 <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/the-agenda/elizabeth-warrens-quote-reihan-salam/">speech</a>. But without going out to sources—something we cannot expect an AI to do in the moment—there is Obama’s next sentence (also included in the speech clip):</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual initiative, but also because we do things together.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Whether Obama intended to say that people did not build their businesses can still be argued, but that’s not the real point. My first point is that AIs based on current art for ascribing meanings not only would make that ascription, but <em>should</em> do so for overall consistency. And the second, larger, point at the end of my <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~regan/cse199/InternetAndData199np.pdf">slides</a>, where I get to hard AI problems, is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We base our confidence in developing AI systems on Alan Turing’s principle that whatever the human mind can resolve, a computer can be programmed to apprehend and execute. But what if important data, on fine scales, concern matters that our human minds cannot resolve? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
CACM puts in a bubble Kirkpatrick’s quoting another expert that “it will take years and massive compute power to train self-driving systems to understand the nonverbal cues that pass between drivers and pedestrians.”  We believe the task and need of getting cars to <em>self-derive</em> meanings is greater still.  </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Do these issues say anything about the difficulty of getting code right? We think so, but what do you think?</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<p><strong>The 2022 STOC Test of Time Award</strong> recognizes papers published in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. This is the second year of this annual award. There are three awards, targeting the STOC conferences 10, 20, and 30 years prior to the year in which the award is given. While there is a preference for papers in the target years (and nominations from those years are encouraged), in each of these award categories it is also possible to nominate STOC conference papers published up to four conferences earlier than the targeted conference. Thus, the 2022 STOC Test of Time Awards will be for papers presented at the STOC conferences in 2008-2012, 1998-2002, and 1988-1992. The awards, which will be presented at STOC 2022, include a prize of US $500 per author as well as complimentary registration for all authors who attend the conference at which the award is given.</p>



<h2>Nomination Procedure</h2>



<p>Nominations should be sent to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>stoc22.tot.award@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong>with a subject line of <strong>“STOC Test of Time Award” </strong>no later than <strong>April 30, 2022</strong>. Nominations should contain an explanation of the impact of the nominated paper(s), including references to follow-on work. A nomination may be accompanied by up to three additional endorsement letters, which may be sent by the endorsers directly to the same email address with the same subject line. Self-nominations are disallowed. </p>



<h2>Selection</h2>



<p>The winners will be selected by a committee appointed by the SIGACT Executive Committee. For 2022 the selection committee consists of Toniann Pitassi (Columbia), Satish Rao (Berkeley), Salil Vadhan (Harvard, chair), Avi Wigderson (Institute for Advanced Study). </p>



<p>In selecting the Test of Time Award winners, the Committee will pay particular attention to long-term impact. This impact can come in many forms, including but not limited to:</p>



<ol><li>Opening up a new area of research</li><li>Introducing new techniques</li><li>Solving a problem of lasting importance</li><li>Stimulating advances in other areas of computer science or in other disciplines.</li></ol>



<p>The committee expects to select exactly one paper for each award. However, when circumstances justify it, up to three may be selected. The committee may consider papers that were not explicitly nominated and gather additional input from experts, but formal nominations are extremely helpful in the committee’s deliberations and strongly encouraged.</p></div>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:  In the Pandora’s Box problem, the algorithm is provided with a number of boxes with unknown (stochastic) rewards contained inside them. The algorithm can open any box at some cost, discover the reward inside, and based on these observations can choose one box and keep the reward contained in it. Given the distributions from which the rewards are drawn, the algorithm must determine an order in which to open the boxes as well as when to stop and accept the best reward found so far. In general, an optimal algorithm may make both decisions adaptively based on instantiations observed previously. The Pandora’s Box problem and its extensions capture many kinds of optimization problems with stochastic input where the algorithm can obtain instantiations of input random variables at some cost. Previous work on these problems assumes that different random variables in the input are distributed independently. As such it does not capture many real-world settings. In this work, we provide the first algorithms for Pandora’s Box-type problems with correlations. In the independent setting, optimal algorithms are non-adaptive and based on the notion of the Gittins index. These techniques fail to extend to the correlated case. We assume that the algorithm has access to samples drawn from the joint distribution on input and provide solutions that require few samples; are computationally efficient; and guarantee approximate optimality. <br />This is joint work with Evangelia Gergatsouli, Yifeng Teng, Christos Tzamos, and Ruimin Zhang and appeared in FOCS’20.</p>

The sum of the absolute values of the Fourier coefficients of a function $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{R}$ is called the spectral norm of $f$.    Green and Sanders' quantitative version of  Cohen's idempotent theorem states that if the spectral norm of $f:\mathbb{F}_2^n \to \{0,1\}$ is at most $M$, then the support of $f$ belongs to the ring of sets generated by at most $\ell(M)$ cosets,  where $\ell(M)$ is a constant that only depends on $M$.
    
    We prove that the above statement can be generalized to approximate spectral norms if and only if the support of $f$ and its complement satisfy a certain arithmetic connectivity condition. In particular, our theorem provides a new proof of the quantitative Cohen's theorem for $\mathbb{F}_2^n$.</div>

Quantified conflict-driven clause learning (QCDCL) is one of the main solving approaches for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). One of the differences between QCDCL and propositional CDCL is that QCDCL typically follows the prefix order of the QBF for making decisions.
We investigate an alternative model for QCDCL solving where decisions can be made in arbitrary order. The resulting system QCDCL-ANY is still sound and terminating, but does not necessarily allow to always learn asserting clauses or cubes. To address this potential drawback, we additionally introduce two subsystems that guarantee to always learn asserting clauses (QCDCL-UNI-ANY) and asserting cubes (QCDCL-EXI-ANY), respectively.
We model all four approaches by formal proof systems and show that QCDCL-UNI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on false formulas, whereas QCDCL-EXI-ANY is exponentially better than QCDCL on true QBFs. Technically, this involves constructing specific QBF families and showing lower and upper bounds in the respective proof systems.
We complement our theoretical study with some initial experiments that confirm our theoretical findings.</div>

<p>A few days ago I received by mail Imre Bárány’s new book <em>Combinatorial Convexity</em>. The book presents Helly-type theorems and other results in convexity with combinatorial flavour. The choice of material and the choice of proofs is terrific and it is an ideal book for a course for graduate students and advanced undergraduates.  Congratulations, Imre!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/ulect-77/">AMS page</a> gives the following description</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>This book is about the combinatorial properties of convex sets, families of convex sets in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces, and finite points sets related to convexity. This area is classic, with theorems of Helly, Carathéodory, and Radon that go back more than a hundred years. At the same time, it is a modern and active field of research with recent results like Tverberg’s theorem, the colourful versions of Helly and Carathéodory, and the <span class="MathJax" id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame"><span class="math" id="MathJax-Span-1"><span class="mrow" id="MathJax-Span-2"><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-3">(</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-4">p</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-5">,</span><span class="mi" id="MathJax-Span-6">q</span><span class="mo" id="MathJax-Span-7">)</span></span></span></span> theorem of Alon and Kleitman. As the title indicates, the topic is convexity and geometry, and is close to discrete mathematics. The questions considered are frequently of a combinatorial nature, and the proofs use ideas from geometry and are often combined with graph and hypergraph theory. </em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>The book is intended for students (graduate and undergraduate alike), but postdocs and research mathematicians will also find it useful. It can be used as a textbook with short chapters, each suitable for a one- or two-hour lecture. Not much background is needed: basic linear algebra and elements of (hyper)graph theory as well as some mathematical maturity should suffice.</em></span></p></blockquote>

<p>This fall, I taught my course <a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/">CS 127: Cryptography</a>, based on my lecture notes: <a href="https://intensecrypto.org/">“An intensive introduction to cryptography”</a>. This is a course that starts with no background knowledge, and gets to advanced concepts including lattice-based (aka “post quantum”) encryption, fully homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, multiparty secure computation, software obfuscation, quantum computing and crypto, and more. </p>



<p><a href="https://cs127.boazbarak.org/projects/">As in previous years</a>, I had an fantastic group of students, several of whom produced impressive course projects. These include the following: </p>



<p><strong>Gavin Uberti</strong>, <strong>Kevin Luo</strong>, <strong>Oliver Cheng,</strong>  and <strong>Wittmann Goh</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04581">implemented Witness Encryption</a>. Witness encryption is a cool concept whereby you can encrypt a secret X (for example the private key corresponding to a bitcoin wallet) so that people can decrypt X if and only if they can find a solution to some puzzle P. You can do this <em>even if you don’t know a solution yourself!</em> So for example you could use this to offer an automatically paying reward for a formal proof of the Reimann Hypothesis, or as they did, offer 2270  Satoshis to anyone solving this Soduko puzzle:</p>

<p><strong>Simas Sakenis</strong> wrote a <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/simas_project.pdf">survey of proofs of stake in cryptocurrencies</a>,  providing a uniform formalizaiton of proofs of work and proofs of stake, and explaining the difference. </p>



<p><strong>Michael Kiestra</strong> and <strong>Beatrice Nash</strong> proposed  <a href="https://windowsontheory.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/kiestra_nash.pdf">CLAMBAKE</a>,  a protocol that uses broadcast encryption and Yao’s garbled circuits to achieve a privacy-preserving protocol for facilitating access to controlled resources such as university buildings.</p>



<p>(There were more projects in the course, but some students preferred not to post these publicly since they are still working on them; I will update this post with more projects if appropriate.)</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Pessiland is the worst of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds: it is a world where NP is hard on average and pseudorandom generators do not exist. Excluding Pessiland (i.e., showing the equivalence between average-case hardness of NP and the existence of pseudorandom generators) is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science. In this talk, we propose to consider PH (Polynomial Hierarchy) variants of Impagliazzo’s five possible worlds. Our main result is to unconditionally rule out PH variants of Pessiland. I will also mention recent progress on excluding PH Heuristica: average-case hardness of PH follows from exponential worst-case hardness of PH.</p>

<p>I am on the <a href="https://focs2022.eecs.berkeley.edu/cfp.html">FOCS 2022 </a>Program Committee, and I am overjoyed that the PC meeting will be virtual.  Hopefully, the days are over when the program chair can brush aside all cost-benefit considerations, impose their backyard on far-away scholars who need service items, and then splash their offspring at the welcome party.</p>



<p>I am also overjoyed that we will be implementing double-blind reviews.  This issue has been discussed and ridiculed at length.  Admittedly, it makes it harder to adhere to Leonid Levin’s 1995 influential <em><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/202840.606487">STOC Criteria</a></em>.  For example, if a reviewer wanted to trash a paper based on the fact that the authors are not in the position to judge their own work, now they’ll have to check online for talks or preprints to know who the authors are.  Given the volume of reviews, it’s reasonable to expect that in some cases the reviewer won’t be able to conclusively exclude that a letter-writer is among the authors.  In such a situation they can resort to writing a very long, thorough, and competent review whose most significant digit is the STOC/FOCS death sentence: <em>weak accept</em>.</p>



<p>No, I actually do have something more constructive to say about this.  I was — as they say — privileged to serve on many NSF panels.  As an aside, it’s interesting that there the track-record of the investigators <em>is </em>a key factor in the decision; in fact, according to many including myself, it should carry even more weight, rather than forcing investigators to fill pages with made-up directions most of which won’t pan out.  But that’s another story; what is relevant for this post is that each panel begins with a quick “de-biasing” briefing, which I actually enjoy and from which I learnt something.  For example, there’s a classic experiment where the ratio of females hired as musicians increases if auditions hide the performer behind a tent and make them walk in on carpet so you can’t tell what shoes they are wearing.  Similar experiments exist that hide names from the folders of applicants, etc.  What I propose is to do a similar thing when reviewing papers.  That is, start with a de-biasing briefing: tell reviewers to ask themselves whether their attitude towards a paper would be different if:</p>



<ol><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were ultra-big shots, or</li><li>The authors of this paper/previous relevant work were hapless nobodies, or</li><li>The proofs in this paper could be simplified dramatically to the point that even I understand them, or</li><li>This result came with a super-complicated proof which I can’t even begin to follow, or</li></ol>



<p>What other questions would be good to ask?</p></div>

<p>During the early parts of the cold war of the 20th century, we saw two almost independent developments of computational complexity, in the west and in the then USSR. There was little communication between the two groups, and countless theorems proven twice, most notably the seminal NP-complete papers of Cook and Levin. To understand more, I recommend the two articles about the early days of complexity by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.1981.10005">Juris Hartmanis</a> and by <a href="https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1984.10036">Boris Trakhtenbrot</a>.</p><p>Russia's invasion and relentless bombing in Ukraine have quickly separated the east and the west again. </p><p>Our first concern needs to be with Ukraine and its citizens. We hope for a quick end to this aggression and Ukraine remaining a free and democratic country. Ukrainian cities have undergone massive damage, and even in the best possible outcome it will take years if not decades to fully rebuild the country. </p><p>Terry Tao has been <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2022/03/02/resources-for-displaced-mathematicians/">collecting resources</a> for displaced mathematicians due to the crisis.</p><p>We've cut off ties with Russia institutions. In our world, major events to be held in Russia, including the <a href="https://www.mathunion.org/">International Congress of Mathematics</a> and the <a href="https://logic.pdmi.ras.ru/csr2022/">Computer Science in Russia</a> conference are being moved online. I was invited to workshops in St Petersburg in 2020 and 2021, both cancelled due to Covid, and was looking forward to one in 2022, which if it happens, will now happen without me. </p><p>The music world has has cancelled some stars, most notably <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/ukraine-putin-valery-gergiev-anna-netrebko.html">Valery Gergiev and Anna Netrebko</a>, due to their close ties to Putin. It's rare that we do the same to mathematicians for political reasons though <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/imus-non-controversial-changing-name-of.html">not unheard of</a>. I suspect most of our colleagues in Russia oppose the war in Ukraine, or would if they had accurate information of what was going on. I have several Russian friends and colleagues including <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/06/compressing-in-moscow.html">two I travelled to Moscow in 2019 to honor</a> and would hate to be disconnected from them.</p><p>It's way too early to know how this will all play out. Will we see a quick Russian retreat? Not likely. Will we see a situation that sees a mass migration of Ukranian and Russian mathematicians and computer scientists to Europe and North America, like in the 1990's? Possibly. We will see a repeat of the cold war, disconnected internets and science on both sides happening in isolation? I hope not but we can't rule it out.</p></div>

Neil L. is a leprechaun. He has been visiting me or Ken once every year since we started GLL. We had never seen a leprechaun before we began the blog—there must be some connection. </p>
<p>
Today we want to share the experience we each had with him this morning of St. Patrick’s Day.<br />
<span id="more-19755"></span></p>
<p>
That’s right—Neil visited both of us separately. Four years ago, when I had major heart surgery on St. Patrick’s Eve, Neil <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/17/leprechauns-know-what-it-feels/">came</a> to my previous New York apartment, grabbed a page of my notes, and took it to Ken. The past two years, Ken was on Zoom with me when Neil appeared. This time, Neil had a bone to pick with Ken—after posing a problem to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Neil’s Problem </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Kathryn, my dear wife, and I are still in our new midtown Manhattan apartment after my procedure two weeks ago. She went to sleep in the bedroom, but I stayed up awaiting Neil’s arrival. I must have dozed off, but jolted awake to his laugh and the waft of his pipe’s green smoke.</p>
<p>
Neil said hi and explained right away that he had a problem. “A classic problem that leprechauns have faced forever.” I nodded to him and rubbed my eyes to be awake enough to listen. Neil continued:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The other day I was minding me business and I fell into a trap. Nasty fall. The trapper was an old foe of mine. She told me she had three wishes. And I was bound to grant them as usual. Sae much, sae normal. But then she breached the rules. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> No More Wishes </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Now I knew the rules of wishes, so Neil did not have to tell me: Must be about something contingent, not love or death, no self-transmogrification, and most of all—well, let’s hear it from the genie in Disney’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)">Aladdin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Three wishes, three. Uno, dos, tres, no substitutions, exchanges, or refunds, and ixnay on the wishing for more wishes.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p></font><p><font color="darkgreen">
Neil picked up his story: “Her first two wishes were:<br />
</font> </p>
<ol>
<li>
A pot of gold coins. <p></p>
</li><li>
Another pot of gold.
</li></ol>
<p><font color="darkgreen"></font></p><font color="darkgreen">
<p>
Those were fair and I showed I could handle them forthwith. But then she asked for: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> ‘Please ten chirag oil lamps, each with a genie who can grant three wishes.’ </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This was terrible. It sent me to the lore. Ye cannot ask your servant for more wishes. Ye cannot involve another leprechaun. But lamps of themselves are just objects. That a <em>chirag</em> lamp has a genie is like an oyster has a pearl. Even if half the lamps be duds, that still  compounds the wishes—and she wished for ten that were not duds.”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Math and Myth </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Neil puffed a few more times, as if really expecting an answer from me. He even prompted, “What do ye think?” </p>
<p>
That sent me into befuddlement. Usually I try to engage Neil on a <em>math</em> problem, to trick him into telling the answer to Riemann or factoring or P=NP. But despite the “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3E+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{&gt; 3}" class="latex" />” aspect, this wasn’t math—it was more about <em>myth</em>. Math I can take seriously, but with weighty matters personal and worldwide, I did not want to play “meta” games. </p>
<p>
Neil read my mind: “Nay, I assure ye—it be really about math. Even the Riemann—”</p>
<p>
That made me think: if Neil knew that it had real math content, he must know the answer already. No sense groping for it groggily. I just retorted: “I don’t want to guess the answer. Please just tell me.”</p>
<p>
“Ye know there be only one way I ever tell ye answers…”</p>
<p>
“Sure. OK.” I really wanted to join Kathryn for some sleep.</p>
<p>
I blinked as Neil vanished in green light. Only his pipe smoke remained, and it curled around into a shape I couldn’t place at first. It took awhile to become sharp enough that I could tell what it was:</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/17/meta-wishes/greenzeta/" rel="attachment wp-att-19758"><img width="60" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GreenZeta.png?resize=60%2C123&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19758" height="123" /></a></p>
<p></p><h2> Myth and Math </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I, Ken, shall tell the rest. Ordinarily, I would have been eager to engage Neil again about the NCAA basketball tournaments. But I too am too touched by the same weighty matters, and quite forgot the day.</p>
<p>
My unawareness did not matter because Neil apparated and instantly started confronting me: “What gave ye the mickey to <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/">write</a> of mathematics being ’emergent’? Ye dinna even define it.”</p>
<p>
I had to concede I’d not only been vague but had analogized it too to two senses of “emergent” in philosophy. I started to explain: “It’s like Albert Einstein’s famous question, ‘Did God have a choice?’ among physical laws. Now about math…”</p>
<p>
Neil cut me off: “When Einstein said ‘God,’ he meant nature—but when <em>you</em> say it, you mean leprechauns. You are asking: ‘Do we leprechauns have the power to change mathematical truths in advance of your learning them?’ That’s our turf—!”</p>
<p>
I stammered that I had a right to pose the question and had not meant to insinuate. But Neil kept on: “If we really could change outcomes then what would <em>maths</em> rest on? On <em>myths</em> just as well. But where ye speak of <em>law</em>, we have <em>lore</em>. Established rules. And they suffice.”</p>
<p>
This was waxing cryptic and I thought bringing up Kurt Gödel would only make it more so. Neil sensed I was adrift and went on: “I shall inform ye via the same story I told Dick.”</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Neil’s Solution </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Neil unfurled his story. At his same pause, one perception dawned on me: “Neil, did the lady’s wish imply a recursion—meaning the genies would be asked for a wish generator in the same proportion?”</p>
<p>
Neil nodded: “The lore says yes—the lore on hearing what is said. That is what I consulted it for. The rest I could work out on paper.” </p>
<p>
The paper part was easy up to a point. The wishes implied an infinite summation: the original <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3}" class="latex" />, then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{30}" class="latex" /> more of the ten genies, with the third wishes to each bringing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{30}" class="latex" /> at the next level, for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B30+%5Ccdot+10+%3D+300%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{30 \cdot 10 = 300}" class="latex" /> more wishes there, and so on. In sum, </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3+%2B+30+%2B+300+%2B+3000+%2B+%5Ccdots+%3D+3%5Ccdot+%281+%2B+10+%2B+100+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3 + 30 + 300 + 3000 + \cdots = 3\cdot (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>wishes. Clearly the number of wishes is bounded by the series </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot%281+%2B+10+%2B+3%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+100+%2B+5%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+6%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+7%5E%7B%5Clog_2+10%7D+%2B+1000+%2B+%5Ccdots%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot(1 + 10 + 3^{\log_2 10} + 100 + 5^{\log_2 10} + 6^{\log_2 10} + 7^{\log_2 10} + 1000 + \cdots) " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Which equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%5Ccdot+%5Czeta%28-%5Clog_2+10%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3\cdot \zeta(-\log_2 10)}" class="latex" />. Without asking Neil how he’d computed that, I went to an <a href="https://solvemymath.com/online_math_calculator/number_theory/riemann_function/index.php">online</a> zeta <a href="https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1180573439">calculator</a> and obtained a bounding total of </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++3%5Ccdot+0.006023525392866159581193...+%5C%3B%5C%3B%3D+%5C%3B%5C%3B%2B0.018070576178598478743579...+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  3\cdot 0.006023525392866159581193... \;\;= \;\;+0.018070576178598478743579... " class="latex" /></p>
<p>wishes. Neil puffed and chortled and finished his story:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “So the unlucky lass had wished herself into wishing a grand total of less than one-fiftieth of a wish. Since only whole wishes can be honoured, this sprang me from the trap and kept me both me pots o’ gold to boot. I gave her one coin as a peace offering.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
I joined the laughter for just a moment. This followed mathematical rules but outlandishly, and I groped for the point. But Neil supplied it directly:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “Some of your fellow travelers have felt reaching answers by non-constructive methods to be less outlandish only in degree not kind. If ye later apprehend the answer by calculation—which is what your post styled as “emergent” knowledge—then it must be exactly the same object previously described non-constructively. Thus in the realms ye ascribed to us wee folk, we are the guardians and gatekeepers of truth, not the forgers of it.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Neil tipped his hat and simply faded out—no green smoke for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Can Neil’s zeta-function calculations insulate against any attempt at recursively gaining infinite wishes? The zeta function whips up and down in tune with the Bernoulli numbers, but the leprechauns do have freedom to choose a bounding series. Or is there an infinite series scheme that rises above 3 wishes even so? We hope this has given some St. Patrick’s Day diversion.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Differential Privacy (DP) is a formal definition of privacy which guarantees that the outcome of a statistical procedure does not vary much regardless of whether an individual input is included or removed from the training dataset. 
This guarantee is desirable when we are tasked to train machine learning models on private datasets that should not memorize individual inputs. 
Past works have shown that differentially private models can be resilient to strong membership inference [<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kairouz15.html">1</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519424">34</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/fc4ddc15f9f4b4b06ef7844d6bb53abf-Abstract.html">35</a>] and data reconstruction attacks [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/carlini">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12383">3</a>] when the privacy parameter is set to be sufficiently small. 
See a <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/how-to-deploy-ml-with-dp/">prior post</a> for more background on differentially private machine learning.</p>

<p>Yet, in practice, most attempts at training differentially private deep learning models on moderately-sized datasets have resulted in large performance drops compared to when training without privacy-protection baked in. 
These performance drops are oftentimes large enough to discourage the adoption of differential privacy protection into machine learning pipelines altogether.</p>

<p>To provide a reference of the potential performance hit, the authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12677">5</a>] trained a ResNet-20 from scratch on CIFAR-10 with a privacy budget of \(\epsilon=8\) that has test accuracy barely over 62% (see their Table 1). 
Contrast this with the 8.75% error rate (91.25% accuracy) reported for training the same architecture without enforcing differential privacy [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html">6</a>]. 
While some works report private learning results better than the above, absent additional data, pre-training, or external knowledge, most improvements have been incremental, and the test accuracy for CIFAR-10 models trained under modest privacy leakage (\(\epsilon=3\)) has roughly settled to ~70% in the literature [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>].</p>

<p>One reason behind the performance drop lies in sample efficiency — differentially private learning generally requires much more data than non-private learning to reach an acceptable level of performance. 
This also means that learning the high-level features (e.g., syntactic structure in text, edge detectors for images) necessary to perform specific tasks with private data can be much more sample-costly.</p>

<p>This blog post surveys results that leverage public self-supervised pre-training to obtain high-performing models through differentially private fine-tuning.
The pre-train-fine-tune paradigm is straightforward to execute and results in high-performing models under modest privacy budgets for many standard computer vision and natural language processing tasks. 
Moreover, existing results have shown that private fine-tuning consistently benefits from improvements in public pre-training.</p>

<h2 id="self-supervised-pre-training">Self-Supervised Pre-Training</h2>

<p>Self-supervised learning is a paradigm which leverages unlabeled data to learn representations that can be useful for a range of downstream tasks.
Since self-supervised learning doesn’t target specific tasks itself, 
the (pre-)training procedure doesn’t require labeled data — in many cases, mildly curated unlabeled data is sufficient for self-supervised pre-training to produce models for subsequent fine-tuning. 
So far, there have been two broadly successful instantiations of this learning paradigm in computer vision [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j.html">9</a>] and natural language processing [<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~amuham01/LING530/papers/radford2018improving.pdf">7</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">8</a>]. 
We recap the two approaches below.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>Contrastive pre-training for vision:</strong> 
One class of self-supervised methods in computer vision (SimCLR, [<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/chen20j.html">9</a>]) performs pre-training through contrastive learning. 
Algorithms of this type produce embeddings for images with the goal of creating different embeddings for semantically different images and similar embeddings for similar ones. 
Concretely, the algorithm used in SimCLR forces models to produce similar embeddings for an image and its augmented siblings (e.g., image rotated by some degrees), 
and different embeddings for separate images (and their augmentations). 
The SimCLR framework with large scale models and compute led to state-of-the-art (non-private) ImageNet fine-tuning results at the time of its writing.</p>

<p><strong>Masked language modeling and autoregressive language modeling for text:</strong> 
Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Auto-regressive Language Modeling (ALM) are two self-supervised pre-training approaches. 
While the former asks models to predict deliberately masked out tokens from a piece of text, the latter asks models to simply predict the next token in a sequence. 
With large amounts of unlabeled text data, large and expressive Transformer models [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html">24</a>], and lots of compute, both approaches produce powerful models that are good starting points for downstream fine-tuning. 
For instance, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT, [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">8</a>]), produced state-of-the-art (non-private) results (at the time) for a large collection of language understanding tasks when fine-tuned on each.</p>

<h2 id="fine-tuning-self-supervised-models-with-dp-optimization">Fine-Tuning Self-Supervised Models With DP-Optimization</h2>
<p>Self-supervised pre-training is appealing in the context of differentially private machine learning. 
This is because (i) the mildly curated data needed for pre-training can usually be obtained cheaply from the public domain, and (ii) pre-trained models may contain useful domain knowledge that can reduce the sample complexity of subsequent private learning. 
A paradigm for private learning that leverages self-supervised pre-training could follow two steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>collect cheap and public (unlabeled) data from the task domain (e.g., vision, language, etc.) to pre-train a model with self-supervised learning, and</li>
  <li>collect moderate amounts of task-specific private (labeled) data and fine-tune the pre-trained model under differential privacy to perform the task.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>To date, some of the best differentially private deep learning results in the literature have resulted from instantiating this paradigm [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06500">12</a>].
Below, we review works which capitalize on self-supervised pre-training by differentially privately fine-tuning pre-trained models with an iterative gradient method like DP-SGD [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978318">19</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6736861">20</a>].<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
<img src="https://differentialprivacy.org/images/fine-tuning-paradigm.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>Private fine-tuning with SimCLR features:</strong> 
The authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>] fine-tuned a linear model on top of the embedding vectors produced by SimCLRv2 from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Under a privacy budget of \(\epsilon=2\), 
these models reached an average test accuracy of 92.7%. This number can be further improved to ~94% with the use of larger and wider pre-trained models in the SimCLRv2 family.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> 
These test accuracies are very close to some standard non-private results attained by an off-the-shelf ResNet architecture [<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/html/He_Deep_Residual_Learning_CVPR_2016_paper.html">6</a>].</p>

<p><strong>Privately fine-tuning BERT variants and GPT-2:</strong> 
The authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06500">12</a>, <a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/yu21f.html">16</a>] showed that with appropriate hyper-parameters, fine-tuning BERT variants and GPT-2 with DP-optimization results in high-performing private models for text classification and language generation — even on datasets of modest sizes and under modest privacy budgets. 
Notably, some of these models attain a task performance close to non-private models from previous years in the literature. 
These results also exceed many non-private learning results from the pre-BERT and pre-GPT years.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>More interestingly, the authors showed that the larger (and thus better) the pre-trained model, the better the private fine-tuning performance gets. 
This empirical observation in private fine-tuning of large Transformers is qualitatively different from what’s implied by the usual minimax optimal rates derived for vanilla private learning with convex loss functions under approximate differential privacy [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6979031">14</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/3bd8fdb090f1f5eb66a00c84dbc5ad51-Abstract.html">15</a>]. 
This discrepancy between experimental results for training large models and the theory for learning with convex losses suggests there is more to be understood.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Overall, for both vision and language tasks, private learning performance has consistently improved with the improvement in the quality of pre-training, 
where the latter is measured by the non-private fine-tuning performance.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="conclusion-and-outlook">Conclusion and Outlook</h2>

<p>We surveyed recent works in the literature that obtained highly performant private machine learning models leveraging self-supervised pre-training. 
Common to these results is the trend that the performance of private learning consistently improved with the quality of public pre-training. 
We therefore anticipate that the general paradigm may be useful in additional settings (e.g., federated learning) and tasks (e.g., private synthetic image generation), and lead to better private learning results.</p>

<p>We have thus far assumed that the data for public pre-training can be cheaply obtained.
This, however, does not imply that determining whether a particular source of data is appropriate for public pre-training is an easy problem.
Using publicly available data is not necessarily risk-free in terms of privacy.
For instance, the authors of [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/carlini-extracting">33</a>] were able to extract personally identifiable information from a GPT-2 model pre-trained on data scraped from the public internet.</p>

<p>Self-supervised pre-training has led to progress in private deep learning, but leveraging pre-trained models alone will not address several fundamental challenges to differentially private learning.
First and foremost, the datasets of machine learning tasks may be sampled from long-tailed distributions [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1e14bfe2714193e7af5abc64ecbd6b46-Abstract.html">21</a>]. 
When privately trained on such datasets, a machine learning model may fail to acquire the learning signal necessary to perform accurate predictions for examples on the tail [<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445934">28</a>] or from underrepresented (sub)populations [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/hash/fc0de4e0396fff257ea362983c2dda5a-Abstract.html">29</a>]. 
Second, many machine learning problems are in a domain where public data (even unlabeled data) may be sparse, e.g., medical imaging. 
Developing refined versions of the pre-train-fine-tune approach for problems from these domains is an interesting avenue for future work.</p>

<p>Lastly, differential privacy as one specific definition of privacy may not capture all that’s desired for privacy in reality. 
For instance, while differentially private algorithms naturally give machine unlearning guarantees [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9519428">30</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7163042">32</a>], tailored unlearning algorithms tend to have higher capacities of unlearning [<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/9627c45df543c816a3ddf2d8ea686a99-Abstract.html">31</a>].
In addition, what constitutes a record in the differential privacy framework can oftentimes be unclear. 
Inappropriately defined example boundaries can create correlated records which cause differential privacy guarantees to degrade [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01508">22</a>].
Moreover, differential privacy guarantees won’t directly prevent the inference of private data outside the original context [<a href="https://heinonline.org/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/washlr79&amp;section=16">23</a>]. 
These are fundamental limitations of differential privacy which improvements to differentially private learning won’t touch on.</p>

      <p>Authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258">18</a>] framed these self-supervised models which are trained on broad data at scale that are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks as “foundation models.” <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

      <p>The idea of privately fine-tuning a publicly pre-trained model certainly isn’t new.

Results on privately fine-tuning <em>self-supervised</em> models are, on the other hand, more recent.

      <p>Hyper-parameters that work well for non-private learning typically aren’t those that work best for differentially private learning [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJg851rYwH">27</a>]. It’s crucial to use a large batch size, a small clipping norm, an appropriate learning rate, and a reasonably large number of training epochs to obtain the mentioned private learning results [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>]. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:5" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:6">
      <p>In practice, past works have presented mixed results on whether larger models would yield better performance. While some showed that using more filters in a convolutional network can degrade the performance of private learning after some threshold [<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJg851rYwH">27</a>], others showed that a larger model can outperform a smaller model from a different model family [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660">4</a>]. Note these results are conditioned on their particular hyperparameter choices. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:7">
      <p>Since the pre-training data for large language models are oftentimes collected through large scale web scraping (e.g., WebText), a common concern is that some training and test instances for downstream tasks may already appear in the pre-training data. Self-supervised pre-training therefore can give models an opportunity to “see” this data even before they are privately fine-tuned. Authors of [<a href="https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf">17</a>] confirmed that there is a 1-6% overlap between the test set of many natural language processing tasks and the pre-training data they collected (WebText); these common tasks, however, don’t include those studied by authors of [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05679">11</a>]. The numbers suggest a possibility that existing private fine-tuning results in the literature could be slightly inflated compared to when the pre-training data didn’t contain any instance for any downstream task for which evaluation was performed. <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fnref:7" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p>

<p>1) In 1989 on the episde The Royale of Star Trek: The Next Generation (which takes place in the far future)  Captain Picard is working on Fermat's last theorem which he says quite explicitly is still open.</p><p>When I saw the episode I asked Larry Washington, a Number Theorist at Univ of MD, when he thought FLT would be solved. He said</p><p>                                      <i>It will be solved within the next 10 years.</i></p><p>And indeed- Wiles solved it in 1993-sort of. There was a flaw in the proof which he fixed in 1994 with the help of his former student Richard Taylor. Wiles published the correction to the flaw in 1995, so we will date it as having been solved in 1995. Larry Washington was correct.  And in an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine in 1995 (episode name:Facets) Dax says that a previous host, Tobin Dax, had done the most creative work on FLT since Wiles. Maybe Tobin wrote this limerick:</p><p>A challenge for many long ages</p><p>Had baffled the savants and sages</p><p>Yet at last came the light</p><p>Seems that Fermat was right</p><p>To the margin add 200 pages.</p><p><br /></p><p>I asked Larry W when he thought Riemann would be solved. He said  </p><p>                   <i> In your lifetime but not in mine.</i></p><p>He is about 10 years older than I am and I think we are both in good health. This seems like a rather precise prediction so I am skeptical. But he did get FLT right...</p><p>2) In class I sometimes say things like </p><p><i>I do not think Quantum Computers will factor faster than classical in my lifetime. </i></p><p><i>I do not think P vs NP will be solved in my lifetime.</i></p><p><i>I can imagine P=BPP will be proven in my lifetime.

What about in my lifetime?</i></p><p>Indeed- his lifetime and mine are rather far apart. </p><p>I am reminded that one of the answers to my P vs NP poll made the point that while we have some sense of what will happen in the next 10 years, maybe even 20, math and life can change so much that conjectures beyond that are guesswork.

<p>One of the central tenets of machine learning warns the more times you run experiments with the same test set, the more you overfit to that test set. This conventional wisdom is mostly wrong and prevents machine learning from reconciling its inductive nihilism with the rest of the empirical sciences.</p>

<p>Rebecca Roelofs, Ludwig Schmidt, and Vaishaal Shankar led an passionate quest to test the overfitting hypothesis, devoting countless hours to reproducing machine learning benchmarks. In particular, they painstakingly recreated a test set of the famous <a href="https://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet benchmark</a>, which itself is responsible for bringing about the latest AI feeding frenzy. Out of the many surprises in my research career, what <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10811">they found surprised me the most.</a></p>

<p class="center"><img width="90%" alt="The scatterplot of nightmares" src="http://www.argmin.net/assets/RSS_Scatter.png" /></p>

<p>In this graph, the x-axis is the accuracy on the original ImageNet benchmark, which has been used millions of times by individual researchers at Google alone. On the y-axis is the accuracy evaluated on “ImageNet v2” set, which was made by closely trying to replicate the data creation method for the benchmark. Each blue dot represents a single machine learning model trained on the original ImageNet data. The red line is a linear fit to these models, and the dashed line is what we would see if the accuracy was the same on both test sets. What do we see? The models which perform the best on the original test set perform the best on the new test set. That is, there is no evidence of overfitting.</p>

<p>What is clear, however, is a noticeable drop in performance on the new test set. Despite their best efforts in reproducing the ImageNet protocol, there is evidence of a <em>distribution shift</em>. Distribution shift is a far reaching term describing whenever the data on which a machine learning algorithm is deployed is different from the data on which it is trained. The Mechanical Turk workers who labeled the images were different from those originally employed. The API used for the labeling was slightly different. The selection mechanism to aggregate differences in opinions between labelers is slightly different. The small differences add up to around a 10% drop in accuracy, equivalent to five years of progress on the benchmark.</p>

<p>Folks in my research group have reproduced this phenomenon several times. In <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/9117-a-meta-analysis-of-overfitting-in-machine-learning">Kaggle competitions</a>, where the held out set and validation set were <em>identically</em> distributed, we saw no overfitting <em>and</em> no distribution shift. We found sensitivity to distribution shifts in CIFAR10, in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02168">video</a>, and in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14444">question answering</a> benchmarks. And Chhavi Yadav and Leon Bottou showed that we have not yet overfit to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10498">venerable MNIST data set</a>, but distribution shift remains a challenge.</p>

<p>The marked sensitivity to distribution shift is a huge issue. If small ambiguities in reproductions lead to large losses in predictive performance, what happens when we take ML systems designed on static benchmarks and deploy them in important applications? A decade of AI fever has delivered piles of evidence that distribution shift is machine learning’s achilles heel. Algorithms run inside the big tech companies need to be constantly retrained with their huge computing resources. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002683">Data-driven algorithms for radiology often fail if one changes the X-ray machine</a>. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2781307">AI algorithms for sepsis fail if you change hospitals</a>. And self-driving car systems are readily confused in new environments (No citation needed. Keep your Tesla away from me.).</p>

<p>The only way forward is for machine learning to engage more broadly with other scientists who have been tackling similar issues for centuries. My first proposal is simple: let’s change our terminology to align with the rest of the sciences. The study of distribution shift in machine learning has always been insular and, while machine learning is particularly sensitive, all empirical science must deal with the jump from experiment to reality.</p>

<p>With this in mind, <a href="https://twitter.com/rajiinio">Deb Raji</a> and I have been digging through the scientific literature for a while now hoping to find some answers. In most other parts of science, “robustness to distribution shift” is called external validity. External validity quantifies how well a finding generalizes beyond a specific experiment. For example, a significant result on a particular cohort may not generalize to a broader population.</p>

<p>Predictive algorithms and experimental science both rely on repeatability. “The sun has always risen in the east.” “The apple always falls straight to the ground.” We expect that given the same contexts, the natural world more or less repeats itself. There is unfortunately a big leap from the sun rising in the morning, to an experimental finding in machine learning or biomedicine being reproducible. Why?</p>

<p>The experimental contexts under which predictions and inferences are designed are often far too narrow. The results of a study performed on young male college students in Maine may not help us understand properties of a retirement community in Arizona. These populations are different! However, it may give us insights into other cohorts of male college students: a study at Bates may generalize to Colby or Bowdoin.</p>

<p>Contexts can change in a myriad of ways. Some examples include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The context can just be too narrow in the experiment. Do studies on adults generalize to children? Do studies on medications with only men generalize to women?</li>
  <li>The measured quantity may itself change. It is often easier to measure, detect, and control for exogenous disturbances in a lab setting than in the real world.</li>
  <li>Populations can change over time. For example, medical recommendations from the 1980s may no longer apply to the current population. Recent developments have led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/13/1045746669/task-force-says-most-people-should-not-take-daily-aspirin-to-prevent-a-heart-att">not recommending aspirin to prevent heart attacks</a>.  Machine Learners like to call this <em>covariate shift</em>.</li>
  <li>Even more nefariously, the population can change in response to the intervention. A classic example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s Law</a> which states “Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.”</li>
</ol>

<p>How can we grapple with these external validity challenges? Verifying external validity is daunting and the set of potential solutions remains quite limited. As I mentioned, Deb and I have been chatting about this for a year now, and we’ve now dragged the rest of the group into our investigations. So I’m going to share the blog with Deb for a few posts now, and we’ll both expand on what we’ve been reading and thinking about. In the next few posts, we’ll explore some of the intricacies of when external validity can fail and will also try to spell out some of the research directions that might help bridge the gaps between experiments and reality.</p></div>

Thomas Keller and Heiko Rölke led a team at the University of Applied Sciences in Graubünden, Switzerland, that set a new record for the computation of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> last August. They computed 62.8 trillion digits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" />. The last ten digits they obtained are 7817924264.</p>

Pi Day needs the day to be written American-style as 3/14/22. In international style it would be 31/4/22, but April does not have 31 days. This year involves the numerator of the simplest serviceable approximation to pi: </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cpi+%5Capprox+%5Cfrac%7B22%7D%7B7%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \pi \approx \frac{22}{7} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> is irrational, any finite fraction or number of digits is an approximation. Because <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> is computable—indeed highly efficiently computable in <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/03/15/cooks-class-contains-pi/">senses</a> we have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/07/14/making-an-algorithm-an-algorithm-bbp/">covered</a>—we can adduce that the code for doing so represents <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> exactly. Furthermore, the symbol <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> lends itself to many other calculations that yield exact finite results. </p>
<p>
The digits, however, have their own mystique. We still do not know whether they are <a href="http://pi314.at/math/normal.html">normal</a> in any base, let alone base ten. Speaking as mathematical Platonists, we regard the infinite sequence as a completed, unchanging entity—one for which assertions like “it is normal” have currently-definite truth values. </p>
<p>
This is what events of the past few weeks have prompted Dick and me to question. If our world presently stops existing, 7817924264 will be the last digits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> that we know.</p>

<p></p><h2> Not Just WW III </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I already have a story of impermanent truth rooted in Russia. On my phone I have a free app for the <a href="https://chessok.com/?page_id=27966">Lomonosov Tablebases</a>, which give the perfect result of all chess positions with 7 or fewer pieces. Those tables took years to compile and exist only as 100+ terabytes on a machine at the Lomonosov Moscow State University computer center. </p>
<p>
Sometime over the new year, I noticed that the server stopped working. It was <a href="http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=74046">reportedly</a> the victim of a ransomware attack. Is it meaningful to say that the tables currently exist? Mathematically, yes, and physically likely also yes—assuming the bits were merely blocked and not altered on the storage plates. </p>
<p>
Happily, there is a second 7-piece table called <a href="https://lichess.org/blog/W3WeMyQAACQAdfAL/7-piece-syzygy-tablebases-are-complete">Syzygy</a>, which uses only about 18 terabytes and exists in multiple dowloaded copies. However, this leads us to another question about correctness. The Syzygy computation reproduced some key extremal features of the Lomonosov compilation, such as the position with the longest number of moves needed to win. Not all have been verifiable, because Syzygy counts the time needed to make concrete progress in the form of a capture or pawn advance rather than the time to give checkmate. What I don’t know—and maybe now won’t know—is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Has Syzygy been used to verify every win/draw/loss (WDL) verdict computed by Lomonosov, and vice-versa? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Doing so would require cross-checking many trillions of chess positions. Of course, we should expect that the algorithms used to produce these tables have been verified as completely correct. </p>
<p>
That is worth saying again: The chess algorithms have been verified in themselves. This is not a case of a shock I had before Christmas, when a module in my own chess software threw an error for the first time since I wrote it in 2014, having worked perfectly on over 100 million moves in several million games. The function in question records not only the exact source and destination squares of a move but also the minimum information required by short-form notation systems to disambiguate it from other pieces that could move to the square. There was one game where the players horsed around until one side had 5 queens that could all move to the same square, and that was 1 more than my scheme had presumed possible. My code is thus not-quite correct.</p>
<p>
But even analytical correctness fails in cases of hardware error. A cosmic ray temporarily <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/subatomic-particles-cosmic-rays-computers-change-elections-planes-autopilot-a7584616.html">changed</a> the outcome of an election in Belgium. Fortunately, the systems have cross-checks to catch these events. When the subject is <em>mathematical truths</em>, however, how are we checking? On what basis can we be satisfied by such checks?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Emergence </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Despite our Platonist convictions, as practitioners of mathematics we experience its truths as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">emergent</a>. By “emergent” we mean more than saying theorems are unknown until the point in time where they are clearly proved. <em>Pace</em> our <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/04/21/pnp-proofs/">claimers</a>, P versus NP has not been proved either way, and we live in a world where even those who strongly believe <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%3C+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P &lt; NP}}" class="latex" /> will aver it is unknown. We <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/12/31/make-a-trillion-dollars/">covered</a> this recently.</p>
<p>
Our sense of <em>emergent</em> meets at least the “weak” criterion enunciated <a href="http://consc.net/papers/emergence.pdf">here</a> by David Chalmers, a sense of unexpectedness <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2015/10/29/guessing-conjectures/">that</a> we <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/04/13/even-great-mathematicians-guess-wrong/">have</a> often <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/06/19/guessing-the-truth/">discussed</a> going <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/09/27/surprises-in-mathematics-and-theory/">back</a> to the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/19/we-all-guessed-wrong/">beginning</a> of the blog. </p>
<p>
Chalmers’s strong sense, when applied to mathematics, leads into independence results of the kind effected by Kurt Gödel, this blog’s eponym. We realize that none of our 1,000+ posts has yet attempted a deep appraisal of what these independence results <em>mean</em>. We will not do so now because we are questioning something more basic: Discussion of Gödelian independence is with regard to a truth value that is presumed to exist. What if it doesn’t exist?</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/14/are-these-the-last-digits-of-pi/provemewrong/" rel="attachment wp-att-19741"><img width="277" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ProveMeWrong.jpg?resize=277%2C218&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-19741" height="218" /></a></p>
<p>
We are not just catching the tension of Platonism with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a> and related paths to asking, what is science? We are asking whether reality aligns with the position that we already feel is best for <em>practice</em>. </p>
<p>
“Emergent Mathematics” is a teaching movement that, in the words of one prominent <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23434871">paper</a>, gets away from mathematics courses that “are focused on completed results that often hide the messiness and complication that led to their production.” In trying to explain much data showing that the most experienced mathematicians are not the most accomplished teachers, the paper’s two authors seem to identify the former with the position of putting emphasis on completed results. They seek the best attitude for childhood <em>learning</em> of mathematics, and believe it to be orthogonal to that of presenting finished mathematics.  But going another 90 degrees around the dial, perhaps their compass needle’s other end points to the best philosophical position for <em>creating</em> mathematics.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I think we would all still agree that the next trillion digits of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\pi}" class="latex" /> currently exist. The tougher question is whether it is scientifically meaningful to postulate knowledge of them, without knowing them. We may get an opinion on that from a regular friend late Wednesday into Thursday.</p></font></font></div>

<p>Hi, nerd blog! (This is a post that I wrote a long time ago and then never published. I figured it would be nice to publish it on March 14th.)</p>



<p>Today, we’re interested in the Gaussian integral </p><p style="line-height: 41px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-096cdf537e620c218a57694e9aca2bf4_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="41" width="170" alt="\[f(C) := \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-Cx^2} {\rm d} x\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> for <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-87ddd944257c5bf57009a80226e5c414_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="47" alt="C &gt; 0" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. This integral of course has lots of very serious practical applications, as it arises naturally in the study of the Gaussian/normal distribution. But, more importantly, it’s a lot of fun to play with and is simply beautiful. We’ll see a bit about what it makes it so pretty below. We start by simply trying to figure out the value of this thing, which isn’t super easy.<p></p>



<p>By a change of variables, we immediately see that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-051ceeda9119a5fc9be66053f9dd40a3_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="37" alt="f(C)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> is proportional to <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-94fd71739495e33d6c86fe0b70cdbcf1_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="21" width="46" alt="1/\sqrt{C}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. But, what is the constant of proportionality? It’s actually nicer to ask a slightly different question: what is the unique value of <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f34f74d98915e33f37a086f8cbfb996a_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="14" alt="C" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> such that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a4141e7514a6f611842effecf51c1199_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="70" alt="f(C) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. A quick numerical computation shows that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-24b068172655b4e41a85afb20c734882_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="114" alt="f(3.14159) \approx 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. E.g., here’s some Mathematica code to find this value:<br /><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-27-at-3.25.48-PM.png" style="width: 400px;" height="110" width="1066" alt="" class="wp-image-552" />.</p>



<p>This constant <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-3351e9436eef51bd249c328e212df088_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="97" alt="C \approx 3.14159" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> is so important for this blog post that it is worth giving it a name. So, I looked through the Greek alphabet for a nice letter that doesn’t get used much and chose the obscure lowercase letter <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />—spelled <em>pi</em> in English, and pronounced like “pie”. In other words, by definition <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-64cecd17d70571e9f6e5d0e701cda533_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="67" alt="f(\pi) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. (If this implicit definition bothers you, we can equivalently just define <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fd24a2e8eab1e07787b7429db8502015_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="20" width="80" alt="\pi := f(1)^{2}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. But, I find the implicit definition to be more elegant.)</p>



<p>So, we have this brand new mysterious constant <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. What should we do with it? It is of course natural to try to find different expressions for it (though our integral expression can already be used to compute it to quite high precision). A first idea is to apply the change of variables <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fcb6cf4e246632c794949355411b046b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="62" alt="u = \pi x^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> to obtain </p><p style="line-height: 41px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f10d9cf7ba99c79b8b6410cfbffbcb0d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="41" width="343" alt="\[1 = 2\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x^2}{\rm d} x = \pi^{-1/2} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-u}/u^{1/2} {\rm d} u\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> So, <p style="line-height: 41px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a70346615d75d7bd8aad3e871d66f99c_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="41" width="199" alt="\[\pi =\Big( \int_0^\infty e^{-u}/u^{1/2} {\rm d} u\Big)^2\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> which you might recognize as the square of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamma function</a> evaluated at <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="25" alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, i.e., <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f89e7a589afd5b47baf442a3c38013ee_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="20" width="93" alt="\pi = \Gamma(1/2)^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. (Recalling that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-59278ef14f8421f91a9c38456784aa70_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="118" alt="\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> for integer <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, one might interpret this as saying that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a0df3b7b3c88b80bd1b77220c28fb5ec_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="25" alt="\sqrt{\pi}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> is “the factorial of <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b5205e45813b524be8d323d4b2d0fade_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="39" alt="-1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.”) <p></p>



<p>This mysterious identity will play a key role later. We could, of course, find other identities involving this new constant <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. But, I thought instead I’d jump ahead to a rather obscure fact about the relationship between <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> and a circle.</p>



<h2>Our constant’s relationship with circles</h2>



<p>In my opinion, the Gaussian distribution is far more interesting in dimensions larger than one. In particular, consider the distribution on <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f9868b4451c5811a288f7fdd10be5558_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="21" alt="\mathbb{R}^n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> given by the probability density function </p><p style="line-height: 24px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-cbeee2e0bc6e4a6f5288818cb4aa2a7a_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="24" width="129" alt="\[\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = e^{-\pi \|\mathbf{x}\|^2}\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> Notice that <p style="line-height: 41px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8c88f8ef8350b5bf5e3924147dbed5de_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="41" width="457" alt="\[\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}e^{-\pi \|\mathbf{x}\|^2} {\rm d} \mathbf{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \cdots \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-\pi x_1^2 -\cdots - \pi x_n^2} {\rm d}x_1 \ldots {\rm d} x_n = 1\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> so that this is in fact a distribution. <p></p>



<p>In fact, up to scaling, this distribution is the <em>unique</em> continuous radial product distribution—i.e., the unique distribution such that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-17a91f072153c1ba54d02a280dccc979_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="18" width="38" alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}]" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> can be written both as a function only of the norm of <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-bcda923e732ff6e429d93d0fa7ea8a47_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="\mathbf{x}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-2c1674e9adcb304d86d51e6e3e89bd93_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="124" alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = f^*(\|\mathbf{x}\|)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> for some continuous function <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d1bc0c1e9f63254ef68d09d8ea3e316d_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="16" width="17" alt="f^*" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, <em>and</em> as a product of functions of its coordinates, <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-724a32e8712eb42c68f40510a4461d33_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="188" alt="\Pr[\mathbf{x}] = f_1(x_1)\cdots f_n(x_n)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. This makes the Gaussian a uniquely powerful tool for reducing complicated multi-dimensional problems to one-dimensional problems. </p>



<p>For example, suppose that for some strange reason we wish to know the circumference of a circle with radius one. (If we were less civilized mathematicians, we might instead set the diameter to be equal to <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-4868771cbc422b5818f85500909ce433_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="13" width="7" alt="1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, so that the radius would be <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-872abde626b8cdf8e983a3345ee98925_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="25" alt="1/2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.) We can try to write this as some kind of path integral or something—and suffer quite a bit in the process—or we can use the following beautiful trick.

<p>So, surprisingly, our mysterious constant <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-26d6788550ffd50fe94542bb3e8ee615_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> is actually intimately related with the circumference of a circle.

<h2>What’s so special about two dimensions? Surface area of n-spheres.</h2>



<p>But, why stop in dimension <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e584dd0bab4e6c8efc164939c28db757_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="8" alt="2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />? This same <em>one neat trick</em> is just as useful in higher dimensions. E.g., what is the surface area <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-e14b74f2c92c5d34a31da4576bfaecc9_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="24" width="46" alt="\sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> of a unit sphere in <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> dimensions?

Well, we have </p><p style="line-height: 41px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-f260e2a2d6410051fb74cc87df3c7792_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="41" width="531" alt="\[1 = \int_{-\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-\pi \|x\|^2} {\rm d} x = \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} \sigma^{(n-1)}_r {\rm d} r= \sigma^{(n-1)}_1 \int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r\; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> (Again, the only property that I have used here is that <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b61ebafad59fad72671514841700ebab_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="24" width="153" alt="\sigma_r^{(n-1)} = r^{n-1} \sigma_1^{(n-1)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.) This integral is a bit less pretty, but using the same approach, we see that  <p style="line-height: 42px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-65c828363c086f1b820b730be79a4c39_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="42" width="437" alt="\[\int_0^\infty e^{-\pi r^2} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r = \frac{1}{2\pi^{n/2}} \cdot \int_0^{\infty} e^{-u} u^{n/2-1} {\rm d} u = \frac{\Gamma(n/2)}{2\pi^{n/2}}\; ,\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> where the last step is literally just plugging in the definition of the Gamma function. Rearranging, we see that the surface area of the unit sphere in <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> dimensions is exactly <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-50d143fa8519caff967068ce2d9de43f_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="30" width="42" alt="\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.<p></p>



<p>If the Gamma function intimidates you, that’s fine. (It certainly intimidates me.) We can go a bit further by remembering that for integers <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-6b41df788161942c6f98604d37de8098_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="15" alt="m" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-d226e3a5659b079c31cbf51beb7d6f69_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="128" alt="\Gamma(m) = (m-1)!" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, while <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5d2b39f9e1062dcc5fa00ec58d82eb91_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="246" alt="\Gamma(m+1/2) = \sqrt{\pi}(2m)!/(4^m m!)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. (Both of these identities follow from the relation <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-fb2599738079fdbd25e5b92aa6f75617_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="178" alt="\Gamma(x) = (x-1) \Gamma(x-1)" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, which follows from integration by parts, together with the values <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-53c41acb4ea9695fbe3fbed4d494e73a_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="65" alt="\Gamma(1) = 1" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> and <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-119c76244632be47b3cddb44bcce032b_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="19" width="101" alt="\Gamma(1/2) = \sqrt{\pi}" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.) </p>



<p>Then, we see that the surface area of the unit sphere in <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> dimensions is </p><p style="line-height: 55px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7093395acfb9701717087f97c5b73145_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="55" width="318" alt="\[\sigma_1^{(n-1)} = \begin{cases}\pi^{n/2} \cdot \frac{2}{(n/2-1)!} &amp;n\text{ even}\\\pi^{(n-1)/2} \cdot \frac{2^n \cdot ((n-1)/2)!}{(n-1)!} &amp;n\text{ odd}.\end{cases}\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p> In particular, from this formula, we immediately see the perhaps surprising fact that the surface area of the sphere in <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> dimensions rapidly approaches <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a5e437be25f29374d30f66cd46adf81c_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="9" alt="0" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> as <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-032ad3d6327a419ab33b269b23c31b7c_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="10" width="55" alt="n \to \infty" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.

<p>We can also plug in low values of <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> to see what we get. E.g., I have heard that some people are interested in the case when <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a47a3377f14fefc160d10b089a4aab45_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="42" alt="n = 2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> and <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-8eda9fc1983d40517cca42fa671a0f51_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="43" alt="n = 3" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. Plugging in, one sees that the circumference of a circle with radius one is <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5bfa2124624f767670227d1aeab8d85c_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="20" alt="2\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" /> (which, ok, we already saw before), and that the surface area of a sphere with radius one is <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-a64f86508ea52835b7fd42736282275d_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="12" width="20" alt="4\pi" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />. But, we can easily go farther: the surface area in four dimensions is <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-7249ec3f5fb52ad8207e0f9d873c7a4f_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="15" width="27" alt="2\pi^2" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />, and in five dimensions, it is <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-5b263bf1209b153f5824b853138f0510_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="20" width="45" alt="8\pi^{2}/3" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />.</p>



<p>And, we can of course find the volume of the unit <img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-b170995d512c659d8668b4e42e1fef6b_l3.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="8" width="11" alt="n" class="ql-img-inline-formula quicklatex-auto-format" />-ball by computing a simple integral </p><p style="line-height: 44px;" class="ql-center-displayed-equation"><span class="ql-right-eqno">   </span><span class="ql-left-eqno">   </span><img src="http://www.solipsistslog.com/wp-content/ql-cache/quicklatex.com-08b8932dcb424209e24a111106e869b2_l3.png" title="Rendered by QuickLaTeX.com" height="44" width="366" alt="\[V^{(n)} = \int_0^{1}\sigma_r^{(n)} {\rm} d r = \sigma_1^{(n)} \cdot \int_0^{1} r^{n-1} {\rm d} r = \sigma_1^{(n)}/n \; .\]" class="ql-img-displayed-equation quicklatex-auto-format" /></p><p></p>

We prove that for every 3-player (3-prover) game, with binary questions and answers and value less than $1$, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to $0$. That is, for every such game, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is at most $n^{-c}$.

Along the way to proving this theorem, we prove two additional parallel repetition theorems for multiplayer (multiprover) games, that may be of independent interest:

$\textbf{Playerwise Connected Games (with any number of players and any Alphabet size):}$ We identify a large class of multiplayer games and prove that for every game with value less than $1$ in that class, the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game decays polynomially fast to $0$.

More precisely, our result applies for $\textit{playerwise connected games}$, with any number of players and any alphabet size:
For each player $i$, we define the graph $G_i$, whose vertices are the possible questions for that player and two questions $x,x'$ are connected by an edge if there exists a vector $y$ of questions for all other players, such that both $(x,y)$ and $(x',y)$ are asked by the referee with non-zero probability. We say that the game is $\textit{playerwise connected}$ if for every $i$, the graph $G_i$ is connected.

Our class of playerwise connected games is strictly larger than the class of connected games that was defined in [DHVY17] and for which exponentially fast decay bounds are known [DHVY17]. For playerwise connected games that are not connected, only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96].

$\textbf{Exponential Bounds for the Anti-Correlation Game:}$ In the 3-player $\textit{anti-correlation game}$, two out of three players are given $1$ as input, and the remaining player is given $0$. The two players who were given $1$ must produce different outputs in $\{0,1\}$. We prove that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of that game decays exponentially fast to $0$. That is, there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that the value of the $n$-fold parallel repetition of the game is at most $2^{-cn}$. Only inverse Ackermann decay bounds were previously known [Ver96].

The 3-player anti-correlation game was studied and motivated in several previous works. In particular, Holmgren and Yang gave it as an example for a 3-player game whose non-signaling value (is smaller than $1$ and yet) does not decrease at all under parallel repetition [HY19].</div>

<p>As members of the TCS community will most likely know, FOCS established<a href="https://focs2021.cs.colorado.edu/test-of-time-awards/" target="_blank"> Test-of-Time Awards from its 2021 edition</a> to celebrate contributions published at that conference 30, 20 and 10 years before. The first list of selected winners is, as one might have expected, stellar: <br /></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li>Uriel Feige, Shafi Goldwasser, László Lovász, Shmuel Safra, Mario Szegedy:<br />Approximating Clique is Almost NP-Complete.<br />FOCS 1991</li><li>David Zuckerman:<br />Simulating BPP Using a General Weak Random Source.<br />FOCS 1991</li><li>Serge A.

Awards are a scarce resource! My goal with this post is simply to remind our community (and especially its younger members) of a seminal contribution that they might want to read or re-read. <br /></p><p>The paper in question is "<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6860/2019sp/Handouts/EmersonJutla91.pdf" target="_blank">Tree automata, mu-calculus and determinacy</a>" by <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~emerson/" target="_blank">Allen Emerson</a> and <a href="https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-csjutla" target="_blank">Charanjit S. Jutla</a>, which appeared at FOCS 1991. (Emerson shared the 2007 A.M. Turing Award for the invention of model checking and Jutla went on to doing path-breaking work in cryptography.) That paper is absolutely fundamental for the mu-calculus, but also for automata theory, and verification in general. It introduced many ideas and results that became the basis for extensive research. </p><p>As a first contribution, the article introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game" target="_blank">parity games</a> and proved their fundamental properties. The parity condition was a missing link in automata theory on infinite objects. It made the whole theory much simpler than that proposed in earlier work.  Technically, the parity condition is both universal and positional. Universal means that tree automata with parity conditions are as expressive as those with Rabin or Muller conditions. Positional means that in the acceptance game if a player has a winning strategy then she has one depending only on the current position and not on the history of the play so far. This is a huge technical advance for all automata-theoretic constructions and for the analysis of  infinite-duration games. It allows one, for instance,  to avoid the complicated arguments of Gurevich and Harlington in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/800070.802177" target="_blank">their seminal STOC 1982 article</a>, which were already a huge simplification of <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1969-141-00/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1/S0002-9947-1969-0246760-1.pdf" target="_blank">Rabin's original argument from 1969</a> proving the decidability of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadic_second-order_logic#Decidability_and_complexity_of_satisfiability" target="_blank">monadic second-order theory of the infinite binary tree</a> and much more. In passing, let me remark that Rabin has gone on record saying that "I consider this to be the most difficult research I have ever done." See <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69370-an-interview-with-michael-rabin/fulltext" target="_blank">this interview</a> in CACM. </p><p>The second main contribution of that paper is the discovery of the relation between parity games and the mu-calculus. The authors show how a mu-calculus model-checking problem can be reduced to solving a parity game, and conversely, how the set of winning positions in a parity game can be described by a mu-calculus formula. This result is the birth of the "model-checking via games" approach. It also shows that establishing a winner in parity games is contained both in NP and in co-NP. As a corollary, the model-checking problem is as complex as solving games. It is still not known if the problem is in PTIME. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3055399.3055409" target="_blank">recent advance from STOC'17</a> gives a quasi-polynomial-time algorithm. (See <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/03/parity-games-in-quasipolynomial-time.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for a discussion of that result, which received the STOC 2017 best paper award and was immediately followed up by a flurry of related papers.) </p><p>Finally, the paper also shows how to prove Rabin's complementation lemma, which is the most difficult step in his celebrated aforementioned decidability result, with the help of parity conditions. The proof is radically simpler than previous approaches. The paper puts this contribution most prominently, but actually the conceptual and technical contributions presented later in the paper turned out to be most important for the community. </p><p>Overall, the above-mentioned paper by Emerson and Jutla is a truly seminal contribution that has stood the test of time, has sown the seeds for much research  over the last thirty years (as partly witnessed by the over 1,130 citations it has received so far) and is still stimulating advances at the cutting edge of theoretical computer science that bridge the Volume A-Volume B divide. </p><p>I encourage everyone to read it!</p><p><b>Acknowledgement:</b> I have learnt much of the content of this post from Igor Walukiewicz. The responsibility for any infelicity is mine alone. <br /></p></div>
