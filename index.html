<span style="font-weight: normal;"><i>Guest Blog by John Tromp (Thanks for the opportunity, Lance)</i></span><br />
<br />
In the past few months, cycle finding has become one of the most widely run
graph theory problems. An estimated quarter-to-half million GPUs are constantly
looking for 42-cycles in random bipartite graphs on a billion or more nodes.
Customized chips have been designed to perform this specific application an
order of magnitude more efficiently, thanks to integrating as much as 1GB of
SRAM on a single chip, where Intel/AMD CPUs top out at 64 MB.

<br />
<br />
The purpose of all this? To compete for block rewards in various
cryptocurrencies using the <a href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo">Cuckoo Cycle Proof of Work</a>.


<br />
<br />
It is named after the Cuckoo Hashtable, in which each data item can be stored
at two possible locations, one in each of two arrays.  A hash function maps the
pair of item and choice of array to its location in that array. When a newly
stored item finds both its locations already occupied, one is kicked out and
replaced by the new item. This forces the kicked-out item to move to its
alternate location, possibly kicking out yet another item. Problems arise
if the corresponding Cuckoo graph, a bipartite graph with array locations as
nodes and item location pairs as edges, has cycles.
While n items, whose edges form a cycle, could barely be stored in the table,
any n+1st item mapping within the same set of locations (a chord in the cycle)
would not fit, as the pigeonhole principle tells us.

<br />
In the Proof-of-Work problem, we typically set n ≥ 29, and use edge indices
(items) 0 .. N-1, where N = 2<sup>n</sup>.  The endpoints of edge i are (siphash(i|0) % N, siphash(i|1) % N), with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">siphash</a> being a popular keyed hash function.
A solution is a cycle of length L in this Cuckoo graph, where typically L = 42.<br />
<br />
While looking for cycles takes a lot of time and memory, solutions can be instantly verified.
This sets Cuckoo Cycle apart from many other memory hard proofs of work that require computing a memory hard hash function, such as scrypt,
both for proving and verifying.

Some luck is also required to find a 42-cycle;
Slides 18 and 19 of this <a href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/blob/master/presentations/grinconUS0/12-Tromp-Proof_of_Work.pdf">Grincon.US presentation</a> sketch a proof of the
<br />
<br />
<b>Cuckoo Cycle Theorem</b>:
The expected number of L-cycles tends to 1/L

<br />
<br />
While there is a known linear time-memory trade-off, it suffers from a large constant factor penalty.
A large bounty is offered on the project webpage for better trade-offs.

<br />
<br />
Cuckoo Cycle solvers spend nearly all cycles on edge trimming; identifying and
removing edges that end in a leaf node (of degree 1), as such edges cannot be
part of a cycle. Trimming rounds alternate between the two node
partitions. This can be done using N bits for the edge bitmap, and N log<sub>2</sub>(3) bits
for the (truncated) node degrees. The random accesses to the latter,
while not a problem for custom chips using enough SRAM, cause large memory latencies
on commodity hardware. These can be mostly avoided by storing remaining edges explicitly
and (bucket) sorting them to determine node degrees.
Despite using an order of magnitude more memory than the edge bitmap, this is still over 4x faster.<br />
<br />
The fraction f<sub>i</sub> of remaining edges after i trimming rounds (in the limit as N
goes to infinity) appears to obey the
<br />
<div style="text-align: center;">
<b>Cuckoo Cycle Conjecture:</b>
f<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i-1</sub> * a<sub>i</sub>, where a<sub>-1</sub> = a<sub>0</sub> = 1, and a<sub>i+1</sub> = 1 - e<sup>-a<sub>i</sub></sup></div>
f<sub>i</sub> could equivalently be defined as the fraction of edges whose first endpoint is the middle of a (not necessarily simple) path of length 2i.<br />
<br />
So far I have only been able to prove the conjecture for i ≤ 3.
For instance, for i = 1, the probability that an edge endpoint is not the endpoint
of any other edge is (1-1/N)<sup>N-1</sup> ~ 1/e.

Here's hoping someone finds an elegant proof...</div>

case of telecommunication networks (SONET rings) which gained attention from
practitioners and theorists alike. Given an undirected cycle on $n$ nodes
together with non-negative demands between any pair of nodes, the Ring Loading
Problem asks for an unsplittable routing of the demands such that the maximum
cumulated demand on any edge is minimized. Let $L$ be the value of such a
solution. In the relaxed version of the problem, each demand can be split into
two parts where the first part is routed clockwise while the second part is
routed counter-clockwise. Denote with $L^*$ the maximum load of a minimum split
routing solution. In a landmark paper, Schrijver, Seymour and Winkler [SSW98]
showed that $L \leq L^* + 1.5D$, where $D$ is the maximum demand value. They
also found (implicitly) an instance of the Ring Loading Problem with $L = L^* +
1.01D$. Recently, Skutella [Sku16] improved these bounds by showing that $L
\leq L^* + \frac{19}{14}D$, and there exists an instance with $L = L^* + 1.1D$.
We contribute to this line of research by showing that $L \leq L^* + 1.3D$. We
also take a first step towards lower and upper bounds for small instances.

large-scale nearest neighbor search tasks since the source codes were released
two years ago. The attractiveness of this approach lies in its superior
performance over most of the nearest neighbor search approaches as well as its
genericness to various distance measures. In this paper, several comparative
studies have been conducted on this search approach. The role of hierarchical
structure in HNSW and the function of HNSW graph itself are investigated. We
find that the hierarchical structure in HNSW could not achieve "a much better
logarithmic complexity scaling" as it was claimed in the paper, particularly on
high dimensional data. Moreover, we find that similar high search speed
efficiency as HNSW could be achieved with the support of flat k-NN graph after
graph diversification. Finally, we point out the difficulty, faced by most of
the graph based search approaches, is directly linked to "curse of
dimensionality". HNSW, like other graph based approaches, is unable to address
such difficulty.

($k$-NNS) over the Euclidean distance in the semi-honest model. Our
implementation is able to handle massive datasets efficiently. On the
algorithmic front, we show a new circuit for the approximate top-$k$ selection
from $n$ numbers that is built from merely $O(n + \mathrm{poly}(k))$
comparators. Using this circuit as a subroutine, we design new approximate
$k$-NNS algorithms and two corresponding secure protocols: 1) optimized linear
scan; 2) clustering-based sublinear time algorithm.
</p>
<p>Our secure protocols utilize a combination of additively-homomorphic
encryption, garbled circuit and Oblivious RAM. Along the way, we introduce
various optimizations to these primitives, which drastically improve concrete
efficiency.
</p>
<p>We evaluate the new protocols empirically and show that they are able to
handle datasets that are significantly larger than in the prior work. For
instance, running on two standard Azure instances within the same availability
zone, for a dataset of $96$-dimensional descriptors of $10\,000\,000$ images,
we can find $10$ nearest neighbors with average accuracy $0.9$ in under $10$
seconds improving upon prior work by at least two orders of magnitude.

computer science. Its worst-case hardness lies at the core of computational
complexity theory, for example in the form of NP-hardness and the (Strong)
Exponential Time Hypothesis. In practice however, SAT instances can often be
solved efficiently. This contradicting behavior has spawned interest in the
average-case analysis of SAT and has triggered the development of sophisticated
rigorous and non-rigorous techniques for analyzing random structures.
</p>
<p>Despite a long line of research and substantial progress, most theoretical
work on random SAT assumes a uniform distribution on the variables. In
contrast, real-world instances often exhibit large fluctuations in variable
occurrence. This can be modeled by a non-uniform distribution of the variables,
which can result in distributions closer to industrial SAT instances.
</p>
<p>We study satisfiability thresholds of non-uniform random $2$-SAT with $n$
variables and $m$ clauses and with an arbitrary probability distribution
$(p_i)_{i\in[n]}$ with $p_1 \ge p_2 \ge \ldots \ge p_n &gt; 0$ over the n
variables. We show for $p_1^2=\Theta(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)$ that the asymptotic
satisfiability threshold is at $m=\Theta( (1-\sum_{i=1}^n
p_i^2)/(p_1\cdot(\sum_{i=2}^n p_i^2)^{1/2}) )$ and that it is coarse. For
$p_1^2=o(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)$ we show that there is a sharp satisfiability
threshold at $m=(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2)^{-1}$. This result generalizes the seminal
works by Chvatal and Reed [FOCS 1992] and by Goerdt [JCSS 1996].

<p><b>Authors: </b>Valery Shchesnovich <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02013">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>The classical complexity of sampling from the probability distribution of
quantum interference of $N$ indistinguishable single bosons on unitary network
with $M$ input and output ports is studied with the focus on how boson density
$\rho =\frac{N}{M}$ for $M\ge N$ affects the number of computations required to
produce a single sample. Glynn's formula is modified for computation of
probabilities of output configurations $\mathbf{m}=(m_1,\ldots,m_n,0,\ldots,0)$
with $n&lt;N$ output ports occupied by bosons, requiring only
$\mathcal{C}_\mathbf{m}\equiv O\Bigl(N\frac{\prod_{l=1}^n
(m_l+1)}{\mathrm{min}(m_l+1)}\Bigr)$ computations. It is found that in a
unitary network chosen according to the Haar probability measure the tails of
the distribution of the total number $n$ of output ports occupied by bosons are
bounded by those of a binomial distribution. This fact allows to prove that for
any $\epsilon&gt;0$ with probability $1-\epsilon$ the number of computations in
the classical sampling algorithm of P. Clifford and R. Clifford scales as at
least $O\bigl( N 2^{\frac{1-\delta}{1+\rho}N}\bigr)$ and at most
$O\Bigl(N\left(1+r\right)^{\frac{N}{r}}\Bigr)$, where $\delta =
\sqrt{\frac{4(1+\rho)}{N}\ln\left(\frac{2}{\epsilon}\right)}$ and $r =
\mathrm{max}\left(1,\frac{1+\rho}{1+\delta}\right)$.

individuals, algorithmic discrimination is becoming a prominent concern. The
seminal work of Dwork et al. [ITCS 2012] introduced the notion of individual
fairness (IF): given a task-specific similarity metric, every pair of similar
individuals should receive similar outcomes. In this work, we study fairness
when individuals have diverse preferences over the possible outcomes. We show
that in such settings, individual fairness can be too restrictive: requiring
individual fairness can lead to less-preferred outcomes for the very
individuals that IF aims to protect (e.g. a protected minority group).
</p>
<p>We introduce and study a new notion of preference-informed individual
fairness (PIIF), a relaxation of individual fairness that allows for outcomes
that deviate from IF, provided the deviations are in line with individuals'
preferences. We show that PIIF can allow for solutions that are considerably
more beneficial to individuals than the best IF solution. We further show how
to efficiently optimize any convex objective over the outcomes subject to PIIF,
for a rich class of individual preferences.
</p>
<p>Motivated by fairness concerns in targeted advertising, we apply this new
fairness notion to the multiple-task setting introduced by Dwork and Ilvento
[ITCS 2019]. We show that, in this setting too, PIIF can allow for considerably
more beneficial solutions, and we extend our efficient optimization algorithm
to this setting.

for supervised graph classification. The algorithm iteratively partitions the
set of $k$-tuples, defined over the set of vertices of a graph, by considering
neighboring $k$-tuples. Here, we propose a \new{local} variant which considers
a subset of the original neighborhood in each iteration step. The cardinality
of this local neighborhood, unlike the original one, only depends on the
sparsity of the graph. Surprisingly, we show that the local variant has at
least the same power as the original algorithm in terms of distinguishing
non-isomorphic graphs. In order to demonstrate the practical utility of our
local variant, we apply it to supervised graph classification. Our experimental
study shows that our local algorithm leads to improved running times and
classification accuracies on established benchmark datasets.

The article investigates the relation between three well-known hypotheses.   
1) Hunion:   the union of disjoint complete sets for NP is complete for NP
2) Hopps:    there exist optimal propositional proof systems
3) Hcpair:   there exist complete disjoint NP-pairs

The following results are obtained:
a) The hypotheses are pairwise independent under relativizable proofs, except for the known implication Hopps \Rightarrow Hcpair.
b)Answers to questions by Pudlák in terms of an oracle relative to which  \neg Hcpair,  \neg Hopps, UP has many-one-complete sets, but NP \cap coNP has no many-one-complete sets.
c) The converse of Koebler, Messner, and Toran's implication NEE \cap TALLY \subseteq coNEE \Rightarrow Hopps fails relative to an oracle, where NEE := NTIME(2^{O(2^n)}).
d) New characterizations of Hunion and two variants in terms of coNP-completeness and P-producibility of the set of hard formulas of propositional proof systems.</div>

<p>Congratulations to the Knuth prize committee chaired by Avrim Blum for the excellent choice of <a href="http://www.sigact.org/prizes/knuth.html">awarding the 2019 Knuth prize to Avi Wigderson</a>.</p>
<p>Avi has worked on all aspects of computational complexity theory, and he has had a transformative influence on the way theoretical computer science relates to pure mathematics. I will not repeat what I wrote about his work on the occasion of his 60th birthday <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2016/10/04/avi60/">here</a> and <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/avi60-zero-knowledge-for-all-np/">here</a>. Long-term readers of <i>in theory</i> will remember that I consider him as one of the <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/on-paul-erdos-and-kim-kardashian/">saints of computational complexity</a>.</p>
<p>The organizers of the coming FOCS would like me to remind you that the deadline is this Friday, and that someone, for some reason, has set up a fake submission site (on the domain aconf dot org) but the true submission site (that, to be honest, looks less legit than the fake one) is at <a href="https://focs19.cs.utexas.edu/">focs19.cs.utexas.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the deadline to submit nominations for the inaugural FOCS test of time award is in three weeks. There will be three awards, one for papers appeared in FOCS 1985-89, one for FOCS 1995-99 and one for FOCS 2005-09.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, GMW appeared in FOCS 1986 and the Nisan-Wigderson “Hardness versus randomness” paper appeared in FOCS 1988.</p></div>

<div class="content">
Parallel repetition is known to reduce the soundness error of some special cases of interactive arguments:  three-message protocols and public-coin protocols. However, it does not do so in the general case.

Haitner [FOCS '09, SiCOMP '13] presented a simple method for transforming any interactive argument $\pi$ into a slightly modified protocol $\widetilde{\pi}$, which he named the random terminating variant of $\pi$, such that the parallel repetition of $\widetilde{\pi}$ does reduce the soundness error at a weak exponential rate. More precisely, if $\pi$ has $m$ rounds and soundness error $(1-\epsilon)$, then Haitner proved that $\widetilde{\pi}^k$, the $k$-parallel repetition of $\widetilde{\pi}$, has soundness error $(1-\epsilon)^{\epsilon k / m^4}$.

We emphasize that parallel repetition of the random-terminating variant of a protocol is the only unconditional round-preserving hardness amplification technique we have for arbitrary interactive arguments. Since the security of many cryptographic protocols (e.g., binding) depends on the soundness of a related interactive argument, improving the analysis of Haitner is a key challenge in the study of cryptographic protocols.

In this work we introduce a different analysis for Haitner's method, proving that parallel repetition of random terminating protocols reduces the soundness error at a much stronger exponential rate: the soundness error of $\widetilde{\pi}^k$ is $(1-\epsilon)^{k / m}$, only an $m$ factor from the optimal rate of $(1-\epsilon)^k$, achievable in public-coin and three-message protocols.  We prove the tightness of our analysis by presenting a matching protocol.</div>

We reprove the results on the hardness of approximating hypergraph coloring using a different technique based on bounds on the size of extremal $t$-agreeing families of $[q]^n$.  Specifically, using theorems of Frankl-Tokushige [FT99], Ahlswede-Khachatrian [AK98] and Frankl [F76] on the size of such families, we give simple and unified proofs of quasi NP-hardness of the following problems:

$\bullet$ coloring a $3$ colorable $4$-uniform hypergraph with $(\log n)^\delta$ many colors
$\bullet$ coloring a $3$ colorable $3$-uniform hypergraph with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ many colors
$\bullet$ coloring a $2$ colorable $6$-uniform hypergraph with $(\log n)^\delta$ many colors
$\bullet$ coloring a $2$ colorable $4$-uniform hypergraph with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\log \log n})$ many colors

where $n$ is the number of vertices of the hypergraph and $\delta&gt;0$ is a universal constant.</div>

We study the problem of constructing explicit families of matrices which cannot be expressed  as a product of a few sparse matrices. In addition to being a natural mathematical question on its own, this problem appears in various incarnations in computer science; the most significant being in the context of lower bounds for algebraic circuits which compute linear transformations,  matrix rigidity and  data structure lower bounds.

We first show, for every constant $d$, a deterministic construction in subexponential time of a family $\{M_n\}$ of $n \times n$ matrices which cannot be expressed as a product $M_n = A_1 \cdots A_d$ where the total sparsity of $A_1,\ldots,A_d$ is less than $n^{1+1/(2d)}$. In other words, any depth-$d$ linear circuit computing the linear transformation $M_n\cdot \mathbf{x}$ has size at least $n^{1+\Omega(1/d)}$. This improves upon the prior best lower bounds for this problem, which are barely super-linear, and were obtained by a long line of research based on the study of  super-concentrators (albeit at the cost of a blow up in the time required to construct these matrices). 

We then outline an approach for proving improved lower bounds through a certain derandomization problem, and use this approach to prove asymptotically optimal quadratic lower bounds for natural special cases, which generalize many of the common matrix decompositions.</div>

I have a grant with some brain scientists on the following exciting approach to P vs NP.<br />
<br />
We want to prove:<br />
<br />
                               There is no algorithm for SAT in P<br />
<br />
This seems hard.  So lets scale down our goals to:<br />
<br />
                              Lance cannot find an algorithm for SAT in P<br />
<br />
You can replace Lance with someone else, but Lance has volunteered to have brain scans done. The idea is to scan the P vs NP part of his brain and see what we can discern.<br />
<br />
I know what you are thinking. Lance truly believes that SAT is NOT in P so perhaps even if SAT is in P, he would have a mental block. Hence I am hoping to also get some serious theorists that think SAT is in P to participate.  This might also shed light on the following conjecture:  is it easier to prove a theorem if you believe it is true.<br />
<br />
Lance has proposed another line of research. Barriers. Try to establish<br />
<br />
                             Lance cannot prove that SAT is NOT in P<br />
<br />
using brain scans and he volunteered.<br />
<br />

<tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w0aJgcjWXp0/XI-8jhzGnlI/AAAAAAABmv4/xmXbmb5HDy4zahASbPwc-RjOqeRjLD0DgCLcBGAs/s1600/mribrain.jpg"><img width="259" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-w0aJgcjWXp0/XI-8jhzGnlI/AAAAAAABmv4/xmXbmb5HDy4zahASbPwc-RjOqeRjLD0DgCLcBGAs/s320/mribrain.jpg" border="0" height="320" /></a></td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: center;" class="tr-caption">Brain Scan of Lance's Proving Ability</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br />
For this one the mental block problem is gone; however,   as you can clearly see from his brain scan, Lance will never prove that SAT is not in P. Seven years as department chair has caused irreversible damage to his ability to reason logically.<br />
<br />
We hope to recruit other theorists to the project. The sticking point might be privacy: if we prove that professor X cannot solve P vs NP will the affect their being hired? For this reason we will restrict the study to professors with Tenure. But this is a weakness of the study since we had wanted to study if younger people have a better chance to resolve P vs NP.  So we need to find very young tenured professors.<br />
<br />
After we get the technology working on Theorists and P vs NP we will try to expand it for home use. For example, if a spouse claims <i>I could never learn to cook </i>or <i>I could never learn to drive (that's me) </i>their partner  will be able to verify the statement. It is not clear if this will make the divorce rate go up or down. Or if a child says <i>I just can't do algebra</i> the parents can test the child and say <i>Oh yes you can</i>!</div>

Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and maximum degree $d$. Fix some minor-closed property $\mathcal{P}$ (such as planarity).
We say that $G$ is $\varepsilon$-far from $\mathcal{P}$ if one has to remove $\varepsilon dn$ edges to make it have $\mathcal{P}$.
The problem of property testing $\mathcal{P}$ was introduced in the seminal work of Benjamini-Schramm-Shapira (STOC 2008)
that gave a tester with query complexity triply exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$.
Levi-Ron (TALG 2015) have given the best tester to date, with a quasipolynomial (in $\varepsilon^{-1}$) query complexity.
It is an open problem to get property testers whose query complexity is $\poly(d\varepsilon^{-1})$,
even for planarity.

In this paper, we resolve this open question. For any minor-closed property,
we give a tester with query complexity $d\cdot \poly(\varepsilon^{-1})$.
The previous line of work on (independent of $n$, two-sided) testers is primarily combinatorial.
Our work, on the other hand, employs techniques from spectral graph theory. This paper
is a continuation of recent work of the authors (FOCS 2018) analyzing random walk algorithms
that find forbidden minors.</div>

Faadosly Polir has had an incredible year of research success. A year ago we <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/04/01/the-entropy-of-baseball/">covered</a> his research on universal information entropy in baseball. This led to uncredited co-authorship on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05561">paper</a>, which <em>Quanta</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-scarring-appears-to-defy-universes-push-for-disorder-20190320/">covered</a> last week, about reversal of entropy in a previously-built 51-qubit quantum <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24622">computer</a>. The paper focuses on quantum many-body scarring in a Bunimovich <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/visualinsight/2016/11/15/bunimovich-stadium/">stadium</a>, but Polir’s work on athletic body scarring in baseball stadiums was integral. </p>
<p>
Today we report on his exciting and topical new findings.</p>
<p>
Polir’s next project implemented a <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-random-events-of-quantum-physics-influence-the-information-content-of-the-universe">suggestion</a> by the complexity theorist Vaughan Pratt on how to research the influence of random events on the information content of the universe:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Picture inserting a giant eggbeater into the deep state cloud servers and relocating all its bits at random. How would you recover important information like the net worth of Meghan Markle or President Trump’s tax returns? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Polir began the Cloud Beater Project using spare Amazon Web Services credits from Ken. The results so far are classified, but in addition to the above objectives there is a current push to infer from web traffic the full text of the impending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017-2019)">report</a> by Robert Mueller. The string length has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/mueller-report-length.html">inferred</a>. Polir’s model algebraically represents the entire cloud as a finite automaton analogous to Alan Turing’s model of the Enigma machine during World War II. The inferencing process is similar and <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/technology/businessinsider/article/With-just-60-and-internet-access-researchers-13628061.php">cheap</a>. </p>
<p>
The newest work, however, will have the greatest social impact for the research community.</p>

The problem is one we all are familiar with: the impact of the Internet and computing technology resources on critical thinking and academic research <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/is-technology-hurting-productivity">productivity</a>. After extensive analysis-of-variance runs on Google Scholar data, Polir’s team isolated one key adverse factor:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> <i>LaTeX forces one to compile and recompile multiple times</i>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In retrospect the effect of this should have been suspected—after all, LaTeX is the one factor common to a major part of research across all scientific disciplines. Here are examples of relevant user <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/107967/need-to-typeset-twice-for-correct-compile">comments</a>, some paraphrased:</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> You cannot avoid it. LaTeX has to build the .aux file to store the table of contents (ToC) and such, because when typesetting the ToC it cannot know beforehand what sections will occur. </p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> Often not only two but three or more runs are necessary. Imagine a document with lots of figures and a list of figures somewhere at the first pages of the document. All pages are numbered using ascending Arabic numbers. First compilation run will typeset the document without any entry at the list of figures but collects the information at the .lof file (via .aux file). Second compilation run will typeset the list of figures with several pages and as a consequence of this the page numbers of all figures will change. So you need a third run to get the correct numbers at the list of figures.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbullet%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\bullet}" class="latex" title="{\bullet}" /> To correctly line up the various parts of a longtable, “In the typical case the algorithm will converge after three or four passes” (manual, section 4).</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Magnitude </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The result is the observation that there now are so many uses of LaTeX that any inefficiency in using it has great consequences. The bottom line of the first findings chapter in the report led by Polir is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We found that over 100 million hours of productive time per year are lost to the multiple-pass issue in LaTeX. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
There are now billions of LaTeX pages being worked on each year. See <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/blog/219-youve-created-three-million-projects-and-counting-dot-dot-dot">this</a> for some data. Thus at a conservative estimate of $100 dollars per hour this means that we are losing <i>over ten billion dollars per year</i>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ken’s Solution </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken has a way of coping. He spends the time waiting for LaTeX documents to open and compile on his office PC in a productive way. He used to check fantasy baseball or football player news during these waits. But last year he acquired a Facebook friend (FBF) from the chess world who became the first—out of his several hundred FBFs—to post cat videos. Several times daily cat videos, all new. </p>
<p>
Ken had never seen a Facebook cat video before. So now he goes to the FBF’s page and clicks the next one while waiting for LaTeX to finish. This does, however, have less relevance to his statistical chess research than <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/29/benfords-law-and-baseball/">fantasy</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/is-the-hot-hand-fallacy-a-fallacy/">sports</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/03/28/is-there-momentum-in-chess/">had</a>.</p>

<p></p><h2> Polir’s Solution </h2><p></p>
<p>
Polir found a different solution that does not use cat videos—too bad for the cats. Polir first approached the most recently responsible party, who won the 2013 ACM Turing Award for solving the <em>broken deli number dispenser</em> problem. The prize-winning solution, as described in the <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/lamport_1205376.cfm">citation</a>, is to have each customer choose a number higher than all the other customers’ numbers. But how to leverage this brilliant solution to solve the multi-pass problem?</p>
<p>
Polir’s insight came while consulting the original responsible party and author of the following computer <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs/sat13.w">code</a> for a SAT solver. While hearing the author explain how this code emerged from his Pascal-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB">WEB</a> and C-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a> programming environments, Polir realized this in a flash:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> A LaTeX document is a <b>network</b>. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This led to the realization that the quick-compilation problems could be formulated as instances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_network_coding">network coding</a> problems upon dividing the document into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" />-sized chunks. A helpful reader of this blog supplied the final needed piece last week in a <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/#comment-100107">comment</a>: via this new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10935">paper</a>, there is an efficient reduction from network coding to integer multiplication. The reduction is not a string mapping but rather “corporate” via direct analysis of solving circuits.</p>
<p>
Thus the solution came down to ideas in the brilliant new <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/papers/nlogn/">paper</a> on integer multiplication which we just <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/03/29/integer-multiplication-in-nlogn-time/">posted</a> about. It means that we can solve the multi-pass problem essentially by multiplying pieces of the document together—or more exactly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution#Discrete_convolution">convolving</a> them. We needn’t be concerned about our remarks on the algorithm in that paper being galactic—there is a clear proof of concept in that the paper’s second author is also the chief developer of the <a href="http://texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html">TeXmacs</a> composition environment. We thus nominate the paper plus Polir’s breakthrough consequence for result of the year.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Update April 2, 2019: the links below are not working anymore. </strong></span></h3>
<p>Google Plus is a nice social platform with tens of millions participants. I found it especially nice for scientific posts, e.g. by <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/117663015413546257905">John Baez</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/104488217075635760621">Moshe Vardi</a>, or about <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/symplectic%20geometry/top">symplectic geometry, </a> about <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/s/majorana%20fermions/top">Majorana Fermions</a>, and with a discussion about <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/106808239073321070854/posts/cwzYpKXSACM">What is combinatorics</a>. A few months ago Google announced  that Google+ will be closed. This is going to happen today (March 31, 2019) in a few hours. For example, I am not even sure if the above valuable links will continue to operate. (Every individual user can get his own stuff.)</p>
<p>For possible answers on why Google shut down Google Plus see this <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Google+-closed">Quora question</a>.</p>
<p>My question is different. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Is it legitimate for Google to close Google+? Is it legitimate and is it ethical for Google to eliminate existing content from the public domain?</strong> </span></p>
<h3>Let me state clearly my opinion:</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Google has strong ethical/moral obligation to maintain at least for several years public access to all Google+ existing material. </strong></span></h3>
<p>The fact that huge content that millions of people spent time and effort creating and that people spent time and effort to search and find, is deleted — by a huge and successful company — is very problematic</p>

<p>In the Fall, Boaz and I co-taught a <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/fall18seminar/">grad seminar</a> on physics and computation (see <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2018/08/06/physics-envy/">here</a> for some of the original press coverage). We were lucky to attract an intrepid group of students from multiple fields, with representatives from computer science, physics, math and biology. As part of the course, we asked our students to give presentations and write expository blog posts on a number of topics at the intersection of computation and physics, including algorithms from statistical physics, quantum area laws, and the firewall paradox. The students worked hard to produce posts that make the physics concepts accessible to a computer science audience, and the result is a nice collection of posts that create a “bridge” from CS to physics.</p>
<p>Here, the aim is to give a (long overdue) table of contents for their posts. Followers of the blog may have noticed a landslide of physics &amp; computation posts around December and January; if you weren’t able to keep up with them all at the time, then here they are, rounded up and organized by topic.</p>

David Harvey and Joris van der Hoeven are computational mathematicians. They have just released a <a href="https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~davidharvey/papers/nlogn/">paper</a> showing how to multiply two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit integers in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n\log n)}" /> time. A companion <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/joris/ffnlogn/ffnlogn-abs.html">paper</a> gives details of a simpler second algorithm that is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n\log n)}" /> time pending a widely-believed conjecture about primes.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss what makes these new results possible.</p>
<p>
The first paper leads off with a nice history of algorithms that beat the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5E2%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n^2)}" class="latex" title="{O(n^2)}" />-time method all of us learned in school. Far from being <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/galactic-algorithms/">galactic</a>, the longtime-champion <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n+%5Clog%5C%21%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n\log n \log\!\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n\log n \log\!\log n)}" /> algorithm of Arnold Schönhage and Volker Strassen is a workhorse of the GNU Multiple Precision Library (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Multiple_Precision_Arithmetic_Library">GMP</a>). The <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Clog%5C%21%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\log\!\log n}" class="latex" title="{\log\!\log n}" /> factor was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furer's_algorithm">improved</a> by Martin Fürer in 2007 and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3360?context=cs">further</a> in 2014 by Harvey and van der Hoeven with Grégoire Lecerf. Now it is gone altogether.</p>
<p>
Their algorithm is currently not practical, but it is also not yet tuned. At the start of section 5, they note that their estimates take effect for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cgeq+2%5E%7Bd%5E%7B12%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n \geq 2^{d^{12}}}" class="latex" title="{n \geq 2^{d^{12}}}" /> where they use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+1%2C%5C%21729%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d = 1,\!729}" class="latex" title="{d = 1,\!729}" />. When they note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7Bd%5E%7B12%7D%7D+%3E+2%5E%7B4%2C%5C%21096%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{d^{12}} &gt; 2^{4,\!096}}" class="latex" title="{2^{d^{12}} &gt; 2^{4,\!096}}" /> they don’t mean the numbers need at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%2C%5C%21096%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4,\!096}" class="latex" title="{4,\!096}" /> bits, rather <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B4%2C%5C%21096%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{4,\!096}}" class="latex" title="{2^{4,\!096}}" /> is the number of bits. Since there are only <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/a27259/how-many-particles-are-in-the-entire-universe/">about</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B270%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^{270}}" class="latex" title="{2^{270}}" /> particles in the observable universe, this puts the term <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/galactic-algorithms/">galactic</a> to shame. </p>
<p>
The number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21729%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1,\!729}" class="latex" title="{1,\!729}" /> recalls a famous <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hardy-RamanujanNumber.html">story</a> about Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan. This is not wholly a coincidence. They get a bounding multiplier of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B36%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{36}" class="latex" title="{36}" /> from one place, another factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{6}" class="latex" title="{6}" /> from another, and finally a factor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{8}" class="latex" title="{8}" /> giving <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21728%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1,\!728}" class="latex" title="{1,\!728}" /> which equals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B12%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{12^3}" class="latex" title="{12^3}" />. Then they just make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> be higher by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, setting up <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21729+%3D+12%5E3+%2B+1%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1,\!729 = 12^3 + 1^3}" class="latex" title="{1,\!729 = 12^3 + 1^3}" /> which happens to equal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9%5E3+%2B+10%5E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{9^3 + 10^3}" class="latex" title="{9^3 + 10^3}" />. But there is much flex in the choices and they sketch how to improve the needed bound from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2C%5C%21728%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1,\!728}" class="latex" title="{1,\!728}" /> to just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{8}" class="latex" title="{8}" />. They also uncover some new tricks for calculating in certain large finite rings defined via multi-variable polynomials.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Polynomials and Tricks </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
When we heard the news on Tuesday, both of us thought of the famous primality <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">test</a> of Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena (AKS), which placed deciding primality into deterministic polynomial time. We stated the message as the title of an old <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/02/26/polynomials-are-easier-than-integers/">post</a> on other joint work by Kayal: “Polynomials Are Easier Than Integers.” </p>
<p>
The crux of the AKS test is to employ the theorem that for any co-prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2CN%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(a,N)}" class="latex" title="{(a,N)}" />, the polynomial congruence relation </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x+%2B+a%29%5EN+%5Cequiv+x%5EN+%2B+a+%5Cpmod%7BN%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x + a)^N \equiv x^N + a \pmod{N} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x + a)^N \equiv x^N + a \pmod{N} " /></p>
<p>holds in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}" /> if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> is prime. This is tested in the quotient ring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%2F%28x%5Er+-+1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^r - 1)}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^r - 1)}" />. The game becomes finding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> small enough and minimizing the number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> that need to be checked in order for the body of tests in the quotient ring to be conclusive. </p>
<p>
We take time to note that the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+N-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a = N-1}" class="latex" title="{a = N-1}" /> is possibly sufficient while testing a small set of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />. Agrawal has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrawal's_conjecture">conjectured</a> that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x+-+1%29%5EN+%5Cequiv+x%5EN+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(x - 1)^N \equiv x^N - 1}" class="latex" title="{(x - 1)^N \equiv x^N - 1}" /> modulo both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Er+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x^r - 1}" class="latex" title="{x^r - 1}" /> then either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> is prime or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%5E2+-+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N^2 - 1}" class="latex" title="{N^2 - 1}" />. This conjecture is <a href="https://aimath.org/WWN/primesinp/primesinp.pdf">doubted</a> on heuristic counting grounds but it has been verified for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3C+10%5E%7B12%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N &lt; 10^{12}}" class="latex" title="{N &lt; 10^{12}}" /> and can be <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/008.pdf">modified</a> by including the case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba+%3D+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a = 2}" class="latex" title="{a = 2}" />. It would improve the polynomial time in the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> of bits in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{N}" class="latex" title="{N}" /> from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E6%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde{O}(n^6)}" class="latex" title="{\tilde{O}(n^6)}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctilde%7BO%7D%28n%5E3%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\tilde{O}(n^3)}" class="latex" title="{\tilde{O}(n^3)}" /> and also improve the constants. We mention this because Harvey and van der Hoeven have a number-theoretic conjecture that (as shown in their companion paper) improves both their constant on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Clog+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n\log n}" class="latex" title="{n\log n}" /> and the simplicity of the proof.</p>
<p>
The further message of the new papers is added power from giving the polynomials more variables. They use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> variables: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}}" class="latex" title="{x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}}" /> plus a nominal <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_d}" class="latex" title="{x_d}" /> that is later substituted by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7B%5Cpi+i%2Fr%7D+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{e^{\pi i/r} y}" class="latex" title="{e^{\pi i/r} y}" />.

The other variables are used to mod out by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x_1%5E%7Bt_1%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%5E%7Bt_%7Bd-1%7D%7D+-+1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1)}" class="latex" title="{(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1)}" /> where the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_i}" class="latex" title="{t_i}" /> are powers of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> no higher than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2r%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2r}" class="latex" title="{2r}" />. Operations in quotient rings of this type are especially efficient. They are used to emulate operations in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%2F%28x%5Es+-+1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^s - 1)}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^s - 1)}" /> where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s}" class="latex" title="{s}" /> is a product of primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_1%5Ccdots+s_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_1\cdots s_d}" class="latex" title="{s_1\cdots s_d}" /> that are near powers of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />.

They start with Schönhage and Strassen’s original trick of splitting the two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit integers into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Theta(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{\Theta(\log n)}" />-sized pieces so that the problem reduces to multiplying polynomials of degree <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CTheta%28n%2F%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Theta(n/\log n)}" class="latex" title="{\Theta(n/\log n)}" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%5Bx%5D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{Z}[x]}" /> with coefficients of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" /> size. They use the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{C}}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{C}}" /> with complex operations that need only <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" /> bits of precision individually. This setting also gives leeway for approximative methods in their final algorithm. But first we describe what was evidently their original strategy.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Recursive Strategy </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Their first task in either case is to find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />-many distinct primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cs_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_1,\dots,s_d}" class="latex" title="{s_1,\dots,s_d}" /> of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2F%5Clog+n%29%5E%7B1%2Fd%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n/\log n)^{1/d}}" class="latex" title="{(n/\log n)^{1/d}}" /> in magnitude. Now when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+1%2C%5C%21729%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d = 1,\!729}" class="latex" title="{d = 1,\!729}" /> the exponent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2Fd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1/d}" class="latex" title="{1/d}" /> makes the primes quite small indeed, and the need to find distinct ones already drives <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> up quite high before their algorithm can even go into effect. Moreover, for the approximation to work, the primes need to be congruent to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />. </p>
<p>
Their original strategy—detailed in the companion paper—builds on a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1448407">result</a> of Charles Rader to reduce the DFT computation to multiplications in </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5D%2F%28x_1%5E%7Bs_1+-+1%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5E%7Bs_d+-+1%7D+-+1%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{s_1 - 1} - 1,\dots,x_d^{s_d - 1} - 1), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{s_1 - 1} - 1,\dots,x_d^{s_d - 1} - 1), " /></p>
<p>where compared to (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/feed/#CRT">1</a>) they have reduced the exponents by one. Using <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_i+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cpmod%7Br%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_i \equiv 1 \pmod{r}}" class="latex" title="{s_i \equiv 1 \pmod{r}}" />, they next reduce this to multiplications in </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5D%2F%28x_1%5E%7Br%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_d%5E%7Br%7D+-+1%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{r} - 1,\dots,x_d^{r} - 1). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_d]/(x_1^{r} - 1,\dots,x_d^{r} - 1). " /></p>
<p>Then the above-mentioned substitution of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x_d}" class="latex" title="{x_d}" /> by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%5E%7B%5Cpi+i%2Fr%7D+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{e^{\pi i/r} y}" class="latex" title="{e^{\pi i/r} y}" /> makes them into products over </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++R%5Bx_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%5D%2F%28x_1%5E%7Bt_1%7D+-+1%2C%5Cdots%2Cx_%7Bd-1%7D%5E%7Bt_%7Bd-1%7D%7D+-+1%29+%5Cqquad%5Ctext%7Bwith%7D%5Cqquad+R+%3D+%5Cmathbb%7BC%7D%5By%5D%2F%28y%5Er+%2B+1%29.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  R[x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}]/(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1) \qquad\text{with}\qquad R = \mathbb{C}[y]/(y^r + 1). " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  R[x_1,\dots,x_{d-1}]/(x_1^{t_1} - 1,\dots,x_{d-1}^{t_{d-1}} - 1) \qquad\text{with}\qquad R = \mathbb{C}[y]/(y^r + 1). " /></p>
<p>These last products are at last amenable to the usual Fast Fourier Transform trick of applying FFT for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_i}" class="latex" title="{t_i}" /> by pretending that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%5E%7B2r%2Ft_i%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y^{2r/t_i}}" class="latex" title="{y^{2r/t_i}}" /> is a primitive <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_i}" class="latex" title="{t_i}" />-th root of unity, multiplying pointwise in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" />, and doing the inverse FFT. Finally the products in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{R}" class="latex" title="{R}" /> can be converted into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" />-bit integer products, and this sets up the vast recursion from multiplying the original <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit integers to a batch of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" />-bit ones. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Finding Good Primes </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
In order for the recursion to solve to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n\log n)}" />, they need the values <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_i+%3D+%28s_i+-+1%29%2Fr%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q_i = (s_i - 1)/r}" class="latex" title="{q_i = (s_i - 1)/r}" /> to be not too large. Viewing this task from the bottom up, they want to choose a single value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> and choose small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q_i}" class="latex" title="{q_i}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_i+%3D+rq_i+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_i = rq_i + 1}" class="latex" title="{s_i = rq_i + 1}" /> is prime. Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> is a power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" />, there is some resemblance to the harder task of finding Sophie Germain primes, which are also relevant to the AKS algorithm. In this case, however, all they need is a sufficiently small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0}" /> such that:</p>

This is, however, only known for “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />” <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%3D+4.18%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{= 4.18}" class="latex" title="{= 4.18}" /> and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis is only known to improve the bound to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%5E%7B2%2B%5Cdelta%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{k^{2+\delta}}" class="latex" title="{k^{2+\delta}}" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta+%3E+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta &gt; 0}" class="latex" title="{\delta &gt; 0}" />.

They currently need it for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3D+1%2F303%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon = 1/303}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon = 1/303}" />.</p>
<p>
The companion paper uses the conjecture to improve multiplication in the field <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_%7Bp%5E%5Cell%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}" /> to time <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Cell+%5Clog%28p%29%28%5Clog%28n%29+%2B+%5Clog%28%5Cell%29+%2B+%5Clog%5C%21%5Clog%28p%29%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n\ell \log(p)(\log(n) + \log(\ell) + \log\!\log(p))}" class="latex" title="{O(n\ell \log(p)(\log(n) + \log(\ell) + \log\!\log(p))}" />.

The companion <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/joris/ffnlogn/ffnlogn-abs.html">paper</a> has full details of how all this works and many more numerical tricks than we’ve mentioned—a <em>tour de force</em>. Getting the result for integer multiplication unconditionally, however, requires one more major tool in their arsenal. To use it they set up the primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_i}" class="latex" title="{s_i}" /> to be slightly below respective powers of 2 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_i}" class="latex" title="{t_i}" /> (rather than be above a single power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2}" class="latex" title="{2}" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> by the aforementioned factors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q_i}" class="latex" title="{q_i}" />) while retaining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_1%5Ccdots+t_d+%3D+O%28s_1+%5Ccdots+s_d%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_1\cdots t_d = O(s_1 \cdots s_d)}" class="latex" title="{t_1\cdots t_d = O(s_1 \cdots s_d)}" />. </p>
<p>
Their innovation compared to the translations in the first strategy is that one can still reduce the DFT computation in dimensions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs_1%2C%5Cdots%2Cs_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{s_1,\dots,s_d}" class="latex" title="{s_1,\dots,s_d}" /> needing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(\log n)}" /> precision to a complex DFT in dimensions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt_1%2C%5Cdots%2Ct_d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t_1,\dots,t_d}" class="latex" title="{t_1,\dots,t_d}" /> by employing approximation. Their algorithm is completely deterministic but it employs weights that conform to Gaussian distributions to effect the approximation. The preservation of Gaussians under Fourier transforms enables close enough approximations to be obtained by solving relatively small and easily-specified systems of linear equations. The resulting complex DFT is then massaged in a manner similar to the first strategy. The resulting recursion is not quite as steep—it goes from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%27+%3D+n%5E%7B1%2Fd+%2B+o%281%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n' = n^{1/d + o(1)}}" class="latex" title="{n' = n^{1/d + o(1)}}" />—but it gives </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++M%28n%29+%3D+%5Cfrac%7BKn%7D%7Bn%27%7D+M%28n%27%29+%2B+O%28n%5Clog+n%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  M(n) = \frac{Kn}{n'} M(n') + O(n\log n) " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  M(n) = \frac{Kn}{n'} M(n') + O(n\log n) " /></p>

This gives <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%28n%29+%3D+O%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M(n) = O(n\log n)}" class="latex" title="{M(n) = O(n\log n)}" />. The approximation technique does not work for multiplication in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_%7Bp%5E%5Cell%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_{p^\ell}}" />, however. As usual, here is where we say to consult the papers for further details—there is a wealth of them.</p>
<p>

Will the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(n\log n)}" class="latex" title="{O(n\log n)}" /> time be concretely improvable?

Least Weight Subsequence (LWS) is a type of highly sequential optimization problems with form $F(j) = \min_{i &lt; j} [F(i) + c_{i,j}]$. They can be solved in quadratic time using dynamic programming, but it is not known whether these problems can be solved faster than $n^{2-o(1)}$ time. Surprisingly, each such problem is subquadratic time reducible to a highly parallel, non-dynamic programming problem [KPS17]. In other words, if a "static"  problem is faster than quadratic time, so is an LWS problem. For many instances of LWS, the sequential versions are equivalent to their static versions by subquadratic time reductions. The previous result applies to LWS on linear structures, and this paper extends this result to LWS on paths in sparse graphs. When the graph is a multitree (i.e. a DAG where any pair vertices can have at most one path) or when the graph is a DAG whose underlying undirected graph has constant treewidth, we show that LWS on this graph is still subquadratically reducible to their corresponding static problems. For many instances, the graph versions are still equivalent to their static versions.

Moreover, this paper shows that on these graphs, property testing of form $\exists x \exists y (\text{TC}_E(x,y) \wedge P(x,y))$ is subquadratically reducible to property testing of form $\exists x \exists y P(x,y)$, where $P$ is a property checkable in time linear to the sizes of $x$ and $y$, and $\text{TC}_E$ is the transitive closure of relation $E$. Furthermore, when $P$ is definable by a first-order logic formula with at most one quantified variable, then the above two problems are equivalent to each other by subquadratic reductions.</div>

<blockquote><p>Abstract: Problems arising from analyzing and understanding graph structures have motivated the development of many powerful tools for storing and compressing graphs and networks. Many, if not most, of these massive graphs are accumulations of updates over time. Maintaining updates and queries on dynamically changing graphs more efficiently than recomputing from scratch is a well-studied topic, with several important open problems related to global, optimization related queries.</p>
<p>We study dynamic graph algorithms for maintaining spectral vertex sparsifiers with respect to a subset of terminal vertices. Such sparsifiers preserve key structures in spectral algorithms, including effective resistances (which can be viewed as a numerical generalization of connectivity), solutions to systems of Laplacian linear equations, and energy of electrical flows between terminal vertices. We give data structures that maintain, in sublinear time, these sparsifiers under insertions/deletions of edges, as well as terminal additions.</p>
<p>This primitive in turn leads to sublinear time data structures for key primitives in spectral graph algorithms, including ones at the core of the “Laplacian paradigm” for designing graph optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E%7B4%2F3%7D%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-4%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(m^{4/3}\epsilon^{-4})" class="latex" title="O(m^{4/3}\epsilon^{-4})" /> time per query/update for effective resistances on unweighted graphs, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E%7B11%2F12%7D%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-5%7D%29&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="O(n^{11/12}\epsilon^{-5})" class="latex" title="O(n^{11/12}\epsilon^{-5})" /> time per query/update for implicit access to linear system solutions, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cepsilon&amp;bg=fff&amp;fg=444444&amp;s=0" alt="\epsilon" class="latex" title="\epsilon" /> is the relative approximation accuracy.</p>
<p>The majority of the talk will focus on key components of this data structure: (1) an interpretation of vertex sparsifiers as a sum of random walks, (2) a suitable choice of terminals to keep these walks local, and (3) maintenance of local walks and numerical solutions. Potential avenues in generalizing these techniques to provide new building blocks for dynamic graph algorithms will also be discussed.</p></blockquote></div>

<p><em>[Guest post by Aleksander Mądry]</em></p>



<p>To me, one of the best things about working in theoretical computer <br />science has always the exciting rate of progress we make as a community. <br />On (what appears to be) a regular basis, we produce breakthroughs on <br />problems that are absolutely fundamental to our field. Problems that <br />often look impossible to tackle, right up until someone actually tackles <br />them.</p>



<p>However, as inspiring as all these developments were to me, I also <br />always felt that we, as a community, could do more to properly recognize <br />and highlight them, both internally and to the outside world. This kind <br />of outreach would make it easier for us to capitalize on the <br />breakthroughs as well as to accelerate the impact of the underlying <br />ideas on the other areas of computer science, and beyond.</p>



<p>Fortunately, this is about to change!</p>



<p>One of the first decisions of our newly (re-)elected <a href="https://www.sigact.org/">SIGACT committee</a> was to create a committee (as committees are wont to do <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /> whose mission will be to help  promote top computer science theory research. This <strong>SIGACT Research Highlights Committee</strong> – consisting of <a href="https://www.boazbarak.org/">Boaz Barak</a>, <a href="https://omereingold.wordpress.com/">Omer Reingold</a>,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/marywootters/">Mary Wootters</a> and <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/">myself</a> – will, in particular, work to identify results to be recommended for consideration for the <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/">CACM </a>Research Highlights section as well  as other general-audience research outlets in computer science and other  fields.</p>



<p>Of course, to do a proper job here we require your help! To this end, <br />the committee solicits two types of nominations:</p>



<p>1) Conference nominations. Each year, the committee will ask the PC <br />chairs of a broad set of theoretical computer science conferences to <br />send a selection of up to three top papers from these conferences <br />(selected based on both their technical merit and the potential <br />significant interest to non-theory audiences) and forwarding them to the <br />committee for consideration.</p>



<p>2) Community nominations. The committee will accept nominations from the  members of the community. Each such nomination should summarize the  contribution of the nominated (and recently published) paper and also <br />argue why this paper particularly merits a broader outreach. The <br />nomination should be no more than a page in length and can be submitted <br />at any time by emailing it to <a href="mailto:sigact.cacm.nominations@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sigact.cacm.nominations@gmail.com</a>. <br />Self-nominations are discouraged.</p>



<p>To be considered in the upcoming round of our deliberations, we need to <br />receive your nomination by <strong>April 30</strong>.</p>



<p>Looking forward to learning about all the new exciting research that you <br />all are doing!

</p></div>

 After 22 years in the United States, 19 of which spent in the San Francisco Bay Area, this Summer I will move to Milan to take a job at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocconi_University">Bocconi University</a>.</p>
<p>
Like a certain well-known Bay Area institution, Bocconi is a private university that was endowed by a rich merchant in memory of his dead son. Initially characterized by an exclusive focus on law, economics and business, it has had for a while a high domestic recognition for the quality of teaching and, more recently, a good international profile both in teaching and research. Despite its small size, compared to Italy’s giant public universities, in 2017 Bocconi was the Italian university which had received the most ERC grants during the first ten years of existence of the European Research Council (in second place was my Alma Mater, the Sapienza University of Rome, which has about nine times more professors) <a href="https://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/03/07/news/in_bocconi_i_fuoriclasse_della_ricerca-159919972/">(source)</a>.</p>
<p>
About three years ago, Bocconi started planning for a move in the space of computing, in the context of their existing efforts in <a href="http://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home">data science</a>. As a first step, they recruited <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riccardozecchina/home">Riccardo Zecchina</a>. You may remember Riccardo from his work providing a non-rigorous calculation of the threshold of random 3-SAT, his work on the “survey propagation” algorithm for SAT and other constraint satisfaction problems, as well as other work that brought statistical physics techniques to computer science. Currently, Riccardo and his group are doing very exciting work on the theory of deep learning.</p>
<p>
Though I knew of his work, I had never met Riccardo until I attended a 2017 workshop at the Santa Fe Institute on <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/events/thermodynamics-and-computation-towards-new-synthes">“Thermodynamics and computation,”</a> an invitation that I had accepted on whim, mostly based on the fact that I had never been to New Mexico and I had really liked Breaking Bad. Riccardo had just moved to Bocconi, he told me about their future plans, and he asked me if I was interested. I initially politely declined, but one thing led to another, and now here I am putting up my San Francisco house for sale.</p>
<p>
Last August, as I was considering this move, I applied for an <a href="https://lucatrevisan.wordpress.com/2018/07/31/erc-vs-nsf/">ERC grant</a> from the European Union, and I just learned that the <a href="https://erc.europa.eu/news/erc-2018-advanced-grants-results">grant has been approved</a>. This grant is approximately the same amount as the total of all the grants that I have received from the NSF over the past twenty years, and it will support several postdoc positions, as well as visitors ranging from people coming for a week to give a talk and meet with my group to a full-year sabbatical visit.</p>
<p>
 Although it’s a bit late for that, I am looking for postdocs starting as early as this September: if you are interested please contact me. The postdoc positions will pay a highly competitive salary, which will be free of Italian income tax (<s>although American citizens will owe federal income tax to the IRS</s> correction: American citizens would not owe anything to IRS either). As a person from Rome, I am not allowed to say good things about Milan or else I will have to return my Roman card (it’s kind of a NY versus LA thing), but I think that the allure of the city speaks for itself.</p>
<p>
Likewise, if you are a senior researcher, and you have always wanted to visit me and work together on spectral methods, approximation algorithms, graph theory or graph algorithms, but you felt that Berkeley had insufficiently many Leonardo mural paintings and opera houses, and that it was too far from the Alps, then now you are in luck!</p>

At Dagstuhl I got a few ideas for future posts but then...<br />
<br />
We had some discussions about STOC allowing program committee members to submit papers that I planned to post about. But then Suresh wrote a <a href="http://blog.geomblog.org/2019/03/on-pc-submissions-at-soda-2020.html">fine post</a> on the same issue for SODA. My thoughts: PC members should not submit--no matter how you try to avoid the conflict of interest, there will always be a cloud on the process. Suresh suggest blind reviews that other non-theory conferences use, but I prefer the tiered PC system. It's fine to have PC members submit papers if the top of the tier, a senior PC or the PC chairs, makes the final calls.<br />
<br />
I was also going to post about Yann LeCun's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10152719972317143&amp;id=722677142">Facebook rant</a> about stodgy CS departments but then Yann goes ahead and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/technology/turing-award-ai.html">wins a Turing award</a> with Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for their work on machine learning. I knew Yann from when we worked together at NEC Research in the early 2000's and let's just congratulate him and the others and let them bask in glory for truly transforming how we think of computing today. I'll get back to his post soon enough.</div>

Motivated by the quest for scalable and succinct zero knowledge arguments, we revisit worst-case-to-average-case reductions for linear spaces, raised by [Rothblum, Vadhan, Wigderson, STOC 2013]. The previous state of the art by [Ben-Sasson, Kopparty, Saraf, CCC 2018] showed that if some member of an affine space $U$ is $\delta$-far in relative Hamming distance from a linear code $V$ — this is the worst-case assumption — then most elements of $U$ are almost-$\delta$-far from $V$ — this is the average case. However, this result was known to hold only below the “double Johnson” function of the relative distance $\delta_V$ of the code $V$ , i.e., only when $\delta &lt; 1 ? (1 ? \delta_V)^{1/4}$.
First, we increase the soundness-bound to the “one-and-a-half Johnson” function of $\delta_V$ and show that the average distance of $U$ from $V$ is nearly $\delta$ for any worst-case distance $\delta$ smaller than $1 ? (1 ? \delta_V)^{1/3}$. This bound is tight, which is somewhat surprising because the one-and-a-half Johnson function is unfamiliar in the literature on error correcting codes.
To improve soundness further for Reed Solomon codes we sample outside the box. We suggest a new protocol in which the verifier samples a single point $z$ outside the box $D$ on which codewords are evaluated, and asks the prover for the value at $z$ of the interpolating polynomial of a random element of $U$. Intuitively, the answer provided by the prover “forces” it to choose one codeword from a list of “pretenders” that are close to $U$. We call this technique Domain Extending for Eliminating Pretenders (DEEP).
The DEEP method improves the soundness of the worst-case-to-average-case reduction for RS codes up their list decoding radius. This radius is bounded from below by the Johnson bound, implying average distance is approximately $\delta$ for all $\delta &lt; 1 ? (1 ? \delta_V)^{1/2}$. Under a plausible conjecture about the list decoding radius of Reed-Solomon codes, average distance from $V$ is approximately $\delta$ for all $\delta$. The DEEP technique can be generalized to all linear codes, giving improved reductions for capacity-achieving list-decodable codes.
Finally, we use the DEEP technique to devise two new protocols:
• An Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for RS codes, called DEEP-FRI. This soundness of the protocol improves upon that of the FRI protocol of [Ben-Sasson et al., ICALP 2018] while retaining linear arithmetic proving complexity and logarithmic verifier arithmetic complexity.
• An Interactive Oracle Proof (IOP) for the Algebraic Linking IOP (ALI) protocol used to construct zero knowledge scalable transparent arguments of knowledge (ZK-STARKs) in [Ben-Sasson et al., eprint 2018]. The new protocol, called DEEP-ALI, improves soundness of this crucial step from a small constant $&lt; 1/8$ to a constant arbitrarily close to $1$.</div>

<p>I was delighted (and not at all surprised) to hear that this year’s Turing Award will go to <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/">LeCun, Hinton, and Y. Bengio</a> for their work on deep learning.</p>
<p>Like public-key cryptography, deep learning was ahead of its time when first studied, but, thanks to the pioneering efforts of its founders, it was ready to be used when the technology caught up. </p>
<p>Mathematical developments take a long time to mature, so it is essential that applied mathematical research be done ahead of the time of its application, that is, at a time when it is basic research. Maybe quantum computing will be the next example to teach this lesson.</p>
<p>By the way, this summer the Simons Institute will host a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">program on the foundations of deep learning</a>, co-organized by Samy Bengio, Aleks Madry, Elchanan Mossel and Matus Telgarsky.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it is not just the practical applications of a mathematical advance that take time to develop: the same can be true even for its <i>theoretical</i> applications! Which brings me to the next announcement of this post, namely that the call for nominations for the <a href="http://focs2019.cs.jhu.edu/tota/">FOCS test of time award</a> is out. Nominations are due in about four weeks.</p></div>

Call for Papers:

Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/behavioralec/">https://sites.google.com/view/behavioralec/</a>
June 28, 2019, Phoenix, AZ
In conjunction with the 20th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation 
(ACM EC '19)

SUBMISSIONS DUE May 1, 2019, 11:59pm PDT.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We solicit research contributions and participants for The 1st
Workshop on Behavioral Economics and Computation, to be held in
conjunction with the 20th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation 
(ACM EC '19). The workshop will bring together researchers and
practitioners from diverse subareas of EC, who are interested in the 
intersection of human economic behavior and computation, to share new 
results and to discuss future directions for behavioral research 
related to economics and computation. It will be a full-day workshop, 
and will feature invited speakers, contributed paper presentations and 
a panel discussion.

The gap between rationality-based analysis that assumes utility-maximizing 
agents and the actual human behavior in the real world has been well 
recognized in economics, psychology and other social sciences. In recent 
years, there has been a growing interest in conducting behavioral research 
across many of the sub-areas related to economics and computation to 
address this gap. In one direction, some of these studies leverage insights 
on human decision making from behavioral economics and social psychology 
literature to study economic and computational systems with human users. 
In the other direction, computational tools are used to study and gain 
insights on human behavior and a data-driven approach is sometimes used to 
learn behavior models from user-generated data.

The Behavioral EC workshop aims to bring together researchers and 
practitioners from diverse fields, including but not limited to computer 
science, economics, psychology and sociology, to exchange ideas related to 
behavioral research in economics and computation. In addition to sharing new 
results, we hope the workshop will foster a lively discussion of future 
directions and methodologies for behavioral research related to economics 
and computation as well as fruitful cross-pollination of behavioral 
economics, cognitive psychology and computer science. 

We welcome studies at the intersection of economic behavior and computation 
from a rich set of theoretical, experimental and empirical perspectives. The 
topics of interest for the workshop are behavioral research in all settings 
covered by EC, including but not limited to:

Behavioral mechanism design and applied mechanism design
Empirical studies of economic behavior
Boundedly-rational models of economic decision making
Model evaluation and selection based on behavioral data
Online prediction markets, experiments, and crowdsourcing platforms
Hybrid human-machine systems
Models and experiments about social considerations (e.g. fairness) in 
decision making 
Methods for behavioral EC: information aggregation, probability elicitation, 
quality control


Submission Instructions
=======================

Submission deadline: May 1, 2019, 11:59pm PDT.

Notification: May 20, 2019

We will give priority to new (unpublished) research papers, but will 
also consider ongoing research and recently published papers that may 
be of interest to the workshop audience. For submissions of published 
papers, authors must clearly state the venue of publication. Papers 
will be reviewed for relevance, significance, originality, research 
contribution, and likelihood to catalyze discussion. The workshop will 
not have archival proceedings but will post accepted papers on the 
workshop website. Position papers and panel discussion proposals are also 
welcome. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected 
to attend and present their findings at the workshop.

Submissions can be in any format and can be up to 18 pages long (plus 
a title page and excluding appendices that can be arbitrarily long). We 
recommend the format of the EC submissions. The limit of 18 pages on 
the main body is an upper bound, and papers can be significantly shorter. 

Submissions should be uploaded to the submission server no later 
than May 1, 2019, 11:59pm PDT.

SODA 2020 (in SLC!!) is experimenting with a new submission guideline: PC members will be allowed to submit papers. I had a conversation about this with Shuchi Chawla (the PC chair) and she was kind enough (thanks Shuchi!) to share the guidelines she's provided to PC members about how this will work.<br /><br />  <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">SODA is allowing PC members (but not the PC chair) to submit papers this year. To preserve the integrity of the review process, we will handle PC member submissions as follows.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">1. PC members are required to declare a conflict for papers that overlap in content with their own submissions (in addition to other CoI situations). These will be treated as hard conflicts. If necessary, in particular if we don't have enough confidence in our evaluation of a paper, PC members will be asked to comment on papers they have a hard conflict with. However, they will not have a say in the final outcome for such papers. </span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">2. PC submissions will receive 4 reviews instead of just 3. This is so that we have more confidence on our evaluation and ultimate decision.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">3. We will make early accept/reject decisions on PC members submissions, that is, before we start considering "borderline" papers and worrying about the total number of papers accepted. This is because the later phases of discussion are when subjectivity and bias tend to creep in the most.</span> </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span class="s1">4. In order to be accepted, PC member submissions must receive no ratings below "weak accept" and must receive at least two out of four ratings of "accept" or above.</span>  </blockquote><blockquote class="tr_bq">5. PC member submissions will not be eligible for the best paper award.</blockquote><br />My understanding is that this was done to solve the problem of not being able to get people to agree to be on the PC - this year's PC has substantially more members than prior years.<br /><br />And yet....<br /><br />Given all the discussion about conflicts of interest, implicit bias, and double blind review, this appears to be a bizarrely retrograde move, and in fact one that sends a very loud message that issues of implicit bias aren't really viewed as a problem. As one of my colleagues put it sarcastically when I described the new plan:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"why don't they just cut out the reviews and accept all PC submissions to start with?"</blockquote>and as another colleague pointed out:<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"It's mostly ridiculous that they seem to be tying themselves in knots trying to figure out how to resolve COIs when there's a really easy solution that they're willfully ignoring..."</blockquote><br />Some of the arguments I've been hearing in support of this policy frankly make no sense to me.<br /><br />First of all, the idea that a more heightened scrutiny of PC papers can alleviate the bias associated with reviewing papers of your colleagues goes against basically all of what we know about implicit bias in reviewing. The most basic tenet of human judgement is that we are very bad at filtering our own biases and this only makes it worse. The one thing that theory conferences (compared to other venues) had going for them regarding issues of bias was that PC members couldn't submit papers, but now....<br /><br />Another claim I've heard is that the scale of SODA makes double blind review difficult. It's hard to hear this claim without bursting out into hysterical laughter (and from the reaction of the people I mentioned this to, I'm not the only one).  Conferences that manage with double blind review (and PC submissions btw) are at least an order of magnitude bigger (think of all the ML conferences). Most conference software (including easy chair) is capable of managing the conflicts of interest without too much trouble. Given that SODA (and theory conferences in general) are less familiar with this process, I’ve recommended in the past that there be a “workflow chair” whose job it is to manage the unfamiliarity associated with dealing the software. Workflow chairs are common at bigger conferences that typically deal with 1000s of reviewers and conflicts.<br /><br />Further, as a colleague points out, what one should really be doing is "aligning nomenclature and systems with other fields: call current PC as SPC or Area Chairs, or your favorite nomenclature, and add other folks as reviewers. This way you (i) get a list of all conflicts entered into the system, and (ii) recognize the work that the reviewers are doing more officially as labeling the PC members. "<br /><br /><br />Changes in format (and culture) take time, and I'm still hopeful that the SODA organizing team  will take a lesson from <a href="https://algo2019.ak.in.tum.de/index.php/menue-esa/esa-call">ESA 2019</a>  (and their own resolution to look at DB review more carefully that was passed a year or so ago) and consider exploring DB review. But this year's model is certainly not going to help.<br /><div><br /><b>Update: </b><a href="https://twitter.com/stevemblackburn/status/1111068299796705280?s=20">Steve Blackburn outlines how PLDI handles PC submissions</a> (in brief, double blind + external review committee)<br /><br /><b>Update: </b><a href="https://md.ekstrandom.net/blog/2019/03/anonymous-reviewing">Michael Ekstrand</a> takes on the question that Thomas Steinke asks in the comments below: "How is double blind review different from fairness-through-blindness?".<br /></div><div class="feedflare">

<div class="content">
In light of the recent academic scandal I am going to list ways I've heard to help get your kid into college and thoughts on how ethical they are (hint: bribing a coach to claim your kid is on the rowing team is not ethical).<br />
<br />
1) Your kid likes (1) helping the homeless and (2)  Ramsey Theory and (3)  helping the homeless learn Ramsey Theory. Or perhaps they like  rowing or Latin or fencing or Pig Latin or....  Great! encourage them, get them books and tutors,  and whatever they need. You have an eye towards how this will look on for college admissions; however, it is your kids choice as to what they like. Also note that these activities are in addition to doing well in school, SATs, etc, not instead of it.  Perfectly ethical, though I note that this avenue is not open to poor families and in some cases even middle class families.<br />
<br />
2) Item 1 is the extreme on a spectrum in terms of how much are the extra things the kid does there idea OR planned by you to GET INTO A GOOD COLLEGE. This item will be the other extreme, but realize there is a continuum (actually I doubt there are a continuum number of options here, but there are many in between. Maybe its omega + omega*.) You have heard that being on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing">chess boxing</a> teams is good on a college application so you TELL YOUR KID that they  likes both Chess AND Boxing and should be on the team. You also hear this about being on the fencing team and knowing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin">pig latin</a>, so your kid can taunt their opponents like this:<br />
<br />
youah, aint-kay ence-fay orth-way eans-bay<br />
<br />
This might not be as bad as it sounds if the kid learns to like Chess-Boxing.  But it may be worse than it sounds if the kid rebels against all of this and becomes a crack whore.<br />
<br />
Is this ethical? It may be bad for the kid, but it may push him into things he ends up liking. One drawback: you've HEARD that being on the chess boxing team is good for college admissions, but is it true?<br />
<br />
And again, not open to some families.<br />
<br />
3) Item 2 (or even 1) but with an addition: Hire a college adviser to help you. Someone who knows (or claims to know) what colleges look for- Trombone, Latin, Chess-boxing, whatever. Still ethical but I again worry about the kids future rehab bills.<br />
<br />
4) Here is where it gets murky. The college adviser helps:<br />
<br />
a) Polish the kids essay (my parents, who are both in English, helped polish my essay to get into graduate school (I don't recall if there was one for ugrad). They told me to use lots of `ing' words so it sounds like I am actively doing things. They also helped me figure out when recursion-theoretic is hyphenated. I got into Harvard but not MIT, so make of that what you will.) Polishing, proofreading, that could be okay. But it can slip into b or c below.<br />
<br />
b) The adviser (or the parents) talk to the kids to find out what to write, but then writes it. Maybe the kid proofreads and polishes. Maybe not even. The adviser is  a ghostwriter. Clearly unethical but the line between helping-to-polish and adviser-wrote-it is again a continuum.<br />
<br />
c) Adviser writes it and it is completely fictional. I once heard a rumor that a particular sample of an essay to get into med school was used  by several  med school applicant. Gee,they can't all have gotten inspired by watching their grandfather in his pajamas die of cancer. This is awful of course, but I wonder- what if the student writes a fictional essay all by themselves! Some combination of how much the essay is true and how much help you got on it is unethical. But some might be okay. Is it bad to polish stories that are basically true to make them flow more easily?  Prob not. But there is a 2-dim continuum based on both accuracy and how much help the student got.<br />
<br />
As a side note- how much does the personal statement matter for admissions? I suspect that if an elite school gets LOTS of REALLY QUALIFIED applicants, the essay may be all that distinguishes them.So it can be important. I also wonder if people on admissions can tell if an essay is not written by the applicant. Or maybe if there is an interview that can help detect it.<br />
<br />
5) Parents give X amount of money to the college and the kid gets in. This is talked about a lot though I don't know how common it is for someone NOT qualified to GET IN based on money. College admissions has many factors so its not quite so clear cut what NOT qualified means. Even so, if seems odd that this is not in any way shape or form illegal. It IS transparent, so I guess thats a plus. The argument I've heard is that the money is used for scholarships to fund students who get in but can't afford to go. I do not know if this is true. And this one  is only available to the top Z %, not sure what Z is, but there are people who can do 1,2,3,4 who can't do 5. I would call this unethical though colleges don't seem to think so. Or they do but they do it anyway.<br />
<br />
6) Before I list the current scandal I want to list another issue: having a psychologist (or whoever it is who judges these things) say your kid is Learning Disabled so they get more time on the SATs. Perhaps bribing them, or perhaps its understood what you want.  Again, I do not know how common this is.  An alternative if you can't afford some of the above options, or done in conjunction with a lot of the above options.<br />
<br />
7) The current scandal. Obviously unethical. A few things I wonder about:<br />
<br />
a) One story was that they bribed someone to say their daughter was Learning Disabled and had to take the SAT (or whatever it was) in a separate room, making it easier to change the answers to the correct ones.  So twice unethical.<br />
<br />
b) Some of the students  were clearly NOT qualified.<br />
<br />
c) A parent does unethical things to get the kid into college.<br />
<br />
The kid later lies to the parents about their grades or their plans<br />
<br />
The parents are SHOCKED that their kids lie and wonder where the learned such behaviour!<br />
<br />
8) Actually Item 2 --Parent has kid do things to plan to get into college-- is interesting for another reason. Are you your resume?<br />
<br />
Imagine that Alice helps the homeless her Sophmore year in High School NOT because she cares about the homeless but because its good for college admissions.<br />
<br />
Alice goes on to do other things that look good for college, NOT because she likes them or cares, but just to get into a good college.<br />
<br />
She gets into an elite college<br />
<br />
Did they take her in the hope she would KEEP doing these things or because she is the KIND OF PERSON who does these things?<br />
<br />
And it gets weirder- she DOES keep doing these things since she's heard its good for Business School (disclaimer- I do not know if its good for B-school)<br />
<br />
More generally, she keeps doing things she doesn't care about to advance. So her outward self really is doing good deeds and such, but her heart is not in it. So if her college or B-school or Job hired her because she DOES these things, that is NOT a lie. If they hired her because they want this KIND OF PERSON then... its a lie but I'm not sure what to make of that.<br />
<br />
9) Is there ANY reason to have legacy matter for admissions? This seems like the dumbest and most easily fixed aspect of the whole process.  I have never heard a good argument for it. Ever.<br />
<br />
10) College Sports--- that's an entire blog post or book all by itself, so I won't go there.<br />
<br />
11) One can argue whether helping the homeless, or being on the rowing team, or teaching the homeless how to row, should matter for college anyway. But lets assume that its legit to want people at your college who have lead interesting lives. So charity work or sports might be a MEASURE of that. But beware Goodhart's law:<br />
<br />
                         <i> When a measure becomes a target is ceases to be a measure.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
The recent scandal is Goodhart's law on steroids.<br />
(NOTE- I had in earlier version `Goodwin's law' but a commenter corrected me and reminded me that Goodwin's law is that if an internet discussion goes on long enough someone will be compared to Hitler. I wonder if that also applies in discussions by Nazi's.)<br />
<br />
12) Does getting into an Elite College really increase your income or happiness (these are two very different questions) over the course of your life? I do not know-- if you do, please comment.<br />
<br />
13) (ADDED LATER) A commenter pointed out that one could also go to a school outside of  the USA that values proficiency in the chosen discipline over the items above. Excellent question that raises a few more:<br />
<br />
Do schools outside of the USA hold Americans (or for that matter any non-citizen of their country) to a higher standard for admissions? I ask non-rhetorically.<br />
<br />
If you get a degree from outside of the USA will that help or hurt your job prospects in the USA? Of course this depends on the school you goto, but even with that I do not know the answer.<br />

We study the Boolean Hierarchy in the context of two-party communication complexity, as well as the analogous hierarchy defined with one-sided error randomness instead of nondeterminism. Our results provide a complete picture of the relationships among complexity classes within and across these two hierarchies. In particular, we prove a query-to-communication lifting theorem for all levels of the Boolean Hierarchy and use it to resolve an open problem stated in the paper by Halstenberg and Reischuk (CCC 1988) which initiated this topic.</div>
