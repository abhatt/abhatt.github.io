\emph{deterministically}, in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ rounds of the
$\mathsf{Congested}$ $\mathsf{Clique}$ model.
</p>
<p>In the $\mathsf{Congested}$ $\mathsf{Clique}$ model, there are $n$ players
that perform computation in synchronous rounds. Each round consist of a phase
of local computation and a phase of communication, in which each pair of
players is allowed to exchange $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ bit messages.
</p>
<p>The studies of this model began with the MST problem: in the paper by Lotker
et al.[SPAA'03, SICOMP'05] that defines the $\mathsf{Congested}$
$\mathsf{Clique}$ model the authors give a deterministic $\mathcal{O}(\log \log
n)$ round algorithm that improved over a trivial $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ round
adaptation of Bor\r{u}vka's algorithm.
</p>
<p>There was a sequence of gradual improvements to this result: an
$\mathcal{O}(\log \log \log n)$ round algorithm by Hegeman et al. [PODC'15], an
$\mathcal{O}(\log^* n)$ round algorithm by Ghaffari and Parter, [PODC'16] and
an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ round algorithm by Jurdzi\'nski and Nowicki, [SODA'18], but
all those algorithms were randomized, which left the question about the
existence of any deterministic $o(\log \log n)$ round algorithms for the
Minimum Spanning Tree problem open.
</p>
<p>Our result resolves this question and establishes that $\mathcal{O}(1)$
rounds is enough to solve the MST problem in the $\mathsf{Congested}$
$\mathsf{Clique}$ model, even if we are not allowed to use any randomness.
Furthermore, the amount of communication needed by the algorithm makes it
applicable to some variants of the $\mathsf{MPC}$ model.

incomparable frameworks, most notably the hitting time framework, originally by
Szegedy, the electric network framework by Belovs, and the MNRS framework by
Magniez, Nayak, Roland and Santha. As a result, a number of pieces are
currently missing. For instance, the electric network framework allows quantum
walks to start from an arbitrary initial state, but it only detects marked
elements. In recent work by Ambainis et al., this problem was resolved for the
more restricted hitting time framework, in which quantum walks must start from
the stationary distribution.

<p>We present a new quantum walk search framework that unifies and strengthens
these frameworks. This leads to a number of new results. For instance, the new
framework not only detects, but finds marked elements in the electric network
setting. The new framework also allows one to interpolate between the hitting
time framework, which minimizes the number of walk steps, and the MNRS
framework, which minimizes the number of times elements are checked for being
marked. This allows for a more natural tradeoff between resources. Whereas the
original frameworks only rely on quantum walks and phase estimation, our new
algorithm makes use of a technique called quantum fast-forwarding, similar to
the recent results by Ambainis et al. As a final result we show how in certain
cases we can simplify this more involved algorithm to merely applying the
quantum walk operator some number of times. This answers an open question of
Ambainis et al.

Woodruff</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04177">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>Recently, Musco and Woodruff (FOCS, 2017) showed that given an $n \times n$
positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix $A$, it is possible to compute a
relative-error $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate low-rank approximation to $A$ by
querying $\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon^{2.5})$ entries of $A$ in time
$\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon^{2.5} +n k^{\omega-1}/\epsilon^{2(\omega-1)})$. They
also showed that any relative-error low-rank approximation algorithm must query
$\widetilde{\Omega}(nk/\epsilon)$ entries of $A$, and closing this gap is an
important open question. Our main result is to resolve this question by showing
an algorithm that queries an optimal $\widetilde{O}(nk/\epsilon)$ entries of
$A$ and outputs a relative-error low-rank approximation in
$\widetilde{O}(n\cdot(k/\epsilon)^{\omega-1})$ time. Note, our running time
improves that of Musco and Woodruff, and matches the information-theoretic
lower bound if the matrix-multiplication exponent $\omega$ is $2$.
</p>
<p>Next, we introduce a new robust low-rank approximation model which captures
PSD matrices that have been corrupted with noise. We assume that the Frobenius
norm of the corruption is bounded. Here, we relax the notion of approximation
to additive-error, since it is information-theoretically impossible to obtain a
relative-error approximation in this setting. While a sample complexity lower
bound precludes sublinear algorithms for arbitrary PSD matices, we provide the
first sublinear time and query algorithms when the corruption on the diagonal
entries is bounded. As a special case, we show sample-optimal sublinear time
algorithms for low-rank approximation of correlation matrices corrupted by
noise.

eigenvalue problems. Our work is motivated by applications in computational
quantum physics, where one solution approach to solve the so-called
Bethe-Salpeter equation involves the solution of a large, dense, skew-symmetric
eigenvalue problem. The computed eigenpairs can be used to compute the optical
absorption spectrum of molecules and crystalline systems. One state-of-the art
high-performance solver package for symmetric matrices is the ELPA (Eigenvalue
SoLvers for Petascale Applications) library. We extend the methods available in
ELPA to skew-symmetric matrices. This way, the presented solution method can
benefit from the optimizations available in ELPA that make it a
well-established, efficient and scalable library, such as GPU support. We
compare performance and scalability of our method to the only available
high-performance approach for skew-symmetric matrices, an indirect route
involving complex arithmetic. In total, we achieve a performance that is up to
3.67 higher than the reference method using Intel's ScaLAPACK implementation.
The runtime to solve the Bethe-Salpeter-Eigenvalue problem can be improved by a
factor of 10. Our method is freely available in the current release of the ELPA
library.

points of $S$ that can be strictly separated by a hyperplane from the remaining
$n-k$ points. Similarly, one may consider $k$-facets, which are hyperplanes
that pass through $d$ points of $S$ and have $k$ points on one side. A
notorious open problem is to determine the asymptotics of the maximum number of
$k$-sets. In this paper we study a variation on the $k$-set/$k$-facet problem
with hyperplanes replaced by algebraic surfaces belonging to certain families.
We demonstrate how one may translate bounds for the original problem to bounds
for the algebraic variation. In stark contrast to the original
$k$-set/$k$-facet problem, there are some natural families of algebraic curves
for which the number of $k$-facets can be counted exactly. For example, we show
that the number of halving conic sections for any set of $2n+5$ points in
general position in the plane is $2\binom{n+2}{2}^2$. To understand the limits
of our argument we study a class of maps we call $\textit{generally neighborly
embeddings}$, which map generic point sets into neighborly position.

progress by Ta-Shma [Ta13] implies a method to approximate the determinant of
Hermitian matrices with condition number $\kappa$ in quantum space $O(\log n +
\log \kappa)$. However, it is not known how to perform the task in less than
$O(\log^2 n)$ space using classical resources only. In this work, we show that
the condition number of a matrix implies an upper bound on the depth complexity
(and therefore also on the space complexity) for this task: the determinant of
Hermitian matrices with condition number $\kappa$ can be approximated to
inverse polynomial relative error with classical circuits of depth $\tilde
O(\log n \cdot \log \kappa)$, and in particular one can approximate the
determinant for sufficiently well-conditioned matrices in depth $\tilde{O}(\log
n)$. Our algorithm combines Barvinok's recent complex-analytic approach for
approximating combinatorial counting problems [Bar16] with the
Valiant-Berkowitz-Skyum-Rackoff depth-reduction theorem for low-degree
arithmetic circuits [Val83].

to enhance the meaningfulness of the mined patterns with high-impact aspects
related to novelty, serendipity, and ethics. Surprisingly, in the classic
problem of influence maximization in social networks, relatively little study
has been devoted to diversity and its integration into the objective function
of an influence maximization method.
</p>
<p>In this work, we propose the integration of a side-information-based notion
of seed diversity into the objective function of a targeted influence
maximization problem. Starting from the assumption that side-information is
available at node level in the general form of categorical attribute values, we
design a class of monotone submodular functions specifically conceived for
determining the diversity within a set of categorical profiles associated with
the seeds to be discovered. This allows us to develop an efficient scalable
approximate method, with a constant-factor guarantee of optimality. More
precisely, we formulate the attribute-based diversity-sensitive targeted
influence maximization problem under the state-of-the-art reverse influence
sampling framework, and we develop a method, dubbed ADITUM, that ensures a
(1-1/e-\epsilon)-approximate solution under the general triggering diffusion
model. We experimentally evaluated ADITUM on five real-world networks,
including comparison with methods that exploit numerical-attribute-based
diversity and topology-driven diversity in influence maximization.

relies on graph coloring. Hence, an efficient graph coloring algorithm is of
paramount importance. In this work we try to learn a good heuristic for
coloring interference graphs that are used in the register allocation phase. We
aim to handle moderate sized interference graphs which have 100 nodes or less.
For such graphs we can get the optimal allocation of colors to the nodes. Such
optimal coloring is then used to train our Deep Learning network which is based
on several layers of LSTM that output a color for each node of the graph.
However, the current network may allocate the same color to the nodes connected
by an edge resulting in an invalid coloring of the interference graph. Since it
is difficult to encode constraints in an LSTM to avoid invalid coloring, we
augment our deep learning network with a color correction phase that runs after
the colors have been allocated by the network. Thus, our algorithm is hybrid in
nature consisting of a mix of a deep learning algorithm followed by a more
traditional correction phase. We have trained our network using several
thousand random graphs of varying sparsity. On application of our hybrid
algorithm to various popular graphs found in literature we see that our
algorithm does very well when compared to the optimal coloring of these graphs.
We have also run our algorithm against LLVMs popular greedy register allocator
for several SPEC CPU 2017 benchmarks and notice that the hybrid algorithm
performs on par or better than such a well-tuned allocator for most of these
benchmarks.

streaming problems of sliding window queries over data streams. Given a stream
of 0's and 1's, the purpose of this problem is to estimate the number of 1's in
the last N elements (or time units) seen from the stream. Its solution can be
used as building blocks to solve numerous more complex problems such as heavy

the flattened exponential histogram (FEH) model for the Basic Counting problem.
Our model improves over the exponential histogram [1], [2], a well-received
deterministic technique for Basic Counting problem, with respect to accuracy
and memory utilization most of the time in practice. Extensive experimental
results on real-world datasets show that with the same memory footprint, the
accuracy of our model is between 4 to 15 and on average 7 times better than
that of the exponential histogram, while the speed is roughly the same.

group of solvers for large scale linear Least Squares (LS) problems, are
proposed and analyzed in detail. The proposed techniques are obtained by
incorporating the Heavy Ball Acceleration into the Iterative Hessian Sketch
algorithm and they provide significant improvements over the randomized
preconditioning techniques. Through the error analyses of the M-IHS variants,
lower bounds on the sketch size for various randomized distributions to
converge at a pre-determined rate with a constant probability are established.
The bounds present the best results in the current literature for obtaining a
solution approximation and they suggest that the sketch size can be chosen
proportional to the statistical dimension of the regularized problem regardless
of the size of the coefficient matrix. The statistical dimension is always
smaller than the rank and it gets smaller as the regularization parameter
increases. By using approximate solvers along with the iterations, the M-IHS
variants are capable of avoiding all matrix decompositions and inversions,
which is one of the main advantages over the alternative solvers such as the
Blendenpik and the LSRN. Similar to the Chebyshev Semi-iterations, the M-IHS
variants do not use any inner products and eliminate the corresponding
synchronizations steps in hierarchical or distributed memory systems, yet the
M-IHS converges faster than the Chebyshev Semi-iteration based solvers.

optimization task. While hard in general, recent years have brought about vast
progress for solving structurally restricted, (non-mixed) ILPs: $n$-fold,
tree-fold, 2-stage stochastic and multi-stage stochastic programs admit
efficient algorithms, and all of these special cases are subsumed by the class
of ILPs of small treedepth.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we extend this line of work to the mixed case, by showing an
algorithm solving MILP in time $f(a,d) \textrm{poly}(n)$, where $a$ is the
largest coefficient of the constraint matrix, $d$ is its treedepth, and $n$ is
the number of variables.
</p>
<p>This is enabled by proving bounds on the denominators of the vertices of
bounded-treedepth (non-integer) linear programs. We do so by carefully
analyzing the inverses of invertible submatrices of the constraint matrix. This
allows us to afford scaling up the mixed program to the integer grid, and
applying the known methods for integer programs.
</p>
<p>We trace the limiting boundary of our approach, showing that naturally
related classes of linear programs have vertices of unbounded fractionality.
Finally, we show that restricting the structure of only the integral variables
in the constraint matrix does not yield tractable special cases.

orthogonality, tangency, etc. Both libraries work in spaces with any dimension

from an arbitrary distribution over $[-1,1]^n$, arrive one-by-one and must be
immediately given a $\pm$ sign. The goal is to keep the discrepancy small as
possible. A concrete example is the online interval discrepancy problem where
$T$ points are sampled uniformly in $[0,1]$, and the goal is to immediately
color them $\pm$ such that every sub-interval remains nearly balanced. As
random coloring incurs $\Omega(T^{1/2})$ discrepancy, while the offline bounds
are $\Theta((n\log T)^{1/2})$ for vector balancing and 1 for interval
balancing, a natural question is whether one can (nearly) match the offline
bounds in the online setting for these problems. One must utilize the
stochasticity as in the worst-case scenario it is known that discrepancy is
$\Omega(T^{1/2})$ for any online algorithm.
</p>
<p>Bansal and Spencer recently show an $O(\sqrt{n}\log T)$ bound when each
coordinate is independent. When there are dependencies among the coordinates,
the problem becomes much more challenging, as evidenced by a recent work of
Jiang, Kulkarni, and Singla that gives a non-trivial $O(T^{1/\log\log T})$
bound for online interval discrepancy. Although this beats random coloring, it
is still far from the offline bound.
</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce a new framework for online vector balancing when
the input distribution has dependencies across coordinates. This lets us obtain
a poly$(n, \log T)$ bound for online vector balancing under arbitrary input
distributions, and a poly$(\log T)$ bound for online interval discrepancy. Our
framework is powerful enough to capture other well-studied geometric
discrepancy problems; e.g., a poly$(\log^d (T))$ bound for the online
$d$-dimensional Tus\'nady's problem. A key new technical ingredient is an {\em
anti-concentration} inequality for sums of pairwise uncorrelated random
variables.

<p>Longest common subsequence (LCS) and edit distance (ED) are fundamental similarity measures of interest to genomic applications (insertions/deletions/substitutions are a pretty good proxy for both mutations and read errors). The fastest known algorithms for computing the LCS/ED between two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" />-character strings run in nearly quadratic time. Breakthroughs in fine-grained complexity <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0348">[BI18]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06022">[AHWW16]</a> from the last few years provide some nice formal barriers further progress: in particular, substantially faster algorithms would refute <em>NC-SETH</em>, the hypothesis that given an NC circuit with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n" class="latex" title="n" /> input bits,  deciding if the circuit has any satisfying assignment requires <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%281-o%281%29%29n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="2^{(1-o(1))n}" class="latex" title="2^{(1-o(1))n}" /> time. (Note that this is a weaker, aka safer, hypothesis than the standard SETH.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Quantum algorithms for edit distance?</h2>
<p>One way to try to circumvent the computational barriers is by approximation algorithms (see my <a href="https://theorydish.blog/2018/07/20/approximating-edit-distance/">blog post</a>). A different approach is to go with quantum algorithms: Grover’s search can solve NC-SAT in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="2^{n/2}" class="latex" title="2^{n/2}" /> time. Even those of us less skeptic than <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/11/13/gils-collegial-quantum-supremacy-skepticism-faq/">Gil Kalai</a> can probably agree that quadratic quantum speedups won’t be practical anytime soon. But in theory, I find the question of whether we can design subquadratic quantum algorithms for edit distance very interesting (see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04178">[BEG+18]</a>).</p>
<p>Alas, even with the power of quantum computers we don’t know any truly subquadratic algorithms for computing LCS/ED. On the other hand, it is not clear how to rule out even linear-time algorithms. A few weeks ago, Buhrman, Patro, and Speelman, posted a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05686">paper</a> that gives a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> quantum <em>query complexity </em>lower bound for LCS/ED.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open Problem: Close the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> vs <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^2" class="latex" title="n^2" /> gap for quantum query complexity of ED/LCS.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is “query complexity” of ED/LCS? Buhrman et al. consider the following query model: In LCS, we want a <strong>maximum monotone matching</strong> between the characters of the two strings, where we can match two characters if they’re identical. Now suppose that in the query complexity problem we still want to find a maximum monotone matching, but instead of the character-equality graph (which is a union of disjoint cliques), we have an arbitrary bipartite graph, and <strong>given a pair of vertices, the oracle tells you if there is an edge between them</strong>.</p>
<p>This model may seem a bit counter-intuitive at first since the graphs may not correspond to any pair of strings; and indeed other models have been considered before <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321922">[UAH76]</a><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4033">[AKO10]</a>. But it turns out that this model is well-motivated by the NC-SETH lower bound (see discussion below).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The ultimate hardness hypothesis</h2>
<p>What does the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7B3%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="n^{3/2}" class="latex" title="n^{3/2}" /> query complexity lower bound mean for algorithms on actual strings? Instead of a black box oracle, our algorithms have access to an NC-circuit that implements it. Intuitively, we don’t know how to do very much with white box circuits, so it seems plausible to hypothesize that the running time will be lower bound by the query complexity. In some sense, this is a special case of the following <em>ultimate hardness hypothesis </em>that unifies a lot of the computational hardness assumptions that we like to assume but have no idea how to prove (e.g. P!=NP, P!=BQP, NC-SETH, FP!=PPAD, etc):</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ultimate Hardness Hypothesis] For every problem, the white-box computational complexity is lower bounded by the black-box query complexity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In communication complexity similar statements are known and are called simulation/lifting theorems (see e.g. <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~mika/thesis.pdf">Mika’s thesis</a>). For computational complexity, there are obvious counter examples such as “decide if the oracle can be implemented by a small circuit”. So it only makes sense to continue to assume the ultimate hardness hypothesis for “reasonable problems” instead of “every problem”.</p>
<p>But Burhman et al. identify the following variant of the ultimate hardness hypothesis which I find very interesting. It is defined with respect to a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T%3A%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D%5E%7B2%5En%7D+%5Crightarrow+%5C%7B0%2C1%5C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" class="latex" title="T:\{0,1\}^{2^n} \rightarrow \{0,1\}" /> which takes as input the truth-table of a circuit and outputs True or False. Roughly, they hypothesize that:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Burhman et al.-QSETH, paraphrased] For <em>every</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" />, deciding if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="T" class="latex" title="T" /> is true or false is as hard whether we’re given the actual circuit, or only the guarantee that the oracle is implemented by a small circuit”</p></blockquote>
<p>At a first read, I thought that arguments a-la impossibility of obfuscation <a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2001/21390001.pdf">[BGI+01]</a> should refute this hypothesis, but a few weeks later I still don’t know how to prove it. Do you?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>A tip for the upcoming holidays</h2>
<p>During my postdoc, I worked on the quantum query complexity of ED/LCS with Shalev Ben-David, Rolando La Placa, and John Wright. I was a bit bummed to find out that we got scooped by Buhrman et al, but I know of at least 3 other groups that were also scooped by the same paper, so at least we’re in good company <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>At the time, a fellow postdoc from Psychology asked me what I was working on. I resisted the temptation to try to explain the various quantum variants of NC-SETH, and instead told him I was working on “DNA sequencing with quantum computers”. His reaction was priceless. Regardless of what you’re actually working on, try this line during the holidays when your relatives ask you about your work.</p>

<i>                     What can be computed: A Practical Guide to the Theory of Computation</i><br />
<i>                     by John MacCormick</i><br />
<br />
<br />
and I need YOUR help for the first SENTENCE.  I began by saying<br />
<br />
<br />
                    This is a text book for a course on <i>Formal Language Theory</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
but then I realized that this is not what we call the course at UMCP. Then I got to thinking: what do other schools call it? I have the following so far:<br />
<br />
UMCP: Elementary Theory of Computation<br />
<br />
Harvard: Introduction to Theory of Computation<br />
<br />
MIT: Automata, Computability, and, Complexity<br />
<br />
Clark: Automata Theory<br />
<br />
(My spellcheck does not think Automata is a word. Also Computability. Usually I listen to my spellcheckers, but I checked and YES, I spelled them right.)<br />
<br />
For some other schools I either hit a place I needed an account, or I just got titles without a description so I could not be sure.<br />
<br />This is where YOU come in!<br />
<br />
Please leave comments with your school and the title of the course at your school that covers a reasonable overlap with: Regular Sets, Context Free Sets, Decidable and Undecidble and r.e. sets, P, NP, perhaps other complexity classes, and NP-completeness. Its FINE if your answer is one of the above ones, or one of the other comments--- I plan to later set this up as a pigeonhole principle problem.<br />
<br />
I suspect that courses in algorithms are called <i>Algorithms </i>or <i>Introduction to Algorithms.</i><br />
<i><br /></i>
I suspect that courses in cryptography are called <i>Cryptography </i><i> </i>or <i>Intro to Cryptography.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
Why does the non-algorithm, non-crypto theory course have more names?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<i><br /></i>

Héctor Garcia-Molina <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2019/12/06/hector-garcia-molina-influential-computer-scientist-database-expert-dies-65/">died</a> just before Thanksgiving. He was a computer scientist and Professor in both the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I write in sadness about his passing and to express some personal appreciations. </p>
<p>
We at GLL have talked about him before. See <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2015/03/08/lint-for-math/">this</a> for his story about the fun of using an IBM mainframe for teaching. Or see <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/whos-afraid-of-arrows-paradox/">this</a> for a story about Héctor and meetings.</p>
<p>
I, Dick, had the pleasure to have worked with him, while we were both faculty at Princeton in the 1980’s and beyond.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> His Clock </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor was the chair of the Stanford Computer Science Department from January 2001 to December 2004. Stanford then rotated the chair so all took their turn. I know that he “hated” being an administrator in general. But of course being a team player he took his turn. </p>
<p>
One way to see his real feelings about being a chair was to look at the clock his students constructed for him. The clock was a digital timer that counted down the seconds that remained in his term as the chair. It started at roughly 126227808. I am sure he did fine, but the clock was a statement. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> His Worst Paper </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
While Héctor was at Princeton we worked together on a project—the <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2010/05/20/sorting-out-chess-endgames/">MMM</a> project. It led to one of his least cited papers—a 1984 <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1676454">paper</a> with me and Jacobo Valdes. OK, it has 48 citations according to IEEE. The idea of the project was to use memory rather than processors to speed up computations. He was a joy to work with: he was careful, and thoughtful, and just fun to work with on any project. </p>
<p>
We did write a second <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AMrcBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=The+Massive+Memory+Machine+Project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_QFT07G56P&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-KV060yO3PHRllCnj3Y5o10BX-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7o67o-abmAhXHwFkKHRfzDs4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The Massive Memory Machine Project&amp;f=false">paper</a> with Richard Cullingford instead of Valdes, which Héctor presented at a meeting on knowledge-based management systems. The above Google Books link goes to the end with a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AMrcBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=The+Massive+Memory+Machine+Project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_QFT07G56P&amp;sig=ACfU3U0-KV060yO3PHRllCnj3Y5o10BX-w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7o67o-abmAhXHwFkKHRfzDs4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The Massive Memory Machine Project&amp;f=false">discussion</a> in which a simple issue was raised—we paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Won’t it take forever just to write all zeros to the memory? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Héctor had a scientist’s answer: the project was still not at the prototype stage so he didn’t know. He said the project should be viewed as a scientific experiment to find out. Maybe he also had an inkling that what was coming was a decade of breakthroughs in CPU design and parallel/pipeline processing after all. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> His Predictions </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor was unparalleled at seeing the future. I always thought that one of his abilities, one that set him apart, was his ability to predict directions of research. This allowed him, and his students, to write early papers in research areas before they became hot. This is one of the talents that made him so amazing.</p>
<p>
I recall way before the world wide web was created he had students working on adding links to documents. I recall a talk by one of his students at Princeton that discussed what we now call URLs. One question that was raised during the talk was: How were the links going to be created? There was a lively discussion about this. Could they be created automatically? If not why would people take the time to create the links? Indeed.</p>
<p>
Héctor saw that links would be created. That people would take the effort to create them. I must admit that he was right, and he saw the future better than most. I wish I had a fraction of his ability to see directions like he did.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Guiding Students </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor told me that when he first got to Stanford the fund managers and investors roamed the halls. They would ask anyone they could if they had an idea for a company or a startup. It was a constant issue that Héctor had to deal with. They were continually trying to steal away students. </p>
<p>
He told me he felt like he was the head of an abbey and was always having to protect his charges within the walls.</p>
<p>
When the impetus came from within it was different. Of course, Héctor was the advisor of Sergey Brin at the time he and Larry Page conceived Google. Brin and Page found that their search engine prototypes were so good the dataflow was constantly straining Stanford’s machines. They needed to scrounge for more disks and processors to mount their servers. Héctor already oversaw the Stanford Digital Libraries Project and he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/04/8-surprising-facts-you-might-not-know-about-googles-early-days.html">arranged</a> for funds to purchase spare parts for the data servers. </p>
<p>
It is interesting that in this 2001 <a href="https://sigmod.org/publications/interviews/pdf/hector-final1.pdf">interview</a> in the <em>SIGMOD Record</em>, Héctor did not have a high opinion of the industrial side of his area:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Again, I don’t think industry really does very much research. They come up with an idea and they try to sell it. If it was a good idea, maybe they will make money. Even if it was a bad idea, if they have good marketing people, they might still make money and we never know … I don’t think they have an advantage over [academics] in testing the ideas and evaluating them and performing measurements and really understanding what are the right techniques. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In the same interview, he had sage advice for students after completing their PhDs and during the tenure process, mainly on the side of not trying to play the system but focus on doing what you love.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Stanford Home Team </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Héctor had been a graduate student at Stanford. So his return there as a professor was a kind of homecoming. He was a home-team player in many senses. One of them is shown by this photo:</p>

He was a registered Stanford sports photographer. He also taught a course at Stanford on photography. We don’t know if he had special insights on detecting “deepfake” photos and videos. </p>

Our condolences go to all his family. Héctor you will be missed. You are missed. </p>

A covering code is a set of codewords with the property that the union of balls, suitably defined, around these codewords covers an entire space. Generally, the goal is to find the covering code with the minimum size codebook. While most prior work on covering codes has focused on the Hamming metric, we consider the problem of designing covering codes defined in terms of  insertions and  deletions. First, we provide new sphere-covering lower bounds on the minimum possible size of such codes. Then, we provide new existential upper bounds on the size of optimal covering codes for a single insertion or a single deletion that are tight up to a constant factor. Finally, we derive improved upper bounds for covering codes using $R\geq 2$ insertions or deletions. We prove that codes exist with density that is only a factor $O(R \log R)$ larger than the lower bounds for all fixed $R$. In particular, our upper bounds have an optimal dependence on the word length, and we achieve asymptotic density matching the best known bounds for Hamming distance covering codes.</div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
The query model offers a concrete setting where quantum algorithms are provably superior to randomized algorithms. Beautiful results by Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon,  Aaronson, and others presented partial Boolean functions that can be computed by quantum algorithms making much fewer queries compared to their randomized analogs. To date, separations of $O(1)$ vs. $\sqrt{N}$ between quantum and randomized query complexities remain the state-of-the-art (where $N$ is the input length), leaving open the question of whether $O(1)$ vs. $N^{1/2+\Omega(1)}$ separations are possible?

We answer this question in the affirmative. Our separating problem is a variant of the Aaronson-Ambainis $k$-fold Forrelation problem. We show that our variant:
(1) Can be solved by a quantum algorithm making $2^{O(k)}$ queries to the inputs.
(2) Requires at least $\tilde{\Omega}(N^{2(k-1)/(3k-1)})$ queries for any randomized algorithm.

For any constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, this gives a  $O(1)$  vs. $N^{2/3-\varepsilon}$ separation between the quantum and randomized query complexities of partial Boolean functions. 

Our proof is Fourier analytical and uses new bounds on the Fourier spectrum of classical decision trees, which could be of independent interest. 

Looking forward, we conjecture that the Fourier bounds could be further improved in a precise manner, and show that such conjectured bounds imply optimal $O(1)$ vs. $N^{1-\varepsilon}$ separations between the quantum and randomized query complexities of partial Boolean functions.</div>

We show that the size of any regular resolution refutation of Tseitin formula $T(G,c)$ based on a graph $G$ is at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G)/\log n)}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$ and $tw(G)$ is the treewidth of $G$. For constant degree graphs there is known upper bound $2^{O(tw(G))}$ [AR11, GTT18], so our lower bound is tight up to a logarithmic factor in the exponent.

In order to prove this result we show that any regular resolution proof of Tseitin formula $T(G,c)$ of size $S$ can be converted to a read-once branching program computing satisfiable Tseitin formula $T(G,c')$ of size $S^{O(\log n)}$. Then we show that any read-once branching program computing satisfiable Tseitin formula $T(G,c')$ has size at least $2^{\Omega(tw(G))}$; the latter improves the recent result of Glinskih and Itsykson [GI19].</div>

A pseudo-deterministic algorithm is a (randomized) algorithm which, when run multiple times on the same input, with high probability outputs the same result on all executions. Classic streaming algorithms, such as those for finding heavy hitters, approximate counting, $\ell_2$ approximation, finding a nonzero entry in a vector (for turnstile algorithms) are not pseudo-deterministic. For example, in the instance of finding a nonzero entry in a vector, for any known low-space algorithm $A$, there exists a stream $x$ so that running $A$ twice on $x$ (using different randomness) would with high probability result in two different entries as the output.

In this work, we study whether it is inherent that these algorithms output different values on different executions. That is, we ask whether these problems have low-memory pseudo-deterministic algorithms. For instance, we show that there is no low-memory pseudo-deterministic algorithm for finding a nonzero entry in a vector (given in a turnstile fashion), and also that there is no low-dimensional pseudo-deterministic sketching algorithm for $\ell_2$ norm estimation.  We also exhibit problems which do have low memory pseudo-deterministic algorithms but no low memory deterministic algorithm, such as outputting a nonzero row of a matrix, or outputting a basis for the row-span of a matrix.

We also investigate multi-pseudo-deterministic algorithms: algorithms which with high probability output one of a few options. We show the first lower bounds for such algorithms. This implies that there are streaming problems such that every low space algorithm for the problem must have inputs where there are many valid outputs, all with a significant probability of being outputted.</div>

<p>We hit the mother-lode of property testing papers this month. Stick with us, as we cover 10 (!) papers that appeared online in November.</p>



<p>EDIT: We actually have 11 papers, check out <em>Optimal Adaptive Detection of Monotone Patterns</em> at the bottom.</p>



<p><strong>Testing noisy linear functions for sparsity</strong>, by Xue Chen, Anindya De, and Rocco A. Servedio (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00911">arXiv</a>). Given samples from a noisy linear model \(y = w\cdot x + \mathrm{noise}\), test whether \(w\) is \(k\)-sparse, or far from being \(k\)-sparse. This is a property testing version of the celebrated sparse recovery problem, whose sample complexity is well-known to be \(O(k\log n)\), where the data lies in \(\mathbb{R}^n\). This paper shows that the testing version of the problem can be solved (tolerantly) with a number of samples independent of \(n\), assuming technical conditions: the distribution of coordinates of \(x\) are i.i.d. and non-Gaussian, and the noise distribution is known to the algorithm. Surprisingly, all these conditions are needed, otherwise the dependence on \(n\) is \(\tilde \Omega(\log n)\), essentially the same as the recovery problem.</p>



<p><strong>Pan-Private Uniformity Testing</strong>, by Kareem Amin, Matthew Joseph, Jieming Mao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01452">arXiv</a>). Differentially private distribution testing has now seen significant study, in both the local and central models of privacy. This paper studies a distribution testing in the pan-private model, which is intermediate: the algorithm receives samples one by one in the clear, but it must maintain a differentially private internal state at all time steps. The sample complexity turns out to be qualitatively intermediate to the two other models: testing uniformity over \([k]\) requires \(\Theta(\sqrt{k})\) samples in the central model, \(\Theta(k)\) samples in the local model, and this paper shows that \(\Theta(k^{2/3})\) samples are necessary and sufficient in the pan-private model.</p>



<p><strong>Almost Optimal Testers for Concise Representations</strong>, by Nader Bshouty (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/156/">ECCC</a>). This work gives a unified approach for testing for a plethora of different classes which possess some sort of <em>sparsity</em>. These classes include \(k\)-juntas, \(k\)-linear functions, \(k\)-terms, various types of DNFs, decision lists, functions with bounded Fourier degree, and much more. </p>



<p><strong>Unified Sample-Optimal Property Estimation in Near-Linear Time</strong>, by Yi Hao and Alon Orlitsky (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03105">arXiv</a>). This paper presents a unified approach for estimating several distribution properties with both near-optimal time and sample complexity, based on piecewise-polynomial approximation. Some applications include estimators for Shannon entropy, power sums, distance to uniformity,  normalized support size, and normalized support coverage. More generally, results hold for all Lipschitz properties, and consequences include high-confidence property estimation (outperforming the “median trick”) and differentially private property estimation.</p>



<p><strong>Testing linear-invariant properties</strong>, by Jonathan Tidor and Yufei Zhao (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06793">arXiv</a>). This paper studies property testing of functions which are in a formal sense, definable by restrictions to subspaces of bounded degree. This class of functions is a broad generalization of testing whether a function is linear, or a degree-\(d\) polynomial (for constant \(d\)). The algorithm is the oblivious one, which simply repeatedly takes random restrictions and tests whether the property is satisfied or not (similar to the classic linearity test of BLR, along with many others). </p>



<p><strong>Approximating the Distance to Monotonicity of Boolean Functions</strong>, by Ramesh Krishnan S. Pallavoor, Sofya Raskhodnikova, Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/163/">ECCC</a>). This paper studies the following fundamental question in tolerant testing: given a Boolean function on the hypercube, test whether it is \(\varepsilon’\)-close or \(\varepsilon\)-far from monotone. It is shown that there is a non-adaptive polynomial query algorithm which can solve this problem for \(\varepsilon’ = \varepsilon/\tilde \Theta(\sqrt{n})\), implying an algorithm which can approximate distance to monotonicity up to a multiplicative \(\tilde O(\sqrt{n})\) (addressing an <a href="https://ptreview.sublinear.info/?p=250">open problem</a> by Sesh). They also give a lower bound demonstrating that improving this approximating factor significantly would necessitate exponentially-many queries. Interestingly, this is proved for the (easier) erasure-resilient model, and also implies lower bounds for tolerant testing of unateness and juntas.</p>



<p><strong>Testing Properties of Multiple Distributions with Few Samples</strong>, by Maryam Aliakbarpour and Sandeep Silwal (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07324">arXiv</a>). This paper introduces a new model for distribution testing. Generally, we are given \(n\) samples from a distribution which is either (say) uniform or far from uniform, and we wish to test which is the case. The authors here study the problem where we are given a <em>single sample</em> from \(n\) different distributions which are either all uniform or far from uniform, and we wish to test which is the case. By additionally assuming a structural condition in the latter case (it is argued that <em>some</em> structural condition is necessary), they give sample-optimal algorithms for testing uniformity, identity, and closeness.</p>



<p><strong>Random Restrictions of High-Dimensional Distributions and Uniformity Testing with Subcube Conditioning</strong>, by Clément L. Canonne, Xi Chen, Gautam Kamath, Amit Levi, and Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/165/">ECCC</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07357">arXiv</a>). By now, it is well-known that testing uniformity over the \(n\)-dimensional hypercube requires \(\Omega(2^{n/2})\) samples — the curse of dimensionality quickly makes this problem intractable. One option is to assume that the distribution is product, which causes the complexity to drop to \(O(\sqrt{n})\). This paper instead assumes one has stronger access to the distribution — namely, one can receive samples conditioned on being from some subcube of the domain. With this, the paper shows that the complexity drops to the near-optimal \(\tilde O(\sqrt{n})\) samples. The related problem of testing whether a distribution is either uniform or has large mean is also considered. </p>



<p><strong>Property Testing of LP-Type Problems</strong>, by Rogers Epstein, Sandeep Silwal (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08320">arXiv</a>). An LP-Type problem (also known as a generalized linear program) is an optimization problem sharing some properties with linear programs. More formally, they consist of a set of constraints \(S\) and a function \(\varphi\) which maps subsets of \(S\) to some totally ordered set, such that \(\varphi\) possesses monotonicity and locality properties. This paper considers the problem of testing whether \(\varphi(S) \leq k\), or whether at least an \(\varepsilon\)-fraction of constraints in \(S\) must be removed for \(\varphi(S) \leq k\) to hold. This paper gives an algorithm with query complexity \(O(\delta/\varepsilon)\), where \(\delta\) is a dimension measure of the problem. This is applied to testing problems for linear separability, smallest enclosing ball, smallest intersecting ball, smallest volume annulus. The authors also provide lower bounds for some of these problems as well.</p>



<p><strong>Near-Optimal Algorithm for Distribution-Free Junta Testing</strong>, by Xiaojin Zhang (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10833">arXiv</a>). This paper presents an (adaptive) algorithm for testing juntas, in the distribution-free model with one-sided error. The query complexity is \(\tilde O(k/\varepsilon)\), which is nearly optimal. Algorithms with this sample complexity were previously known under the uniform distribution, or with two-sided error, but this is the first paper to achieve it in the distribution-free model with one-sided error.</p>



<p><strong>Optimal Adaptive Detection of Monotone Patterns</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Shoham Letzter, Erik Waingarten (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01169">arXiv</a>). Consider the problem of testing whether a function has no monotone increasing subsequences of length \(k\), versus being \(\varepsilon\)-far from having this property. Note that this is a generalization of testing whether a function is monotone (decreasing), which corresponds to the case \(k = 2\). This work shows that the adaptive sample complexity of this problem is \(O_{k,\varepsilon}(\log n)\), matching the lower bound for monotonicity testing. This is in comparison to the non-adaptive sample complexity, which is \(O_{k,\varepsilon}((\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k\rfloor})\). In fact, the main result provides a certificate of being far, in the form of a monotone increasing subsequence of length \(k\).</p></div>

<p><em>By Preetum Nakkiran, Gal Kaplun, Yamini Bansal, Tristan Yang, Boaz Barak, and Ilya Sutskever</em></p>



<p><em>This is a lightly edited and expanded version of the following post on the <a href="https://openai.com/blog/deep-double-descent/">OpenAI blog</a> about the following <a href="http://mltheory.org/deep.pdf">paper</a>. While I usually don’t advertise my own papers on this blog, I thought this might be of interest to theorists, and a good follow up to <a href="https://windowsontheory.org/2019/11/15/puzzles-of-modern-machine-learning/">my prior post</a>. I promise not to make a habit out of it. –Boaz</em></p>



<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>   <a href="http://mltheory.org/deep.pdf">Our paper</a> shows that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">double descent</a> occurs in conventional modern deep learning settings: visual classification in the presence of label noise (CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100) and machine translation (IWSLT’14 and WMT’14). As we increase the number of parameters in a neural network, initially the test error decreases, then increases, and then, just as the model is able to fit the train set, it undergoes a second descent, again decreasing as the number of parameters increases. This behavior also extends over train epochs, where a single model undergoes double-descent in test error over the course of training. Surprisingly (at least to us!), we show these phenomenon can lead to a regime where “<em><strong>more data hurts</strong></em>”—training a deep network on a larger train set actually performs worse.</p>



<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Open a statistics textbook and you are likely to see warnings against the danger of “overfitting”: If you are trying to find a good classifier or regressor for a given set of labeled examples, you would be well-advised to steer clear of having so many parameters in your model that you are able to completely fit the training data, because you risk not generalizing to new data.</p>



<p>The canonical example for this is polynomial regression. Suppose that we get <em>n</em> samples of the form <em>(x, p(x)+noise)</em> where <em>x</em> is a real number and <em>p(x)</em> is a cubic (i.e. degree 3) polynomial. If we try to fit the samples with a degree 1 polynomial—-a linear function, then we would get many points wrong. If we try to fit it with just the right degree, we would get a very good predictor. However, as the degree grows, we get worse till the degree is large enough to fit all the noisy training points, at which point the regressor is terrible, as shown in this figure:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H4f4ST5B9RnLX1ski6HEI7RBV5gqvk7WGiFR0qf6Savafmep6i08RYlpF5sgtq9oVqQ6ZkuglvCn0PTMQ_uaK3XStJlSskTSM6I52SyCZ91FeAcphq11MKa56wsfnDAG6GuruTT3" alt="" /></figure>



<p>It seems that the higher the degree, the worse things are, but what happens if we go <em>even higher</em>? It seems like a crazy idea—-why would we increase the degree beyond the number of samples? But it corresponds to the practice of having many more  parameters than training samples in modern deep learning. Just like in deep learning, when the degree is larger than the number of samples, there is more than one polynomial that fits the data– but we choose a specific one: the one found running gradient descent.</p>



<p>Here is what happens if we do this for degree 1000, fitting a polynomial using gradient descent (see <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oMuUz3_BOENSoaOVOymLoB2mHeYBex8S">this notebook</a>):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DjQoPWG5gCueu_sAORKtrhNrrWY35OU3y-RXKJx0AZxIofVzZo-psP-JFsr_a4v20pWhH7EFfFPozckotWzvKypEebkPRJmdSa3vuy39ABdp2PqtqMr7dPX1PTDfMT362n4dGzVG" alt="" /></figure>



<p>We still fit all the training points, but now we do so in a more controlled way which actually tracks quite closely the ground truth. We see that despite what we learn in statistics textbooks, sometimes overfitting is not that bad, as long as you go “all in” rather than “barely overfitting” the data. That is, overfitting doesn’t hurt us if we take the number of parameters to be much larger than what is needed to just fit the training set — and in fact, as we see in deep learning, larger models are often better.</p>



<p>The above is not a novel observation. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11118">Belkin et al </a>called this phenomenon <strong><em>“double descent”</em></strong> and this goes back to <a href="http://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op01.pdf">even</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03667">earlier</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09349">works</a><a href="http://www.ki.tu-berlin.de/fileadmin/fg135/publikationen/opper/Op03b.pdf"> </a>. In this <a href="http://mltheory.org/deep.pdf">new paper</a> we (Preetum Nakkiran, Gal Kaplun, Yamini Bansal, Tristan Yang, Boaz Barak, and Ilya Sutskever) extend the prior works and report on a variety of experiments showing that “double descent” is widely prevalent across several modern deep neural networks and for several natural tasks such as image recognition (for the CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100 datasets) and language translation (for IWSLT’14 and WMT’14 datasets).  As we increase the number of parameters in a neural network, initially the test error decreases, then increases, and then, just as the model is able to fit the train set, it undergoes a <em>second descent,</em> again decreasing as the number of parameters increases.  Moreover, double descent also extends beyond number of parameters to other measures of “complexity” such as the number of training epochs of the algorithm. </p>



<p>The take-away from our work (and the prior works it builds on) is that neither the classical statisticians’ conventional wisdom that <strong><em>“too large models are worse”</em></strong> nor the modern ML paradigm that <strong><em>“bigger models are always better”</em></strong><em> </em>always hold. Rather it all depends on whether you are on the first or second descent.  Further more, these insights also allow us to generate natural settings in which even the age-old adage of <strong><em>“more data is always better”</em></strong> is violated!</p>



<p>In the rest of this blog post we present a few sample results from this recent paper.</p>



<h3 id="modelwisedoubledescent">Model-wise Double Descent</h3>



<p>We observed many cases in which, just like in the polynomial interpolation example above, the test error undergoes a “double descent” as we increase the complexity of the model. The figure below demonstrates one such example: we plot the test error as a function of the complexity of the model for ResNet18 networks. The complexity of the model is the width of the layers, and the dataset is CIFAR10 with 15% label noise. Notice that the peak in test error occurs around the “interpolation threshold”: when the models are just barely large enough to fit the train set. In all cases we’ve observed, changes which affect the interpolation threshold (such as changing the optimization algorithm, changing the number of train samples, or varying the amount of label noise) also affect the location of the test error peak correspondingly. </p>



<p>We found the double descent phenomena is most prominent in settings with added label noise— without it, the peak is much smaller and easy to miss. But adding label noise amplifies this general behavior and allows us to investigate it easily.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tFWTvNkFwG8Ljx8zp9X3Ul6aUZT9YmkwcNk07g6_EFUklZoBUd9MqApBEojLzOp9N7yndveLwg5A7uj_vxpGVofQ2QCe-bbMAguQB38cK4NhRfXBp-SWMDQUt9x44r6d_fMur7NO" alt="" /></figure>



<p></p>



<h3 id="samplewisenonmonotonicity">Sample-Wise Nonmonotonicity</h3>



<p>Using the model-wise double descent phenomenon we can obtain examples where training on <strong>more data actually hurts</strong>. To see this, let’s look at the effect of increasing the number of train samples on the test error vs. model size graph. The below plot shows Transformers trained on a language-translation task (with no added label noise):</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/YkuZGjuWGKoCcl1gNbQfaKO-96hX9ShcVZ_Dj0KlKddRZhgpMGtzs427zPuC9QwHOOKgmuV5E0aEKOU3zwhwpGmdiWwDDDBIk7hroJZfRLa7kXSThzwTDZoNSM8I2M9OfWxIW5X_" alt="" /></figure>



<p>On the one hand, (as expected) increasing the number of samples generally shifts the curve downwards towards lower test error. On the other hand, it also shifts the curve to the right: since more samples require larger models to fit, the interpolation threshold (and hence, the peak in test error) shifts to the right. For intermediate model sizes, these two effects combine, and we see that <strong>training on 4.5x more samples actually hurts test performance.</strong></p>



<h3 id="epochwisedoubledescent">Epoch-Wise Double Descent</h3>



<p><strong>There is a regime where training longer reverses overfitting.</strong> Let’s look closer at the experiment from the “Model-wise Double Descent” section, and plot Test Error as a function of both model-size and number of optimization steps. In the plot below to the right, each column tracks the Test Error of a given model over the course of training. The top horizontal dotted-line corresponds to the double-descent of the first figure. But we can also see that for a fixed large model, as training proceeds test error goes down, then up and down again—we call this phenomenon “epoch-wise double-descent.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SCP6M-txj9ax5g9cR9Ry27X2nF1sEJbpsfC9FiME5umNm-BxcHHBmhseuuWEm3mHMzo_0o5q-92ETcaU0OEXnhTmv_7MpOREaaeIMs7zbL9P5aFeqkXMYh8O8VN4FdASnAu0HOPI" alt="" /></figure>



<p>Moreover, if we plot the Train error of the same models and the corresponding interpolation contour (dotted line) we see that it exactly matches the ridge of high test error (on the right).</p>



<p><strong>In general, the peak of test error appears systematically when models are just barely able to fit the train set.</strong></p>



<p>Our intuition is that for models at the interpolation threshold, there is effectively only one model that fits the train data, and forcing it to fit even slightly-noisy or mis-specified labels will destroy its global structure. That is, there are no “good models”, which both interpolate the train set, and perform well on the test set. However in the over-parameterized regime, there are many models that fit the train set, and there exist “good models” which both interpolate the train set and perform well on the distribution. Moreover, the implicit bias of SGD leads it to such “good” models, for reasons we don’t yet understand.</p>



<p>The above intuition is theoretically justified for linear models, via a series of recent works including [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08560">Hastie et al.</a>] and [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05355">Mei-Montanari</a>]. We leave fully understanding the mechanisms behind double descent in deep neural networks as an important open question.</p>

<p>The experiments above are especially interesting (in our opinion) because of how they can inform ML theory: any theory of ML must be consistent with “double descent.” In particular, one ambitious hope for what it means to “theoretically explain ML” is to prove a theorem of the form:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“If the distribution satisfies property X and architecture/initialization satisfies property Y, then SGD trained on ‘n’ samples, for T steps, will have small test error with high probability”</p>



<p>For values of X, Y, n, T, “small” and “high” that are used in practice.</p>



<p>However, these experiments show that these properties are likely more subtle than we may have hoped for, and must be non-monotonic in certain natural parameters.</p>



<p>This rules out even certain natural “conditional conjectures” that we may have hoped for, for example the conjecture that</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“If SGD on a width W network works for learning from ‘n’ samples from distribution D, then SGD on a width W+1 network will work at least as well”</p>



<p>Or the conjecture</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“If SGD on a certain network and distribution works for learning with ‘n’ samples, then it will work at least as well with n+1 samples”</p>



<p>It also appears to conflict with a “2-phase” view of the trajectory of SGD, as an initial “learning phase” and then an “overfitting phase” — in particular, because the overfitting is sometimes reversed (at least, as measured by test error) by further training.</p>



<p>Finally, the fact that these phenomena are not specific to neural networks, but appear to hold fairly universally for natural learning methods (linear/kernel regression, decision trees, random features) gives us hope that there is a deeper phenomenon at work, and we are yet to find the right abstraction.</p>

A central question in the study of interactive proofs is the relationship between private-coin proofs, where the verifier is allowed to hide its randomness from the prover, and public-coin proofs, where the verifier's random coins are sent to the prover. 
	
	In this work, we study transformations from private-coin proofs to public-coin proofs, which preserve (up to polynomial factors) the running time of both the prover and the verifier. We re-consider this question in light of the emergence of doubly-efficient interactive proofs, where the honest prover is required to run in polynomial time. Can every private-coin doubly-efficient interactive proof be transformed into a public-coin doubly-efficient proof? We show that, assuming one-way functions exist, there is no black-box private-coin to public-coin transformation for doubly-efficient interactive proofs.
	
	Our main result is a (loose) converse: every doubly-efficient proof has a function such that if this function is invertible, then the proof can be efficiently transformed. 
	
	Turning our attention back to classic interactive proofs, where the honest prover need not run in polynomial time, we show a similar result for constant-round general interactive proofs. Finally, we demonstrate a condition that suffices for efficiency preserving emulation of any protocol (even if the number of rounds is polynomial and the honest prover is unbounded). For a given interactive proof, if for every transcript prefix it is possible to efficiently approximate the number of consistent verifier random coins, then there is an efficiency-preserving transformation.</div>

We show that there are degree-$d$ polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ with
correlation $\Omega(d/\sqrt{n})$ with the majority function on $n$
