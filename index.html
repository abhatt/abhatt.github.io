<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Google’s supremacy stone soup</span></h3>
<p>Here is a little update on the Google supremacy claims that we discussed in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/">this earlier post</a> (see especially <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/quantum-computers-amazing-progress-google-ibm-and-extraordinary-but-probably-false-supremacy-claims-google/#comment-61165">this remark</a>). Don’t miss <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2019/10/13/gerard-cornuejolss-bakers-eighteen-5000-dollars-conjectures/">our previous post</a> on combinatorics.</p>
<p>Recall that a quantum supremacy demonstration would be an experiment where a quantum computer can compute in 100 seconds something that requires a classical computer 10 hours. (Say.)</p>
<p>The Google experiment actually showed that a quantum computer running for 100 seconds PLUS a classic computer that runs 1000 hours can compute something that requires a classic computer 10 hours. (So, of course, this has no computational value, the Google experiment is a sort of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">stone soup</a>.)</p>
<p>The crucial mistake in the supremacy claims is that the researchers’ illusion of a calibration method toward a better quality of the quantum computer was in reality a tuning of the device toward a specific statistical goal for a specific circuit.</p>
<p>Let me remark that the mathematics of this mistake seems rather interesting and I plan to come back to it (see at the end of the post for a brief tentative account), and also that while the supremacy claim is false, Google’s calibration method is an interesting piece of experimental physics.</p>
<p>I personally hope that in spite of what appears (to me) to be a major setback, Google will maintain <strong>and enhance</strong> its  investments in quantum information research. We are still at a basic-science stage where we can expect the unexpected.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0000ff;">Detection statistical flaws using statistics</span></h3>
<p>Now, how can we statistically test such a flaw in a statistical experiment? This is also an interesting question and it reminded me of the following legend (See also <a href="http://ceadserv1.nku.edu/longa/confs/biomath2008/Poincare.html">here</a> (source of pictures below), <a href="https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/7299/poincar%C3%A9-and-the-baker-was-the-anecdote-true">here,</a> and <a href="https://houstonstatisticians.wordpress.com/2013/01/11/poincare-and-the-bakery/">here</a>) about Poincaré and the baker, which is often told in the context of using statistics for detection. I first heard it from Maya Bar-Hillel in the late 90s. Since this story <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2009/04/07/coffee-cigarettes-and-aggression/">never really happened</a> I tell it here a little differently. Famously, Poincaré did testify as an expert in a <a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/dreyfus.htm">famous trial</a> and his testimony was on matters related to statistics.</p>
<h2>The story of Poincaré and his friend the baker</h2>
<p>“My friend the baker,” said Poincaré, “I weighed every loaf of bread that I bought from you in the last year and the distribution is Gaussian with mean 950 grams. How can you claim that your average loaf is 1 kilogram?”</p>
<p><a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bakernormal.png"><img src="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bakernormal.png?w=640" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18269" /></a></p>
<p>“You are so weird, dear Henri,” the baker replied, “but I will take what you say into consideration.”*</p>
<p>A year later the two pals meet again</p>
<p>“How are you doing dear Henri” asked the baker “are my bread loaves heavy enough for you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, for me they are,” answered Poincaré “but when I weighed all the loaves last year I discovered that your mean value is still 950 grams.”</p>
<p>“How is this possible?” asked the baker</p>
<p>“I weighed your loaves all year long and I discovered that the weights represent a Gaussian distribution with mean 950 grams truncated at 1 kilogram. You make the same bread loaves as before but you keep the heavier ones for me!”</p>

<p>“Ha ha ha” said the baker “touché!”** and the baker continued “I also have something that will surprise you, Henri. I think there is a gap in your proof that 3-manifolds with homology of a sphere is a sphere. So if you don’t tell the bread police I won’t tell the wrong mathematical proofs police :)” joked the baker.</p>
<p>The rest of the story is history, the baker continued to bake bread loaves with an average weight of 950 grams and Poincaré constructed his famous Dodecahedral sphere and formulated the Poincaré conjecture. The friendship of Poincaré and the baker continued for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>*  “There are many bakeries in Paris” thought the baker “and every buyer can weight the quality, weight, cost, and convenience”.</p>

<p>The ideal distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" /> for a (freezed)  random circuit can be seen exponentially distributed probabilities depending on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" />.</p>
<p>The first order effect of the noise is to replace <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C" class="latex" title="D_C" /> by a convex combination <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=tD_C%2B%281-t%29J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="tD_C+(1-t)J" class="latex" title="tD_C+(1-t)J" /> with a uniform distribution <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=J&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="J" class="latex" title="J" />. (For low fidelity <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=t&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="t" class="latex" title="t" /> is rather small.)</p>
<p>The second order effect of the noise is adding a Gaussian fluctuation described by Gaussian-distributed probabilities <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_C" class="latex" title="G_C" /> . Like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=D_C%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="D_C," class="latex" title="D_C," /> these probabilities also depend on the circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" />.</p>
<p>For low fidelity, as in our case, the calibration mainly works in the range where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G_C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G_C" class="latex" title="G_C" /> is dominant and the calibration (slightly) “cancels” this Gaussian fluctuation. This does not calibrate the quantum computer but rather tweaks it toward the specific Gaussian contribution that depends on the circuit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="C" class="latex" title="C" />.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gérard Cornuéjols</span></p>
<p><a href="http://integer.tepper.cmu.edu/">Gérard Cornuéjols</a>‘s beautiful (and freely available) book from 2000 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245695625_Combinatorial_Optimization_Packing_and_Covering">Optimization: Packing and Covering</a> is about an important area of combinatorics which is lovely described in the preface to the book</p>
<blockquote><p>The integer programming models known as set packing and set covering have a wide range of applications, such as pattern recognition, plant location and airline crew scheduling. Sometimes, due to the special structure of the constraint matrix, the natural linear programming relaxation yields an optimal solution that is integer, thus solving the problem. Sometimes, both the linear programming relaxation and its dual have integer optimal solutions. Under which conditions do such integrality properties hold? This question is of both theoretical and practical interest. Min-max theorems, polyhedral combinatorics and graph theory all come together in this rich area of discrete mathematics. In addition to min-max and polyhedral results, some of the deepest results in this area come in two flavors: “excluded minor” results and “decomposition” results. In these notes, we present several of these beautiful results. Three chapters cover min-max and polyhedral results. The next four cover excluded minor results. In the last three, we present decomposition results.</p></blockquote>
<p>The last sentence of the preface gives this post some urgency</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>In particular, we state 18 conjectures. For each of these conjectures, we offer $5000 as an incentive for the first correct solution or refutation before December 2020.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>The book starts with Konig’s theorem, the first figure is the Petersen graph, and among the other mathematical heroes mentioned in the book are Edmonds, Johnson, Seymour, Lovász, Lehman, Camion, Tutte, and Truemper.</p>
<p>The title of this post refers to Baker’s dozen. In the 13th century Bakers who were found to have shortchanged customers could be liable to severe punishment, and to guard against the punishment of losing a hand to an axe, a baker would give 13 for the price of 12, to be certain of not being known as a cheat. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dozen#Baker's_dozen">Wikipedia</a>) In this post we mention a 19th problem for which Gerard offered 5000 dollars. (I am not sure if there is time limit for that problem. I am thankful to Maria Chudnovsky for telling me about the problem.)</p>

<h3>What happened to the 18 problems in the list?</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult problem on the list was solved first: two of the problems in the list were about perfect graphs and were settled with the solution of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0212070">strong perfect graph conjecture</a> by Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas. Three of the problems were about balanced bipartite graphs. They <a href="https://gilkalai.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/1-s2.0-s0095895607000597-main.pdf">were solved by Chudnovsky and Seymour</a> in 2006. Conjecture 4.14 in Chapter 4 was solved by Jonathan Wang (2010) 30,000 dollars were thus collected and 60,000 dollars are still offered (until Dec 2020).</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Balanced bipartite graphs and the 19th problem.</h3>
<p>Balanced bipartite graphs are sort of bipartite analogs of perfect graphs. They are bipartite graphs so that every induced cycle have length divisible by four. Gerard’s 19the prize money problem is also about balanced bipartite graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> Let G be balanced. Then there is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=e+%5Cin+E%28G%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="e \in E(G)" class="latex" title="e \in E(G)" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=G%5Cbackslash+e&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="G\backslash e" class="latex" title="G\backslash e" /> is a balanced graph.</p>
<p>In other words every balanced bipartite graph contains an edge which is not a unique chord in any cycle.</p>
<p>This conjecture is Conjecture 5.20 in</p>
<p>M. Conforti, G. Cornuejos, K. Vuskovic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927050705120064">Balanced matrices</a></p>
<p>In that paper, this conjecture is attributed to:</p>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html">Hardness of planar Hamiltonian decomposition and linear arboricity</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/" title="11011110">David Eppstein</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I was getting ready to start writing a paper proving that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_decomposition">Hamiltonian decomposition</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_arboricity">linear arboricity</a> are both <span style="white-space: nowrap;">-complete</span> for planar graphs of maximum degree four. But then I realized that there’s a trivial proof, based on known results:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Finding a Hamiltonian cycle is <span style="white-space: nowrap;">-complete</span> in 3-regular planar graphs.<sup id="fnref:gjs"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:gjs" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 3-regular graph has a Hamiltonian cycle if and only if its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph">line graph</a> has a Hamiltonian decomposition.<sup id="fnref:k"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:k" class="footnote">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:m"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:m" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The line graph of a 3-regular planar graph (its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_graph">medial graph</a>) is a 4-regular planar graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A 4-regular graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition if and only if the subgraph formed by removing an arbitrarily chosen single vertex has linear arboricity two.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s not enough for a paper, even though the linear arboricity result resolves a conjecture of Cygan, Hou, Kowalik, Lužar, and Wu (2012).<sup id="fnref:c"><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/10/12/hardness-planar-hamiltonian.html#fn:c" class="footnote">4</a></sup> So instead I’ll just leave this here, together with two illustrations I already drew of the gadgets for my proof. It’s a reduction from monotone planar 3-sat, in which the variables are connected in a cycle in the plane, the 3-sat clauses with all variables positive are on one side of the cycle, and the 3-sat clauses with all variables negative are on the other side. Here “planar” means that if you represent each variable and clause as a vertex, draw edges from each variable to each clause that uses it, and also draw edges connecting consecutive variables in the cycle, the result is a planar graph.</p>

<p>My reduction adds a special “truth-setting gadget” to the cycle of variables. It represents the variables by regions of the plane, bounded by edges that are forced to belong to the same cycle in any Hamiltonian decomposition. The truth-setting gadget also forms regions of the plane, again bounded by edges that belong to the same cycle. The truth-setting regions extend through the clause gadgets so that they can reach the other clause gadgets on the other sides of them. A variable or negated variable is true if its region’s bounding edges are in the other cycle than the truth-setting gadget.</p>

<p>Here is the truth-setting gadget (the colored parts of the figure), and the (very simple) variable gadgets (gray shaded regions). Each variable gadget will have one loop of one color above the midline, and another loop of the opposite color below the midline.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/truth.svg" alt="Truth-setting and variable gadgets for a reduction from monotone planar 3-sat to Hamiltonian decomposition" /></p>

<p>And here is the clause gadget:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2019/clause.svg" alt="Clause gadget for a reduction from monotone planar 3-sat to Hamiltonian decomposition" /></p>

<p>The 4- and 8-vertex subunits in the light yellow disks force the partition into two parts of Hamiltonian cycles to be uniquely determined within each gadget, and the 5-vertex subunits between the variable and clause gadget allow the variable to either connect to the parts of the cycles within the clause gadget or to remain separate from them. To construct a Hamiltonian decomposition, you have to have at least one true variable per clause, so that the clause gadget can be connected to the other cycle than the one from the truth-setting gadget. The reduction produces a multigraph rather than a graph, but that’s easy to fix by replacing some of the vertices by wheels.</p>

<p>Maybe the same idea of having a truth-setting gadget that passes through the clause gadgets can be useful in some other reductions?</p>

<p>It has been six weeks since I moved to Milan, and I am not yet completely settled in yet.</p>
<p>For example, although, as of yesterday, I finally have  working wired internet access in my place, I still do not have a bus card (obtaining the latter has been one of the most stubbornly intractable problems I have encountered) and all the stuff that I did not carry in two bags is still in transit in a container.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the busyness of handling the move, getting settled, trying to get a bus card, and teaching two courses, has meant that I did not really have time to sit down with my thoughts and process my feelings about such a major life change. If people ask me what I miss about San Francisco I will, truthfully, say something like UberX, or Thai food, or getting a bus card from a vending machine, because I still have not had a chance to miss the bigger stuff. Similarly, this post will be about random small stuff.</p>
<p><span id="more-4263"></span></p>
<p>Milan is lovely this time of the year. Unlike most other Italian cities, there is no well-preserved historical neighborhood: the city was devastated by WW2 bombings, and then rebuilt; in the center, majestic old buildings are scattered among generic 1960s era condos. Nonetheless, walking along the Naviglio Grande (a canal running roughly in an East-West direction flanked mostly by 100+ year old buildings) at sunset is quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Milan is one of the most expensive cities in Italy, but one can have an awesome sit-down multi-course lunch for 12 euros (tax included, no tip), or a sit-down coffee for one euro. In one of my new favorite dinner places, the old but energetic lady that runs the place comes to the table to offer a choice of a handful of first courses, a couple of second courses and a couple of desserts (no menu); last time I was there she charged 4 euros for two glasses of wine.</p>
<p>Bocconi keeps rolling out its strategy to expand into computing. After introducing an undergraduate degree in Economics, Management and Computer Science, and a masters degree in Data Science, next year will see the start of a new <a href="http://www.unibocconi.eu/phdstatscompscience">PhD Program in Statistics and Computer Science</a>. The deadline to apply is in February, and I would be happy to talk to students interested in applying. The language of instruction, like for almost all degree programs at Bocconi, is English. A new undergraduate program on computing is in the final planning stages, and I will say more about it when it is official.</p>
<p>Between teaching two courses, getting settled, and trying to get a bus card, I have not had a lot of time for research, but the local physicists have been giving us a crash course on the replica method to study optimization problems on random instances. I plan, in the near future, to complete my series of posts on online optimization, and to write whatever I understand of the replica method. An example of what is going on: </p>
<blockquote><p>
physicist: “so the smallest eigenvalue of this nxn matrix is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Cchoose+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0" alt="{n \choose 2}" class="latex" title="{n \choose 2}" />, which is negative, and this is a problem because it means that the matrix is not PSD”<br />
me: “wait, what?”<br />

<p>Coming here, I thought that my command of the Italian language, which I haven’t spoken on a regular basis for a while, would be almost perfect, and this has been true, except that the “almost” part has come from unexpected directions. </p>
<p>For example, one can find a number of places serving real (and very good) Chinese food, which was not the case at the time I grew up in Italy. However, I have no idea how Chinese dishes are called in Italian, for the most part I don’t know how they are called in Chinese either, so I have to resort to the English menu, if available, or to guesswork. Quite reasonably, dumplings are called “ravioli” and noodles are called “pasta” or “spaghetti.” In some places, buns are called, also quite reasonably, “panini”. That dish that I like that is usually called, with much understatement, “boiled fish with preserved vegetables” in America? “Zuppa di pesce”. How do you say “bok choy”? I am still not sure.</p>
<p>In Italian, like in French, you can address someone in a formal or an informal way (in Italian the formal way is to use the third person) and the subtle cues of when to use which form have shifted a little with time, so I have been feeling a bit confused and I have mostly been following other people’s lead.</p>
<p>Bocconi is an exceptionally well run institution. This is true in many ways, from maintenance and cleaning all the way to campus strategic planning, but one of the things that most impressed me, a luxury you do not see on American campuses any more, is that they have <i>secretaries</i>. Not directors of operations, not grant administrators, not coordinators of this or that with lots of underlings, but people that you can go talk to, describe a problem you are having or something you need, and then walk away and forget about it, because they will take care of it, with lots of common sense and professionalism. This is <i>amazing</i>! The cognitive load of worrying about lots of things other than teaching and research is something that it feels just wonderful not to have.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Bocconi administration operates on a shoestring budget compared to American universities. How does it do it? I am collecting figures and I plan to write a separate post about it. If only the Bocconi administration was in charge of issuing bus cards for the city!</p>
<p>It should be noted that, while it has a lot of autonomy as a private university, Bocconi is not a sovereign entity and it is subject to Italian law. For example, I recently had to see two doctors who had to certify that I had no medical condition that would make it dangerous for me to be a professor, and the procedure to hire postdocs is a bit Byzantine (but the secretaries take care of most of it!).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I had some very intense, very exciting, and very rewarding six weeks and, while I do not yet have a bus card, I have a medical certificate that I can teach and do research. Now I am off to eat some Chinese ravioli and maybe a Chinese panino.</p></div>

sequencing of billions of short DNA fragments at high throughput, paving the
way for population-scale genomics. Genomics data analytics at this scale
requires overcoming performance bottlenecks, such as searching for short DNA
sequences over long reference sequences. In this paper, we introduce LISA
(Learned Indexes for Sequence Analysis), a novel learning-based approach to DNA
sequence search. As a first proof of concept, we focus on accelerating one of
the most essential flavors of the problem, called exact search. LISA builds on
and extends FM-index, which is the state-of-the-art technique widely deployed
in genomics tool-chains. Initial experiments with human genome datasets
indicate that LISA achieves up to a factor of 4X performance speedup against
its traditional counterpart.

high-throughput technologies are giving rise to an exponential growth in the
size of nucleotide sequence databases. Moreover, many emerging applications of
nucleotide datasets -- as those related to personalized medicine -- require the
compliance with regulations about the storage and processing of sensitive data.
We have designed and carefully engineered E2FM-index, a new full-text index in
minute space which was optimized for compressing and encrypting nucleotide
sequence collections in FASTA format and for performing fast pattern-search
queries. E2FM-index allows to build self-indexes which occupy till to 1/20 of
the storage required by the input FASTA file, thus permitting to save about 95%
of storage when indexing collections of highly similar sequences; moreover, it
can exactly search the built indexes for patterns in times ranging from few
milliseconds to a few hundreds milliseconds, depending on pattern length.

predicates definable in Presburger arithmetic (PA), the first-order theory of
addition. As part of this result, they presented a procedure that translates
any formula $\varphi$ of quantifier-free PA with remainder predicates (which
has the same expressive power as full PA) into a population protocol with
$2^{O(\text{poly}(|\varphi|))}$ states that computes $\varphi$. More precisely,
the number of states of the protocol is exponential in both the bit length of
the largest coefficient in the formula, and the number of nodes of its syntax
tree.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove that every formula $\varphi$ of quantifier-free PA
with remainder predicates is computable by a leaderless population protocol
with $O(\text{poly}(|\varphi|))$ states. Our result shows that, contrary to the
case of time complexity, where protocols with leaders can be exponentially
faster than leaderless protocols, protocols with and without leaders have both
polynomial state complexity.
</p>
<p>Our proof is based on several new constructions, which may be of independent
interest. Given a formula $\varphi$ of quantifier-free PA with remainder
predicates, a first construction produces a succinct protocol (with
$O(|\varphi|^3)$ leaders) that computes $\varphi$; this completes the work
initiated in [STACS'18], where we constructed such protocols for a fragment of
PA. For large enough inputs, we can get rid of these leaders. If the input is
not large enough, then it is small, and we design another construction
producing a succinct protocol with one leader that computes $\varphi$. Our last
construction gets rid of this leader for small inputs.

are in $k (k\geq 2)$ different groups, or communities, and edges are only
allowed between vertices in distinct groups. The observation is the weighted
adjacency matrix, perturbed by a Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), or
Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) matrix. Different from the standard symmetric
$\ZZ_2$-synchronization in which there are 2 communities with equal number of
vertices, we do not assume that the number of vertices in each group is the
same. For the exact recovery of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with
various weighted adjacency matrix, we prove a sharp phase transition result
with respect to the intensity $\sigma$ of the Gaussian perturbation. These
weighted adjacency matrices may be considered as natural models for the
electric network. Surprisingly, the threshold, or critical value, of $\sigma$
does not depend on whether or not the sample space for MLE is restricted to the
classifications such that the number of vertices in each group is the same as
the true value. In contrast to the well-studied $\ZZ_2$-sychronization, a new
complex version of the semi-definite programming (SDP) is designed to
efficiently implement the community detection problem when the number of
communities $k$ is greater than 2, and a common region for $\sigma$ such that
SDP exactly recovers the true classification is obtained, which is independent
of $k$.

minimum cuts of undirected surface-embedded graphs. Given an edge-weighted
undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices embedded on an orientable surface of
genus $g$, our algorithms can solve either problem in $g^{O(g)} n \log \log n$
or $2^{O(g)} n \log n$ time, whichever is better. When $g$ is a constant, our
$g^{O(g)} n \log \log n$ time algorithms match the best running times known for
computing minimum cuts in planar graphs.
</p>
<p>Our algorithms for minimum cuts rely on reductions to the problem of finding
a minimum-weight subgraph in a given $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homology class, and we give
efficient algorithms for this latter problem as well. If $G$ is embedded on a
surface with $b$ boundary components, these algorithms run in $(g + b)^{O(g +

a minimum-weight subgraph homologous to a single input cycle is NP-hard,
showing it is likely impossible to improve upon the exponential dependencies on
$g$ for this latter problem.

found that the problem of determining if an RCMSN is equivalent to a GMSN is
NP-Hard, but whether a CMSN is equivalent to an RGMSN with a given number of

<p>Sir Timothy Gowers is a Fields medalist and fellow <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/">blogger</a>. Sometimes he (too) writes about simple topics.</p>
<p>
Today I would like to talk about a simple problem that came up recently. </p>
<p>
The problem is a simple to state “obvious fact”. The reason I thought you might be interested is that I had a tough time finding the solution. I hope you find the explanation below interesting. </p>
<p>
The general issue of proving obviously true statements is discussed here for <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/51531/theorems-that-are-obvious-but-hard-to-prove">example</a>. Here is an example from Gowers:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_%7B1%7D%2CI_%7B2%7D%2C%5Cdots+%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{I_{1},I_{2},\dots }" class="latex" title="{I_{1},I_{2},\dots }" /> be intervals of real numbers with lengths that sum to less than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />, then their union cannot be all of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5B0%2C1%5D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{[0,1]}" class="latex" title="{[0,1]}" />. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
He says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> It is quite common for people to think this statement is more obvious than it actually is. (The “proof” is this: just translate the intervals so that the end point of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_%7B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{I_{1}}" class="latex" title="{I_{1}}" /> is the beginning point of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BI_%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{I_{2}}" class="latex" title="{I_{2}}" />, and so on, and that will clearly maximize the length of interval you can cover. The problem is that this argument works just as well in the rationals, where the conclusion is false.) </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Statement </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The following simple problem came up the other day. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is an odd number. Show there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%284x%2B1%2Ct%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>Here <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28a%2C+b%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(a, b)}" class="latex" title="{(a, b)}" /> is the gcd, the greatest common divisor of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Ba%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{a}" class="latex" title="{a}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bb%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{b}" class="latex" title="{b}" />. For example, 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%2821%2C+14%29+%3D+7.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (21, 14) = 7. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (21, 14) = 7. " /></p>
<p>This result seems totally obvious, must be true, but I had trouble finding a proof. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Cousin </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There is a unproved conjecture in number theory that says: There are an infinite number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that both <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> are prime. This clearly shows that there is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> for our problem. </p>
<p>
I like conjectures like this since they give you an immediate insight that a statement is likely to be true. But we would like a proof that does not use any unproved conjectures. Our problem can be viewed as a poor version of some of these conjectures. Suppose that you have a conjecture that there are an infinite number of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++f_%7B1%7D%28x%29%2Cf_%7B2%7D%28x%29%2C%5Cdots%2Cf_%7Bm%7D%28x%29%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x),\dots,f_{m}(x), " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  f_{1}(x),f_{2}(x),\dots,f_{m}(x), " /></p>
<p>are all prime for some given functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bf_%7Bk%7D%28x%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{f_{k}(x)}" class="latex" title="{f_{k}(x)}" />. Then the poor version is to prove that there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that these numbers are all relatively prime to some given <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. There are some partial <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606088">results</a> to the prime version by Ben Green and Terence Tao. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Failed Proofs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My initial idea was to try to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to something like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bty+%2B+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{ty + 1}" class="latex" title="{ty + 1}" />. The point is that this always satisfies the first constraint: that is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28ty%2B1%2C+t%29%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(ty+1, t)=1}" class="latex" title="{(ty+1, t)=1}" /> for any <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. Then I planned to try and show there must be some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> that satisfies the second constraint. Thus the goal is to prove there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%284%28ty%2B1%29%2B1%2C+t%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (4(ty+1)+1, t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (4(ty+1)+1, t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>But this is false. Note that if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" /> divides <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++4%28ty%2B1%29%2B1+%3D+4ty+%2B+5+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  4(ty+1)+1 = 4ty + 5 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  4(ty+1)+1 = 4ty + 5 " /></p>
<p>and so <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> is always divisible by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{5}" class="latex" title="{5}" />. Ooops. </p>
<p>
My next idea was to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> to a more “clever” value. I tried 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%3D+ty+%2B+d.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x = ty + d. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x = ty + d. " /></p>
<p>Here I thought that I could make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> special and control the situation. Now 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++4%28ty%2Bd%29%2B1+%3D+4ty+%2B+4d%2B1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  4(ty+d)+1 = 4ty + 4d+1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  4(ty+d)+1 = 4ty + 4d+1. " /></p>
<p>This looked promising. I then said to myself that why not make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4d%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4d+1}" class="latex" title="{4d+1}" /> a large prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" />. Then clearly 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++4x+%2B+1+%3D+%284t%29y+%2B+p.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  4x + 1 = (4t)y + p. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  4x + 1 = (4t)y + p. " /></p>
<p>Since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4t%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4t}" class="latex" title="{4t}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p}" class="latex" title="{p}" /> are relatively prime by the famous Dirichlet’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions">Theorem</a> on arithmetic progressions we could make <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> a prime too by selecting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{y}" class="latex" title="{y}" />. This would satisfy the second constraint, and we are done.</p>
<p>
Not quite. The trouble is that we need to have also that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>Now this is 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28ty+%2B+d%2C+t%29+%3D+1.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (ty + d, t) = 1. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (ty + d, t) = 1. " /></p>
<p>The trouble is that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> might not be relatively prime to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. So we could just <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" title="{\dots}" /> This seems like a recursion and I realized that it might not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Problem’s Solution </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I finally found a solution thanks to Delta Airlines. My dear wife, Kathryn Farley, and I were stuck in DC for several hours waiting for our delayed flight home. This time was needed for me to find a solution. </p>
<p>
The key for me was to think about the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. It is usually a good idea to look at the simplest case first. So suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t=1}" class="latex" title="{t=1}" />, then clearly the constraints 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%28x%2Ct%29+%3D+1+%5Ctext%7B+and+%7D+%284x%2B1%2Ct%29+%3D+1%2C+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1, " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  (x,t) = 1 \text{ and } (4x+1,t) = 1, " /></p>
<p>are now trivial. The next simplest case seems to be when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is a prime. Let’s try <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3D3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t=3}" class="latex" title="{t=3}" />. Now <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3D1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x=1}" class="latex" title="{x=1}" /> works. Let’s generalize this to any prime <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%3E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t&gt;3}" class="latex" title="{t&gt;3}" />. The trick is to set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> so that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%5Cequiv+2+%5Cbmod+t.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x \equiv 2 \bmod t. " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x \equiv 2 \bmod t. " /></p>
<p>Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4x%2B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{4x+1}" class="latex" title="{4x+1}" /> is equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B9%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{9}" class="latex" title="{9}" /> modulo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />, which is not divisible by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" />. This shows that when <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is an odd prime there is always some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />.</p>
<p>
Okay how do we get the full result? What if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is the product of several primes? The Chinese remainder theorem to the rescue. Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bt%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{t}" class="latex" title="{t}" /> is divisible by the distinct odd primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_%7B1%7D%2Cp_%7B2%7D%2C+%5Cdots%2C+p_%7Bm%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p_{1},p_{2}, \dots, p_{m}}" class="latex" title="{p_{1},p_{2}, \dots, p_{m}}" />. We can easily see that we do not care if there are repeated factors, since that cannot change the relatively prime constraints. </p>
<p>
Then we constraint <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" /> by: 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%5Cequiv+1+%5Cbmod+3+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x \equiv 1 \bmod 3 " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x \equiv 1 \bmod 3 " /></p>
<p>and 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x+%5Cequiv+2+%5Cbmod+p_%7Bk%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle  x \equiv 2 \bmod p_{k} " class="latex" title="\displaystyle  x \equiv 2 \bmod p_{k} " /></p>
<p>for all primes <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bp_%7Bk%7D%3E3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{p_{k}&gt;3}" class="latex" title="{p_{k}&gt;3}" />. Then the Chinese remainder theorem proves there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{x}" class="latex" title="{x}" />. Done.</p>

Today, Oct 10, 2019 is William Kruskal's 100th birthday (he's dead, so no cake. Oh well.) William Kruskal was a great statistician. To honor him we have a guest post by his nephew Clyde Kruskal. We also note that the Kruskal Family is one of the top two math families of all time (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/02/baseball-families-and-math-families.html">here</a>). William is a reason why the other two Kruskal brothers went into mathematics: As a much older sibling (6 years older than Martin and 8 years older than Joseph), he encouraged their early mathematical development. <br />
<br />
Here are some pictures of William Kruskal and of the Kruskal Family: <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/billk1.pdf">here</a><br />
<br />
<b>Guest Post by Clyde Kruskal<br />
</b><br />
<br />
I was asked to blog about my uncle, the statistician, William H. Kruskal, on the centennial of his birth. We called him Uncle Bill. He is best known for co-inventing the Kruskal-Wallis test.<br />
<br />
There are two stories that I know about Bill's childhood, which must have been family lore:<br />
<br />
(1) As a young child, Bill was a prolific reader. His reading comprehension outstripped his conversational English. One morning, having just read the word ``schedule'' in a book, and obviously having never heard it pronounced, he sat down to breakfast and asked:<br />
"What is the ske·D<span style="text-decoration: overline;">U</span>·l<span style="text-decoration: overline;">e</span> for today?"<br />
<br />
(2) My grandparents once had Bill take an occupational assessment test. The tester said that Bill was a very bright child, and should become a traffic engineer to solve  the problems with traffic congestion. (This would have been the 1920s!)  As you probably know, Uncle Bill did not succeed in ending traffic congestion. Oh well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recently there has been a controversy over whether to ask about citizenship in the 2020 census.  In the late 1900s there was a different  controversy: whether to adjust the known undercount statistically.  In general, Democrats wanted to adjust the count and Republicans did not (presumably because Democratic states tended to have a larger undercount). A national committee was set up to study the issue, with four statisticians in favor and four against.  I was surprised  to learn that Uncle Bill was on the commission as one of those against adjustment, since, I thought his political views were more closely aligned with those of the Democrats.  He was very principled, basing his views only on statistical arguments.  I saw him give a talk on the subject, which seemed quite convincing  (but, then again, I did not see the other side).  They ended up not adjusting. <br />
<br />
<br />
For more on William Kruskal, in general, and his view on adjusting the census, in particular, see the pointers at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have more to say. I just hope that I am on the  ske·D<span style="text-decoration: overline;">U</span>·l<span style="text-decoration: overline;">e</span> to blog about Uncle Bill at the bicentennial of his birth.<br />

A function f:[n_1] x ... x [n_d]--&gt;F  is a direct sum if it is of the form f(a_1,...,a_d) = f_1(a_1) + ... + f_d (a_d)  (mod 2) for some d functions f_i:[n_i]--&gt;F_i for all i=1,...,d. We present a 4-query test which distinguishes between direct sums and functions that are far from them. The test relies on the BLR linearity test (Blum, Luby, Rubinfeld, 1993) and on an agreement test which slightly generalizes the direct product test.

In multiplicative {+1,-1} notation, our result reads as follows. A d-dimensional tensor with {+1,-1} entries is called a tensor product if it is a tensor product of d vectors with {+1,-1} entries, or equivalently, if it is of rank 1. The presented tests can be read as tests for distinguishing between tensor products and tensors that are far from being tensor products.

We also present a different test, which queries the function at most (d+2) times, but is easier to analyze.</div>

<div class="content">
<p>In <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/03/16/drawing-clustered-graphs.html">a paper from last year</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustered_planarity">clustered planarity</a>, with Giordano Da Lozzo, Mike Goodrich, and Sid Gupta, we provided subexponential-time algorithms for arbitrary instances, and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for instances whose embedded width and number of clusters are both bounded.</p>

<p>Now, in my newest preprint, “C-planarity testing of embedded clustered graphs with bounded dual carving-width” (with the same authors, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02057">arXiv:1910.02057</a>), we’ve eliminated the dependence on the number of clusters (using a different width parameter) and found a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with just a single parameter.</p>

<p>It was just in time: while our paper was in submission, last July, Rado Fulek and Csaba Tóth put up their own preprint, “Atomic embeddability, clustered planarity, and thickenability” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13086">arXiv:1907.13086</a>) announcing a solution to the clustered planarity problem in polynomial time without dependence on parameters. I <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102537368093048271">posted about it briefly at the time</a>, and can’t find much else more recent about it, but I assume it’s in submission to somewhere good. So our results may be only of historic value…</p>

<p>Our paper was presented at IPEC 2019 (part of the <a href="http://algo2019.ak.in.tum.de/">ALGO 2019 conference in Munich</a>) last month, and won IPEC best paper award. The late timing of the preprint is because (somewhat unusually for a CS conference) IPEC makes their proceedings versions due after the conference rather than before, so they can take into account feedback from the conference.
The arXiv version is more complete than the proceedings version will be, because of page limits in the proceedings, but we prepared it at the same time.</p>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/10/what-comes-first-theory-or-practice-its.html">What comes first theory or practice? Its Complicated!</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/" title="Computational Complexity">Computational Complexity</a>
<p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
Having majored in pure math I had the impression that usually the theory comes first and then someone works out something to work in practice. While this is true sometimes it is often NOT true and this will not surprise any of my blog readers.  Even so, I want to tell you about some times it surprised me. This says more about my ignorance than about math or applications or whatnot.<br />
<br />
1) Quantum<br />
<br />
a) Factoring was proven to be in BQP way before actual quantum computers could do this in reasonable time (we're still waiting).<br />
<br />
b) Quantum Crypto- This really is out there. I do not know what came first, the theory or the practice. Or if they were in tandem.<br />
<br />
c) (this one is the inspiration for the post)  When I first heard the term <i>Quantum Supremacy</i> I thought it meant the desire for a THEOREM that problem A is in BQP but is provably not in P.  For example, if someone proved factoring is not in P (unlikely this will be proven, and hey- maybe  factoring is in P). Perhaps some contrived problem like those constructed by diagonalization (my spell checker thinks that's not a word. Having worked in computability theory, I think it is. Darn- my spellchecker thinks computability is not word.) Hence when I heard that Google had a paper proving Quantum Supremacy (I do not recall if I actually heard the word  <i>proven) </i>I assumed that there was some <i>theoretical </i>breakthrough. I was surprised and not in the slightest disappointed to find out it involved actual quantum computers.<br />
<br />
<b>Question</b>: When the term <i>Quantum Supremacy</i> was first coined, did they mean theoretical, or IRL, or both?<br />
<br />
2) Ramsey Theory<br />
<br />
a) For Ramsey's Theorem and Van Der waerden's theorem and Rado's theorem and others I could name, first a theorem showed a upper bound on a number, then later computers and perhaps some math got better bounds on that number.<br />
<br />
b) Consider the following statement:<br />
<br />
For all c there exists P such that for all c-colorings of {1,...,P} there exists x,y,z the same color such that x<sup>2</sup> +y<sup>2</sup> = z<sup>2</sup>.<br />
<br />
Ronald Graham conjectured the c=2 case and offered $100 in the 1980's. (I do not know if he had any comment on the general case.)  I assumed that it would be proven with ginormous bounds on the P(c) function, and then perhaps some reasonable bound would be found by clever programming and some math. (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_Pythagorean_triples_problem">here</a> for the Wikipedia Entry about the problem, which also has pointers to other material).<br />
<br />
Instead the c=2 case was proven with an exact bound, P(2)=7825, by a computer program, in 2016. The proof is 200 terabytes. So my prediction was incorrect.<br />
<br />
As for the result<br />
<br />
PRO: We know the result is true for c=2 and we even know the exact bound. Wow! and for Ramsey Theory its unusual to have exact bounds!<br />
<br />
CON: It would be good to have a human-readable proof. This is NOT an anti-technology statement. For one thing, a human-readable proof might help us get the result for c=3 and beyond.<br />
<br />
3) This item is a cheat in that I knew the empirical results first. However, I will tell you what I am sure I would have thought (and been wrong) had I not know them.<br />
<br />
Given k, does the equation<br />
<br />
<br />
x<sup>3</sup> +y<sup>3</sup> +z<sup>3</sup> = k<br />
<br />
have a solution in Z? I would have thought that some hard number theory would determine<br />
for which k it has a solution (with a proof that does not give the actual solutions)  and for then a computer programs would try to find the solutions. Instead (1) some values of k are ruled out by simple mod considerations, and (2) as for the rest, computers have found solutions for some of them. Lipton-Regan (<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/30/writing-33-as-a-sum-of-cubes/">here</a>) and Gasarch (<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/04/x-3-y-3-z-3-33-has-solution-in-z-and.html">here</a>) have blogged about the k=33 case. Lipton-Regan also comment on the more recent k=42 case.<br />

<p>A couple weeks ago I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rationalists-Artificial-Intelligence-Geeks-World/dp/1474608779/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">The AI Does Not Hate You: Superintelligence, Rationality, and the Race to Save the World</a>, the first-ever book-length examination of the modern <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Rationalist_movement">rationalist community</a>, by British journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/TomChivers?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Tom Chivers</a>.  I was planning to review it here, before it got preempted by the news of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">quantum supremacy</a> (and subsequent news of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4342">classical non-supremacy</a>).  Now I can get back to rationalists.</p>



<p>Briefly, I think the book is a triumph.  It’s based around in-person conversations with many of the notable figures in and around the rationalist community, in its Bay Area epicenter and beyond (although apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a> only agreed to answer technical questions by Skype), together of course with the voluminous material available online.  There’s a good deal about the 1990s origins of the community that I hadn’t previously known.</p>



<p>The title is taken from Eliezer’s aphorism, “The AI does not hate you, nor does it love you, but you are made of atoms which it can use for something else.”  In other words: as soon as anyone succeeds in building a superhuman AI, if we don’t take extreme care that the AI’s values are “aligned” with human ones, the AI might be expected to obliterate humans almost instantly as a byproduct of pursuing whatever it <em>does</em> value, more-or-less as we humans did with woolly mammoths, moas, and now gorillas, rhinos, and thousands of other species.</p>



<p>Much of the book relates Chivers’s personal quest to figure out how seriously he should take this scenario.  Are the rationalists just an unusually nerdy doomsday cult?  Is there some non-negligible chance that they’re actually right about the AI thing?  If so, how much more time do we have—and is there even anything meaningful that can be done today?  Do the dramatic advances in machine learning over the past decade change the outlook?  Should Chivers be worried about his own two children?  How does this risk compare to the more “prosaic” civilizational risks, like climate change or nuclear war?  I suspect that Chivers’s exploration will be most interesting to readers who, like me, regard the answers to <em>none</em> of these questions as obvious.</p>



<p>While it sounds extremely basic, what makes <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> so valuable to my mind is that, as far as I know, it’s nearly the only examination of the rationalists ever written by an outsider that tries to assess the ideas on a scale from true to false, rather than from quirky to offensive.  Chivers’s own training in academic philosophy seems to have been crucial here.  He’s not put off by people who act weirdly around him, even needlessly cold or aloof, nor by utilitarian thought experiments involving death or torture or weighing the value of human lives.  He just cares, relentlessly, about the ideas—and about remaining a basically grounded and decent person while engaging them.  Most strikingly, Chivers clearly feels a need—anachronistic though it seems in 2019—actually to <em>understand</em> complicated arguments, be able to repeat them back correctly, before he attacks them.</p>



<p>Indeed, far from failing to understand the rationalists, it occurs to me that the central criticism of Chivers’s book is likely to be just the opposite: he understands the rationalists so well, extends them so much sympathy, and ends up endorsing so many aspects of their worldview, that he must simply <em>be</em> a closet rationalist himself, and therefore can’t write about them with any pretense of journalistic or anthropological detachment.  For my part, I’d say: it’s true that <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> is what you get if you treat rationalists as extremely smart (if unusual) people from whom you might learn something of consequence, rather than as monkeys in a zoo.  On the other hand, Chivers does perform the journalist’s task of constantly challenging the rationalists he meets, often with points that (if upheld) would be fatal to their worldview.  One of the rationalists’ best features—and this precisely matches my own experience—is that, far from clamming up or storming off when faced with such challenges (“lo! the visitor is not one of us!”), the rationalists positively relish them.</p>



<p>It occurred to me the other day that we’ll never know how the rationalists’ ideas would’ve developed, had they continued to do so in a cultural background like that of the late 20th century.  As Chivers points out, the rationalists today are effectively caught in the crossfire of a much larger cultural war—between, to their right, the recrudescent know-nothing authoritarians, and to their left, what one could variously describe as woke culture, call-out culture, or sneer culture.  On its face, it might seem laughable to conflate the rationalists with today’s resurgent fascists: many rationalists are driven by their utilitarianism to advocate open borders and massive aid to the Third World; the rationalist community is about as welcoming of alternative genders and sexualities as it’s humanly possible to be; and leading rationalists like Scott Alexander and Eliezer Yudkowsky strongly condemned Trump for the obvious reasons. </p>



<p>Chivers, however, explains how the problem started.  On rationalist Internet forums, many misogynists and white nationalists and so forth encountered nerds willing to <em>debate their ideas politely</em>, rather than immediately banning them as more mainstream venues would.  As a result, many of those forces of darkness (and they probably don’t mind being called that) predictably congregated on the rationalist forums, and their stench predictably wore off on the rationalists themselves.  Furthermore, this isn’t an easy-to-fix problem, because debating ideas on their merits, extending charity to ideological opponents, etc. is sort of the rationalists’ <em>entire shtick</em>, whereas denouncing and no-platforming anyone who can be connected to an ideological enemy (in the modern parlance, “punching Nazis”) is the entire shtick of those condemning the rationalists.</p>



<p>Compounding the problem is that, as anyone who’s ever hung out with STEM nerds might’ve guessed, the rationalist community tends to skew WASP, Asian, or Jewish, non-impoverished, and male.  Worse yet, while many rationalists live their lives in progressive enclaves and strongly support progressive values, they’ll also undergo extreme anguish if they feel forced to subordinate truth to those values.</p>



<p>Chivers writes that all of these issues “blew up in spectacular style at the end of 2014,” right here on this blog.  Oh, what the hell, I’ll just quote him:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Scott Aaronson is, I think it’s fair to say, a member of the Rationalist community.  He’s a prominent theoretical computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, and writes a very interesting, maths-heavy blog called Shtetl-Optimised.</p><p>People in the comments under his blog were discussing feminism and sexual harassment.  And Aaronson, in a comment in which he described himself as a fan of Andrea Dworkin, described having been terrified of speaking to women as a teenager and young man.  This fear was, he said, partly that of being thought of as a sexual abuser or creep if any woman ever became aware that he sexually desired them, a fear that he picked up from sexual-harassment-prevention workshops at his university and from reading feminist literature.  This fear became so overwhelming, he said in the comment that came to be known as Comment #171, that he had ‘constant suicidal thoughts’ and at one point ‘actually begged a psychiatrist to prescribe drugs that would chemically castrate me (I had researched which ones), because a life of mathematical asceticism was the only future that I could imagine for myself.’  So when he read feminist articles talking about the ‘male privilege’ of nerds like him, he didn’t recognise the description, and so felt himself able to declare himself ‘only’ 97 per cent on board with the programme of feminism.</p><p>It struck me as a thoughtful and rather sweet remark, in the midst of a long and courteous discussion with a female commenter.  But it got picked up, weirdly, by some feminist bloggers, including one who described it as ‘a yalp of entitlement combined with an aggressive unwillingness to accept that women are human beings just like men’ and that Aaronson was complaining that ‘having to explain my suffering to women when they should already be there, mopping my brow and offering me beers and blow jobs, is so tiresome.’</p><p>Scott Alexander (<em>not</em> Scott Aaronson) then wrote a furious 10,000-word defence of his friend… (p. 214-215)</p></blockquote>



<p>And then Chivers goes on to explain Scott Alexander’s central thesis, in <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/">Untitled</a>, that privilege is not a one-dimensional axis, so that (to take one example) society can make many women in STEM miserable while <em>also</em> making shy male nerds miserable in different ways.</p>



<p>For nerds, perhaps an alternative title for Chivers’s book could be “The Normal People Do Not Hate You (Not All of Them, Anyway).”  It’s as though Chivers is demonstrating, through understated example, that taking delight in nerds’ suffering, wanting them to be miserable and alone, mocking their weird ideas, is not simply the default, well-adjusted human reaction, with any other reaction being ‘creepy’ and ‘problematic.’  Some might even go so far as to apply the latter adjectives to the sneerers’ attitude, the one that dresses up schoolyard bullying in a social-justice wig.</p>



<p>Reading Chivers’s book prompted me to reflect on my own relationship to the rationalist community.  For years, I interacted often with the community—I’ve known Robin Hanson since ~2004 and Eliezer Yudkowsky since ~2006, and our blogs bounced off each other—but I never considered myself a member.  I never ranked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer">paperclip-maximizing AIs</a> among humanity’s more urgent threats—indeed, I saw them as a distraction from an all-too-likely climate catastrophe that will leave its survivors lucky to have stone tools, let alone AIs.  I was also repelled by what I saw as the rationalists’ cultier aspects.  I even once toyed with the idea of changing the name of this blog to “More Wrong” or “Wallowing in Bias,” as a play on the rationalists’ <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a> and <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/">OvercomingBias</a>.</p>



<p>But I’ve drawn much closer to the community over the last few years, because of a combination of factors:</p>



<ol><li>The comment-171 affair.  This was not the sort of thing that could provide any new information about the likelihood of a dangerous AI being built, but <em>was</em> (to put it mildly) the sort of thing that can tell you who your friends are.  I learned that empathy works a lot like intelligence, in that those who boast of it most loudly are often the ones who lack it.</li><li>The astounding progress in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">deep learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GANs</a>, which caused me (like everyone else, perhaps) to update in the direction of human-level AI in our lifetimes being an actual live possibility,</li><li>The rise of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Scott Alexander</a>.  To the charge that the rationalists are a cult, there’s now the reply that Scott, with his constant equivocations and doubts, his deep dives into data, his clarity and self-deprecating humor, is perhaps the least culty cult leader in human history.  Likewise, to the charge that the rationalists are basement-dwelling kibitzers who accomplish nothing of note in the real world, there’s now the reply that Scott has attracted a huge mainstream following (Steven Pinker, Paul Graham, presidential candidate Andrew Yang…), purely by offering up what’s self-evidently some of the best writing of our time.</li><li>Research.  The AI-risk folks started publishing some research papers that I found interesting—some with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565">relatively approachable problems</a> that I could see myself trying to think about if quantum computing ever got boring.  This shift seems to have happened at roughly around the same time my former student, <a href="https://paulfchristiano.com/">Paul Christiano</a>, “defected” from quantum computing to AI-risk research. </li></ol>



<p>Anyway, if you’ve spent years steeped in the rationalist blogosphere, read Eliezer’s <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences">“Sequences,”</a> and so on, <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> will probably have little that’s new, although it might still be interesting to revisit ideas and episodes that you know through a newcomer’s eyes.  To anyone else … well, reading the book would be a lot faster than spending all those years reading blogs!  I’ve heard of some rationalists now giving out copies of the book to their relatives, by way of explaining how they’ve chosen to spend their lives.</p>



<p>I <em>still</em> don’t know whether there’s a risk worth worrying about that a misaligned AI will threaten human civilization in my lifetime, or my children’s lifetimes, or even 500 years—or whether everyone will look back and laugh at how silly some people once were to think that (except, silly in which way?).  But I do feel fairly confident that <em>The AI Does Not Hate You</em> will make a positive difference—possibly for the world, but at any rate for a little well-meaning community of sneered-at nerds obsessed with the future and with following ideas wherever they lead.</p></div>

The probabilistic degree of a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is defined to be the smallest $d$ such that there is a random polynomial $\mathbf{P}$ of degree at most $d$ that agrees with $f$ at each point with high probability. Introduced by Razborov (1987), upper and lower bounds on probabilistic degrees of Boolean functions --- specifically symmetric Boolean functions --- have been used to prove explicit lower bounds, design pseudorandom generators, and devise algorithms for combinatorial problems. 
		
In this paper, we characterize the probabilistic degrees of all symmetric Boolean functions up to polylogarithmic factors over all fields of fixed characteristic (positive or zero).</div>

A decision list is an ordered list of rules. Each rule is specified by a term, which is a conjunction of literals, and a value. Given an input, the output of a decision list is the value corresponding to the first rule whole term is satisfied by the input. Decision lists generalize both CNFs and DNFs, and have been studied both in complexity theory and in learning theory.

The size of a decision list is the number of rules, and its width is the maximal number of variables in a term. We prove that decision lists of small width can always be approximated by decision lists of small size, where we obtain sharp bounds (up to constants). This in particular resolves a conjecture of Gopalan, Meka and Reingold (Computational Complexity, 2013) on DNF sparsification.

An ingredient in our proof is a new random restriction lemma, which allows to analyze how DNFs (and more generally, decision lists) simplify if a small fraction of the variables are fixed. This is in contrast to the more commonly used switching lemma, which requires most of the variables to be fixed.</div>

Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson (STOC'98) observed that for every Boolean function $f : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ and $\bullet : \{-1, 1\}^2 \to \{-1, 1\}$ the two-party bounded-error quantum communication complexity of $(f \circ \bullet)$ is $O(Q(f) \log n)$, where $Q(f)$ is the bounded-error quantum query complexity of $f$. Note that the bounded-error randomized communication complexity of $(f \circ \bullet)$ is bounded by $O(R(f))$, where $R(f)$ denotes the bounded-error randomized query complexity of $f$. Thus, the BCW simulation has an extra $O(\log n)$ factor appearing that is absent in classical simulation. A natural question is if this factor can be avoided. H{\o}yer and de Wolf (STACS'02) showed that for the Set-Disjointness function, this can be reduced to $c^{\log^* n}$ for some constant $c$, and subsequently Aaronson and Ambainis (FOCS'03) showed that this factor can be made a constant. That is, the quantum communication complexity of the Set-Disjointness function (which is $NOR_n \circ \wedge$) is $O(Q(NOR_n))$.

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, we show that when $ \bullet = \oplus$, then the extra $\log n$ factor in the BCW simulation is unavoidable. In other words, we exhibit a total function $F : \{-1, 1\}^n \to \{-1, 1\}$ such that $Q^{cc}(F \circ \oplus) = \Theta(Q(F) \log n)$.

To the best of our knowledge, it was not even known prior to this work whether there existed a total function $F$ and 2-bit function $\bullet$, such that $Q^{cc}(F \circ \bullet) = \omega(Q(F))$.</div>

<p>One of my favorite parables ever since childhood was that of the four blind men and the elephant, with each man announcing the local image evoked in his mind’s eye on touching a different part of the elephant. This parable has provided an interesting metaphor even for serious scientific matters, a well-known one being wave-particle duality in physics.</p>
<p>But when it comes to matching markets, the parable has taken an unusual twist, with the proverbial elephant undergoing a metamorphosis of its own! The “blind men’’ in this case are entire disciplines which can lay claim to the field of matching markets. Of course, the obvious one is economics – the founders of this field, namely Gale and Shapley, were mathematical economists and <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2012/summary/">the 2012 Nobel Prize in Economics</a> was awarded to Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley for work on these markets.</p>
<p>A key enabler was researchers in systems and networking. Their scientific revolutions of the Internet and mobile computing put matching markets on an exciting, new journey and their systems run these centralized markets on powerful computers.</p>
<p>The discipline of algorithm design has had an umbilical connection to matching markets: At the birth of this field lies the highly sophisticated <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.05.386?journalCode=uamm20">Gale-Shapley</a> stable matching algorithm (1962), whose pivotal game-theoretic property of incentive compatibility follows as a free gift from polynomial time solvability — it was established <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/jmasso/pdf/DubinsFreedmanAMM1981.pdf">two decades</a> after the discovery of the algorithm! Yet most researchers, including those in theoretical computer science, are not aware that algorithm design is also a legitimate claimant to this field. Indeed, the very “engine’’ that runs almost each one of these markets is a <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/rmklectures2019-fall-1">sophisticated algorithm</a> chosen from the “gold mine’’ of matching theory! Besides stable matching, this includes maximum matching and online matching and their numerous variants.</p>
<p>Looking back at the huge expansion of matching markets over the last decade-and-a-half, one can see that all three disciplines were faced with numerous challenges: understanding the incentive structure of a new market; finding ways of dealing with terra-bytes of data, and choosing and delivering within milli-seconds the “right’’ ads to show with a user query; and designing an algorithm for the latest variant of online matching. And they all delivered!</p>
<p>The rich and diverse set of research talks given at the recent <a href="https://agtb.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/matching-markets-simons-driven-by-theory-driving-the-economy/">Simons program</a> on matching markets is proof enough that the elephant is still evolving!</p></div>

<p>I get a lot of questions about how I spent last summer. Normally I just take off to the Bay Area the day my last Spring class is over and fly back the day before my Fall class begins.
However, last summer I decided I’ve been in the US long enough to learn everything it has to offer and it was time to explore life across the pond and spend three months at the Alan Turing Institute in London. Then I had two interns coming over to Bloomington so I spent my first ever summer month here. 
Since it is that time of year, a quick reminder to <a href="https://cs.indiana.edu/apply/graduate-application.html">apply by Dec 15</a> if you are interested in doing a Ph.D. and stay tuned for the internship call announcement (probably similar deadline).</p>

<h1 id="summer-interns-in-bloomington">Summer Interns in Bloomington</h1>

<p>IU has started a <a href="https://sice.indiana.edu/research/student-research/fellowship.html">Global Talent Attraction Program (GTAP)</a> – fantastic program for international summer interns. The program gives you a $4000 stipend and you spend 2 months here at IU. There were a lot of strong applicants so it took me a while to interview all candidates. In the end, the two interns I got were <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Chameleon2460">Jakub Boguta</a> (U. Warsaw, ACM ICPC gold this year, must be tough to be in the lead for 4 hours and not win) and <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/josdas">Stanislav Naumov</a> (SPb ITMO, ACM ICPC finalist, who spent summer at Google and just arrived on campus). Also, <a href="https://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/farthaud/">Farid Arthaud</a> joined us from ENS Paris, Ulm with a short recommendation of being “probably the best third-year CS student in France”. If you think you are the best in your country, have U.S. citizenship and don’t need to get paid, shoot me an email ;) Despite it being hot and humid here in Bloomington during the summer, we had a great time.</p>

<div align="center"><img width="400" alt="interns" src="http://grigory.github.io/blog/pics/interns.jpg" /></div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>We decided to dive into deep learning for image classification and figured out how to get more mileage out of standard pretrained neural nets by using them to produce hierarchical clusterings (with guarantees). If this sounds fun, you can apply for GTAP next year (picture by Farid).</p>

<h1 id="london-and-the-alan-turing-institute">London and the Alan Turing Institute</h1>

<p>Overall, this was a great experience as it quickly became clear that my neural net is overfit to the US lifestyle. I think of UK as throwing in some perturbations to your visual and verbal input (some may seem adversarial, but mostly just random) which, as we know, is good for robustness, generalization and what not.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Is grass greener there? <b>A</b>: Yes, of course. Especially, if you live next to the Regent’s Park.</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Is it your cup of tea? <b>A</b>: No, I still only function on Redbull, but the afternoon teas are a great experience. Proximity to cutting-edge tech, CS research and startups still matters most to me. However, if you are into math or finance, your mileage will almost certainly vary. Also, London seems perfect for a short-term visit/sabbatical, especially if you want to take a break from the tech hype, write a book, explore Europe, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: What’s up with the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/">Alan Turing Institute</a> and DeepMind? <b>A</b>: These two are probably the most happening places in the UK right now in academia and industry respectively. They are within a 5-minute walk from each other in King’s Cross. I was staying right across the road and it was perfect except for no AC. ATI serves as a meeting hub for researchers from all of the top UK schools (Cambridge, Oxford, Warwick, UCL, Edinburgh, etc.).
ATI is based inside the British library, which was the largest public building constructed in the UK in the 20th century. ATI has its own space inside the library which is equipped similarly to Google/FB offices. Except no free food, only drinks – would you want to have free British food anyway?</li>

<div class="content">
In [20] Goldwasser, Grossman and Holden  introduced pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for search problems where a powerful prover can convince a probabilistic polynomial time verifier that a solution to a search problem is canonical.  They studied  search problems for which polynomial time algorithms are not known and for which many solutions are possible. They showed that whereas there exists a constant round pseudo deterministic proof for graph isomorphism where the canonical solution is the lexicographically smallest isomorphism, the existence of pseudo-deterministic interactive proofs for NP-hard problems would imply the collapse of the polynomial time hierarchy.

In this paper, we turn our attention to studying  doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proofs for polynomial time search problems:  pseudo-deterministic proofs with the extra requirement that the prover runtime is polynomial  and the verifier runtime to verify that a solution is canonical is significantly lower  than the complexity of finding any solution, canonical or otherwise. Naturally this question is particularly interesting for search problems for which a lower bound on its worst case complexity  is known or has been widely conjectured. 

We show doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic algorithms for a host of natural problems whose complexity has long been conjectured. In particular:

We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for linear programming where the canonical solution which the prover will provide is  the lexicographically greatest optimal solution for the LP. To this end, we show how through perturbing the linear program and strong duality this solution can be both  computed efficiently by the prover, and verified by the verifier.  
The time of the verifier is $O(d^2 )$ for a linear program with integer data and at most $d$ variables and constraints, whereas the time to solve such linear program is $\tilde{O}(d^{\omega} )$ by randomized algorithms [11] for $\omega$  the exponent for fast matrix multiplication .


We show a doubly efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for 3-SUM and problems reducible to 3-SUM where the prover is a $O(n^2)$ time algorithm and the verifier takes time $\tilde{O}(n^{1.5})$. 


We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the hitting set problem} where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(m)$ and the prover runs in time $\tilde{O}(m^2)$ where $ m = \sum_{S \in \mathcal{S}} |S| + \sum_{T \in \mathcal{T}} |T|$ for inputs  collections of sets $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}$.

We show a doubly-efficient pseudo-deterministic proof for the Zero Weight Triangle problem where the verifier runs in time $\tilde{O}(n^{2 + \omega/3})$ and the prover runs in randomized time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$. The Zero Weight Triangle problem is equivalent to the All-Pairs Shortest Path problem, a well-studied problem that is the foundation of many hardness results in graph algorithms [39,38], under sub-cubic reductions.</div>

We study the problem of finding monotone subsequences in an array from the viewpoint of sublinear algorithms. For fixed $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that the non-adaptive query complexity of finding a length-$k$ monotone subsequence of $f \colon [n] \to \mathbb{R}$, assuming that $f$ is $\varepsilon$-far from free of such subsequences, is $\Theta((\log n)^{\lfloor \log_2 k \rfloor})$. Prior to our work, the best algorithm for this problem, due to Newman, Rabinovich, Rajendraprasad, and Sohler (2017), made $(\log n)^{O(k^2)}$ non-adaptive queries; and the only lower bound known, of $\Omega(\log n)$ queries for the case $k = 2$, followed from that on testing monotonicity due to Erg\"un, Kannan, Kumar, Rubinfeld, and Viswanathan (2000) and Fischer (2004).</div>

<p><s>Five</s> Six papers this month: results on testing separations, linearity testing in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), testing for regular languages, graph property testing, topological property testing, and Boolean rank. </p>



<p><strong>Hard properties with (very) short PCPPs and their applications</strong>, by Omri Ben-Eliezer, Eldar Fischer, Amit Levi, and Ron D. Rothblum (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/088/">arXiv</a>). Probably, the most significant takeaway from this work is a (largest possible) separation between standard and tolerant property testing. PCPPs (Probabilistically Checkable Proofs of Proximity) are the “NP” variant of property testing, where the tester is aided by a proof string. Consider property \(\mathcal{P}\). If \(x \in \mathcal{P}\), there must be a proof string that makes the tester accept (with probability 1). If \(x\) is far from \(\mathcal{P}\) (in the usual property testing sense), for any proof string, the tester must reject with sufficiently high probability. PCPPs have played a role in the classical constructions of PCPs, but have also found uses in getting a better understanding of property testing itself. And this paper shows how PCPP constructions can be used to get property testing separations. The main result in this paper is a property \(\mathcal{P}\) that (basically) requires \(\Omega(n)\) queries to “property test”, but has a PCPP system where the proof length is \(\widetilde{O}(n)\). (\(n\) is the input length.) The main construction uses collections of random linear codes. Significantly, these constructions show a strong separation between standard vs tolerant property testing, and standard vs erasure-resilient property testing. (The latter is a recent variant by <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/16M1075661?journalCode=smjcat">Dixit et al</a>, where certain parts of the input are hidden from the tester.) There is a property that is testable in a constant number of queries, but requires \(\widetilde{\Omega}(n)\) queries to test tolerantly (for any non-trivial choice of parameters). An analogous result holds for erasure-resilient testing.</p>



<p><strong>Distribution-Free Testing of Linear Functions on R^n</strong>, by Noah Fleming and Yuichi Yoshida (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03391">arXiv</a>). Linearity testing is arguably <em>the</em> canonical problem in property testing, yet there is still much to be learned about it. This paper considers functions \(f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\), and the <em>distribution-free setting</em>. (In this setting, distance is measured according is an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) over the input, and the tester can access samples from this distribution. For \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the “standard” distribution would the \(n\)-dimensional Gaussian.) The main result is that linearity testing can be done in the distribution-free setting with \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\) queries, assuming that the distribution is continuous. The primary technical tool, an interesting result in its own right, is that additivity \((f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y))\) can be tested in \(\widetilde{O}(1/\varepsilon)\) queries. The significance of the testing result is cemented by an \(\Omega(n)\) lower bound for sample-based testers.</p>



<p><strong>Sliding window property testing for regular languages</strong> by Moses Ganardi, Danny Hucke, Markus Lohrey, Tatiana Starikovskaya (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10261">arXiv</a>). Fix a regular language \(\mathcal{R}\). Consider the streaming model, and the basic question of recognizing whether the string (being streamed) is in \(\mathcal{R}\). Simple, you will say! Run the DFA recognizing \(\mathcal{R}\) in constant space. Now, suppose there is a sliding window length of \(n\). The aim is to determine if the past \(n\) symbols (the “active window”) form a string in \(\mathcal{R}\). Suprisingly (at least to me), there is a full characterization of the space required for randomized algorithms, and (depending on \(\mathcal{R}\)), it is either \(\Theta(1)\), \(\Theta(\log\log n)\), \(\Theta(\log n)\), or \(\Theta(n)\).  In the interest of beating these lower bounds, suppose we wish to property test on the active window. It turns out the answer is quite nuanced. There are deterministic \(O(\log n)\)-space testers and randomized two-sided \(O(1/\varepsilon)\)-space testers for all regular languages. For randomized one-sided testers, there are multiple possibilities for the optimal space complexity, and there is a full characterization of these regular languages.</p>



<p><strong>A characterization of graph properties testable for general planar graphs with one-sided error (It’s all about forbidden subgraphs)</strong> by Artur Czumaj and Christian Sohler (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.10647.pdf">arXiv</a>). Property testing of sparse graphs has been receiving more attention, but most results focus on the bounded degree setting. Unfortunately, many of these results break quite dramatically on sparse graphs with unbounded degrees. This paper focuses on property testing, within the class of unbounded degree planar graphs. (Meaning, the input is always assumed to be planar.) The results achieve a significant goal: as the title suggests, there is a complete characterization of properties that are constant-query testable with one-sided error. The easier part is in showing that all such properties can be reduced to testing \(H\)-freeness. The harder (remarkable) result is \(H\)-freeness can be tested in general planar queries with constant queries. (This is non-trivial even for triangle-freeness.) And, as is easy to conjecture but hard to prove, these results carry over for all minor-closed families.  As a small indication of the challenge, most testers for bounded-degree graphs work by doing constant depth BFSes. When high degree vertices are present, this method fails, and we really need new ideas to deal with such graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Near Coverings and Cosystolic Expansion – an example of topological property testing</strong> by Irit Dinur and Roy Meshulam (<a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2019/126/">ECCC</a>). In most algebraic settings, property testing results can be seen as local to global theorems. When do local constraints on a large object imply a global condition? This paper gives a topological instantiation of this phenomenon. We need to define the <em>cover</em> of a simplicial complex \(X\). For concreteness, think of a 2D simplicial complex \(X\), which is a hypergraph with hyperedges of size at most 3, where subsets of hyperedges are also present. A 2-cover is a simplicial complex \(X’\) with the following property. It has two copies of each vertex of \(X\). Each hyperedge of \(X\) must have two “corresponding” disjoint copies in \(X’\). Let the copies of vertex \(v\) be \(v_0, v_1\). Then, for every hyperedge (say) \((u,v,w)\) of \(X\), there must be two disjoint hyperedges in \(X’\) involving copies of the corresponding vertices. One can consider the property testing twist: if the neighborhoods of “most” vertices \(v\) in \(X\) satisfy these condition (with respect to the neighborhoods of the copies of \(v\) in \(X’\)), then is \(X’\) close to being a cover of \(X\)? Indeed, this paper proves that such a “property testing condition” holds iff \(X\) is a high-dimensional expander.</p>



<p><strong>Property testing of the Boolean and binary rank</strong> by Michal Parnas, Dana Ron, and Adi Shraibman (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11632">arXiv</a>). The Boolean rank of a matrix \(M\) is a fundamental quantity that appears in many lower bound constructions. (Recall that an \(n \times m\) Boolean matrix \(M\) has a rank \(r\) if \(M\) can be expressed as \(X \cdot Y\), where \(X \in \mathbb{F}_2^{n \times d}\) and \(Y \in \mathbb{F}_2^{d \times m}\).) In the real-valued setting, results show that one can property test rank in \(poly(d/\varepsilon)\) queries. This paper proves an analogous result for the Boolean rank. There is a surprise element here: over reals, the rank can be computed in polynomial time, and many of the geometric intuitions can be brought over to the property testing problem. On the other hand, the Boolean rank is NP-hard to compute exactly, yet we can still get a tester with \(poly(d)\) query complexity. The paper also gives results for <em>binary rank</em>. For the binary rank, we require the component matrices \(X, Y\) to be Boolean, but algebraic operations are over the reals. In the case, the tester has query complexity \(2^{2d}\) (with varying dependencies on \(\varepsilon\) for adaptive/non-adaptive testers). The intriguing open problem is whether \(poly(d)\)-query testers exist for binary rank.</p>
