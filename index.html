<div class="content">
<p>The last couple of years, for International Women’s Day, I’ve posted about <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/03/08/more-mathematics-books.html">mathematics books by women covered by recently added Wikipedia articles</a>. I have a few more of those that I could list today, and a few more that I plan to add, but instead, I thought I’d list books on mathematics and related areas that look interesting enough to me that I want to add them to Wikipedia, but haven’t, because I haven’t found enough reviews to use as the basis for an article.</p>

<p>If you know of more reviews for these, please let me know! I need at least three in-depth reviews, published in journals or by major societies rather than just on a web site or someone’s blog, by three different reviewers, to be comfortable writing a Wikipedia article. It would also help convince other Wikipedians that the topic is a worthy one for Wikipedia if it had at least one review in an actual journal, not just in the MAA, EMS, AMS, and zbMATH review collections, for which one could argue that a review is “routine coverage” that doesn’t suggest any particular significance for a book. Even if you can’t find more reviews, you might find some of these titles and topics intriguing enough to read the books.</p>

$r$-locally checkable problems. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm that
takes as input a graph with an associated clique-width expression and solves a
$1$-locally checkable problem under certain restrictions. We show that it runs
in polynomial time in graphs of bounded clique-width, when the number of colors
of the locally checkable problem is fixed. Furthermore, we present a first
extension of our framework to global properties by taking into account the
sizes of the color classes, and consequently enlarge the set of problems
solvable in polynomial time with our approach in graphs of bounded
clique-width. As examples, we apply this setting to the $k$-Roman domination
problem, as well as the $k$-community problem and some of its variants, thus
providing the first linear and polynomial-time algorithms, respectively, in
graphs of bounded clique-width for these problems.

quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a
general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree,
and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In
particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost
$O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that
can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$.
</p>
<p>Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a
similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the
"guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing
complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by
Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory.
This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing
complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure.
We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the
complete binary AND-OR tree.
</p>
<p>Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for
Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an
assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of
changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective
value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting
scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and
argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for
which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and
Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked
whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.

Despite
a long line of research, existing algorithms still only consider two choices of
offline neighbors for each online vertex because of the technical challenge in
analyzing multiple choices. This paper introduces two approaches for designing
and analyzing algorithms that use multiple choices. For unweighted and
vertex-weighted matching, we adopt the online correlated selection (OCS)
technique into the stochastic setting, and improve the competitive ratios to
$0.716$, from $0.711$ and $0.7$ respectively. For edge-weighted matching with
free disposal, we propose the Top Half Sampling algorithm. We directly
characterize the progress of the whole matching instead of individual vertices,
through a differential inequality. This improves the competitive ratio to
$0.706$, breaking the $1-\frac{1}{e}$ barrier in this setting for the first
time in the literature. Finally, for the harder edge-weighted problem without
free disposal, we prove that no algorithms can be $0.703$ competitive,
separating this setting from the aforementioned three.

method we choose affect the quality of the approximate sample we obtain? In
practice, there are many answers. However, in theory, there are still gaps in
our understanding. In this paper, we address this question from the point of
view of complexity theory, providing bounds in terms of the size of the desired
error.

widely believed to exhibit a statistical/computational gap, but there is
surprisingly little formal evidence for this belief, even in the form of
examples that are hard for restricted classes of algorithms. Recent work has
shown that, for certain covariance matrices, the broad class of Preconditioned
Lasso programs provably cannot succeed on polylogarithmically sparse signals
with a sublinear number of samples. However, this lower bound only shows that
for every preconditioner, there exists at least one signal that it fails to
recover successfully. This leaves open the possibility that, for example,
trying multiple different preconditioners solves every sparse linear regression
problem.
</p>
<p>In this work, we prove a stronger lower bound that overcomes this issue. For
an appropriate covariance matrix, we construct a single signal distribution on
which any invertibly-preconditioned Lasso program fails with high probability,
unless it receives a linear number of samples.
</p>
<p>Surprisingly, at the heart of our lower bound is a new positive result in
compressed sensing. We show that standard sparse random designs are with high
probability robust to adversarial measurement erasures, in the sense that if
$b$ measurements are erased, then all but $O(b)$ of the coordinates of the
signal are still information-theoretically identifiable. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that partial recoverability of arbitrary sparse signals under
erasures has been studied in compressed sensing.

literature of upper bounds, lower bounds, and applications. The goal is to
store a dynamically-changing set of $n$ items in an array of $m$ slots, while
maintaining the invariant that the items appear in sorted order, and while
minimizing the relabeling cost, defined to be the number of items that are
moved per insertion/deletion.
</p>
<p>For the linear regime, where $m = (1 + \Theta(1)) n$, an upper bound of
$O(\log^2 n)$ on the relabeling cost has been known since 1981. A lower bound
of $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ is known for deterministic algorithms and for so-called
smooth algorithms, but the best general lower bound remains $\Omega(\log n)$.
The central open question in the field is whether $O(\log^2 n)$ is optimal for
all algorithms.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we give a randomized data structure that achieves an expected
relabeling cost of $O(\log^{1.5} n)$ per operation. More generally, if $m = (1
+ \varepsilon) n$ for $\varepsilon = O(1)$, the expected relabeling cost
becomes $O(\varepsilon^{-1} \log^{1.5} n)$.
</p>
<p>Our solution is history independent, meaning that the state of the data
structure is independent of the order in which items are inserted/deleted. For
history-independent data structures, we also prove a matching lower bound: for
all $\epsilon$ between $1 / n^{1/3}$ and some sufficiently small positive
constant, the optimal expected cost for history-independent list-labeling
solutions is $\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^{3/2} n)$.

complexity is inadequate to analyze data movement. This work expands upon Data
Movement Distance, a recently proposed framework for memory-aware algorithm
analysis, by 1) demonstrating that its assumptions conform with
microarchitectural trends, 2) applying it to six variants of matrix
multiplication, and 3) showing it to be capable of asymptotically
differentiating algorithms with the same time complexity but different memory
behavior, as well as locality optimized vs. non-optimized versions of the same
algorithm. In doing so, we attempt to bridge theory and practice by combining
the operation count analysis used by asymptotic time complexity with
per-operation data movement cost resulting from hierarchical memory structure.
Additionally, this paper derives the first fully precise, fully analytical form
of recursive matrix multiplication's miss ratio curve on LRU caching systems.
Our results indicate that the Data Movement Distance framework is a powerful
tool going forward for engineers and algorithm designers to understand the
algorithmic implications of hierarchical memory.

<p class="justify-text">Symmetric positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices come up in a variety of places in machine learning, statistics, and optimization, and more generally in most domains of applied mathematics. When estimating or optimizing over the set of such matrices, several geometries can be used. The most direct one is to consider PSD matrices as a convex set in the vector space of all symmetric matrices and thus to inherit the Euclidean geometry. Like for the positive orthant (which corresponds to diagonal PSD matrices), this is not natural for a variety of reasons. In this post we will consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bregman_divergence">Bregman divergences</a> to define our notion of geometry.</p>



<p class="justify-text">A first natural and common geometry is to consider PSD matrices as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix">covariance matrices</a> (or their inverses, often referred to a precision or concentration matrices). They can thus be seen as parameters of zero-mean Gaussian random vectors, and classical notions from information theory, such as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, can be brought to bear to define a specific geometry. This happens to be equivalent to using the negative log determinant to define the Bregman divergence, and leads to the usual Stein divergence $$ – \log \det A + \log \det B \ – {\rm tr}[ – B^{\, -1} ( A \, – B) ] =  -\log \det (AB^{\, -1}) + {\rm tr}( A B^{\, -1}) + d, $$ which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback Leibler divergence</a> between two Gaussian random vectors with zero means and covariance matrices \(B\) and \(A\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">In this blog post, we consider a different but related matrix function, which will be \(A \mapsto {\rm tr }  [ A \log A]\) instead of \(– {\rm tr} [ \log A ]\). This will have stronger links with the Shannon entropy of discrete random variables [1]. In particular, we will be able to extend two classical notions related to discrete entropy:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>The entropy function \(H(p) = \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i\), defined on the simplex \(\Delta \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) (vectors with non-negative components that sum to one), is concave, while the associated Bregman divergence, here the usual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence">Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence</a>, is $$ \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}. $$ It is jointly convex in the vectors \(p\) and \(q\) (see this nice article [<a href="http://carma.newcastle.edu.au/resources/jon/Preprints/Books/CUP/CUPold/MaterialI/bregman.pdf">6</a>] for other jointly convex Bregman divergences). Note that the joint convexity is here a direct application of classical results regarding the convexity of the perspective of a convex function [<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf">10</a>, section 3.2.6].</li><li>The Fenchel-Legendre conjugate of \(-H\) (with the simplex as domain) is $$\sup_{p \in \Delta} \ \ p^\top z\ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \log \Big( \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i) \Big).$$ With the positive orthant as the domain, we have $$\sup_{p \in \mathbb{R}_+^d }\ \ p^\top z \ – \sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log p_i = \sum_{i=1}^d \exp(z_i-1) .$$ This has many consequences in probabilistic modelling, notably the duality between maximum likelihood and maximum entropy [1, <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/Papers/WaiJor08_FTML.pdf">7</a>].</li></ul>



<p class="justify-text">The extension to matrices will have several interesting consequences:</p>



<ul class="justify-text"><li>This defines a Bregman divergence that has interesting applications to mirror descent and smoothing techniques in optimization.</li><li>The non-trivial joint convexity of the associated Bregman divergence will lead to elegant methods for deriving concentration inequalities for symmetric matrices [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>].</li><li>Application to covariance operators in infinite-dimensional spaces will lead to a whole range of information-theoretic results [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], but this is for next month!</li></ul>



<h2 id="von-neumann-entropy-and-relative-entropy">Von Neumann entropy and relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Given a positive semi-definite symmetric matrix \(A \in \mathcal{S}_d\), the von Neumann entropy is defined as $$H(A) =\ – {\rm tr} [ A \log A],$$ as the trace of the matrix function \(– A \log A\), or equivalently as \(– \sum_{i=1}^d \! \lambda_i \log \lambda_i\) where \(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_d \geqslant 0\) are the \(d\) eigenvalues of \(A\) (note that we can have a zero eigenvalue and still be finite). </p>



<p class="justify-text">From <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last month blog post</a>, we get that \(H\) is concave. We can then naturally define on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrahedron">spectrahedron</a> (set of positive semi-definite matrices with unit trace), the <em>relative entropy</em>, which is the Bregman divergence associated with the function \(A \mapsto {\rm tr} [ A \log A]\), whose gradient is \(\log A + I \), leading to: $$D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} [ A \log A ] \, – {\rm tr} [ B \log B] \, – {\rm tr} \big[ ( A \, – B) ( \log B + I ) \big],$$ which is equal to $$ D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A \,  – \log B ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This time we have to be careful to avoid infinite values: it is finite if and only if the null space of \(B\) is included in the one of \(A\), or, equivalently if \(B^{\, -1/2} A^{1/2} B^{\, -1/2}\) is finite. Note that when \(A\) and \(B\) have unit traces, the term in \(– {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\) goes away.</p>



<p class="justify-text">As a Bregman divergence of a strictly convex function, \(D(A\|B)\) is non-negative and equal to zero if and only if \(A = B\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">When \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) and \(B = {\rm Diag}(q)\) are diagonal, we get $$D(A\| B) = \sum_{i=1}^d \Big\{ p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \, – p_i + q_i \Big\},$$ and we recover the traditional relative entropy. </p>



<p class="justify-text">Please refrain from writing \(D(A\| B) = {\rm tr} \big[ A \log ( A B^{\,-1} ) \big] – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B)\), which is not true unless \(A\) and \(B\) commute. See however below how using Kronecker products can make a similar equality always true.</p>



<h2>A geometry on matrices</h2>



<p class="justify-text">The von Neumann relative entropy (also referred to as matrix KL divergence) defines a new notion of geometry, which is different from the Euclidean geometry based on the squared Frobenius norm \(\| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 = {\rm tr} [ ( A -B)^2]\). Below, we plot and compare balls for these various geometries. We first consider Euclidean balls, defined as $$\mbox{ Euclidean : } \  \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  \| A – B \|_{\rm F}^2 \leqslant r \big\},$$ as well as the two KL balls (one for each side of the KL divergence): $$ \mbox{ Left KL : } \ \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(B\|A)  \leqslant r \big\},$$ $$\mbox{ Right KL : } \big\{ B \in \mathcal{S}_d,  D(A\|B) \leqslant r \big\}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Diagonal matrices with unit trace (isomorphic to the simplex).</strong> We consider diagonal matrices \(A = {\rm Diag}(p)\) with \(p\) in the simplex. We compare the three balls below (in yellow), with \(r = 1/16\) for the three of them.</p>

<p class="justify-text">While the Euclidean balls have the same shapes at all positions, the KL balls adapt their shapes to their centers.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Unit trace PSD matrices in dimension two (isomorphic to the Euclidean ball).</strong> We consider matrices \(A = \Big( \begin{array}{cc} x &amp; y \\[-.15cm] y &amp; \!\!\!1-x\!\end{array} \Big)\) with the PSD constraint being equivalent to \(y^2 \leqslant x(1-x)\), that is, \((x,y)\) is in the disk of center \((\frac{1}{2},0)\) and radius \(\frac{1}{2}\). We compare the three balls below (in yellow), with \(r = \frac{1}{32}\) for the Euclidean ball, and \(r =\frac{1}{16}\) for the KL balls, with a similar difference between geometries.</p>

<h2 id="pinsker-inequality-1">Pinsker inequality</h2>



<p class="justify-text">In order to use the relative entropy within mirror descent, we need an extension of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality">Pinsker inequality</a> $$\sum_{i=1}^d p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \Big(\sum_{i=1}^d | p_i – q_i| \Big)^2,$$ which is, in optimization terms, the \(1\)-strong-concavity of the entropy with respect to the \(\ell_1\)-norm. It turns out that the natural extension is true, that is, for PSD matrices with unit trace, $$D(A\| B) =  {\rm tr} \big[ A ( \log A\,   – \log B ) \big] \geqslant \frac{1}{2} \| A \ – B \|_\ast^2,$$ where \(\| \cdot \|_\ast\) denotes the trace norm, a.k.a. the nuclear norm, that is, the \(\ell_1\)-norm of eigenvalues. See [<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yaoliang/mynotes/sc.pdf">3</a>] for a nice and simple proof.</p>



<p class="justify-text">This allows to use the relative entropy when optimizing over the spectrahedron using mirror descent [<a href="https://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/MLOptChapterI.pdf">11</a>]. Note that the diameter \(\sup_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \ –   \inf_{A} {\rm tr} [ A \log A] \) over PSD matrices with unit trace is equal to \(\log d\). Using duality, the relative entropy can also be used for smoothing the maximal eigenvalue of a matrix [<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10107-006-0001-8.pdf">12</a>].</p>



<h2 id="joint-convexity-of-matrix-relative-entropy">Joint convexity of matrix relative entropy</h2>



<p class="justify-text">While the convexity with respect to \(A\) is straightforward, the relative entropy \(D(A \| B)\) is also <em>jointly</em> convex in \((A,B)\), which is crucial in the developments below. There exist several proofs, but one is particularly elegant [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0604206.pdf">4</a>] and will use the matrix-monotonicity that I presented in the <a href="https://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a>.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Kronecker products.</strong> We need to make a clever use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_product">Kronecker products</a>. Given two matrices \(A\) and \(B\) of any sizes, \(A \otimes B\) is the matrix defined by blocks \(A_{ij} B\), thus of size the products of the number of rows and columns of \(A\) and \(B\). In the derivations below, both \(A\) and \(B\) will be of size \(d \times d\), and thus \(A \otimes B\) is then of size \(d^2 \times d^2\). </p>



<p class="justify-text">Kronecker products have very nice properties (they would probably deserve their own post!), such as (when dimensions are compatible), \((A \otimes B) ( C\otimes D) = (AC) \otimes (BD)\) or \((A \otimes B)^{\, -1} = A^{-1} \otimes B^{\, -1}\). What we will leverage is their use in characterizing linear operations on matrices. For a rectangular matrix \(X \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 \times d_2}\), \({\rm vec}(X) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_1 d_2 \times 1}\) denotes the <em>vectorization</em> of \(X\) obtained by stacking all columns of \(X\) one after the other in a single column vector. Then, we have $$ (B^\top \otimes A){\rm vec}(X) = {\rm vec}(AXB)$$ for any \(A, X, B\) with compatible dimensions. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Reformulation of relative entropy.</strong> We can now use Kronecker products to get: $$ {\rm tr} [A \log A] = {\rm tr}[ A^{1/2}( \log A) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [ I \otimes \log A ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ and $$ {\rm tr} [A \log B] = {\rm tr} [ A^{1/2}( \log B) A^{1/2} ] = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top [    \log B \otimes I  ] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}),$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ I \otimes \log A \ – \log B \otimes I \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ The key element is then to use the identity for PSD matrices $$\log(C \otimes D) = \log C \otimes I + I \otimes \log D$$ (which can be shown using the fact that eigenvalue decomposition of a Kronecker product of symmetric matrices can be obtained from the decompositions of the factors), leading to $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( I \otimes A) \ – \log (B \otimes I) \big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})\, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ It seems we have not achieved much, but now, the matrices \( I \otimes A\) and \(B \otimes I\) commute! Therefore, we can now write $$D(A\|B) = {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ \log \big( ( I \otimes A) (B \otimes I)^{-1} \big) \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})- {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ This can then be rewritten as $$D(A\|B)  =\, – {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \big[ \log ( B \otimes A^{-1}) \big] {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \, – {\rm tr}(A) + {\rm tr}(B).$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Using matrix-convexity.</strong> We can now use the matrix-convexity of \(\lambda \mapsto \ – \log \lambda\), and the representation from <a href="http://francisbach.com/matrix-monotony-and-convexity/">last post</a> as $$ -\log \lambda = 1-\lambda + (\lambda-1)^2 \int_0^{+\infty} \!\!\frac{1}{\lambda +u} \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ leading to $$D(A\|B) =  \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})^\top \Big[ ( B\otimes A^{-1} – I)^2 (B\otimes A^{-1} + u I)^{-1} \Big]  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2}) \frac{du}{(1+u)^2},$$ and then, by using  \(( B\otimes A^{-1} – I) ( I \otimes A^{1/2})  {\rm vec}(A^{1/2})  =  {\rm vec}(B-A)\), $$D(A\|B) =   \int_0^{+\infty}  {\rm vec}(A-B)^\top  (B\otimes I+ u I \otimes A)^{-1}   {\rm vec}(A-B)   \frac{du}{(1+u)^2}.$$ We can then use the joint convexity of the function \((C,D) \mapsto {\rm tr} \big[  C^\top D^{-1} C \big] \) to get the  joint convexity of \(D(A\|B)\).</p>



<p class="justify-text">This extends to all matrix-convex functions beyond the logarithm, such as \(\lambda \mapsto (\lambda-1)^2\), \(\lambda \mapsto 1 \, – \lambda^{1/2}\) or \(\displaystyle \lambda \mapsto \frac{1}{\lambda}(\lambda-1)^2\), leading to other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-divergence">\(f\)-divergences</a> between matrices. See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>, Appendix A.4] for details.</p>



<h2 id="lieb-concavity-theorems">Lieb concavity theorems</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that \((A,B) \mapsto D(A\|B)\) is jointly convex on all PSD matrices (not only unit trace), for any fixed symmetric matrix \(M\), the function $$ \varphi: B \mapsto \sup_{ A \succcurlyeq 0} \ {\rm tr}(AM) + {\rm tr}(A) \ – D(A\|B), $$ as the partial maximization (with respect to \(B\)) of a jointly concave function of \((A,B)\), is concave. We can maximize in closed form with respect to \(A\) by computing the gradient \(M \ – \log A  + \log B\), leading to \(A = \exp( M + \log B)\), and $$\varphi(B) = {\rm tr} \exp ( M + \log B),$$ which defines a concave function. This is one version of the classical Lieb concavity theorems [<a href="http://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000187087390011X/pdf?md5=09b7ceaa543358cef395fa6af8de62aa&amp;pid=1-s2.0-000187087390011X-main.pdf">8</a>]. </p>



<p class="justify-text">As a consequence, we can obtain the “subadditivity of the matrix cumulant generative function”. That is, for any random <em>independent</em> symmetric matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) of the same sizes, $$ \mathbb{E} \Big[  {\rm tr} \exp \big(   \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \big) \Big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \big( \sum_{i=1}^n \log \big( \mathbb{E} [ \exp( X_i ) ] \big),$$ which can be shown by recursion using Jensen’s inequality for the function \(\varphi\) above with a well-chosen matrix \(M\). See [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>] for details.</p>



<p class="justify-text">We are now ready to consider concentration inequalities for random matrices.</p>



<h2 id="application-to-concentration-inequalities">Application to concentration inequalities</h2>



<p class="justify-text">We consider random independent random matrices \(X_1,\dots,X_n\) such that \(\mathbb{E} [ X_i ] = 0\) for all \(i \in \{1,\dots,n\}\). Let \(S = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \! X_i\) (which has zero mean). Our goal is to provide upper bounds on \(\mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big]\) and \(\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big]\). We follow the outstanding work and presentation of <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~jtropp/">Joel Tropp</a> [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>]: using the proper matrix tools presented above, we can get for matrix-valued random variables the almost exact same proofs of the usual concentration inequalities for real-valued random <em>variables</em>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality">Hoeffding</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernstein_inequalities_(probability_theory)">Bernstein</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azuma%27s_inequality">Azuma</a>, or Mac-Diarmid inequalities. </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Expectation. </strong>We have, for any \(u &gt; 0\), by homogeneity of the largest eigenvalue: $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] = \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(uS) \big] =  \frac{1}{u}  \mathbb{E} \big[  \log \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big].$$ We can then use Jensen’s inequality for the logarithm to get (together with the fact the largest eigenvalue of the exponential is the exponential of the largest eigenvalue): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big]=\frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ ( \lambda_{\max}( \exp ( uS) ) \big], $$ and finally that for a PSD matrix the trace is larger than the largest eigenvalue, to get $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u}  \log \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ Experts in concentration inequalities have probably recognized the usual argument to bound the expectation of the maximum of \(d\) random <em>real-valued</em> (non necessarily independent) variables \(X_1,\dots,X_d\), as $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \big] \leqslant \frac{1}{u} \log \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Tail bound.</strong> We have, using Markov’s inequality, for any \(u &gt; 0\): $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] = \mathbb{P} \big[ \exp(\lambda_{\max}(uS)) \geqslant \exp(ut) \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp ( \lambda_{\max}(uS) ) \big],$$ thus leading to $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big].$$ The same experts have recognized $$ \mathbb{P} \big[ \max \{Y_1,\dots,Y_d\} \geqslant t \big] \leqslant  e^{-ut} \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp(uY_1)+ \cdots + \exp(u Y_d) \big].$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">We can now consider random matrices such that \(a I \preccurlyeq X_i \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely for all \(i=1,\dots,n\) (and still with zero mean). We first need a lemma whose proof is given at the end of the post, with the exact same proof as for the uni-dimensional case.</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I.$$ </p>



<p class="justify-text">Together with the consequence of Lieb’s result presented above and the matrix-monotonicity of the logarithm, we get: $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ {\rm tr} \exp (  uS ) \big] \leqslant {\rm tr} \exp \Big( n \big( \frac{u^2}{8n^2}(b-a)^2 I \big) \Big) = d  \exp \big(   \frac{u^2}{8n}(b-a)^2 \big).$$ We can then get immediately, by optimizing with respect to \(u\) (with optimal value \(u=4 n t /(b-a)^2\)), $$\mathbb{P} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \geqslant t \big] \leqslant d \exp\big( – \frac{2 n t^2 }{(b-a)^2} \big),$$ and, with optimal value \(u= {2 \sqrt{2 n \log d }}/ { (b-a) }\): $$  \mathbb{E} \big[ \lambda_{\max}(S) \big] \leqslant \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{2n}} \sqrt{ \log d}.$$</p>



<p class="justify-text">Note that these are the exact same results as when \(d=1\)! </p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Extensions.</strong> As nicely detailed in [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571">2</a>], there are extensions to all classical concentration inequalities. Moreover, this can be applied to rectangular matrices, where the largest eigenvalue is replaced by the largest singular value. Finally, for those who like to work in infinite dimensions and cannot bear the explicit dependence in dimension, it is possible to derive results that depend only on a well-defined notion of “intrinsic dimension” (the associated results can then be used for the study of kernel methods, see [<a href="http://di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_book.pdf">13</a>, chapter 9]).</p>



<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="justify-text">Now that we know everything about the matrix relative entropy and its convexity properties, we will explore next month a new link between eigenvalues of covariance operators and the regular Shannon entropy of the generating probability distribution [<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08545.pdf">5</a>], thus mixing my favorite recent mathematical topic with my probably all-time favorite one: positive definite kernels!</p>

<h2 id="proof-of-lemma-on-matrix-cumulant-generating-functions">Proof of lemma on matrix cumulant generating functions</h2>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Lemma.</strong> If \(\mathbb{E} [ X ] = 0\) and \(a I \preccurlyeq X \preccurlyeq b I\) almost surely, then for all \(u &gt; 0\), $$ \mathbb{E} \big[ \exp( u X) \big] \preccurlyeq \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 I \big) =  \exp\big( \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \big) I .$$ Note that we have \(a \leqslant 0 \leqslant b\).</p>



<p class="justify-text"><strong>Proof</strong>. We follow the standard proof [9] for real-valued random variables, simply transferred to the matrix case. On the interval \([a,b]\), by convexity of the exponential function $$ \exp(u\lambda) \leqslant \exp(ub) \frac{\lambda-a}{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{b \, – \lambda}{b-a}.$$ Thus (check why we can do this), almost surely: $$ \exp(uX) \preccurlyeq \exp(ub) \frac{X-a I }{b-a} + \exp(ua) \frac{bI  – X}{b-a},$$ leading to \(\displaystyle \mathbb{E} [ \exp(uX) ]  \preccurlyeq   \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a} I\). We can then show that \(\displaystyle \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \leqslant \exp \Big(  \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2 \Big)\) to conclude the proof. We thus need to show that \(\displaystyle \psi(u) = \log \Big( \frac{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}{b-a}  \Big) \leqslant \frac{u^2}{8}(b-a)^2\) for all \(u \geqslant 0\). We can simply express \(\psi(u)\) as a rescaled logistic function as $$\psi(u) =  ua + \log \frac{b}{b-a} + \log\Big[ 1 + \exp\Big( u(b-a) + \log\frac{-a}{b-a} \Big) \Big].$$ We have \(\psi(0) = 0\), and $$\psi'(u) =  \frac{ba \exp(ua)\ – ab \exp(ub)}{b \exp(ua)\ – a \exp(ub)}, $$ thus \(\psi'(0) = 0\), and through the link with the logistic function, the second-order derivarive is less than \((b-a)^2 / 4\). This leads to the desired result by Taylor’s formula.</p>

A seminal result in learning theory characterizes the PAC learnability of binary classes through the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Extending this characterization to the general multiclass setting has been open since the pioneering works on multiclass PAC learning in the late 1980s. This work resolves this problem: we characterize multiclass PAC learnability through the DS dimension, a combinatorial dimension defined by Daniely and Shalev-Shwartz (2014). 

The classical characterization of the binary case boils down to empirical risk minimization. In contrast, our characterization of the multiclass case involves a variety of algorithmic ideas; these include a natural setting we call list PAC learning. In the list learning setting, instead of predicting a single outcome for a given unseen input, the goal is to provide a short menu of predictions. 

Our second main result concerns the Natarajan dimension, which has been a central candidate for characterizing multiclass learnability. This dimension was introduced by Natarajan (1988) as a barrier for PAC learning. Whether the Natarajan dimension characterizes PAC learnability in general has been posed as an open question in several papers since. This work provides a negative answer: we construct a non-learnable class with Natarajan dimension one. 

For the construction, we identify a fundamental connection between concept classes and topology (i.e., colorful simplicial complexes). We crucially rely on a deep and involved construction of hyperbolic pseudo-manifolds by Januszkiewicz and Swiatkowski. It is interesting that hyperbolicity is directly related to learning problems that are difficult to solve although no obvious barriers exist. This is another demonstration of the fruitful links machine learning has with different areas in mathematics.</div>

They can't even agree on what to have for lunch.  </p><p>d) The above question ASSUMES that he will lose. This is not clear yet.</p><p>2) The US and other countries are imposing sanctions. Visa, MC, and Netflix have withdrawn from Russia. Will these cause Putin to stop, or will they just impose hardships on the citizens without having an affect? I ask non-rhetorically. Foreign Policy is hard, though I suspect Biden has hired experts and is listening to them. Doesn't mean they are right. </p><p>3) This seems like a case where its obvious that Putin is in the wrong so I was surprised to see some Pro-Putin arguments. To be fair, some were more that we should not get involved, which is not quite Pro Putin. Here are some and my thoughts on them.</p><p>a) Putin never called me a racist and never made my kids learn Critical Race Theory. This is meant as a GOTCHA comment. To take it seriously one would have to (1) examine what American's are learning in grade school, (2) examine what Russians are learning in grade school, (3) see which country is giving their students a more honest view of things (particularly history), and (4) decide that whichever school is teaching more honest material deserves are support. </p><p>b) Putin is a strong leader and I admire strong leaders. Really? If  Biden was a strong leader who could push through the Build-Back-Better plan, would you admire that? You can't just admire strong leaders in the abstract, you have to see where they lead. (Same with admiring people who have principles.)</p><p>c) Putin stands for good Christian values. OH- so Putin likes to help the poor and does not approve of divorce or pre-marital sex. Oh, that NOT what you mean? Oh, you just mean that he does not like gay people or abortion. OH, thats not correct- Russia has the second most number of abortions of any country (see <a href="https://www.worldblaze.in/countries-with-highest-abortion-rates/">here</a>) So the only issue where Russia shares your values is in not liking gay people. Is that enough  commonality is enough to justify invading a country? This does raise the serious question: who do you support in a war? The country that shrares your values? The country that didn't start it (sometimes hard to tell, though not in this case)? The country you have a treaty with? These are good and serious questions. </p><p>d) How come the world does not like Putin's war based on lies and had no problem with W's war on Iraq that was based on lies? This is actually a good question. Being an academic by first impulse is to write a paper on it. There are differences between the invasion of Ukraine and Gulf War II, but still, lets assume that they really are somewhat equivalent. The person asking the question was probably AGAINST Gulf War II. Hence they should be against the invasion of Ukraine as well. So this is a good question about the America and NATO's Double standard and hypocrisy but is not a reason to be pro-Putin. (I was emailed that there are many conflicts that American and NATO do not care about that are as bad as Putin's invasion.) </p><p>e) Russia had real concerns about security. The last time Russia was invaded was WW II (if I am wrong then please correct me in the comments). Even so, I've heard analogies made to America freaking out when Cuba had Nuclear missiles. There were no nukes in Ukraine. Ukraine was not going to join NATO anytime soon. I wonder if this was a pretense on Putin's part and not a real reason. </p><p>f) See <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/3/4/2083726/-This-week-in-QAnon-Chronicles-Ukraine-enters-the-conspiracy">here</a>. I give an excerpt (I am not making this up). </p><p>But as its Covid mission has become less clear, the group’s channels have turned to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where conspiracy-minded thinking has flourished. While some group members have admonished Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion, QAnon and anti-vaccine contingents within the groups have seized on a false conspiracy theory that the war is a cover for a military operation backed by former President Donald Trump in Ukraine.</p><p>The conspiracy theory, which is baseless and has roots in QAnon mythology, alleges that Trump and Putin are secretly working together to stop bioweapons from being made by Dr. Anthony Fauci in Ukraine and that shelling in Ukraine has targeted the secret laboratories. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has emerged in the past year as a main target for far-right conspiracy theories.</p><p>3) I was somewhat surprised when Hungary came out against Putin. But Putin's arrangments with his allies are transactional- there is no real love there. I was much more surprised when Switzerland came out against Putin. Switzerland has been neutral since 1515 (I think I read that some place). </p><div><br /></div><p><br /></p></div>

<div class="content">
We analyze the Fourier growth, i.e. the $L_1$ Fourier weight at level $k$ (denoted $L_{1,k}$),  of read-once regular branching programs.
We prove that every read-once regular branching program $B$ of width $w \in [1,\infty]$ with $s$ accepting states on $n$-bit inputs must have its $L_{1,k}$ bounded by
$$
  \min\left\{ \Pr[B(U_n)=1] (w-1)^k , s \cdot O\left((n \log n)/k\right)^{\frac{k-1}{2}} \right\}.
$$
For any constant $k$, our result is tight up to constant factors for the AND function on $w-1$ bits, and is tight up to polylogarithmic factors for unbounded width programs. In particular, for $k=1$ we have $L_{1,1}(B)\leq s$, with no dependence on the width $w$ of the program.

Our result gives new bounds on the coin problem and new pseudorandom generators (PRGs). Furthermore, we obtain an explicit generator for unordered permutation branching programs of unbounded width with a constant factor stretch, where no PRG was previously known.

Applying a composition theorem of B{\l}asiok, Ivanov, Jin, Lee, Servedio and Viola (RANDOM 2021), we extend our results to ``generalized group products,'' a generalization of modular sums and product tests.</div>

We prove that a modification of Andreev's function is not computable by $(3 + \alpha - \varepsilon) \log{n}$ depth De Morgan formula with $(2\alpha - \varepsilon)\log{n}$ layers of AND gates at the top for any $1/5 &gt; \alpha &gt; 0$ and any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In order to do this, we prove a weak variant of Karchmer-Raz-Wigderson conjecture. To be more precise, we prove the existence of two functions $f \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ and $g \colon \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ such that $f(g(x) \oplus y)$ is not computable by depth $(1 + \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ formulas with $(2 \alpha - \varepsilon) n$ layers of AND gates at the top. We do this by a top-down approach, which was only used before for depth-$3$ model. 

Our technical contribution includes combinatorial insights into structure of composition with random boolean function, which led us to introducing a notion of well-mixed sets. A set of functions is well-mixed if, when composed with a random function, it does not have subsets that agree on large fractions of inputs. We use probabilistic method to prove the existence of well-mixed sets.</div>

<p>
I am now carrying a full power CPU embedded in my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberman">chest</a>. If I could use it directly I would have new powers, but it is dedicated to monitor my heart function. Alas.<br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/03/05/i-am-now-a-cyberman/bed/" rel="attachment wp-att-19722"><img width="285" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bed.png?resize=285%2C300&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19722" height="300" /></a></p>
<p></p><h2> The Procedure </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
My heart has not been beating well. So they had to implant a device that monitors the heart and also can restart the beating if needed. It was not a long operation—about one hour—but took two days recovering in the hospital. </p>
<p>
The worst part of the recovery is that it is not restful. And it is boring. I am now home and resting much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Am I Turing Universal? </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Well, according to Alan Turing, I was universal as soon as I began to use my brain. But can I leverage my new processing power?</p>
<p>
The doctors told Kathryn that some ideas from DNA computing went into my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implantable_cardioverter-defibrillator">ICD</a> device. Of course, I cannot implement any DNA computing algorithms on my device. </p>
<p>
I wonder, however, whether I can get useful outputs by varying the input—such as my pulse. Maybe I do not want to experiment on myself there. But it is not too far-fetched to imagine that in the not too distant future many of us could be controlling computations with our heartbeats. Or at least powering them while controlling with brainwaves. Call it “heartbeat computing”—?</p>
<p>
Ken has a more immediate concern: could the computing power in the device be used to cheat at chess? Already many chess tournament prohibit electronic physio devices, even watches, because of this potential. A cognitive <em>implant</em>, however, could bend the rules on what it means to be a human player.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I want to thank all who sent some best wishes. I really thank you all for your thoughts. </p>
<p>
I must also especially thank my dear wife Dr.Kathryn Farley for her tremendous support. And also thank Ken for helping her make some calls on our behalf. Thank you both.</p>

<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02703">The Amplituhedron BCFW Triangulation</a> by Chaim Even-Zohar, Tsviqa Lakrec, and Ran Tessler</h3>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  <span class="abstract-short has-text-grey-dark mathjax" id="2112.02703v4-abstract-short">The amplituhedron <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bn%2Ck%2C4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_{n,k,4}" class="latex" />  is a geometric object, introduced by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka (2013) in the study of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. They conjecture that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_%7Bn%2Ck%2C4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=333333&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_{n,k,4}" class="latex" /> admits a decomposition into images of BCFW positroid cells, arising from the Britto–Cachazo–Feng–Witten recurrence (2005). We prove that this conjecture is true.</span></p>
<p>Congratulations to Chaim, Tsviqa, and Ran!</p>
<p>Quick remarks:</p>
<ol>
<li>The introduction to the paper give a very friendly introduction of the topic as well as a variety of results between 2013 and today.</li>
<li>Ran Tessler gave recently a lovely colloquium talk about the result in Tel Aviv University, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uKYef392Fc3HrgyxJzRED6U8p0nqsR7/view?usp=sharing">here are the slides</a>.</li>
<li>For a 2015 post about these objects and some thoughts about the combinatorial side: <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/02/16/the-simplex-the-cyclic-polytope-the-positroidron-the-amplituhedron-and-beyond/" rel="bookmark">The Simplex, the Cyclic polytope, the Positroidron, the Amplituhedron, and Beyond.</a> See also this post for <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2015/01/20/midrasha-mathematicae-18-in-and-around-combinatorics/">a related lecture series by Alexander Postnikov.</a> (Here are <a href="https://4gravitons.com/category/amplitudes-methods/">quite a few blog posts</a> on the physics side from “4-gravitons”.)</li>

<p>(Click for a larger image.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Questions that arise naturally: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Is there an analog for the “moment curve”? Are there analogs for “neighborly polytopes”? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Do amplituhedra maximize numbers of cells or related parameters like the cyclic polytopes do? </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Are they amplituhedra “universal” objects like vertices of the cyclic polytopes? </span></p></div>

<p>Are you interested in combinatorial mathematics? If so, I am happy to welcome you to the future! </p><p>I am proud to share with you a new, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07715" target="_blank">99-page preprint</a> by three colleagues from my department (<a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/bean.html" target="_blank">Christian Bean</a>, <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/nadeau.html" target="_blank">Émile Nadeau </a>and <a href="https://permutatriangle.github.io/authors/ulfarsson.html" target="_blank">Henning Ulfarsson</a>) and three of their collaborators (<a href="http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/index.php" target="_blank">Michael Albert</a>, <a href="https://akc.is/" target="_blank">Anders Claesson</a> and <a href="http://jaypantone.com/" target="_blank">Jay Pantone</a>) that is the result of years of work that led to the birth of  Combinatorial Exploration.   <i>Combinatorial Exploration</i> is an algorithmic framework that can prove results that so far have required the ingenuity of human combinatorialists. More specifically, it can study, at the press of a button, the structure of combinatorial objects and derive their counting sequences and generating functions. The applicability and power of Combinatorial Exploration are witnessed by the applications to the domain of permutation patterns given in the paper. My colleagues use it to re-derive <i>hundreds</i> of results in the literature in a uniform manner and prove many new ones. See the <a href="https://permpal.com/" target="_blank">Permutation Pattern Avoidance Library (PermPAL)</a> and Section 2.4 of the article for a more comprehensive list of notable results. The paper also gives three additional proofs-of-concept, showing examples of how Combinatorial Exploration can prove results in the domains of alternating sign matrices, polyominoes, and set partitions. Last, but by no means least, the github repository at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/comb_spec_searcher</a> contains the open-source python framework for Combinatorial Exploration, and the one at <a href="https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings">https://github.com/PermutaTriangle/Tilings</a> contains the code needed to apply it to the field of permutation patterns. </p><p> "Det er svært at spå, især om fremtiden", as Niels Bohr and Piet Hein famously said. However, let me stick my neck out and predict that this work will have substantial impact and will be the basis for exciting future work. </p><p> Congratulations  to my colleagues! With my department chair hat on, I am very proud to see work of this quality stem from my department and humbled by what my colleagues have achieved already. As an interested observer, I am very excited to see what their algorithms will be able to prove in the future. For the moment, let's all enjoy what they have done already. <br /></p></div>

<p>The next TCS+ talk will take place this coming Wednesday, March 9th at 1:00 PM Eastern Time (10:00 AM Pacific Time, 19:00 Central European Time, 18:00 UTC). <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/roeitell/"><strong>Roei Tell</strong></a> from IAS will speak about “<em>Hardness vs Randomness, Revised: Uniform, Non-Black-Box, and Instance-Wise</em>” (abstract below).</p>
<p>You can reserve a spot as an individual or a group to join us live by signing up on <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/next-tcs-talk">the online form</a>. Registration is <em>not</em> required to attend the interactive talk, and the link will be posted on the website the day prior to the talk; however, by registering in the form, you will receive a reminder, along with the link. (The recorded talk will also be posted <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/past-talks">on our website</a> afterwards) As usual, for more information about the TCS+ online seminar series and the upcoming talks, or to <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/welcome/suggest-a-talk">suggest</a> a possible topic or speaker, please see <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tcsplus/">the website</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In this talk I’ll show how to revise the classical hardness-vs-randomness framework, so that it can work in a non-black-box fashion. Specifically, we will construct derandomization algorithms that don’t rely on classical PRGs, and instead “extract pseudorandomness” from the given input on which we want to simulate the probabilistic machine.</p>
<p>Using a non-black-box approach allows us to deduce stronger conclusions (or alternatively rely on weaker hypotheses), compared to classical approaches. In one instantiation of the new framework, we reveal a close connection between the promiseBPP = promiseP conjecture and a new type of uniform lower bounds. In another instantiation, we simulate probabilistic algorithms with essentially no observable runtime overhead, under plausible hypotheses.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/080/">joint work</a> with <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~lijieche/">Lijie Chen</a>.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>REU stands for Research Experience for Undergraduates. </p><p>REU programs are funded by the NSF. The NSF website of REU programs is <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.jsp">here</a>. </p><p>Univ if MD at College Park dept of Comp Sci is running two REU programs this summer:</p><p>I (William Gasarch) am running  REU-CAAR (Combinatorics and AI Applied to Real problems) whose theme is applying theory to practice. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/reucaar/">here</a>.</p><p> Jacquelyn Michaelis and Mihai Pop are running REU-BRIDGe (Bioinformatics Research In Data science for Genomics) which, as you can probably tell from the name, is in bio-comp. The website for it is <a href="https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/summer-internships">here</a>.</p><p>Most REU programs have the following: </p><p>1) There is an admissions period where many people apply (I had around 200 applicants last year) of which only about 10 get in. Some have money for a few extra students. This year both REU-CAAR and REU-BRIDGe have applications due March 22; however, in the past I have admitted students before then, so students who apply March 21 may be at a severe disadvantage. </p><p>2) Students apply from across the United states and these programs are competitive, so good to apply to several that you would definitely goto. Students ask me how many- I'll say 10 though temper that with only applying to those you REALLY would goto, and if there are MORE THAN 10 that look awesome, you could apply to more. </p><p>3) Students stay in the dorms (the last two years some programs cancelled, and some were virtual- mine was virtual) and get stipend of $6000, and a meal card. The program is 10 weeks.</p><p>4) Students work on projects in teams of 2-5. Some programs have the students pick what projects they would be happy to work on when they apply (mine does that) while others assign projects once students arrive (REU-BRIDGe will do that). The later makes sense if the program is very focused so the projects do not differ that much. </p><p>5) These programs are excellent for giving ugrads a chance to do research (NSF wants at least half of the students to come from non-research schools) and a sense of what grad school is like. So I recommend students thinking of grad school, or just want to do research, to apply to these programs. </p><p>6) Some students get papers out of the research. In these cases the research usually continues after the program is over. </p><p>7) It is healthy for a student to go to an REU program that is at a DIFFERENT school then where they are an ugrad for broadening. There may be mitigating circumstances where this is not possible. </p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>Yesterday, Bocconi’s Rector signed the decree that created the new Computing Sciences department. This is only the ninth department to be created in our 120 year old university, and the first, I believe, in a couple of decades. It is the first department with an engineering and science mission (the other eight department are, in random order, Accounting, Marketing, Finance, Economics, Managements, Social Sciences, Law, and Decision Sciences).</p>



<p>A few weeks ago, we were joined by <a href="https://www.oncology.ox.ac.uk/team/francesca-buffa">Francesca Buffa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_M%C3%A9zard">Marc Mezard</a>. </p>



<p>Francesca, a computational biologist formerly at Oxford medical school, is now the fourth out of four computer science tenured faculty in our new department to have an active ERC grant.</p>



<p>Marc’s work has spanned theoretical physics, information theory and computation, including his collaboration with Giorgio Parisi’s Nobel Prize winning work, and he has been most recently the president of the Ecole National Superieure in Paris. When we asked for letters for his tenure case, one of the reviewers wrote, more or less in so many words, “you would be lucky to have Marc in your university, though it’s very unlikely that he will accept your offer”. At that point Marc had already accepted.</p>

A distribution is k-incompressible, Yao [FOCS ’82], if no efficient compression scheme compresses it to less than k bits. While being a natural measure, its relation to other computational analogs of entropy such as pseudoentropy, Hastad, Impagliazzo, Levin, and Luby [SICOMP 99], and to other cryptographic hardness assumptions, was unclear.

We advance towards a better understating of this notion, showing that a k-incompressible distribution has (k?2) bits of next-block pseudoentropy, a refinement of pseudoentropy introduced by Haitner, Reingold, and Vadhan [SICOMP ’13]. We deduce that a samplable distribution X that is (H(X) + 2)-incompressible, implies the existence of one-way functions.</div>

<p><img src="https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/news/theory_at_the_institute_and_beyond-february_2022.png" style="margin: 5px; float: right; width: 328px; height: 219px;" alt="" />It has been only a few months since the last time this column appeared. Yet there is so much to write about that it feels like a year has passed. For one area in particular, a decade’s worth of developments seems to have emerged in a few months’ time. I am talking of course about the phenomenal developments on error-correcting codes that we witnessed in the past few months.</p>



<p><strong>Error-correcting codes</strong><br />
	Error-correcting codes encode a message into a longer codeword so that the original message can be recovered even if many of the bits of the codeword are corrupted. Clearly, there is a trade-off between the amount of redundancy introduced by the error-correcting code and the number of errors it can recover from. A gold standard for error-correcting codes is being “constant rate, constant distance,” also referred to as being “asymptotically good.” An asymptotically good code can recover from a constant fraction of bit errors in the codeword, and the codeword is only a constant factor longer than the original message.</p>



<p>Error-correcting codes can be described using a family of “parity checks,” where a parity check on a subset \(S\) of bits is a constraint that there are an even number of \(1\)s within the subset \(S\). A codeword is then a sequence of bits that satisfy all of the parity check constraints. In a low-density parity check (LDPC) code, there is a family of parity checks on constantly many bits each, that together define the code.</p>



<p>Introduced by Gallager in 1960, LDPC codes are central objects in both the theory and the practice of error correction. In 1996, Sipser and Spielman showed how to use expander graphs to construct LDPCs with constant distance and constant rate. Their construction is a thing of beauty. Pick an expander graph and associate one bit on each edge of the graph. For each vertex of the expander graph, the parity of the sum of bits on its edges is even. This construction also admits linear time encoding and decoding algorithms for the same.</p>



<p><strong>Asymptotically good locally testable codes and quantum LDPCs</strong><br />
	A locally testable code is one that admits a highly efficient procedure to detect the presence of errors. More precisely, it admits a testing procedure that queries a small number of randomly selected bits in the codeword, and will reject a corrupted codeword with, say, 1% of errors with constant probability. The gold standard would be a constant-query locally testable code, where the testing procedure queries only a constantly many (say, 100) bits of the corrupted codeword.</p>



<p>Locally testable codes have been central to many of the developments in complexity theory for close to three decades now. Linearity testing, aka locally testing the Hadamard code, is still the prime example for property testing and lies at the gateway to the world of probabilistically checkable proofs.</p>



<p>Intuitively for a code to be locally testable, it needs to admit a large number of constant-size parity checks. In other words, locally testability seemingly necessitates the code to have a lot of redundancy. In fact, the classic examples of locally testable codes, such as Hadamard codes or Reed-Muller codes, have codewords that are superpolynomially larger than the message.</p>



<p>Irit Dinur’s ingenious proof of the PCP theorem yielded as a by-product the first locally testable codes where the codewords were only slightly superlinear in size. It was then that one would dare to ask: can locally testability be achieved for “free”? That is, can one have the best of all worlds: a constant-rate, constant-distance code that also admits a constant-query local-tester?</p>



<p>This long-standing open question always seemed out of reach until late last year, when it was resolved affirmatively by two independent groups of researchers simultaneously!</p>



<span id="more-627"></span>



<p></p>



<p>Irit Dinur, Shai Evra, Ron Livne, Alexander Lubotzky, and Shahar Mozes start their journey with the idea that analogous to how Sipser and Spielman use expander graphs to construct codes, one could potentially use high-dimensional expanders to construct codes that are also locally testable. Starting with this idea, they undertake a long and intensive journey through a terrain of Ramanujan complexes, Bruhat-Tits buildings, <em>p</em>-adic uniformization, and other advanced mathematics to eventually land on an elementary and elegant <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>construction</u></a> (see Irit Dinur’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjc6GCRFnpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>talk</u></a> on this work in the <em>Breakthroughs</em> talk series).</p>



<p>In an independent work, Pavel Panteleev and Gleb Kalachev not only <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03654?context=quant-ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>construct</u></a> asymptotically good locally testable codes, but also resolve yet another long-standing open question! They exhibit a construction of asymptotically good quantum LDPCs. Regular readers of this column might recall that we earlier <u><a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/theory-institute-and-beyond-january-2021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a></u> a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>breakthrough</u></a> by Hastings, Haah, and O’Donnell, who constructed quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with distance \(n^{3/5}\), significantly beating \(\sqrt{n}\) for the first time. Panteleev and Kalachev essentially achieve the holy grail in this context — quantum LDPCs on \(n\) qubits with constant rate and distance \(\Omega(n)\).</p>



<p>It is uncanny how often a question that has remained open for years gets resolved by independent sets of researchers simultaneously. At first, one might remark that these results were really in the air. Yet on a closer look, one can only wonder how the authors masterfully pulled these results out of thin air.</p>



<p>These works are a treasure trove of ideas that are elementary, elegant, and ingenious. To leave you with a taste of things that lie inside, let me briefly describe a new combinatorial object, the “left-right Cayley complex,” that seems to underlie both these works. We are all familiar with Cayley graphs — objects studied for more than a hundred years. These are graphs where the vertices are elements of a group, and edges are of the form \((g,ag)\) — corresponding to left multiplication by a fixed set of group elements \(a\) called generators.</p>



<p>A left-right Cayley complex is a higher-dimensional object that has vertices, edges, and squares (\(4\)-tuples). The vertices are still elements of a group, and the squares are of the form \(\{g, ag, gb, agb\}\), corresponding to left and right multiplication of a group element \(g\) by generators \(a,b\). This simple and easily constructed combinatorial object (left-right Cayley complex) plays a central role in both these code constructions. Yet this object seems to have eluded study in more than a century of work on Cayley graphs.</p>



<p><strong>Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity</strong><br />
	Reed-Muller codes are among the oldest of error-correcting codes and are probably the simplest to describe. Reed-Muller codewords of degree \(d\) are just the truth tables of degree \(d\) polynomials over the finite field \({0,1}\). Yet almost 70 years after their discovery, there are still fundamental questions about Reed-Muller codes that remain open.</p>



<p>Given the noise characteristics of a channel, Shannon’s theory establishes the fundamental upper bound on the rate of communication possible. An error-correcting code is said to “achieve capacity” if the rate of communication (aka, the number of message bits per codeword bit) matches Shannon’s upper bound.</p>



<p>A fundamental question on Reed-Muller codes is whether they do achieve capacity for a broad family of channels. In 2016, a beautiful <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7862912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>work</u></a> by Shrinivas Kudekar, Santhosh Kumar, Marco Mondelli, Henry D. Pfister, Eren Şaşoğlu, and Rüdiger Urbanke showed that indeed, Reed-Muller codes do achieve capacity for erasure channels, namely channels that only erase bits instead of corrupting bits. Using one of the most ingenious applications of Boolean function analysis, they show a very general result that any code with a certain family of symmetries achieves capacity against erasures.</p>



<p>In a remarkable <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>breakthrough</u></a>, Galen Reeves and Henry D. Pfister show that Reed-Muller codes achieve capacity even against the broad family of binary memoryless channels. In particular, they achieve capacity for the most classic channel, namely the binary symmetric channel (BSC), where each bit is flipped with a fixed probability \(\epsilon\).</p>



<p><strong>An algorithmic surprise</strong><br />
	Given a graph with weights on the edges, the best-known algorithm to compute shortest paths between all pairs of vertices takes \(O(n^3)\) time. In fact, it is hypothesized that the all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) problem requires \(n^{3-o(1)}\) time, and this hypothesis is the starting point for a web of reductions in fine-grained complexity.</p>



<p>Now consider the problem of computing max-flow values between every pair of vertices in the graph, also known as the all-pairs max-flow (APMF) problem. It would seem that the APMF problem must be harder than APSP — after all, shortest paths are arguably much simpler to compute than maximum flows.</p>



<p>Yet, a phenomenal new result by Amir Abboud, Robert Krauthgamer, Jason Li, Debmalya Panigrahi, Thatchaphol Saranurak, and Ohad Trabelsi shatters this intuition. In particular, they exhibit a nearly quadratic-time algorithm for APMF!</p>



<p>Perhaps the first hint that max-flow values are arguably simpler objects than shortest paths lies in Gomory-Hu trees. In 1961, Gomory and Hu showed that the max-flow values between every pair of vertices in a graph can be succinctly represented using a weighted tree. More precisely, the Gomory-Hu tree is a weighted tree that one can construct for any given graph so that the maximum flow between every pair of vertices in the graph is equal to the same quantity on the Gomory-Hu tree.</p>



<p>Six decades after its introduction, this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>work</u></a> produces the first near-quadratic-time algorithm to compute the Gomory-Hu tree. Moreover, this work also shows that one can compute Gomory-Hu trees in unweighted graphs by using polylogarithmically many max-flow computations.</p></div>

<div class="content">
Recently Hrubes and Yehudayoff (2021) showed a connection between the monotone algebraic circuit complexity of \emph{transparent} polynomials and a geometric complexity measure of their Newton polytope. They then used this connection to prove lower bounds against monotone VP (mVP). We extend their work by showing that their technique can be used to prove lower bounds against classes that are seemingly more powerful than monotone VNP (mVNP).
	
In the process, we define a natural monotone analogue of VPSPACE --- a well-studied class in the non-monotone setting (Poizat (2008), Koiran Perifel (2009), Malod (2011), Mahajan Rao (2013) --- and prove an exponential separation between the computational powers of this class and mVNP. 
	
To show this separation, we define a new polynomial family with an interesting combinatorial structure which we use heavily in our lower bound. Both the polynomial and the combinatorial nature of our proof might be of independent interest.</div>
