We prove a new derandomization of Håstad's switching lemma, showing how to efficiently generate restrictions satisfying the switching lemma for DNF or CNF formulas of size $m$ using only $\widetilde{O}(\log m)$ random bits. Derandomizations of the switching lemma have been useful in many works as a key building-block for constructing objects which are in some way provably-pseudorandom with respect to AC$^0$-circuits.

Here, we use our new derandomization to give an improved analysis of the pseudorandom generator of Trevisan and Xue for AC$^0$-circuits (CCC'13): we show that  the generator $\varepsilon$-fools size-$m$, depth-$D$ circuits with $n$-bit inputs using only $\widetilde{O}(\log(m/\varepsilon)^{D} \cdot \log n)$ random bits. In particular, we obtain (modulo the $\log \log$-factors hidden in the $\widetilde{O}$-notation) a dependence on $m/\varepsilon$ which is best-possible with respect to currently-known AC$^0$-circuit lower bounds.</div>

Robust sunflowers are a generalization of combinatorial sunflowers that have applications in monotone circuit complexity, DNF sparsification, randomness extractors, and recent advances on the Erd\H{o}s-Rado sunflower conjecture.  The recent breakthrough of Alweiss, Lovett, Wu and Zhang gives an improved bound on the maximum size of a $w$-set system that excludes a robust sunflower.  In this paper, we use this result to obtain an $\exp(n^{1/2-o(1)})$ lower bound on the monotone circuit size of an explicit $n$-variate monotone function, improving the previous best known $\exp(n^{1/3-o(1)})$ due to Andreev and Harnik and Raz. We also show an $\exp(\Omega(n))$ lower bound on the monotone arithmetic circuit size of a related polynomial.  Finally, we introduce a notion of robust clique-sunflowers and use this to prove an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ lower bound on the monotone circuit size of the CLIQUE function for all $k \le n^{1/3-o(1)}$, strengthening the bound of Alon and Boppana.</div>

<p>For many of the famous open problems of theoretical computer science, most researchers agree on what the answer is, but the challenge is to <em>prove </em>it. Most complexity theorists (with few notable exceptions) believe that P≠NP, but we don’t know how to prove it. Similarly, most people working on matrix multiplication believe that there is an Õ(n²) algorithm for this problem, but we’re still stuck at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846">2.3728596</a>.   We believed that primality checking has a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm long before it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test">proven </a>and we still believe the same holds for polynomial identity testing.</p>



<p>The story of <em>cryptographic obfuscation</em> is different. This story deserves a full length blog post (though see my now outdated <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/3/198855-hopes-fears-and-software-obfuscation/fulltext">survey</a>), but the short version is as follows. In 2001 we (in a <a href="http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~oded/p_obfuscate.html">paper </a>with Goldreich, Impagliazzo, Rudich, Sahai, Vadhan, and Yang) showed that what is arguably the most natural definition of obfuscation is impossible to achieve. That paper explored a number of obfuscation-related questions, and in particular left as an open question the existence of so-called <em>indistinguishable obfuscators</em> or <em>IO</em>. Since then there were arguably more negative than positive results in obfuscation research until in 2012, extending some of the ideas behind fully-homomorphic encryption, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/610">Garg Gentry and Halevi</a> gave a heuristic construction of multilinear map, which one can think of as “Diffie Hellman on steroids” (or maybe LSD..). Then in 2013 <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/451">Garg, Gentry, Halevi., Raykova, Sahai and Waters (GGHRSW)</a> built on top of these maps to give a heuristic construction of IO. </p>



<p>The GGHRSW paper opened the floodgates to many papers using IO to achieve many longstanding cryptographic goals as well as show that IO provides a unified approach to solve many classic cryptographic problems. The fact that so many goals were achieved through heuristic constructions was not very comforting to cryptographers. Even less comforting was the fact that several cryptographic attacks were discovered on these heuristic constructions. The years that followed saw a sequence of constructions and breaks,  giving cryptographers an “emotional whiplash”.  Everyone agreed that IO would be amazing if it exists, but whether or not it actually exists depended on who you asked, and what paper in the eprint archive they read that morning…</p>



<p>The “holy grail” in this line of work is to base obfuscation on a standard assumption, and ideally Regev’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_with_errors">Learning With Errors (LWE)</a> assumption. Of course, we don’t know that LWE is true (in particular LWE implies P≠NP) but if it’s false it would bring down so much of the field that cryptographers might as well pack their bags and do machine learning (or try to sabotage progress in quantum computing, since the only other standard <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/365">assumptions for public-key crypto</a> are broken by fully scalable quantum computing).</p>



<p>We have not yet achieved this holy grail (this is only the 4th season) but as described in <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-achieve-crown-jewel-of-cryptography-20201110/">this quanta article</a>, there has been a remarkable progress in the last few months. In particular, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1003">Jain, Lin and Sahai (JLS)</a>  (building on a long sequence of works by  many people including Ananth, Matt, Tessaro and Vaikuntanathan) obtained IO based on LWE and several standard assumptions in cryptography. This is arguably the first “heuristic free” construction, and is a fantastic breakthrough. However, there is still work to do – the JLS construction uses not just LWE but also a variant of it that is not as well studied. It is also based on pairing-based cryptography. This is an area that has thousands of papers, but for which known instantiations can be broken by quantum computers.  However, there is yet more hope – in another  sequence of works by <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/633">Agrawal</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1024">Brakerski, Döttling, Garg, and Malavolta</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1042">Wee and Wichs</a>, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1010">Gay and Pass</a> a construction of IO was achieved that is “almost” heuristic free. It still uses one heuristic assumption (circular security) but has the advantage that apart from this assumption it only relies on LWE. </p>



<p>One can hope that in the next season, these two lines of work will converge to give a construction of IO based on LWE, achieving a “meta theorem” deriving from LWE a huge array of cryptographic primitives.</p>



<p>Want to learn more about these amazing advances? Want to know what’s next in store for IO? <br /><br />Fortunately there is a virtual <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/obfuscation-symposium">Simons symposium on indistinguishability obfuscation</a> <strong>coming to your computer screen on December 10-11</strong>. Authors of all the papers mentioned will join together in coordinated presentations to give a unified view of the field and the challenges ahead. We will also have a historical opening talk by Yael Kalai, as well as a talk by Benny Applebaum on the computational assumptions used, followed by a panel discussion with Yael, Benny and Chris Peikert. Finally, like every proper crypto event, there will be a rump session, though you will have to supply your own beer.</p>

<p>Hope you to see you there! Bring your favorite programs to obfuscate with you*<br /><br />*<sub>Disclaimer/fine print: Due to large constants and exponents, we do not recommend the compiler be used on programs that are more than one nanobit long.</sub></p>

produces a sequence of $n$ persistence diagrams converging in bottleneck
distance to the input diagram, the $i$th of which has $i$ distinct (weighted)
points and is a $2$-approximation to the closest persistence diagram with that
many distinct points. For each approximation, we precompute the optimal
matching between the $i$th and the $(i+1)$st. Perhaps surprisingly, the entire
sequence of diagrams as well as the sequence of matchings can be represented in
$O(n)$ space. The main approach is to use a variation of the greedy permutation
of the persistence diagram to give good Hausdorff approximations and assign
weights to these subsets. We give a new algorithm to efficiently compute this
permutation, despite the high implicit dimension of points in a persistence
diagram due to the effect of the diagonal. The sketches are also structured to
permit fast (linear time) approximations to the Hausdorff distance between
diagrams -- a lower bound on the bottleneck distance. For approximating the
bottleneck distance, sketches can also be used to compute a linear-size
neighborhood graph directly, obviating the need for geometric data structures
used in state-of-the-art methods for bottleneck computation.

only $O(n)$ simplices. The central idea is to connect Delaunay complexes on
progressively denser subsamples by considering the flips in an incremental
construction as simplices in $d+1$ dimensions. This approach leads to a very
simple and straightforward proof of correctness in geometric terms, because the
final filtration is dual to a $(d+1)$-dimensional Voronoi construction similar
to the standard Delaunay filtration complex. We also, show how this complex can
be efficiently constructed.

algorithms and circuit lower bounds. Specifically, let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a
class of polynomial-size concepts, and suppose that $\mathfrak{C}$ can be
PAC-learned with membership queries under the uniform distribution with error
$1/2 - \gamma$ by a time $T$ quantum algorithm. We prove that if $\gamma^2
\cdot T \ll 2^n/n$, then $\mathsf{BQE} \nsubseteq \mathfrak{C}$, where
$\mathsf{BQE} = \mathsf{BQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ is an exponential-time analogue of
$\mathsf{BQP}$. This result is optimal in both $\gamma$ and $T$, since it is
not hard to learn any class $\mathfrak{C}$ of functions in (classical) time $T
= 2^n$ (with no error), or in quantum time $T = \mathsf{poly}(n)$ with error at
most $1/2 - \Omega(2^{-n/2})$ via Fourier sampling. In other words, even a
marginal improvement on these generic learning algorithms would lead to major
consequences in complexity theory.
</p>
<p>Our proof builds on several works in learning theory, pseudorandomness, and
computational complexity, and crucially, on a connection between non-trivial
classical learning algorithms and circuit lower bounds established by Oliveira
and Santhanam (CCC 2017). Extending their approach to quantum learning
algorithms turns out to create significant challenges. To achieve that, we show
among other results how pseudorandom generators imply learning-to-lower-bound
connections in a generic fashion, construct the first conditional pseudorandom
generator secure against uniform quantum computations, and extend the local
list-decoding algorithm of Impagliazzo, Jaiswal, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP
2010) to quantum circuits via a delicate analysis. We believe that these
contributions are of independent interest and might find other applications.

<p><b>Authors: </b><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Abraham:Louis.html">Louis Abraham</a> <br /><b>Download:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01883">PDF</a><br /><b>Abstract: </b>We study two questions related to competition on the OTC CDS market using
data collected as part of the EMIR regulation.
</p>
<p>First, we study the competition between central counterparties through
collateral requirements. We present models that successfully estimate the
initial margin requirements. However, our estimations are not precise enough to
use them as input to a predictive model for CCP choice by counterparties in the
OTC market.
</p>
<p>Second, we model counterpart choice on the interdealer market using a novel
semi-supervised predictive task. We present our methodology as part of the
literature on model interpretability before arguing for the use of conditional
entropy as the metric of interest to derive knowledge from data through a
model-agnostic approach. In particular, we justify the use of deep neural
networks to measure conditional entropy on real-world datasets. We create the
$\textit{Razor entropy}$ using the framework of algorithmic information theory
and derive an explicit formula that is identical to our semi-supervised
training objective. Finally, we borrow concepts from game theory to define
$\textit{top-k Shapley values}$. This novel method of payoff distribution
satisfies most of the properties of Shapley values, and is of particular
interest when the value function is monotone submodular. Unlike classical
Shapley values, top-k Shapley values can be computed in quadratic time of the
number of features instead of exponential. We implement our methodology and
report the results on our particular task of counterpart choice.
</p>
<p>Finally, we present an improvement to the $\textit{node2vec}$ algorithm that
could for example be used to further study intermediation. We show that the
neighbor sampling used in the generation of biased walks can be performed in
logarithmic time with a quasilinear time pre-computation, unlike the current
implementations that do not scale well.

she participates in a public project whose utility is shared equally by the
community. We study the problem of computing if there exists a pure strategy
Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in such games. The problem is already known to be
NP-complete. We provide fine-grained analysis of this problem under the lens of
parameterized complexity theory. We consider various natural graph parameters
and show either W[1]-hardness or exhibit an FPT algorithm. We finally exhibit
some special graph classes, for example path, cycle, bi-clique, complete graph,
etc., which always have a PSNE if the utility function of the players are fully
homogeneous.

analyzing graph-based structures such as automata, labeled transition systems,
linked data networks, Kripke models and interpretations in description logic.
Simulations characterize the class of existential modal formulas, whereas
directed simulations characterize the class of positive modal formulas. These
notions are worth studying. For example, one may be interested in checking
whether a given finite automaton simulates another or whether an object in a
linked data network has all positive properties that another object has. To
deal with vagueness and uncertainty, fuzzy graph-based structures are used
instead of crisp ones. In this article, we design efficient algorithms with the
complexity $O((m+n)n)$ for computing the largest crisp simulation and the
largest crisp directed simulation between two finite fuzzy labeled graphs,
where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of nonzero edges of
the input fuzzy graphs. We also adapt them to computing the largest crisp
simulation and the largest crisp directed simulation between two finite fuzzy
automata.

computing. Fractional coloring is the linear relaxation of the classical notion
of coloring, and has many applications, in particular in scheduling. It is
known that for every real $\alpha&gt;1$ and integer $\Delta$, a fractional
coloring of total weight at most $\alpha(\Delta+1)$ can be obtained
deterministically in a single round in graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, in
the LOCAL model of computation. However, a major issue of this result is that
the output of each vertex has unbounded size. Here we prove that even if we
impose the more realistic assumption that the output of each vertex has
constant size, we can find fractional colourings with a weight arbitrarily
close to known tight bounds for the fractional chromatic number in several
cases of interest. Moreover, we improve on classical bounds on the chromatic
number by considering the fractional chromatic number instead, without
significantly increasing the output size and the round complexity of the
existing algorithms.

zeroes of a multivariate polynomial on a product set. This lemma motivates the
multiplicity codes of Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [J. ACM, 2014], who showed
how to use this lemma to construct high-rate locally-decodable codes. However,
the algorithmic results about these codes crucially rely on the fact that the
polynomials are evaluated on a vector space and not an arbitrary product set.
</p>
<p>In this work, we show how to decode multivariate multiplicity codes of large
multiplicities in polynomial time over finite product sets (over fields of
large characteristic and zero characteristic). Previously such decoding
algorithms were not known even for a positive fraction of errors. In contrast,
our work goes all the way to the distance of the code and in particular exceeds
both the unique decoding bound and the Johnson bound. For errors exceeding the
Johnson bound, even combinatorial list-decodablity of these codes was not
known.
</p>
<p>Our algorithm is an application of the classical polynomial method directly
to the multivariate setting. In particular, we do not rely on a reduction from
the multivariate to the univariate case as is typical of many of the existing
results on decoding codes based on multivariate polynomials. However, a vanilla
application of the polynomial method in the multivariate setting does not yield
a polynomial upper bound on the list size. We obtain a polynomial bound on the
list size by taking an alternative view of multivariate multiplicity codes. In
this view, we glue all the partial derivatives of the same order together using
a fresh set $z$ of variables. We then apply the polynomial method by viewing
this as a problem over the field $\mathbb{F}(z)$ of rational functions in $z$.

efficiency, as an alternative to standard calculations of time complexity,
likely, but not exclusively, when dealing with data structures with unknown
maximum indexes and with algorithms that are dependent on multiple variables
apart from just input size. The proposed method can effectively determine the
run time behavior $F$ at any given index $x$ , as well as $\frac{\partial
F}{\partial x}$, as a function of only one or multiple arguments, by combining
$\frac{n}{2}$ quadratic segments, based upon the principles of Lagrangian
Polynomials and their respective secant lines. Although the approach used is
designed for analyzing the efficacy of computational algorithms, the proposed
method can be used within the pure mathematical field as a novel way to
construct non-polynomial functions, such as $\log_2{n}$ or $\frac{n+1}{n-2}$,
as a series of segmented differentiable quadratics to model functional behavior
and reoccurring natural patterns. After testing, our method had an average
accuracy of above of 99\% with regard to functional resemblance.

<p>A group led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Jianwei">Jianwei Pan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chaoyanglu?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Chao-Yang Lu</a>, based mainly at USTC in Hefei, China, announced today that it <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.abe8770">achieved BosonSampling with 40-70 detected photons</a>—up to and beyond the limit where a classical supercomputer could feasibly verify the results.  (Technically, they achieved a variant called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01199">Gaussian BosonSampling</a>: a generalization of what I called <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1579">Scattershot BosonSampling</a> in a 2013 post on this blog.)</p>



<p>For more, see also <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/new-light-based-quantum-computer-jiuzhang-supremacy">Emily Conover’s piece in <em>Science News</em></a>, or <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/light-based-quantum-computer-exceeds-fastest-classical-supercomputers/">Daniel Garisto’s in <em>Scientific American</em></a>, both of which I consulted on.  (Full disclosure: I was one of the reviewers for the Pan group’s <em>Science</em> paper, and will be writing the Perspective article to accompany it.)</p>



<p>The new result follows the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09930">announcement</a> of 14-photon BosonSampling by the same group a year ago.  It represents the second time quantum supremacy has been reported, following Google’s celebrated <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">announcement</a> from last year, and the first time it’s been done using photonics rather than superconducting qubits.</p>



<p>As the co-inventor of <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/optics.pdf">BosonSampling</a> (with Alex Arkhipov), obviously I’m gratified about this.</p>



<p>For anyone who regards it as boring or obvious, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2435#comment-798278">here</a> and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1579#comment-92034">here</a> is Gil Kalai<a href="http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/">,</a> on this blog, telling me why BosonSampling would never scale beyond 8-10 photons.  (He wrote that, if aliens forced us to try, then much like with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem">Ramsey number</a> R(6,6), our only hope would be to attack the aliens.)  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR-ufBz13Eg">Here’s </a>Kalai making a similar prediction, on the impossibility of quantum supremacy by BosonSampling or any other means, in his plenary address to the International Congress of Mathematicians two years ago.</p>



<p>Even if we set aside the quantum computing skeptics, many colleagues told me they thought experimental BosonSampling was a dead end, because of photon losses and the staggering difficulty of synchronizing 50-100 single-photon sources.  They said that a convincing demonstration of quantum supremacy would have to await the arrival of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_threshold_theorem">quantum fault-tolerance</a>—or at any rate, some hardware platform more robust than photonics.  I always agreed that they might be right.  Furthermore, even if 50-photon BosonSampling <em>was</em> possible, after Google reached the supremacy milestone first with superconducting qubits, it wasn’t clear if anyone would still bother.  Even when I learned a year ago about the USTC group’s intention to go for it, I was skeptical, figuring I’d believe it when I saw it.</p>



<p>Obviously the new result isn’t dispositive.  Maybe Gil Kalai really WON, BY A LOT, before Hugo Chávez hacked the USTC group’s computers to make it seem otherwise?  (Sorry, couldn’t resist.)  Nevertheless, as someone whose intellectual origins are close to pure math, it’s strange and exciting to find myself in a field where, once in a while, the world itself gets to weigh in on a theoretical disagreement.</p>



<p>Since excitement is best when paired with accurate understanding, please help yourself to the following FAQ, which I might add more to over the next couple days.</p>



<p><strong>What is BosonSampling?</strong>  You must be new here!  Briefly, it’s a proposal for achieving quantum supremacy by simply passing identical, non-interacting photons through an array of beamsplitters, and then measuring where they end up.  For more: in increasing order of difficulty, <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2011/quantum-experiment-0302">here’s</a> an <em>MIT News</em> article from back in 2011, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson_sampling">here’s</a> the Wikipedia page, <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/talks/bbn.ppt">here</a> are my PowerPoint slides, <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1631">here</a> are my lecture notes from Rio de Janeiro, and <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/optics.pdf">here’s</a> my original paper with Arkhipov.</p>



<p><strong>What is quantum supremacy?</strong>  Roughly, the use of a programmable or configurable quantum computer to solve <em>some</em> well-defined computational problem much faster than we know how to solve it with any existing classical computer.  “Quantum supremacy,” a term <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5813">coined</a> by John Preskill in 2012, does <em>not</em> mean useful QC, or scalable QC, or fault-tolerant QC, all of which remain outstanding challenges.  For more, see my <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4317">Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ</a>, or (e.g.) my recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLhyTFk-WGs">Lytle Lecture</a> for the University of Washington.</p>



<p><strong>If Google already announced quantum supremacy a year ago, what’s the point of this new experiment?</strong>  To me, at least, quantum supremacy seems important enough to do at least twice!  Also, as I said, this represents the first demonstration that quantum supremacy is possible <em>via photonics</em>.  Finally, as the authors point out, the new experiment has one big technical advantage compared to Google’s: namely, many more possible output states (~10<sup>30</sup> of them, rather than a mere ~9 quadrillion).  This makes it infeasible to calculate the whole probability distribution over outputs and store it on a gigantic hard disk (after which one could easily generate as many samples as one wanted), which is what IBM proposed doing in its <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09534">response</a> to Google’s announcement.</p>



<p><strong>Is BosonSampling a form of universal quantum computing?</strong>  No, we don’t even think it can simulate universal <em>classical</em> computing!  It’s designed for exactly one task: namely, demonstrating quantum supremacy and refuting Gil Kalai.  It <em>might</em> have some other applications besides that, but if so, they’ll be icing on the cake.  This is in contrast to Google’s Sycamore processor, which in principle <em>is</em> a universal quantum computer, just with a severe limit on the number of qubits (53) and how many layers of gates one can apply to them (about 20).</p>



<p><strong>Is BosonSampling at least a <em>step</em> toward universal quantum computing?</strong>  I think so!  In 2000, Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KLM_protocol">famously showed</a> that pure, non-interacting photons, passing through a network of beamsplitters, are capable of universal QC, provided we assume one extra thing: namely, the ability to measure the photons at intermediate times, and change which beamsplitters to apply to the remaining photons depending on the outcome.  In other words, “BosonSampling plus adaptive measurements equals universality.”  Basically, KLM is the holy grail that experimental optics groups around the world have been working toward for 20 years, with BosonSampling just a more achievable pit stop along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any applications of BosonSampling?</strong>  We don’t know yet.  There are proposals in the literature to apply BosonSampling to vibronic spectra in quantum chemistry, finding dense subgraphs, and other problems, but I’m not yet sure whether these proposals will yield real speedups over the best we can do with classical computers, for a task of practical interest that involves estimating specific numbers (as opposed to sampling tasks, where BosonSampling almost certainly <em>does</em> yield exponential speedups, but which are rarely the thing practitioners directly care about).  [See <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5122#comment-1867226">this comment</a> for further discussion of the issues regarding dense subgraphs.]  In a completely different direction, one could try to use BosonSampling to generate cryptographically certified random bits, along the lines of my proposal from 2018, much like one could with qubit-based quantum circuits.</p>



<p><strong>How hard is it to simulate BosonSampling on a classical computer?</strong>  As far as we know today, the difficulty of simulating a “generic” BosonSampling experiment increases roughly like 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the number of detected photons.  It <em>might</em> be easier than that, particularly when noise and imperfections are taken into account; and at any rate it might be easier to spoof the statistical tests that one applies to verify the outputs.  I and others managed to give some theoretical evidence against those possibilities, but just like with Google’s experiment, it’s conceivable that some future breakthrough will change the outlook and remove the case for quantum supremacy.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have any amusing stories?</strong>  When I refereed the <em>Science</em> paper, I asked why the authors directly verified the results of their experiment only for up to 26-30 photons, relying on plausible extrapolations beyond that.  While directly verifying the results of n-photon BosonSampling takes ~2<sup>n</sup> time for any known classical algorithm, I said, surely it should be possible with existing computers to go up to n=40 or n=50?  A couple weeks later, the authors responded, saying that they’d now verified their results up to n=40, but it burned $400,000 worth of supercomputer time so they decided to stop there.  This was by far the most expensive referee report I ever wrote!</p>



<p>Also: when Covid first started, and facemasks were plentiful in China but almost impossible to get in the US, Chao-Yang Lu, one of the leaders of the new work and my sometime correspondent on the theory of BosonSampling, decided to mail me a box of 200 masks (I didn’t ask for it).  I don’t think that influenced my later review, but it was appreciated nonetheless.</p>



<p>Huge congratulations to the whole team for their accomplishment!</p></div>

<p>Back in 2005, I wrote a post titled <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/11/chess-and-poker.html">Chess and Poker</a>. Not really comparing the two but noting that Chess had lost its mojo while poker had high-stakes prime time tournaments. The inspiration was an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/opinion/all-the-right-moves.html">NYT Op-Ed</a> that started "CHESS in America is having a crisis". I suggested that computers getting better than humans may have reduced interest in the game. </p><p>Now chess is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/arts/television/chess-set-board-sales.html">booming again</a>, due to all of us being stuck at home and the Netflix limited series <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10048342/">The Queen's Gambit</a> (highly recommended). </p><p>The fictional show takes place in the 1960's when interest in chess in the US started to pick up due to <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/01/bobby-fischer-guest-post-by-ken-regan.html">Bobby Fischer's exploits</a> and well before computers played a decent game. Fischer isn't mentioned in the Netflix series, the main character Beth Harmon sort of plays his role. The games themselves, created by Gary Kasparov and others, are even a joy to watch. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIMaTKOZG-8">this analysis</a> of the final game (spoiler warning). </p><p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/crosswords/chess/chess-50-years-of-new-york-times-columns.html">started a chess column</a> in 1962 and ran its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/crosswords/chess/after-rocky-start-grand-prix-finds-a-favorite-in-the-lead.html">last column</a> in 2014, though that might be saying more about the state of newspapers than the state of chess.</p><p>What about the computers? They have just gotten so good and with <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/12/our-ai-future-good-and-ugly.html">AlphaZero</a> mastering the game with just machine learning on top of the rules of chess, it's not even fun to watch computer versus computer anymore. Now we're back to watching humans and getting back into the games ourselves.</p><p>Computers have opened the door to cheating. Complexity theorist Ken Regan has a <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/experts/ken-regan-faculty-expert-chess.html">side gig</a> reviewing games to determine if a player punching above their weight secretly used a computer algorithm. </p><p>Microsoft just <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/the-human-side-of-ai-for-chess/">announced</a> chess programs that play as a human at various levels of strength. I suppose someone could use a program like this to cheat in a way that even Ken couldn't detect. But mostly it would be like Googling in pub trivia--just takes the fun out of the game.</p></div>

Håstad showed that any De Morgan formula (composed of AND, OR and NOT gates) shrinks by a factor of $O(p^{2})$ under a random restriction that leaves each variable alive independently with probability $p$ [SICOMP, 1998]. Using this result, he gave an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower bound for the Andreev function, which, up to lower order improvements, remains the state-of-the-art lower bound for any explicit function.

  In this work, we extend the shrinkage result of Håstad to hold under a far wider family of random restrictions and their generalization — random projections. Based on our shrinkage results, we obtain an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower bound for an explicit function computed in $\mathbf{AC}^0$. This improves upon the best known formula size lower bounds for $\mathbf{AC}^0$, that were only quadratic prior to our work. In addition, we prove that the KRW conjecture [Karchmer et al., Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995] holds for inner functions for which the unweighted quantum adversary bound is tight. In particular, this holds for inner functions with a tight Khrapchenko bound.

  Our random projections are tailor-made to the function's structure so that the function maintains structure even under projection --- using such projections is necessary, as standard random restrictions simplify $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits. In contrast, we show that any De Morgan formula shrinks by a quadratic factor under our random projections, allowing us to prove the cubic lower bound.

  Our proof techniques build on the proof of Håstad for the simpler case of balanced formulas. This allows for a significantly simpler proof at the cost of slightly worse parameters. As such, when specialized to the case of $p$-random restrictions, our proof can be used as an exposition of Håstad's result.</div>

<p>
Isabel Cachola, Kyle Lo, Arman Cohan, Daniel Weld are the authors of a recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15011">paper</a> on summarizing papers. They are all connected in various way to the <a href="https://allenai.org/papers">Allen Institute</a> for Artificial Intelligence. </p>
<p>
Today we take a moment to try out the <a href="https://scitldr.apps.allenai.org/">webtool</a> that comes with their paper.  It is noted also in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03277-2">news item</a> last week in <i>Nature</i>.</p>
<p>
They have created a program that reads a science article and outputs a single sentence that summarizes its content. Their goal is to help researchers search through the huge number of published papers faster than looking at abstracts. The software utilizes neural networks trained on many examples. </p>
<p>
For example: Their own <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15011">paper</a> has for its abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We introduce TLDR generation, a new form of extreme summarization, for scientific papers. TLDR generation involves high source compression and requires expert background knowledge and understanding of complex domain-specific language. To facilitate study on this task, we introduce SCITLDR, a new multi-target dataset of 5.4K TLDRs over 3.2K papers. SCITLDR contains both author-written and expert-derived TLDRs, where the latter are collected using a novel annotation protocol that produces high-quality summaries while minimizing annotation burden. We propose CATTS, a simple yet effective learning strategy for generating TLDRs that exploits titles as an auxiliary training signal. CATTS improves upon strong baselines under both automated metrics and human evaluations. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
And this becomes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We introduce SCITLDR, a new multi-target dataset of 5.4K TLDRs over 3.2K papers.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Not so impressive, but more on their program shortly.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Another Tryout </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Perhaps the big news this week is an advance on protein folding by Google DeepMind, the same team whose work on <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/stonefight-at-the-goke-corral/">AlphaGo</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2017/12/17/truth-from-zero/">AlphaZero</a> we have covered. Sure enough, their new system is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold">AlphaFold</a>—actually, AlphaFold2. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding">here</a> for basic information: </p>
<p></p><p><br />
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2020/12/02/too-long-didnt-read/fold-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-17826"><img width="500" alt="" src="https://rjlipton.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/fold.png?w=500&amp;h=222" class="aligncenter wp-image-17826" height="222" /></a></p>
<p></p><p><br />
The detailed <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">announcement</a> on the DeepMind <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog">blog</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Until we’ve published a paper on this work, please cite: “High Accuracy Protein Structure Prediction Using Deep Learning,” John Jumper [et al.]. In Fourteenth Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (Abstract Book), 30 November – 4 December 2020. Retrieved from <a href="https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/CASP14_Abstracts.pdf">here</a></em>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The link under “<a href="https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/CASP14_Abstracts.pdf">here</a>” goes to a long book of abstracts. Among them, there is a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1923-7">paper</a> last January in <em>Nature</em> with many of the same authors, though Jumper not as first author. Using its abstract, we got:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “We train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The abstracts book has the abstract for the current paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In the CASP14 experiment, we deployed AlphaFold 2. This new system uses a different deep learning method than CASP13 AlphaFold, and it produces much more accurate protein structures and estimates of model accuracy. The training data for the system is publicly available and similar to that used for CASP13 AlphaFold. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This is already short, but with SCITLDR it becomes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “In the CASP14 experiment, we deployed AlphaFold 2.0, a new deep learning system that produces much more accurate protein structures and” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The dangling “and” is a little mystifying. SCITLDR has optional fields for <i>Introduction</i> and <i>Conclusions</i>. The entry in the abstracts book has a body titled “Methods,” whose last subsection “T1064” reads like a conclusion, so we added them as such. We cleaned up the paste from PDF to have normal line breaks. After a few seconds, we obtained:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “In the CASP14 experiment, we deployed AlphaFold 2.0, a novel attention-based deep learning architecture that produces accurate protein structures” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The DeepMind announcement poses a further challenge: how to glean an important paper that for now exists only as a blog post. The first paragraph of their <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology">post</a> is boldfaced and reads like an abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Proteins are essential to life, supporting practically all its functions. They are large complex molecules, made up of chains of amino acids, and what a protein does largely depends on its unique 3D structure. Figuring out what shapes proteins fold into is known as the “protein folding problem,” and has stood as a grand challenge in biology for the past 50 years. In a major scientific advance, the latest version of our AI system AlphaFold has been recognised as a solution to this grand challenge by the organisers of the biennial Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP). This breakthrough demonstrates the impact AI can have on scientific discovery and its potential to dramatically accelerate progress in some of the most fundamental fields that explain and shape our world. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
It becomes: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “AlphaFold has been recognized as a solution to this grand challenge by the organizers of the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP)” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Pretty good—do you agree?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Even Faster </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Both Ken and I are fans of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mathematical_Experience">book</a> <em>The Mathematical Experience</em> by Philip Davis and Reuben Hersch. The following passage, from the chapter “The Ideal Mathematician,” describes how one writes a paper, but Ken has always taken it to describe the swiftness needed to read a paper:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> The intended readers (all twelve of them) can decode the formal presentation, detect the new idea hidden in lemma 4, ignore the routine and uninteresting calculations of lemmas 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and see what the author is doing and why he does it. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Nowadays we pore through papers as they appear on arXiv. For most, we just scan the titles. For others, we go to the main page with the abstract. For some, we click on the PDF to read the paper. This may be the greatest exercise in freedom of intellect we have our professional lives, but it is also an exercise in speed. We who do research in time complexity need to minimize our own time. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some CS Examples </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Another way to say this: we all need to read through the literature faster and more precisely. Here are a few examples of their one sentence abstracts for theory papers from the SCITLDR program. Rate them by seeing if you can match the summarizes with the papers.</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<div class="content">
The multiplicity Schwartz-Zippel lemma bounds the total multiplicity of zeroes of a multivariate polynomial on a product set. This lemma motivates the multiplicity codes of Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [J. ACM, 2014], who showed how to use this lemma to construct high-rate locally-decodable codes. However, the algorithmic results about these codes crucially rely on the fact that the polynomials are evaluated on a vector space and not an arbitrary product set. 

In this work, we show how to decode multivariate multiplicity codes of large multiplicities in polynomial time over finite product sets (over fields of large characteristic and zero characteristic).  Previously such decoding algorithms were not known even for a positive fraction of errors. In contrast, our work goes all the way to the distance of the code and in particular exceeds both the unique decoding bound and the Johnson bound. For errors exceeding the Johnson bound, even combinatorial list-decodablity of these codes was not known.

Our algorithm is an application of the classical polynomial method directly to the multivariate setting. In particular, we do not rely on a reduction from the multivariate to the univariate case as is typical of many of the existing results on decoding codes based on multivariate polynomials.  However, a vanilla application of the polynomial method in the multivariate setting does not yield a polynomial upper bound on the list size. We obtain a polynomial bound on the list size by taking an alternative view of multivariate multiplicity codes. In this view,  we glue all the partial derivatives of the same order  together  using a fresh set $\mathbf{z}$ of variables.  We then apply the polynomial method by viewing this as a problem over the field $\mathbb{F}(\mathbf{z})$ of rational functions in $\mathbf{z}$.</div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2020/06/18/foundation-announces-simons-collaboration-on-the-theory-of-algorithmic-fairness/">Simons Collaboration on the Theory of Algorithmic Fairness</a> seek highly qualified candidates (within five years of the award of their PhD) for a postdoctoral research position. Appointments will begin Summer or Fall 2021.</p>



<p>This multi-year program will host several postdoctoral researchers working on modeling and theoretical work understanding (a) the sources of discriminatory behavior of algorithms, and (b) how best to mitigate such impacts.</p>



<p>Descriptions of the scientific agendas of this research collaboration can be found at <a href="https://toc4fairnesses.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://toc4fairnesses.org/</a>.</p>



<p>Fellows will be able to collaborate broadly, including with researchers at partner institutions: Stanford University, Toyota Institute of Technology at Chicago, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, UC Berkeley, Cornell University,  Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Weizmann Institute of Science, University of Toronto,  University of Washington, and University of Pennsylvania.</p>



<p> The anticipated term for a fellowship is one or two years – to be decided at the time of appointment, with the possibility of extension based on mutual agreement. In addition to competitive salary and benefits, the fellowship also includes funding for independent travel to workshops, conferences and other universities and research labs.</p>



<p>In order to apply, please email a CV, research statement, and have two reference letters sent to <a href="mailto:jamiemmt@cs.washington.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jamiemmt@cs.washington.edu</a>.

It is known that the size of monotone arithmetic $(+,\ast)$ circuits can be  exponentially decreased by allowing just one division  "at the very end," at the output gate. A natural question is: can the size of $(+,\ast)$ circuits be substantially  reduced if we allow divisions "at the very beginning," that is, if besides  nonnegative real constants and variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, the circuits can also use their reciprocals $1/x_1,\ldots,1/x_n$ as inputs. We answer this question in the negative: the gain in circuit size is  then always at most quadratic.


Over tropical $(\min,+)$ and $(\max,+)$ semirings, division turns into subtraction; so, reciprocal inputs are then $-x_1,\ldots,-x_n$.  We give the same negative answer also for tropical circuits. The question of whether reciprocal inputs can substantially speed up tropical $(\min,+,\max)$ circuits, using both $\min$ and $\max$ gates, remains open.</div>

<div class="content">
<p><br /></p><p>James The Amazing Randi died on October 20, 2020, at the age of 92. He is survived by</p><p>his husband Jose Alvarez.  His Wikipedia page is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi">here</a></p><div> </div><div>A few Randi Points:</div><div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div>0) Wikipedia lists his careers as Magician, Author, Skeptic. I didn't know that skeptic was a career.</div><div><br /></div><div>1) Randi debunked many paranormal claims, though he did not like the term <i>debunke</i>r. He preferred <i>investigator</i>.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) Martin Gardner and James Randi founded the</div><div><br /></div><div><i>Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>which publishes</div><div><br /></div><div><i>The Skeptical Inquirer</i>: see <a href="https://skepticalinquirer.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwuL_8BRCXARIsAGiC51AlnsnROpbKH-O1K-3WoumIXHGLAACCVDxByb2lFy0rkKunUHblUOAaAmUmEALw_wcB">here</a>  </div></div><div><br /></div><div><div><br /></div><div>3) The internet is both a place where unchecked claims of paranormal activity (and more dangerous lies) can grow faster than in an earlier time, but also a place where magazines like The Skeptical Inquirer, and fact-checking websites, can help check the unchecked claims. What is winning? I leave that as an exercise for the reader. </div><div><br /></div><div>4) I suspect most (all?) people reading this blog do not believe in astrology, UFO's, ESP, or other crank theories. Hence I was surprised to read that Alan Turing thought the evidence for  ESP was <i>overwhelming. </i>This was mentioned in passing in his paper on The Turing Test (called there <i>The</i> <i>Imitation Game</i>) as something the Turing Test will have to account for. I've tried to find out why he believed this, without success. Some websites mentioned that belief in the paranormal was more... normal in those days. One suggested that after the counter-intuitive theories of quantum mechanics and relatively were out there, other counter-intuitive theories took hold, like ESP.  Even so, what was the evidence he was referring to?</div><div><br /></div><div>5) Claims that<i>  I was abducted by a UFO</i> or <i>I saw a UFO</i> have decreased since people now have cell phones so ALWAYS have a way to take pictures. Also rumors like (I had heard this one)</div><div><br /></div><div><i>There is an alternative ending to the movie BLAH which made is way to a few DVDs by mistake.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>are no longer made since IF true you could EASILY produce evidence of such (post to you tube or elsewhere).</div><div><br /></div><div>6) The term<i> skeptic</i> just means someone who doubts something, and is not necc a positive things.</div><div><br /></div><div><i>I am a skeptic when it comes go Global Warming</i></div><div><br /></div><div>being one example.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>Randi largely debunked things that were obviously false and not-political. (That the very existence of Global Warming is political is  appalling. At some future point the question of whether or not we ever got to the moon will be political: Something done by big government that worked is impossible, hence it did not happen. See Scott's Blog on disbelief that we ever went to the moon <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4267">here</a>. And people like Randi will need to debunk the notion that the moon landing was faked.) </div><div><br /></div><div>7) Back to Turing- There is a large diff between believing in ESP and believing in astrology.</div><div><br /></div><div>For ESP Turing mentioned <i>overwhelming evidence. </i> While he was WRONG, he did see the need to HAVE evidence. And note that ESP CAN be tested and found to NOT be true. Also note that it is plausible (though I really doubt it) that some humans somehow have some level of ESP. Astrology has NO redeeming value or hope whatsoever. (I am reminded that in Martin Gardner's book <i>Fads and Fallacies in the name of science </i>he noted that most people would say things like `YES, I liked your debunking of A, but you are wrong about B--- B is for real!')</div><div><br /></div><div>UFO's: I do not believe that aliens have come here and abducted people or left crop circles or anything of the sort. The intelligent question of  <i>is there intelligent life in the universe  </i>is quite another matter.</div><div><br /></div><div>7) When I saw magicians as a kid (1960's) I knew that it was all tricks- though very skillful tricks which were impressive. Sometimes they would indicate that it was <i>real magic </i>but I did not know what they meant. Since then I have learned that in an earlier time it was common that magicians claimed they used  <i>real magic</i>.  I still don't quite know what that means, which is just as well since it does not exist.</div><div><br /></div><div>8) Randi has been sued by people whose tricks he has debunked. Randi seems to have always won.  I say <i>seems to </i> since legal cases are not as clear cut as mathematics.  I also looked up Uri Geller. He has sued A LOT of people, and not just people who deny his claims. Thinks like using his likeness  without permission  (he may have a point there). Very hard to tell how he is doing on balance.</div><div><br /></div><div>9) According to Wikipedia Randi dropped out of High School. I assume he learned A LOT on his own.</div><div><br /></div><div>(Trivia-- who was the last president who did not have a college degree? I will answer at the end.)</div><div><br /></div><div>10) This seems like a paradox... or something (quoted from Wikipedia):</div></div><div><br /></div><div><div>BEGIN</div><div><br /></div><div>Randi has been accused of actually using <i>psychic powers</i> to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud.  Randi said: "<i>Yes, indeed</i>, <i>I'm a trickste</i>r, <i>I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery</i>. The professor shouted back:</div><div><br /></div><div><i>That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it.</i></div><div><br /></div><div>A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena.  When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: "<i>I think</i> <i>Randi may be a </i><i>psychic and doesn't realize it</i>." Randi consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.</div><div><br /></div><div>END</div><div><br /></div><div>Reminds me of <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/06/fraud-or-not.html">this</a> blog entry where I speculate about someone who codes up a great new classical  factoring algorithm and claims he has a quantum computer, or someone who has a working quantum computer and claims its a great new classical factoring algorithm. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>11) The last president who did not have a college degree: Harry Truman.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>

We consider the problem of counting the number of copies of a fixed graph $H$ within an input graph $G$. This is one of the most well-studied algorithmic graph problems, with many theoretical and practical applications. We focus on solving this problem when the input $G$ has {\em bounded degeneracy}. This is a rich family of graphs, containing all graphs without a fixed minor (e.g. planar graphs), as well as graphs generated by various random processes (e.g. preferential attachment graphs). We say that $H$ is {\em easy} if there is a linear-time algorithm for counting the number of copies of $H$ in an input $G$ of bounded degeneracy. A seminal result of Chiba and Nishizeki from '85 states that every $H$ on at most 4 vertices is easy. Bera, Pashanasangi, and Seshadhri recently extended this to all $H$ on 5 vertices, and further proved that for every $k &gt; 5$ there is a $k$-vertex $H$ which is not easy. They left open the natural problem of characterizing all easy graphs $H$. 
		
Bressan has recently introduced a framework for counting subgraphs in degenerate graphs, from which one can extract a sufficient condition for a graph $H$ to be  easy. Here we show that this sufficient condition is also necessary, thus fully answering the Bera--Pashanasangi--Seshadhri problem. We further resolve two closely related problems; namely characterizing the graphs that are easy with respect to counting induced copies, and with respect to counting homomorphisms. Our proofs rely on several novel approaches for proving hardness results in the context of subgraph-counting.</div>

In this post, we explore the Lock-Commit paradigm for consensus protocols. This approach is probably the most celebrated and widely used technique for reaching consensus in a safe manner. This approach is one of the key techniques in DLS88 and Lamport’s Paxos. We exemplify this paradigm by showing a single-shot...</div>

<p>We acquired this small blue glass bottle nearly 15 years ago, as a prop for a Harry Potter themed birthday party. For much of the time since then it’s been decorating our bathroom window with several other blue bottles. Like most bottles these days, it’s molded rather than blown, but a little roughly so the welding seams are more visible than they usually are on wine or liquor bottles.</p>

<div><table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<tbody><tr style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
<td style="padding: 10px;"><img width="240" style="border-style: solid; border-color: black;" alt="Triangular blue glass bottle" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/triangularbottle/1-m.jpg" /></td>

<p>As you can see, it has an unusual triangular cross-section. The final image, with a Reuleaux triangle overlaid, shows that the curvature of this cross-section is less than a Reuleaux triangle would have. I don’t think its outline was chosen with any particular mathematics in mind, but only (as so many other curved triangles) to make an interesting shape.</p>
