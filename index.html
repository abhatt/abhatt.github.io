<p>While I’m a relative newcomer to differential privacy (my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10127">first paper</a> on it was only in 2017), I’ve found the community to be a pleasure to interact with: paradoxically, simultaneously tight-knit yet highly welcoming to newcomers. I partially credit this culture to the number of workshops and programs which bring people together, including, but not limited to, <a href="https://www.birs.ca/events/2018/5-day-workshops/18w5189">a BIRS workshop</a>, <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/">the Privacy Tools project at Harvard</a>, <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/privacy2019">a semester at the Simons Institute</a>, <a href="https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/164/">the forthcoming Shonan workshop</a>, and <a href="https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/">the Theory and Practice of Differential Privacy (TPDP) Workshop</a>.</p>



<p>I’m writing this post to draw attention to the imminent deadline of <a href="https://tpdp.cse.buffalo.edu/2019/">TPDP 2019</a>, co-located with CCS 2019 in London. I’ll spare you the full details (click the link for more information), but most pressing is the deadline tomorrow, June 21, 2019, anywhere on Earth (let me know if this presents hardship for you, and I can pass concerns on to the chair). Essentially anything related to the theory or practice of differential privacy is welcome. Submissions are limited to four pages in length and are lightly refereed, based on originality, relevance, interest, and clarity. There are no published proceedings, and previously published results are welcome. If you’ve been looking to get to know the community, consider either submitting or attending the workshop! </p></div>

<p>In 1788, Lagrange presented a set of equations of motion that, unlike Newtonian mechanics, are independent of the choice of coordinates of the physical system, and ultimately led to the formulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Hilbert_action">general relativity</a>. Hamilton came up with a different set of equations of motion in 1833 that arguably led to the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)">quantum mechanics</a>. Remarkably, in classical mechanics, these sets of equations turn out to be <em>equivalent</em> via a beautiful duality due to <strong>Legendre</strong>.</p>

<p><span style="color: #999999;"><em>A portrait of Legendre by H. Rousseau, E. Thomas, Augustin Challamel, and Desire Lacroix via Wikimedia Commons</em></span></p>
<p>Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics have inspired several promising optimization and sampling algorithms such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04245.pdf">first-order methods in optimization</a>,  <a href="http://arogozhnikov.github.io/2016/12/19/markov_chain_monte_carlo.html">Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a> (see also this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08898">paper</a> that will appear in NIPS 2018). Legendre duality also appears in convex optimization as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenchel%27s_duality_theorem">Fenchel</a> <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.wordpress.com/convex-optimization/">duality</a>.  <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/lagrangehamiltonian.pdf" title="LagrangeHamiltonian">This</a> note, written primarily for optimization folks, introduces Lagrangian dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics, and proves the duality that connects them.</p>
<p>I hope that these fundamental ideas inspire you as well to think about optimization from a physics perspective!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="https://theory.epfl.ch/celis/HOME.html">Elisa Celis</a> and Nisheeth Vishnoi</em></p>
<p>Elections are the nervous system of a democracy and, hence, issues related to their transparency and fairness are central to healthy societies. However, the number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controversial_elections">controversial elections</a> has exploded since 2000, and the more recent ones involve the use of the Internet and algorithms — a good excuse for computer scientists to get involved in elections to save democracy!</p>
<p>Last year, the two of us and Lingxao Huang revisited the question of <em>fairness</em> in <em>multi-winner</em> elections<em>. </em>A multi-winner election is one where the objective is to select a committee from a set of candidates based on voter preferences. However, election systems for multi-winner elections have been shown to be <a href="https://www.representwomen.org/voting_rules_pose_barrier_for_women">biased against minorities</a> by giving preference to committees that under-represent their already-small numbers. When the candidates have certain sensitive attributes (such as gender), and different types (e.g., male, female and non-binary) we may instead wish to impose additional requirement so that the winning committee is <em>fair</em>. We considered the problem of finding the committee with the maximum number of votes, subject to such additional fairness requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But what does it mean to be fair?</em></p>
<p>Is a committee fair when types are equally represented? Or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">proportionally represented</a>? These questions have received more than a century’s worth of attention in social choice theory and are deeply entangled with culture and politics. In short, fairness means different things in different contexts and rather than addressing a specific instance of this question, we asked ourselves — <em>can we provide a framework in which a user can specify fairness constraints according to their needs and design algorithms that can compute the winning committee accordingly?</em></p>
<p>Because such a framework must handle general classes of constraints, the algorithmic task became more challenging than the usual unconstrained case. If you are interested in understanding our algorithmic and complexity results, they appear in our recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10057.pdf">paper</a> that was presented at IJCAI-ECAI this year.</p>
<p>Clearly, however, there are real merits to providing such generality — earlier this year, our paper caught the eye of members of a <a href="https://appelcitoyen.ch/">people’s movement</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Valais">Valais</a> canton in Switzerland, who were in the process of rethinking elections in their region. They were happy to know that we had solved the exact problem they needed for a primary election and asked us if we would be willing to help them conduct their elections. We were, of course, thrilled!</p>
<p>After an intense collaboration for more than four months, 8 elections that used our framework concluded on September 9, 2018. For us, there were several eye-opening aspects of taking our algorithmic framework from theory to practice. Perhaps the most interesting one was coming up with an answer to:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Who decides what is fair?</em></p>
<p>In this case, it was the voters! Before voting on the committee, a vote to determine the fairness constraints was conducted in each of the eight districts. This vote was in mid-June and also checked if the voters agree to use our algorithmic framework. Since transparency was the key motivation, prior to this vote,  we were invited to a press conference to educate the people about the whole process that resulted in coverage in newspapers <a href="https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/listes-ideales-constituante-valaisanne?itm_source=homepage&amp;itm_medium=position-12">Le Temps</a>,  <a href="https://www.lenouvelliste.ch/articles/valais/canton/appel-citoyen-lance-sa-primaire-digitale-en-vue-de-la-constituante-les-passionnes-de-democratie-ont-jusqu-a-jeudi-pour-s-inscrire-763669">Le Nouvelliste</a>, TV channel <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://canal9.ch/appel-citoyen-va-choisir-ses-candidats-pour-la-lassemblee-constituante-en-deux-etapes-et-par-internet/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1537194868256000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQkC-CmcI2n0iBfAAzxP4GWbiBzQ">Canal 9</a>, and radio channels <a href="http://www.rhonefm.ch/fr/podcasts/journal-du-soir-une-election-primaire-digitale--c-est-l-aventure-dans-laquelle-se-lance-le-mouvement-apolitique-appel-citoyen-en-premiere-mondiale-1107827">Rhone FM</a> and  <a href="http://radiochablais.ch//podcast/mp3/info_12h_13062018.mp3">Radio Chablais</a>.</p>

<p><em>An image from the press conference in Sion on June 12, 2018. Elisa Celis (center), accompanied by members of Appel Citoyen.</em></p>
<p>In the end, the voters decided to place constraints on the gender balance, age demographics, and regions. While all districts approved these same three attributes, the specific constraints varied by district according to their demographics and pre-defined regions. This was a truly open and democratic way to determine the criteria by which the committee was to be balanced. The constraints not only ensured that the outcome would be fair (as defined by the voters) but also encouraged many more women to run for election than the party originally anticipated — in fact, in several districts there were more women than men contesting the election!</p>

We have also made available a <a href="http://valais-elections.herokuapp.com/">demo</a> with pre-loaded constraints, candidate information, and votes for anyone to test and compute the results. To know more about the use of our algorithm in these elections, take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6M1fpcEBQE">this video</a>.

<p>We feel fortunate that we were given this unique opportunity to take tools from computer science to the heart of a democratic process. It was an unparalleled learning experience for all of us and something that we increasingly look forward to in the future.</p>

<p>I arrived at the Institute for Advanced Study to attend a workshop on <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/ocit2018/agenda">Optimization, Complexity and Invariant Theory</a> organized by Avi Wigderson. The workshop has an incredibly diverse agenda, also reflected in the participants.</p>
<p>I will talk about <em>Geodesic Convexity: </em>Sometimes, functions that are non-convex in the Euclidean space turn out to be convex if one introduces a suitable metric (or differential structure) and redefines convexity with respect to the induced straight lines — <em>geodesics</em>. Such a function is called <em>geodesically convex. </em>Unlike standard convexity,<em>  w</em>hen does a function have this property and how to optimize it, is not well-understood. My talk will focus on introducing geodesic convexity and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04051">show</a> that the problem of computing the Brascamp-Lieb constant has a succinct geodesically convex formulation.</p>
<p>And, accompanying my talk are <a href="https://nisheethvishnoi.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/geodesicconvexity.pdf" title="GeodesicConvexity">these</a> self-contained and expository notes on differentiation on manifolds, geodesics, and geodesic convexity that are prepared with the help of my student Ozan Yildiz.</p></div>

<p>Today I’d like to sketch a question that’s been pushing me in a lot of different directions over the past few years — some sane, others less so; few fruitful, but all instructive. The question is motivated by the problem of placing upper bounds on the amount of entanglement needed to play a two-player non-local game (near-)optimally. But it can also be stated as a natural mathematical question in itself, so this is how I’ll present it first, and then only briefly discuss some motivation. (I wish I could write I’ll also present results, but these will be quite sparse.) All that is to come is based on discussions with Oded Regev, though all inaccuracies and naïvetés are mine.</p>
<h2>Prelude: Vector Correlation Matrices</h2>
<p>Before jumping to unitary correlation matrices, let’s — rather pedantically — introduce vector correlation matrices. Most of you are already familiar with this simple object: a vector correlation matrix is an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n\times n}" class="latex" title="{n\times n}" /> Hermitian matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> with complex entries such that there exists an integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> and unit vectors <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu_1%2C%5Cldots%2Cu_n%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{u_1,\ldots,u_n\in {\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{u_1,\ldots,u_n\in {\mathbb C}^d}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+%5Clangle+u_i%2Cu_j%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_{i,j} = \langle u_i,u_j\rangle}" class="latex" title="{C_{i,j} = \langle u_i,u_j\rangle}" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%29%5Cin%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn%5C%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2}" class="latex" title="{(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2}" />. In other words: a Gram matrix with diagonal entries equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />.</p>
<p>A natural question is, given a vector correlation matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" />, what is the minimal dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> in which there exists vectors achieving the specified correlations? Clearly <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5Cleq+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d\leq n}" class="latex" title="{d\leq n}" />, the dimension of the span of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> vectors; moreover the identity matrix implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%3Dn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d=n}" class="latex" title="{d=n}" /> is sometimes necessary.</p>
<p>If we allow <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-approximations, we can do better: the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%3DO%28%5Cvarepsilon%5E%7B-2%7D%5Clog+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d=O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log n)}" class="latex" title="{d=O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log n)}" /> is sufficient (and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02094">necessary</a>) to find unit vectors such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Clangle+u_i%2Cu_j%5Crangle-C_%7Bi%2Cj%7D%7C%5Cleq%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\langle u_i,u_j\rangle-C_{i,j}|\leq\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{|\langle u_i,u_j\rangle-C_{i,j}|\leq\varepsilon}" /> for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%2Cj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i,j}" class="latex" title="{i,j}" />. And if we only require the approximation to hold on the average over the choice of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{i}" class="latex" title="{i}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bj%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{j}" class="latex" title="{j}" />, then no dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> is necessary: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd+%3D+O%28%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-2%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d = O(\epsilon^{-2})}" class="latex" title="{d = O(\epsilon^{-2})}" /> suffices.</p>
<p>This is all good and well. Now onto the interesting stuff!</p>
<h2>Theme: Unitary Correlation Matrices</h2>
<p>Define a unitary correlation matrix to be an an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n\times n}" class="latex" title="{n\times n}" /> Hermitian matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> with complex entries such that there exists an integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> and unitary matrices <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU_1%2C%5Cldots%2CU_n%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5E%7Bd%5Ctimes+d%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U_1,\ldots,U_n\in {\mathbb C}^{d\times d}}" class="latex" title="{U_1,\ldots,U_n\in {\mathbb C}^{d\times d}}" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%3D+d%5E%7B-1%7D%5Ctextrm%7BTr%7D%28U_i+U_j%5E%5Cdagger%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C_{i,j} = d^{-1}\textrm{Tr}(U_i U_j^\dagger)}" class="latex" title="{C_{i,j} = d^{-1}\textrm{Tr}(U_i U_j^\dagger)}" /> for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28i%2Cj%29%5Cin%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn%5C%7D%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2}" class="latex" title="{(i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2}" />. Considering block matrices shows that the set of unitary correlation matrices is convex.</p>
<p>By forgetting the unitary structure of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U_i}" class="latex" title="{U_i}" /> we see that a unitary correlation matrix is automatically a vector correlation matrix; in particular it is positive semidefinite with all diagonal entries equal to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. While the latter is a characterization of vector correlation matrices, however, as soon as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Cgeq+4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n\geq 4}" class="latex" title="{n\geq 4}" /> (and not before) there exists vector correlation matrices that are not unitary correlation matrices. This is not completely trivial to see, and appears in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0288">paper </a>by Dykema and Juschenko; it is a nice exercise to work out. Now for the main question:</p>
<p>(<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathfrak{D}}" class="latex" title="{\mathfrak{D}}" />): Dimension reduction for unitaries. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Cin%7B%5Cmathbb+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n\in{\mathbb N}}" class="latex" title="{n\in{\mathbb N}}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+%3E+0+%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon &gt; 0 }" class="latex" title="{\epsilon &gt; 0 }" /> be given. Does there exist an explicit <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%3Dd%27%28n%3B%5Cepsilon%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'=d'(n;\epsilon)}" class="latex" title="{d'=d'(n;\epsilon)}" /> such that for every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n\times n}" class="latex" title="{n\times n}" /> unitary correlation matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C}" class="latex" title="{C}" /> there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" />-dimensional unitaries <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_1%2C%5Cldots%2CV_n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_1,\ldots,V_n}" class="latex" title="{V_1,\ldots,V_n}" /> such that</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5CBig%7C%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bd%27%7D%5Ctextrm%7BTr%7D%5Cbig%28V_i%5C%2CV_j%5E%5Cdagger%5Cbig%29+-+C_%7Bi%2Cj%7D+%5CBig%7C+%5Cleq+%5Cvarepsilon+%5Cqquad+%5Cforall+%28i%2Cj%29%5Cin%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn%5C%7D%5E2%5C%3B+.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \Big|\frac{1}{d'}\textrm{Tr}\big(V_i\,V_j^\dagger\big) - C_{i,j} \Big| \leq \varepsilon \qquad \forall (i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2\; ." class="latex" title="\displaystyle \Big|\frac{1}{d'}\textrm{Tr}\big(V_i\,V_j^\dagger\big) - C_{i,j} \Big| \leq \varepsilon \qquad \forall (i,j)\in\{1,\ldots,n\}^2\; ." /></p>
<p>While the analogue question for vectors is trivial for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon=0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon=0}" />, and a fundamental result in geometry for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}" />, extremely little is known on the question for unitaries. Virtually the only general statement that can be made is that, at least, some bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" /> exists. This follows by a simple compactness argument, but does not yield any meaningful bound on the growth of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" /> as a function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />. In fact no explicit bound, however large, is known to hold in general. Let’s explore the problem a bit.</p>
<h2>Variatio: Equivalent formulations</h2>
<p>A nice feature of question (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathfrak{D}}" class="latex" title="{\mathfrak{D}}" />) is that it is reasonably robust, in the sense that different natural formulations of the question can be shown equivalent, up to simple variations on the precise scaling of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" />. For example, one can relax the constraint of being unitary to the sole requirement that the matrices have all singular values at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />. At the opposite end of the spectrum one can consider a more structured problem which considers correlations between projection matrices (so all eigenvalues are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />). Both these variants can be shown equivalent to the unitary case via some simple reductions.</p>
<p>The one variant which makes a substantial difference is the case of correlation matrices with real entries. A beautiful result of <a href="http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~tsirel/download/qbell87.html">Tsirelson</a> shows that any extremal real correlation matrix can be realized exactly, by Hermitian matrices having all eigenvalues <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B-1%2C1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{-1,1\}}" class="latex" title="{\{-1,1\}}" />,  in dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27+%3D+2%5E%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Clfloor+n%2F2%5Crfloor%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d' = 2^{\sqrt{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}}" class="latex" title="{d' = 2^{\sqrt{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}}" />, and this bound is tight; relatively precise bounds of the form <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%3D2%5E%7B%5CTheta%28%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-1%7D%29%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'=2^{\Theta(\epsilon^{-1})}}" class="latex" title="{d'=2^{\Theta(\epsilon^{-1})}}" /> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01652">are known</a> for small enough <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}" />. (Note that even though projection matrices are Hermitian, and thus give rise to real correlations, Tsirelson’s result does not imply a positive answer for the case of projections as the dimension-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" /> matrices recovered via Tsirelson’s construction will in general be Hermitian, but not projectors, even when the original matrices were.)</p>
<h2>Interlude: Motivation</h2>
<p><strong>Quantum games. </strong>One can arrive at question (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathfrak{D}}" class="latex" title="{\mathfrak{D}}" />) by asking about the minimal dimension of near-optimal strategies in a quantum two-player game. Experts will immediately see the connection, and I will not elaborate on this. Roughly, the easy observation is that correlations that are achievable by entangled players in a nonlocal game take the form</p>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Clangle+%5Cpsi%7C+A+%5Cotimes+B+%7C%5Cpsi%5Crangle+%3D+%5Ctextrm%7BTr%7D%28AKB%5ETK%5E%5Cdagger%29%2C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="\displaystyle \langle \psi| A \otimes B |\psi\rangle = \textrm{Tr}(AKB^TK^\dagger)," class="latex" title="\displaystyle \langle \psi| A \otimes B |\psi\rangle = \textrm{Tr}(AKB^TK^\dagger)," /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpsi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\psi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\psi\rangle}" /> is a unit vector in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed+%5Cotimes+%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%5Ed%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb C}^d \otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb C}^d \otimes {\mathbb C}^d}" /> (the entanglement), <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{K}" class="latex" title="{K}" /> is a complex <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%5Ctimes+d%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d\times d}" class="latex" title="{d\times d}" /> matrix that can be computed from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpsi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\psi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\psi\rangle}" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%2CB%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{A,B}" class="latex" title="{A,B}" />“observables”, i.e. Hermitian operators that square to identity describing the players’ measurement operators. (A more general formulation considers projections, rather than observables.) In case <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpsi%5Crangle%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\psi\rangle}" class="latex" title="{|\psi\rangle}" /> is the so-called “maximally entangled state”, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK+%3D+d%5E%7B-1%2F2%7D+I%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{K = d^{-1/2} I}" class="latex" title="{K = d^{-1/2} I}" /> and we recover precisely an entry from a correlation matrix. (The case of a general state gives rise to a slight variant of question <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(\mathfrak{D})}" class="latex" title="{(\mathfrak{D})}" />, to which I am not sure whether it is equivalent or not.)<br />
Arriving at the question from this “physical” angle, it seems like it “ought” to have a reasonable answer: certainly, if one fixes the size of the game, and an approximation error <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}" />, then there must exist some dimension that suffices to implement an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />-optimal strategy. No such result is known. If anything existing signs seem to point in the negative direction: for instance, Slofstra <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">very recently</a> showed that there exists a fixed, constant-sized game such that the optimal winning probability of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> can only be achieved in the limit of infinite dimension (but it does seem to be the case that, for this game, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />-optimal strategies can be found in dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Ctextrm%7Bpoly%7D%28%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\textrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}}" class="latex" title="{\textrm{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}}" />). Note that this result implies that the set of correlation matrices of projections is not closed.</p>
<p><strong>Connes’ conjecture.</strong> A different, though related, way to arrive at question (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathfrak{D}}" class="latex" title="{\mathfrak{D}}" />) is via the famous “Connes embedding conjecture” in the theory of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BC%5E%2A%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{C^*}" class="latex" title="{C^*}" /> algebras. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1971057?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Connes’ embedding conjecture</a> states, rather informally, that any separable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BII_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{II_1}" class="latex" title="{II_1}" /> factor (i.e. a von Neumann algebra with trivial center that is infinite-dimensional as a vector space, but has a finite faithful trace) embeds into a suitable ultrapower of the hyperfinite factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathcal%7BR%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathcal{R}}" class="latex" title="{\mathcal{R}}" />. Kirchberg <a href="https://eudml.org/doc/144111">showed that</a> the conjecture is equivalent to the following statement.</p>
<p>Theorem. The validity of Connes’ conjecture for some factor <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BM%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{M}" class="latex" title="{M}" /> is equivalent to the following: For all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%2Ck%5Cin%7B%5Cmathbb+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n,k\in{\mathbb N}}" class="latex" title="{n,k\in{\mathbb N}}" /> and unitaries <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU_1%2C%5Cldots%2CU_n%5Cin+M%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U_1,\ldots,U_n\in M}" class="latex" title="{U_1,\ldots,U_n\in M}" /> there is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%5Cin%7B%5Cmathbb+N%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'\in{\mathbb N}}" class="latex" title="{d'\in{\mathbb N}}" /> and unitaries <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BV_1%2C%5Cldots%2CV_n%5Cin+M_%7Bd%27%7D%28%7B%5Cmathbb+C%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{V_1,\ldots,V_n\in M_{d'}({\mathbb C})}" class="latex" title="{V_1,\ldots,V_n\in M_{d'}({\mathbb C})}" />, such that</p>

This formulation is close to question (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathfrak{D}}" class="latex" title="{\mathfrak{D}}" />), except for two important differences: first, we assume that the target correlations are achievable in finite dimension <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" />. This makes the problem easier, and would make it trivial if we were not to introduce a second important difference, which is that we ask for explicit bounds on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" />. As a result I do not know of any formal implication between (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathfrak%7BD%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathfrak{D}}" class="latex" title="{\mathfrak{D}}" />) and Connes’ conjecture, in either direction.</p>
<p><strong>Graph limits. </strong>Finally, for the combinatorialist let me mention an analogous (though, as far I can tell, not directly related) question, formulated by Aldous and Lyons in the context of their study of limits of bounded-degree graphs. The distance between two finite graphs of the same constant degree (but not necessarily the same number of vertices) can be measured via the sampling distance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta}" class="latex" title="{\delta}" />: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%28G%2CG%27%29+%3D+%5Csum_%7Br%3D1%7D%5E%5Cinfty+2%5E%7B-r%7D%5Cdelta_r%28G%2CG%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta(G,G') = \sum_{r=1}^\infty 2^{-r}\delta_r(G,G')}" class="latex" title="{\delta(G,G') = \sum_{r=1}^\infty 2^{-r}\delta_r(G,G')}" />, where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta_r%28G%2CG%27%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta_r(G,G')}" class="latex" title="{\delta_r(G,G')}" /> denotes the total variation distance between the distributions on rooted <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" />-neighborhoods obtained by sampling a random vertex from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> (resp. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G'}" class="latex" title="{G'}" />) and considering the sub-graph induced on all vertices at distance at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{r}" class="latex" title="{r}" /> from the sampled vertex. With this notion in place, Question 10.1 in Aldous and Lyons’ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0603062">paper on unimodular random networks</a> asks the following:</p>
<p>(Aldous-Lyons:) For every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon&gt;0}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon&gt;0}" /> there is an integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> such that for every (finite) graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G}" class="latex" title="{G}" /> there is a graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{G'}" class="latex" title="{G'}" /> on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d}" class="latex" title="{d}" /> vertices such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdelta%28G%2CG%27%29%5Cleq+%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\delta(G,G')\leq \epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\delta(G,G')\leq \epsilon}" />.</p>
<p>In page 1458 the authors mention that the validity of their conjecture for the special class of Cayley graphs would imply that all finitely generated groups are sofic (very roughly, can be embedded into finite-dimensional permutation groups). Even though we do not know of an example of a group that is not sofic, this would be a very surprising result. In particular, it would imply Connes’s Embedding Conjecture for group von Neumann algebras, since the latter is known to hold for sofic groups.</p>
<h2>Development: Results</h2>
<p>Unfortunately this is going to be one of the shortest, most boring developments in musical history: there is too little to say! I could describe multiple failed attempts. In particular, naïve attempts at dimension reduction, inspired by Johnson-Lindenstrauss or other standard techniques, or incremental “gradient-descent” type of progressive block diagonalization procedures, all seem doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Aside from Tsirelson’s result for real correlation matrices, the one case for which we were able to find a cute proof is the case of permutation correlation matrices, where each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U_i}" class="latex" title="{U_i}" /> is assumed to be a permutation matrix. The fact that permutations are sparse seems to make it easier to operate on them by “shifting entries around”; unitaries have a more rigid structure. The proof uses a simple combinatorial argument, with the heaviest hammer being Hall’s theorem guaranteeing the existence of a perfect matching, which is used to simultaneously re-organize the “<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" />” entries in a subset of the permutation matrices while preserving all correlations. The upper bound on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" /> we obtain is of order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5En%2F%5Cvarepsilon%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^n/\varepsilon^2}" class="latex" title="{2^n/\varepsilon^2}" />, which may be the right order.</p>
<p>More is known in terms of negative results, i.e. lower bounds on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" />. Such bounds abound in the theory of nonlocal games, where they go by the name of “dimension witness”. The best known results I am aware of imply that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'}" class="latex" title="{d'}" /> should grow at least like <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmin%282%5E%7B%5COmega%28%5Cepsilon%5E%7B-1%7D%29%7D%2C2%5En%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\min(2^{\Omega(\epsilon^{-1})},2^n)}" class="latex" title="{\min(2^{\Omega(\epsilon^{-1})},2^n)}" />, which is good for very small <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" />, and also <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bd%27%3D%5COmega%28n%5Ec%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{d'=\Omega(n^c)}" class="latex" title="{d'=\Omega(n^c)}" />, which holds for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" title="{\epsilon}" /> smaller than a universal constant (the two bounds are obtained from different families of correlations; see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01652">here</a> for the former and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03574">here</a> for the latter). An interesting consequence of the (proof of) the second bound, which appears in joint work with Natarajan, is that even an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-approximation on average (over the entries of C) requires large dimension. This implies that no “oblivious” rounding technique, as in the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, will work: such a technique would guarantee small approximation error on average independently of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />.</p>
<h2>Coda</h2>
<p>There has been a lot of progress recently on lower bounds, stimulated by works on quantum non-local games. This includes a beautiful framework of games for checking “non-commutative” analogues of linear equations over <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathbb%7BF%7D_2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\mathbb{F}_2}" class="latex" title="{\mathbb{F}_2}" />, developed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2729">Cleve and Mittal</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.3794">Ji</a>; extensions of the framework to testing finitely presented groups by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08618">Slofstra</a>; a development of approaches based on operator systems by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07207">Paulsen</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02791">co-authors</a>, and many others. But no upper bounds! Get to work: things can’t remain this way.</p></div>

<p>This blog has already seen three posts on the quantum PCP conjecture: in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2013/02/24/a-quantum-pcp-theorem/">February 2013</a> to highlight several talks at the Simons Institute in Berkeley, in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2013/10/01/quantum-pcp-a-survey/">October 2013</a> to promote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7495">survey</a> on the topic I wrote with Dorit Aharonov and Itai Arad, and in <a href="https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2014/10/31/quantum-pcp-conjectures/">October 2014</a> to introduce the two main variants “constraint satisfaction” (CSP) and “multiplayer games” (MIP), of the quantum QCP (qPCP) conjecture. Such a high rate of posting (compared to the average frequency of posts on this blog) might indicate a slight obsession. But you may also notice it’s been…two years! Has no result worthy of note been established since? Certainly not, and although the conjecture still stands strong, there have been a few interesting developments on both variants of the conjecture. In this post I’ll discuss a couple results on the CSP-qPCP. In a follow-up post I’ll describe progress on the MIP-qPCP.</p>
<p>When we wrote the survey three summers ago, the latest word on the CSP-qPCP (see Conjecture 1.3 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.7495v1.pdf">here</a> for a precise formulation) had been given in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.0017">paper</a> by Brandao and Harrow. BH showed, using information-theoretic arguments, that the constraint graphs associated with constant-gap QMA-hard instances of the local Hamiltonian problem had to satisfy “non-expansion” requirements seemingly at odds with the expansion properties of graphs associated with what are often considered the hardest instances of classical CSPs. Intuitively, their argument uses the monogamy of quantum correlations to argue that highly expanding constraint graphs place such strong demands on entanglement that there is always a product state whose energy is not far from the minimum. Although not strictly a no-go result, their theorem indicates that QMA-hard instances must be based on constraint graphs with markedly different spectral properties than those associated with the hardest instances of classical CSP.</p>
<p>For the time being it seems like any proof, or disproof, of the conjecture remains out of reach. Instead of focusing directly on qPCP, it may be more fruitful to develop the objects that are expected to play an important role in the proof, such as (quantum) low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) and (quantum) locally testable codes (qLTC). Two recent works make progress on this front.</p>
<h2><b>The NLETS conjecture</b></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1363">no low-energy trivial states (NLTS) conjecture</a> was proposed by Freedman and Hastings as a “complexity-free” analogue of CSP-qPCP. The NLTS conjecture states that there exist local Hamiltonians such that all low-energy (within an additive constant, times the norm of the Hamiltonian, from the minimum) states are “non-trivial”, in the sense that they cannot be generated by a constant-depth quantum circuit applied on a product state. Equivalently, all states that are the output of a constant-depth quantum circuit must have energy a constant above the minimum. NLTS Hamiltonian are good candidates for qPCP as they provide local Hamiltonian for which many obvious classical certificates for the minimal energy of the Hamiltonian (such as the description of a small circuit which generates a low-energy state) are essentially ruled out.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02082v2">earlier version</a> of the Eldar-Harrow manuscript claimed a construction of NLTS Hamiltonian, but the paper was recently updated, and the claim retracted. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02082v3">current manuscript</a> establishes a moderately weaker (though strictly incomparable) result, that the authors call NLETS, for “no low-<em>error</em> trivial states”. The main result of EH is a relatively simple, explicit construction of a family of local Hamiltonians that have no non-trivial “ground state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-impostor”. An <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-impostor is a state that has the same reduced density matrix as a ground state on a fraction <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%281-%5Cvarepsilon%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(1-\varepsilon)}" class="latex" title="{(1-\varepsilon)}" /> of the qubits, but may differ arbitrarily on the remaining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" /> fraction. Using that the Hamiltonian is local, impostors necessarily have low energy, but the converse is not true, so that NLETS rules out non-triviality for a more restricted class of states than NLTS. For that restricted class of states, however, the non-triviality established by EH is sronger than required by NLTS: they show that no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-impostor can even be well-approximated (within inverse-polynomial trace distance) by logarithmic-depth, instead of just constant-depth, quantum circuits.</p>
<p>Let’s see if I can give some basic intuition on their construction; for anything substantial see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02082">paper</a>, which gives many angles on the result. Consider first first a classical repetition code encoding <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{1}" class="latex" title="{1}" /> bit into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> bits. This can be made into a locally testable code by enforcing pairwise equality of bits along the edges of a constant-degree expanding graph on vertex set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{1,\ldots,n\}}" class="latex" title="{\{1,\ldots,n\}}" />. Now allow me a little leap of faith: imagine there existed a magic quantum analogue of this classical repetition code, where equality between pairs of qubits is enforced not only in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> (computational) basis, but also in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> (Hadamard) basis. Of course such a thing does not exist: the constraints would force <em>any</em> pair of qubits (linked by the expander) to form an EPR pair, a requirement that strongly violates monogamy. But let’s <em>imagine</em>. Then I claim that we would essentially be done. Why? We need two more observations.</p>
<p>The first key observation made by EH is that any ground state of this imaginary code would have the following property: if you measure all qubits of the state in the same basis, either <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />, then for at least one of the two possible choices the measurement outcomes will be distributed according to a distribution on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" />-bit strings that places a large (constant) weight on at least two well-isolated (separated by at least the minimum distance) subsets of the Hamming cube. Note that this does not hold of the classical repetition code: the distribution which all-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{0}" class="latex" title="{0}" /> codeword is, well, concentrated. But if we were to measure the associated quantum state <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C0%5Ccdots+0+%5Crangle+%5Csimeq+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D%28+%7C%2B%5Ccdots%2B%5Crangle%2B%7C-%5Ccdots-%5Crangle%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|0\cdots 0 \rangle \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( |+\cdots+\rangle+|-\cdots-\rangle)}" class="latex" title="{|0\cdots 0 \rangle \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( |+\cdots+\rangle+|-\cdots-\rangle)}" /> in the Hadamard basis, we would get a very spread distribution, with constant mass on two sets that are at distance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> apart (I realize the equation I wrote is not quite correct! Don’t think too hard about it; obviously my “magical quantum repetition code” does not exist). The reason the distribution obtained in at least one of the two bases must be spread out is due to the uncertainty principle: if the distribution is localized in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> basis it must be delocalized in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> basis, and vice-versa. And the reason it should be concentrated on isolated clumps is that we are measuring a codeword, which, for our magic example, can only lead to outcomes that are supported on the set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5C%7B%7C0%5Crangle%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D%2C%7C1%5Crangle%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D%2C%7C%2B%5Crangle%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D%2C%7C-%5Crangle%5E%7B%5Cotimes+n%7D%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\{|0\rangle^{\otimes n},|1\rangle^{\otimes n},|+\rangle^{\otimes n},|-\rangle^{\otimes n}\}}" class="latex" title="{\{|0\rangle^{\otimes n},|1\rangle^{\otimes n},|+\rangle^{\otimes n},|-\rangle^{\otimes n}\}}" />.</p>
<p>To conclude we need the second observation, which is that trivial states do <em>not</em> have this property: measuring a trivial state in any product basis will always lead to a highly expanding distribution, which in particular cannot have large mass on well-isolated subsets. This is obviously true for product states, and requires a bit of work to be carried through logarithmically many layers of a quantum circuit; indeed this is where the main technical work of the paper lies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the argument is complete…except for the fact that the required magic quantum repetition code does not exist! Instead, HE find a good make-do by employing a beautiful construction of quantum LDPC codes due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0566">Tillich and Zemor</a>, the “hypergraph product”. The hypergraph product takes as input any pair of classical linear codes and returns a quantum “product” CSS code whose locality, distance and rate properties can be related to those of the original codes. The toric code can be case as an example of a hypergraph product code; see Section 3 in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0566">paper</a> for explanations. Unfortunately, the way the distance of the product code scales with other parameters prevents TZ from obtaining good enough qLDPC for the CSP-QPCP; they can “only” obtain codes with constant weight and constant rate, but distance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" title="{O(\sqrt{n})}" />.</p>
<p>In the context of NL(E)TS, and even more so qPCP, however, distance may not be the most relevant parameter. EH’s main construction is obtained as the hypergraph product of two expander-based repetition codes, which as a code only has logarithmic distance; nevertheless they are able to show that the robustness derived from the repetition code, together with the logarithmic distance, are enough to separate <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-impostors from logarithmic-depth trivial states.</p>
<h2><b>Quantum LDPC &amp; LTC</b></h2>
<p>Quantum low-density parity-check codes (qLDPC) already made a showing in the previous sections. These families of codes are of much broader interest than their possible role in a forthcoming proof of qPCP, and constructions are being actively pursued. For classical codes the situation is largely satisfactory, and there are constructions that simultaneously achieve constant rate and linear distance with constant-weight parity checks. For quantum codes less is known. If we insist on constant-weight stabilizers then the best distance is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5COmega%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%5Clog%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+n%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log^{1/4} n)}" class="latex" title="{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log^{1/4} n)}" /> (e.g. <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a414975.pdf">Freedman et al.</a>), a notch above the TZ construction mentioned earlier. The most local construction that achieves linear distance requires stabilizers of weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" title="{O(\sqrt{n})}" /> (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0885">Bravyi and Hastings</a>).</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05089">paper</a> by Hastings makes progress on constructions of qLDPC – assuming a geometrical conjecture on the volume of certain surfaces defined from lattices in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+R%7D%5En%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{{\mathbb R}^n}" class="latex" title="{{\mathbb R}^n}" />. Assuming the conjecture, Hastings shows the existence of qLDPC with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E%7B1-%5Cvarepsilon%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n^{1-\varepsilon}}" class="latex" title="{n^{1-\varepsilon}}" /> distance and logarithmic-weight stabilizers, a marked improvement over the state of the art. Although as discussed earlier even linear-distance, constant-weight, qLDPC would not imply the CSP-qPCP nor NLTS (the resulting Hamiltonian may still have low-energy eigenstates that are not at a small distance from codewords), by analogy with the classical case (and basic intuition!), constructions of such objects should certainly facilitate any attempt at a proof of the conjectures. Moreover, qLDPC suffice for the weaker NLETS introduced by EH, as the latter only makes a statement about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvarepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\varepsilon}" class="latex" title="{\varepsilon}" />-impostors, i.e. states that are at a constant distance from codewords. To obtain the stronger implication to NLTS, the proper notion is that of local testability: errors should be detected by a fraction of parity checks proportional to the distance of the error from the closest codeword (and not just <em>some</em> parity check).</p>
<p>Hastings’ construction follows the topological approach to quantum error correcting codes pioneered by Freedman and Kitaev. Although the latter introduced codes whose properties depend on the surface they are embedded in, at best I could tell the formal connection between homology and error correction is made in a comprehensive <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0605094">paper</a> by Bombin and Martin-Delgado. The advantage of this approach is that properties of the code, including rate and distance, can be tied to geometric properties of the underlying homology, reducing the construction of good codes to that of manifolds with the right properties.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the (conjectural) construction of good qLDPC, almost as an afterthought Hastings provides an unconditional construction of a quantum locally testable code (qLTC), albeit one which encodes two qubits only. Let’s try to visualize this, starting from the helpful warm-up provided by Hastings, a high-dimensional, entangled, locally-testable code…which encodes zero qubit (the code space is one-dimensional). Of course this is trivial, but it’s a warm-up!</p>
<p>The simplest instance to visualize has six physical qubits. To follow the forthcoming paragraphs, take a piece of paper and draw a large tetrahedron. If you didn’t mess up your tetrahedron should have six edges: these are your qubits. Now the parity checks are as follows. Each of the four faces specifies an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />-stabilizer which acts <img src="https://i0.wp.com/i-want-to-study-engineering.org/figs/tetrahedron_volume.png" alt="Image result for tetrahedron" class=" alignright" />on the three edges forming the face. Each of the four vertices specifies a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />-stabilizer which acts on the three edges that touch the vertex. The resulting eight operators pairwise commute, and they specify a unique (entangled) state in the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{2^6}" class="latex" title="{2^6}" />-dimensional physical space.</p>
<p>Next we’d like to understand “local” testability. This means that if we fix a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" /> of edges, and act on each of them using an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> error, then the resulting operator should violate (anti-commute) with a fraction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />-stabilizers that is proportional to the <em>reduced</em> weight of the error, i.e. its distance to the closest operator which commutes with all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />-stabilizers. To see which stabilizers “detect” the error <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" />, we recall that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> which overlap at an even number of locations commute. Therefore a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> stabilizer will detect <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" /> if and only if it lies in its <em>boundary</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpartial+O%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\partial O}" class="latex" title="{\partial O}" />: the set of vertices which touch an odd number of edges in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" />. This is our syndrome; it has a certain cardinality. To conclude we need to argue that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O}" class="latex" title="{O}" /> can be modified into a set <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%2BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O+P}" class="latex" title="{O+P}" /> with no boundary, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cpartial%28O%2BP%29%3D%5Cemptyset%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\partial(O+P)=\emptyset}" class="latex" title="{\partial(O+P)=\emptyset}" />, and such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> is as small as possible – ideally, it should involve at most as many edges as the size of the boundary <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7C%5Cpartial+O%7C%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{|\partial O|}" class="latex" title="{|\partial O|}" />. Here is how Hastings does it: for each vertex in the boundary, introduce an edge that links it to some fixed vertex – say the top-most one in your tetrahedron. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{P}" class="latex" title="{P}" /> be the resulting set of edges. Then you can check (on the picture!) that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%2BP%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O+P}" class="latex" title="{O+P}" /> is boundary-less. Since we added at most as many edges as vertices in the boundary (if the top-most vertex was part of the boundary it doesn’t contribute any edge), we have proven local testability with respect to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" /> errors; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" /> errors are similar.</p>
<p>This was all in three dimensions. The wonderful thing is that the construction generalizes in a “straightforward” way to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{n}" class="latex" title="{n}" /> dimensions. Consider an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28n%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(n+1)}" class="latex" title="{(n+1)}" />-element universe <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%3D%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2Cn%2B1%5C%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U=\{1,\ldots,n+1\}}" class="latex" title="{U=\{1,\ldots,n+1\}}" />. Qubits are all subsets of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BU%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{U}" class="latex" title="{U}" /> of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%3D%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q=(n+1)/2}" class="latex" title="{q=(n+1)/2}" />; there are exponentially many of these. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BZ%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{Z}" class="latex" title="{Z}" />-stabilizers are defined for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28q-1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(q-1)}" class="latex" title="{(q-1)}" />-element subset; each acts on all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28q%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(q+1)}" class="latex" title="{(q+1)}" /> of its <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" />-element supersets. Symmetrically, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BX%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{X}" class="latex" title="{X}" />-stabilizers are defined for each <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28q%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(q+1)}" class="latex" title="{(q+1)}" />-element set; each acts on all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28q%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(q+1)}" class="latex" title="{(q+1)}" /> of its <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{q}" class="latex" title="{q}" />-element subsets. Thus the code is local: each stabilizer has weight <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28q%2B1%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{(q+1)}" class="latex" title="{(q+1)}" />, which is logarithmic in the number of qubits. It remains to check local testability; this follows using precisely the same argument as above (minus the picture…).</p>
<p>This first construction encodes zero qubits. How about getting a couple? Hastings gives a construction achieving this, and remains (poly-logarithmically) locally testable. The idea, very roughly, is to make a toric code by combining together two copies of the code described above. The number of encoded qubits will become non-trivial and local testability will remain. Unfortunately, just as for the toric code, the distance of the result code only scales as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{\sqrt{n}}" class="latex" title="{\sqrt{n}}" />. To construct his code Hastings uses a slightly different cellulation than the above-described one. I am not sure precisely why the change is needed, and I defer to the paper for more details. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00822">Leverrier, Tillich and Zemor</a> had earlier provided a construction, based on the TZ hypergraph product, with linear rate, square root distance, and local testability up to the minimal distance, i.e. for all errors of reduced weight at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0" alt="{O(\sqrt{n})}" class="latex" title="{O(\sqrt{n})}" />.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the geometric picture takes some effort to grasp, I find these constructions fascinating. Given the Brandao-Harrow objections to using the most “straighforward” expander constructions to achieve CSP-qPCP, or even NLTS, it seems logical to start looking for combinatorial structures that have more subtle properties and lie at the delicate boundary where both robustness (in terms of testability) and entanglement (non-triviality of ground states) can co-exist without challenging monogamy.</p></div>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-cryptography-caltechx-delftx-qucryptox">EdX/Delft/Caltech course on quantum cryptography</a> officially ended on Dec. 20th, and is now archived (all material should remain available in the foreseeable future; we will also prepare a self-contained version of the lecture notes). At Caltech, the “flipped classroom” ended a couple weeks earlier; by now all grades are in and the students may even be beginning to recover. <strong>How did it go?</strong></p>
<h2>1. In the classroom</h2>
<p>Fifteen Caltech students, with a roughly equal mix of physics/CS/EE backgrounds, followed the course till the end (we started at ~20). We had a great time, but integration with the online course proved more challenging than I anticipated. Let me say why, in the hope that my experience could be useful to others (including myself, if I repeat the course).</p>
<p>The EdX content was released in 10 weekly updates, on Tuesdays. Since on-campus classes took place Tuesdays and Thursdays, I asked Caltech students to review the material (videos+lecture notes+quizzes) made available online on a given Tuesday by the following Tuesday’s class. I would then be able to structure the class under the assumption that the students had at least some minimal familiarity with the weeks’ concepts. This would allow for a more relaxed, “conversational” mode: I would be able to react to difficulties encountered by the students, and engage them in the exploration of more advanced topics. That was the theory. Some of it worked out, but not quite as well as I had hoped, and this for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>There was a large discrepancy in the students’ level of preparation</strong>. Some had gone through lecture notes in detail, watched all videos, and completed all quizzes. Although some aspects of the week’s material might still puzzle them, they had a good understanding of the basics. But other students had barely pulled up the website, so that they didn’t even really know what topics were covered in a given week. This meant that, if I worked under the assumption that students already had a reasonable grasp of the material, I would loose half the class; whereas if I assumed they had not seen it at all I would put half the class to sleep. As an attempted remedy I enforced some minimal familiarity with the online content by requiring that weekly EdX quizzes be turned in each Tuesday before class. But these quizzes were not hard, and the students could (and did) get away with a very quick scan through the material.</li>
<li>As all students, but, I hear, even more so here, <strong>Caltech undergraduates generally (i) do not show up in class, and (ii) if per chance they happen to land in the right classroom, they certainly won’t participate</strong>. In an attempt to <em>encourage </em>attendance  I made homeworks due right before the Tuesday 10:30am class, the idea being that students would probably turn in homeworks at the last minute, but then they would at least be ready for class. Bad idea: as a result, students ended up spending the night on the homework, dropping it off at 10:29:59… only to skip class so as to catch up on sleep!Slightly over half of the registered students attended any given class, a small group of 8-10 on average. This made it harder to keep participation up. On the whole it still went pretty well, and with a little patience, and insistence, I think I eventually managed to instore a reasonably relaxed atmosphere, where students would naturally raise questions, submit suggestions, etc. But we did not reach the stage of all-out participation I had envisioned.</li>
<li><strong>The material was not easy</strong>. This is partially a result of my inexperience in teaching quantum information; as all bad teachers do I had under-estimated the effort it takes to learn the basis of kets, bras and other “elementary” manipulations, especially when one has but an introductory course in undergraduate linear algebra as background. Given this, I am truly amazed that the 15 students actually survived the class; they had to put in <em>a lot</em> of work. Lucky for me there are bright undergraduates around!We ended the course with projects, on which the students did amazingly well. In groups of 2-3 they read one or more papers in quantum cryptography, all on fairly advanced topics we had not covered in class (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9810068">relativistic bit commitment</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09717">quantum homomorphic encryption</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01383">quantum bitcoin</a>, and more!), wrote up a short survey paper outlining some criticisms and ideas they had about what they had read, and gave an invariably excellent course presentation. From my perspective, this was certainly a highlight of the course.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given these observations on what went wrong (or at least sub-optimally), here are a few thoughts on how the course could be improved, mostly for my own benefit (I hope to put some of these to good practice in a year or two!). This should be obvious, but: <strong>the main hurdle in designing a “flipped classroom” is to figure out how to work with the online content</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First there is a scheduling difficulty. Some students complained that by having to go through the weekly videos and lecture notes <em>prior</em> to the discussion of the material in class they simultaneously had to face two weeks’ worth of content at any given time. Scheduling of online material was decided based on other constraints, and turned out to be highly sub-optimal: each week was released on a Tuesday, which was also the first day of class, so that it was unreasonable to ask the students to review the material before that week’s classes….pushing it to the next week, and resulting in the aforementioned overlap. A much better schedule would have been to e.g. release material online on Friday, and then have class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This would have led to a larger overlap and less schizophrenia.</li>
<li>Then comes the problem of “complementarity”. What can be done in class that does not replicate, but instead enriches, then online material? This is made all the more difficult by the inevitable heterogeneity in the student’s preparation. An effort has to be made to limit this by finding ways to enforce the student’s learning of the material. For instance, each class could be kick-started by a small presentation by one of the students, based on one of the online problems, or even by re-explaining (or, explaining better!) one of the week’s more challenging videos. This should be made in a way that the students find it valuable, both for the presenter and the listeners; I don’t want the outcome to be that no one shows up for class.</li>
<li>Student-led discussions usually work best. They love to expose their ideas to each other, and improve upon them. This forces them to be active, and creative. The best moments in the class where when the discussion really picked up and the students bounced suggestions off each other. The existence of the online material should facilitate this, by giving a common basis on which to base the discussion. My approach this time wasn’t optimal, but based on the experience I think it is possible to do something truly engaging. But it won’t work by itself; one really has to design incentive-based schemes to get the process going.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Online</h2>
<p>Success of the online course is rather hard to judge. At the end of the course there were about 8000 officially registered students. Of these, EdX identified ~500 as “active learners” over the last few weeks (dropping from ~1500 over the first few weeks, as is to be expected). I think an active learner is roughly someone who has at least watched some parts of a video, answered a quizz or problem, participated in a forum, etc.<br />
About 100 students pursued an official certificate, which means that they paid ~50$ to have their success in the course officially registered. I couldn’t figure out how many students have actually “passed” the class, but I expect the number to be around 200: most of the certified students plus a few others who didn’t want to pay for the certificate but still turned in most homeworks. This is a fair number for a challenging specialized course, I am pretty happy with it. The high initial enrollment numbers, together with anecdotal evidence from people who got in touch directly, indicate that there certainly is demand for the topic.  The most active students in the course definitely “wanted in”, and we had lots of good questions on the forum. And, many, many typos were fixed!</p>
<p>How satisfied were the students with the course? We ran an “exit survey”, but I don’t have the results yet; I can write about them later (hoping that a significant enough number of students bother to fill in the survey). We also had  pre- and mid-course survey. Some of the more interesting questions had to do with how students learn. In my opinion this is the main challenge in designing a MOOC: how to make it <em>useful</em>? Will the students learn anything by watching videos? Anecdotal evidence (but also serious research, I hear) suggests not. Reading the lecture notes? Maybe, but that requires time and dedication – basically, to be an assiduous learner already. Just as “in-the-classroom” learning, it is the problem-solving that students are brought to engage in that can make a difference. Students like to be challenged; they need to be given an active role. In the mid-course survey many of the positive comments had to do with “Julia lab” assignments that were part of the course, and for which the students had to do some simple coding that let them  experiment with properties of qubits, incompatible measurements, etc. In the pre-course survey students also indicated a marked preference for learning via solving problems rather than by watching videos.</p>
<p>So<strong> a good online MOOC should be one that actively engages the student’s problem-solving skills</strong>. But this is not easy! Much harder than recording a video in front of a tablet &amp; webcam. Even though I was repeatedly told about it before-hand, I learned the lesson the hard way: homework questions have to be vetted <em>very thoroughly.</em> There is no end to a student’s creativity in misinterpreting a statement – let alone 1000 students’. Multiple-choice questions may sound straightforward, but they’re not: one has to be very careful that there is exactly one straight correct answer, while at the same time not making it too obvious which is that answer; when one has a solution in mind it is easy not to realize that other proposed supposedly wrong solutions could in fact be interpreted as correct. The topic of cryptography makes this particularly tricky: we want the students to reason, be creative, devise attacks, but the multiple-choice limits us in this ability. Luckily we had a very dedicated, and creative, team of TAs, both in Delft and In Caltech, and by working together they compiled quite a nice set of problems; I hope they get used and re-used.</p>
<h2>3. Conclusions</h2>
<p>It’s too early (or too late) for conclusions. This was a first, and I hope there’ll be a second. The medium is a challenge, but it’s worth reaching out: we teach elite topics to elite students at elite institutions, but so many more have the drive, interest, and ability to learn the material that it would be irresponsible to leave them out. MOOCs may not be the best way to expand the reach of our work, but it is one way…to be improved!</p>
<p>It was certainly a lot of fun. I owe <strong>a huge thank you to all the students</strong>, in the classroom and online, who suffered through the course. I hope you learned a lot! Second in line were <strong>the TAs</strong>, at Caltech as well as Delft, who did impressive work, coping simultaneously with the heavy online and offline duties. They came up with a great set of resources. Last but not least, behind the scenes, the <strong>video production</strong> and <strong>online learning teams</strong>, from Delt and Caltech, without whose support none of this would have been made possible. Thanks!</p></div>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/quantum-cryptography-caltechx-delftx-qucryptox">course on quantum cryptography</a> will soon enter its third week of instruction (out of ten weeks planned). My parallel “in-class” course at Caltech has already gone through four weeks of lectures. How is it going so far?</p>
<p>There are many possible measures against which to evaluate the experience. An easy one is raw numbers. Online there are a bit over 7,200 students enrolled. But how many are “active”? The statistics tools provided by EdX report 1995 “active” students last week – under what definition of “active”? EdX also reports that 1003 students “watched a video”, and 861 “tried a problem”. What is an active student who neither watched a video nor tried a problem – they clicked on a link? In any case, the proportion seems high; from what I heard a typical experience is that about 2-5% of registered students will complete any given online course. Out of 7,000, this would bring the number of active students by the end of the course at at a couple hundred, a number I would certainly consider a marked success, given the specialized topic and technically challenging material.</p>
<p>At Caltech there are 20 students enrolled in CS/Phys 120. Given the size of our undergraduate population I also consider this to be a rather high number (but the hard drop deadline has not passed yet!). It’s always a pleasure to see our undergraduate’s eagerness to dive into any exciting topic of research that is brought to their attention. I don’t know the enrollment for TU Delft, but they have a large program in quantum information so the numbers are probably at least twice as high.</p>
<p>Numbers are numbers. How about enthusiasm? You saw the word cloud we collected in Week 0. Here is one from Week 2 (“What does “entanglement” evoke in you right now?”; spot the “love” and “love story”; unfortunately only 1% of responses for either!). <img width="440" alt="word2" src="https://mycqstate.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/word2.jpg?w=440&amp;h=455" class="  wp-image-882 alignright" height="455" />Some of the students speak up when prompted for simple feedback such as this, but the vast majority remain otherwise silent, so that involvement is hard to measure. We do have a few rather active participants in the discussion forums, and it’s been a pleasure to read and try to answer their creative questions each day – dear online learners, if you read this, thanks for your extremely valuable comments and feedback, which help make the course better for everyone! It’s amazing how even as we were learning qubits some rather insightful questions, and objections, were raised. It’s clear that people are coming to the course from a huge range of backgrounds, prompting the most unexpected reactions.</p>
<p>A similar challenge arises in the classroom. Students range from the freshmen with no background in quantum information (obviously), nor in quantum mechanics or computer science, to more advanced seniors (who form the bulk of the class) to graduate students in Caltech’s Institute for Quantum Information and Matter (IQIM). How to capture everyone’s attention, interest, imagination? The topic of cryptography helps -there is so much to be fascinated with. I started the course by discussing the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_money">quantum money</a>, which has the advantage of easily capturing one’s imagination, and for which there is a simple quantum scheme with a clear advantage over classical (cherry on top, the scheme is based on the famous “BB84 states” that will play a major role in the class via their use for quantum key distribution). So newcomers to quantum information could learn about qubits, kets and bras, while others could fend off their impatience by imagining new schemes for public-coin quantum money.</p>
<p>This is not an easy line to thread however, and given the composition of the class I eventually decided to err on the side of caution. Don’t repeat it, but this is my first time even teaching a full class on quantum information, and the basic concepts, not to mention the formalism, can be quite tricky to pick up. So we’re going to take it slow, and we’ll see how far we get. My hope is that the “flipped classroom” format should help needy but motivated students keep afloat by making all the online material available before it is discussed in class. Since the online course has only been going on for a couple weeks I can’t yet report on how well this will work out; my initial impression is that it is not given that the in-class students actually do spend enough time with the online material. I am yet to find the proper way to incentivize this: quizzes? rewards? The best reward should be that they manage to follow the course <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>In the coming weeks we’ll start making our way towards quantum key distribution and its analysis. Entanglement, measuring uncertainty, privacy amplification, BB84 and Eckert, and device independence. Quite a program, and it’s certainly nice to attempt it in such pleasant company!</p></div>
