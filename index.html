<div class="content">
In this note, we show the mixing of three-term progressions $(x, xg, xg^2)$ in every finite quasirandom group, fully answering a question of Gowers. More precisely, we show that for any $D$-quasirandom group $G$ and any three sets $A_1, A_2, A_3 \subset G$, we have
\[ \left|\Pr_{x,y\sim G}\left[ x \in A_1, xy \in A_2, xy^2 \in A_3\right] - \prod_{i=1}^3 \Pr_{x\sim G}\left[x \in A_i\right] \right| \leq \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{D}}\right)^{\frac14}.\] 
Prior to this, Tao answered this question when the underlying quasirandom group is $\mathrm{SL}_{d}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Subsequently, Peluse extended the result to all nonabelian finite simple groups. In this work, we show that a slight modification of Peluse's argument is sufficient to fully resolve Gower's quasirandom conjecture for 3-term progressions. Surprisingly, unlike the proofs of Tao and Peluse, our proof is elementary and only uses basic facts from nonabelian Fourier analysis.</div>

There is a sense of tangible joy among the participants just to be sharing the same physical space, let alone the fantastic environs of the Institute. The renewed energy is all there to witness in the programs this semester on <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/si2021"><u>Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference</u></a> (CCSI) and <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/gmos2021"><u>Geometric Methods in Optimization and Sampling</u></a> (GMOS), both of which are now in full swing. Although masking is maintained, it doesn’t seem to change the quintessential Simons program experience even a little bit. I am referring, of course, to the constant feeling of missing out on all the incredibly interesting activities going on, much of which one is unable to fit into their schedule.</p>



<p>At least some of the palpable energy can be attributed to over 40 postdocs and research fellows who have arrived at the Institute this semester, many of whom will stay on for a year or two. This extraordinary group of young researchers covers the whole gamut of topics, ranging from cryptography, quantum computing, and fairness to machine learning, data structures, algorithms, and complexity theory. Each of these postdocs and fellows gave a 10-minute presentation at the “Meet the Fellows’’ welcome event that the Institute held on September 8 and 9. Check out their <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/events/meet-fellows-welcome-event-wednesday-schedule"><u>talks</u></a> for glimpses of the cutting edge in all these subfields of theory.</p>



<p><strong>An advance in algebraic circuit complexity</strong><br />
	This time around, there is some good news from the front lines on circuit complexity, one of the most challenging arenas within theoretical computer science.</p>



<p>An algebraic circuit consists of gates, each of which carries out either addition or multiplication over some field, say real numbers. The depth of the circuit is the length of the longest path from the output to one of its inputs. Naturally, an algebraic circuit computes a polynomial over its inputs.</p>



<p>In the world of Boolean circuits with AND/OR/NOT gates, lower bounds against constant depth circuits, aka AC0 circuit lower bounds, have been known since the 1980s and are one of the most influential results in complexity theory. For general algebraic circuits over a large field (say reals), even superpolynomial lower bounds for depth three circuits had remained elusive. In a <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2021/081/">remarkable paper</a>, Nutan Limaye, Srikanth Srinivasan, and Sébastien Tavenas have obtained the first superpolynomial lower bounds against general algebraic circuits of all constant depths over fields of characteristic zero (say reals). Furthermore, the lower-bound result is shown for a simple polynomial known as “iterated matrix multiplication” whose input consists of \(d\) matrices \(X_1,\ldots,X_d\) of dimension \(n \times n\), and the goal is to compute a fixed entry of their product \(X_1 \cdot X_2 \cdots X_d\). The same work also obtains a depth hierarchy theorem for algebraic circuits showing that for every depth <em>D</em>, there is an explicit polynomial that can be computed by a depth <em>D</em> circuit of size <em>s</em>, but requires circuits of size superpolynomial in <em>s</em> if the depth is <em>D</em>-1.</p>



<p><strong>Remarkable work of Matthew Brennan</strong><br /> The theory community suffered a terrible loss this year with the tragic and untimely passing of one of our rising stars, Matthew Brennan. While still a graduate student at MIT, Matthew almost single-handedly pushed forward an ambitious research program at the intersection of computational complexity and statistics. Here we will try to give a glimpse of Matthew’s extensive body of research.</p>



<span id="more-595"></span>



<p></p>



<p>To set the context, traditionally the field of computational complexity has been concerned with characterizing how much memory or computational power is needed, while statistics sheds light on how much data are needed. The interplay between computational and statistical resources and their underlying trade-offs is only recently coming into focus.</p>



<p>Many statistical estimation tasks exhibit information-computation gaps wherein the accuracy obtained by efficient algorithms is strictly worse than the estimate that one could in principle extract from the data if there were no computational limitations. In other problems, there is an apparent trade-off between the number of samples needed for an estimation task and the computational power of the estimation algorithm.</p>



<p>Identifying and rigorously establishing the presence of these information-computation trade-offs is a fundamental challenge that has drawn much interest in theoretical computer science and statistics. To rigorously establish an information-computation gap, one would need to prove lower bounds against efficient algorithms for statistical estimation problems.</p>



<p>Here on, there are two routes that one could take. First, one can prove limitations for specific classes of algorithms like MCMC, spectral methods, semidefinite programming, statistical queries, and so on. This approach has been highly successful, yielding precise lower bounds in many models and numerous relations discovered between the models.</p>



<p>Alternatively, one can take the grander route: assume the intractability of a well-studied computational problem and use <em>reductions</em> to establish hardness of the statistical estimation problem at hand. In a seminal work, Berthet and Rigollet showed a reduction from the planted clique problem to the sparse principal component analysis (sparse PCA), thereby establishing the presence of an information-computation gap for a version of sparse PCA.</p>



<p>In its most canonical setup, the input to the sparse PCA problem consists of samples from a \(d\)-dimensional Gaussian with covariance \(\Sigma = I_d + \theta vv^T\), where \(v\) is a \(k\)-sparse unit vector and \(\theta\) denotes the signal strength. A simple hypothesis testing variant of the problem asks to distinguish \(n\) samples drawn from this spiked covariance matrix and \(n\) samples drawn from the standard Gaussian distribution.</p>



<p>Notice that statistical estimation problems like sparse PCA are most interesting when their inputs are drawn from some natural distribution like the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, a reduction from a hard problem <em>A</em> to a statistical estimation problem <em>B</em> will not only have to map instances of <em>A</em> to instances of <em>B</em>, but also have to produce the right distribution over instances of <em>B</em>. For example, ideally a reduction from planted clique to sparse PCA must map instances of planted clique (random graphs with cliques) to random vectors drawn from an appropriate Gaussian measure. How could a reduction ever do this, one might ask.</p>



<p>In fact, this is why one might decide not to take the grand route of using reductions to understand the complexity of statistical problems. While reductions have been exceptionally successful in establishing tight hardness results for <em>NP</em>-complete optimization problems, building a similar web of reductions for statistical problems like sparse PCA seemed hopeless to me. Not for Matthew, who courageously took this challenge head-on and succeeded!</p>



<p>Despite efforts following the seminal work of Berthet and Rigollet, showing a tight hardness result for sparse PCA in its most canonical Gaussian setup seemed out of reach. In a series of works, Matthew and coauthors developed a set of simple reduction tools that when put together led to a tight characterization of the complexity of the sparse PCA problem in its most canonical setup, over the entire range of parameters!</p>



<p>More recently, Matthew and his advisor, Guy Bresler, proposed a generalized planted clique conjecture referred to as “secret leakage planted clique” that can serve as a starting point for a web of reductions encompassing a variety of problems such as tensor PCA, robust sparse mean estimation, and semirandom community recovery. Not only have these works developed a set of useful reduction techniques for statistical problems, but most importantly, they have demonstrated that reductions can indeed be harnessed toward tight hardness results for statistical problems. Matthew was a recipient of the best student paper award at the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) on two separate occasions for this line of work.</p>



<p>Matthew’s work is one of the central themes of this semester’s program on Computational Complexity of Statistical Inference. His work has laid the foundations of a theory of reductions for statistical problems, something for us to build on over the coming years. While his ideas are ever present this semester, his presence at the program is sorely missed.</p></div>

problem: the goal is to scale the rows and columns of a given non-negative
matrix such that the rescaled matrix has prescribed row and column sums.
Motivated by recent results on first-order quantum algorithms for matrix
scaling, we investigate the possibilities for quantum speedups for classical
second-order algorithms, which comprise the state-of-the-art in the classical
setting.
</p>
<p>We first show that there can be essentially no quantum speedup in terms of
the input size in the high-precision regime: any quantum algorithm that solves
the matrix scaling problem for $n \times n$ matrices with at most $m$ non-zero
entries and with $\ell_2$-error $\varepsilon=\widetilde\Theta(1/m)$ must make
$\widetilde\Omega(m)$ queries to the matrix, even when the success probability
is exponentially small in $n$. Additionally, we show that for
$\varepsilon\in[1/n,1/2]$, any quantum algorithm capable of producing
$\frac{\varepsilon}{100}$-$\ell_1$-approximations of the row-sum vector of a
(dense) normalized matrix uses $\Omega(n/\varepsilon)$ queries, and that there
exists a constant $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$ for which this problem takes
$\Omega(n^{1.5})$ queries.
</p>
<p>To complement these results we give improved quantum algorithms in the
low-precision regime: with quantum graph sparsification and amplitude
estimation, a box-constrained Newton method can be sped up in the
large-$\varepsilon$ regime, and outperforms previous quantum algorithms. For
entrywise-positive matrices, we find an $\varepsilon$-$\ell_1$-scaling in time
$\widetilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^2)$, whereas the best previously known bounds
were $\widetilde O(n^2\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$ (classical) and
$\widetilde O(n^{1.5}/\varepsilon^3)$ (quantum).

influential individuals (a.k.a \emph{seeds}) to help promote some products or
ideas through an online social networks. There are two major players in the
social advertising ecosystem: advertiser and platform. The platform sells viral
engagements such as "like"s to advertisers by inserting their ads into the feed
of seeds. These seeds receive monetary incentives from the platform in exchange
for their participation in the social advertising campaign. Once an ad is
engaged by a follower of some seed, the platform receives a fixed amount of
payment, called cost per engagement, from the advertiser. The ad could
potentially attract more engagements from followers' followers and trigger a
viral contagion. At the beginning of a campaign, the advertiser submits a
budget to the platform and this budget can be used for two purposes: recruiting
seeds and paying for the viral engagements generated by the seeds. Note that
the first part of payment goes to the seeds and the latter one is the actual
revenue collected by the platform. In this setting, the problem for the
platform is to recruit a group of seeds such that she can collect the largest
possible amount of revenue subject to the budget constraint. We formulate this
problem as a seed selection problem whose objective function is non-monotone
and it might take on negative values, making existing results on submodular
optimization and influence maximization not applicable to our setting. We study
this problem under both non-adaptive and adaptive settings. Although we focus
on social advertising in this paper, our results apply to any optimization
problems whose objective function is the expectation of the minimum of a
stochastic submodular function and a linear function.

mechanisms that self-optimize in a demand-aware manner. At the heart of our
approach lies a self-adjusting linear list data structure, where unlike in the
classic data structure, there are dependencies, and some items must be in front
of the others; for example, to correctly classify packets by rules arranged in
a linked list, each rule must be in front of lower priority rules that overlap
with it. After each access we can rearrange the list, similarly to
Move-To-Front, but dependencies need to be respected.
</p>
<p>We present a 4-competitive online rearrangement algorithm, whose cost is at
most four times worse than the optimal offline algorithm; no deterministic
algorithm can be better than 3-competitive. The algorithm is simple and
attractive, especially for memory-limited systems, as it does not require any
additional memory (e.g., neither timestamps nor frequency statistics). Our
approach can simply be deployed as a drop-in replacement for a static
datastructure, potentially benefitting many existing networks.
</p>
<p>We evaluate our self-adjusting list packet classifier on realistic ruleset
and traffic instances. We find that our classifier performs similarly to a
static list for low-locality traffic, but significantly outperforms Efficuts
(by a factor 7x), CutSplit (3.6x), and the static list (14x) for high locality
and small rulesets. Memory consumption is 10x lower on average compared to
Efficuts and CutSplit.

and consider the setting where any agent is allowed to introduce diversity
constraints on the items they are allocated. We motivate this via settings
where the items themselves correspond to user ad slots or task workers with
attributes such as race and gender on which the principal seeks to achieve
demographic parity. We consider the following question: When an agent expresses
diversity constraints into an allocation rule, is the allocation of other
agents hurt significantly? If this happens, the cost of introducing such
constraints is disproportionately borne by agents who do not benefit from
diversity. We codify this via two desiderata capturing robustness. These are no
negative externality -- other agents are not hurt -- and monotonicity -- the
agent enforcing the constraint does not see a large increase in value. We show
in a formal sense that the Nash Welfare rule that maximizes product of agent
values is uniquely positioned to be robust when diversity constraints are
introduced, while almost all other natural allocation rules fail this
criterion. We also show that the guarantees achieved by Nash Welfare are nearly
optimal within a widely studied class of allocation rules. We finally perform
an empirical simulation on real-world data that models ad allocations to show
that this gap between Nash Welfare and other rules persists in the wild.

two edges have at most one common point which can be a common vertex or a
crossing. Our main result is that there is a polynomial time algorithm to
compute an 8-approximation of the bundled crossing number of a good drawing (up
to adding a term depending on the facial structure of the drawing). In the
special case of circular drawings the approximation factor is 8 (no extra
term), this improves upon the 10-approximation of Fink et al. (Bundled
crossings in embedded graphs, Proc. Latin'16). Our approach also works with the
same approximation factor for families of pseudosegments, i.e., curves
intersecting at most once. We also show how to compute a 9/2-approximation when
the intersection graph of the pseudosegments is bipartite.

question in this line of work.
</p>
<p>We settle this fundamental question by proving that there is no deterministic
single-pass semi-streaming algorithm that given a graph $G$ with maximum degree
$\Delta$, can output a proper coloring of $G$ using any number of colors which
is sub-exponential in $\Delta$. Our proof is based on analyzing the multi-party
communication complexity of a related communication game, using random graph
theory type arguments that may be of independent interest.
</p>
<p>We complement our lower bound by showing that just one extra pass over the
input allows one to recover an $O(\Delta^2)$ coloring via a deterministic
semi-streaming algorithm. This result is further extended to an $O(\Delta)$
coloring in $O(\log{\Delta})$ passes even in dynamic streams.

pattern graph in a host graph. The recent progress on this problem has not
included complete pattern graphs, i.e., cliques (and their complements, i.e.,
edge-free pattern graphs, in the induced setting). The fastest algorithms for
the aforementioned patterns are based on a straightforward reduction to
triangle detection/counting. We provide an alternative method of
detection/counting copies of fixed size cliques based on a multi-dimensional
matrix product. It is at least as time efficient as the triangle method in
cases of $K_4$ and $K_5.$ The complexity of the multi-dimensional matrix
product is of interest in its own rights. We provide also another alternative
method for detection/counting $K_r$ copies, again time efficient for $r\in \{
4,\ 5 \}$.

$\subseteq$ $\oplus$P (and thus that FewP $\subseteq$ $\oplus$P). In this
paper, we note that there is a tension between the nondeterministic ambiguity
of the class one is seeking to capture, and the density (or, to be more
precise, the needed "nongappy"-ness) of the easy-to-find "targets" used in
iterative constant-setting. In particular, we show that even less restrictive
gap-size upper bounds regarding the targets allow one to capture
ambiguity-limited classes. Through a flexible, metatheorem-based approach, we
do so for a wide range of classes including the logarithmic-ambiguity version
of Valiant's unambiguous nondeterminism class UP. Our work lowers the bar for
what advances regarding the existence of infinite, P-printable sets of primes
would suffice to show that restricted counting classes based on the primes have
the power to accept superconstant-ambiguity analogues of UP. As an application
of our work, we prove that the Lenstra-Pomerance-Wagstaff Conjecture implies
that all O(loglogn)-ambiguity NP sets are in the restricted counting class $\rm
RC_{PRIMES}$.

decompositional parameters such as treewidth or clique-width have so far
traditionally been tailored to specific width parameters. Moreover, for
mim-width, no efficient algorithms for computing good decompositions were
known, even under highly restrictive parameterizations. In this work we
identify F-branchwidth as a class of generic decompositional parameters that
can capture mim-width, treewidth, clique-width as well as other measures. We
show that while there is an infinite number of F-branchwidth parameters, only a
handful of these are asymptotically distinct. We then develop fixed-parameter
and kernelization algorithms (under several structural parameterizations) that
can compute every possible F-branchwidth, providing a unifying framework that
can efficiently obtain near-optimal tree-decompositions, k-expressions, as well
as optimal mim-width decompositions.

<p>If you have Netflix and interested in the academic world, I recommend <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81206259">The Chair</a>, a six-episode dramatic series starring Sandra Oh as a new English department chair at a "lower tier ivy league university". The series takes many artistic liberties and compresses much in a short time period but gets much about academics right such as the tension between faculty and the administration with the chair caught in the middle, the need to create majors that attract students, faculty past their prime teaching the same courses in the same way for decades, faculty who get themselves in a hole and keep digging, alumni donors controlling academic decisions, pressure to build a diverse faculty, faculty feeling under appreciated and getting outside offers, and a wonderful exposition of how the field has changed over the past thirty years given to someone who had dropped out before finishing their PhD to take on a different career.</p><p>When I served as department chair at Georgia Tech, I dealt with most if not all of these issues above, though not at the same time. I had some challenges that today's English department doesn't face: how to handle enrollments that more than doubled while barely able to hire more faculty than were departing, not that I would trade in a second for the existential crisis that English departments are going through. </p><p>When I left Georgia Tech after seven years, I had outlasted every other current chair in the Colleges of Computing, Science and Engineering. Not sure what this says about me or about Georgia Tech.</p><p>Being chair is the most challenging job in academia. The faculty technically report to you but you aren't their boss in any traditional sense--they came to academia because of the freedom to work on what they want and they won't give it up. It's virtually impossible to fire anyone with tenure. The joke goes that a chair needs two umbrellas, one to block stuff coming from the administration going to the faculty and the other to block the stuff from the faculty from going to the administration. Since I left it has gotten much uglier in the University System of Georgia which has no mask or vaccine mandates and glad I'm not the chair to deal with that.</p><p>This all sounds like I'm discouraging of becoming a department chair and it certainly isn't a job for anyone but it can be a very rewarding job. You can help shape the future of the department by the faculty you hire and the vision you set and create an environment that helps your faculty and students succeed. </p></div>

Multi-Paxos is the de facto solution for deciding a log of commands to execute on a replicated state machine, yet it’s famously difficult to understand, motivating the switch to ‘simpler’ consensus protocols such as Raft.

Maryna Viazovska was the first person to prove an exact bound on sphere packing in a dimension higher than 3. She <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.04246.pdf">achieved</a> this for dimension 8 in 2016 by making an improvement of <b>0.00001</b> over one previous <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/annals-v157-n2-p09.pdf">paper</a> by Henry Cohn and Noam Elkies. This also led to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06518.pdf">solution</a> in dimension 24, joint with Cohn and Abhinav Kumar, Stephen Miller, and Danylo Radchenko.</p>
<p>
Today we talk about partial progress—baby steps—and its relation to solving conjectures.</p>
<p>
This post is a continuation of our recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">thoughts</a> about how those who claim to have solved a major problem almost always claim to have solved the whole thing in one large leap. We’ve thought about declaring a rule that any claim on a major open problem, at least about complexity lower bounds, must first be a <em>partial result</em>. We will give concrete suggestions in that direction at the end. But on reflection, we’ll curb the dogmatics a little.</p>
<p>
In her 2016 <em>Quanta</em> <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/sphere-packing-solved-in-higher-dimensions-20160330">article</a> on Viazovska’s breakthrough, Erica Klarreich quotes Peter Sarnak:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> “It’s stunningly simple, as all great things are. You just start reading the paper and you know this is correct.” </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
We hasten to add that the paper’s correctness is evident amid the context that others had established over the previous two decades, going back at least to Thomas Hales’s voluminous proof of Johannes Kepler’s conjecture for dimension 3. To quote Klarreich:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Researchers have known for more than a decade what the missing ingredient in the proof [of optimality for dimensions 8 and 24] should be—an “auxiliary” function that can calculate the largest allowable sphere density—but they couldn’t find the right function. … [F]inding the right modular form allowed Viazovska to prove [the case of 8] in a mere 23 pages. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Thus Viazovska brought in a new tool to the problem, <em>modular forms</em>, which had already proved their merit in resolving the Fermat conjecture. But she still needed to choose the right modular form among many candidates. Klarreich quotes her as saying it is difficult even just to explain how she knew which one to use. This brings us back to the challenge of explaining—or debunking—the flash of insight that claimers claim to have. At least in this case, per Sarnak’s quote, the proof was in the pudding.</p>

<p>
To complete the mixing of our original message, the examples we chose happen to involve improvements by tiny amounts. We’ve even understated Viazovska’s above: reckoned against a later <a href="https://annals.math.princeton.edu/2009/170-3/p01">paper</a> by Cohn and Elkies, her improvement was </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++0.000000000000000000000000000001.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  0.000000000000000000000000000001. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/10/26/a-vast-and-tiny-breakthrough/">post</a> where we discussed the phrase “the proof is in the pudding” involves a number with six more <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />s than that. These are <b>not</b> what we mean by “baby steps.” But let us tell our next story, which also involves Cohn.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Steps Toward Matrix Multiplication </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/11/29/a-breakthrough-on-matrix-product/">covered</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/12/03/the-meaning-of-omega/">other</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/02/01/a-brief-history-of-matrix-product/">work</a> on the exponent <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" /> of matrix product. This means the infimum of all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Be%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{e}" class="latex" /> such that any two <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn+%5Ctimes+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n \times n}" class="latex" /> matrices can be multiplied in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BO%28n%5Ee%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{O(n^e)}" class="latex" /> unit operations. In 1990, Don Coppersmith and Shmuel Winograd <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717108800132">brought</a> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" /> down below <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.375477%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2.375477}" class="latex" />. The current best bound <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega+%3C+2.37286%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega &lt; 2.37286}" class="latex" /> is from a SODA 2021 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05846">paper</a> by Josh Alman and Virginia Williams; its abstract highlights the improvement by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.00001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.00001}" class="latex" /> from the previous best.</p>
<p>
In 2005, however, Cohn wrote a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0511460.pdf">paper</a> with Robert Kleinberg, Balazs Szegedy, and Christopher Umans on ideas for taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega}" class="latex" /> all the way down to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> in one jump. This diverges from both the reading of “baby step” as “tiny improvement” and our idea meaning limited-but-definite partial progress. Their strategy for the full jump has come in and out of clouds since then. But their paper has motivated the subsequent partial progress in several ways. We have <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/03/27/fast-matrix-products-and-other-amazing-results/">mentioned</a> this paper <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/04/30/test-of-time/">several</a> <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2012/06/22/cricket-400-and-complexity-theory/">times</a>, notably <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/08/30/limits-on-matrix-multiplication/">here</a>. </p>
<p>
The objective need not be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> versus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.372...%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2.372...}" class="latex" />, however. There is a notable milepost just above <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2.30%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2.30}" class="latex" />. It comes from a STOC 2015 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5414">paper</a> by Andris Ambainis, Yuval Flimus, and François Le Gall. It shows that a wide class of techniques of the kind used since 1990 cannot achieve better than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Comega+%3C+2.3078%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\omega &lt; 2.3078}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
Other recent <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/8360/pdf/LIPIcs-ITCS-2018-25.pdf">work</a> by Alman and Williams shows both a dimension along which the road down to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> may still be open but other limits in other directions. Even their new <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0.00001%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0.00001}" class="latex" /> improvement has new ideas that may be exploited more generally. This is a feature of partial progress that contrasts with what we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/08/10/p-vs-np-proof-claims/">recently</a> about not learning much from whole-jump attempts: partial progress always shows a higher learning curve.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Partial Progress Objectives </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Cohn also has a page of informal <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/">thoughts</a> on how to perform research, including <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/advice.html">advice</a> for those who claim to have solved some open problem. We want to add this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Make sure ahead of time that your advance really covers the intermediate ground it jumps through. Even better, walk back your claim a little so that it proves something only a step or so beyond previous knowledge. </em>

<p>
Here are a few examples of such things to prove in complexity theory:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BP+%5Cneq+NP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{P \neq NP}}" class="latex" />: The claim is that SAT requires exponential time. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove SAT cannot be done in linear time. Or that it cannot be done in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n^2}" class="latex" /> time.
</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Circuit Lower Bounds</b>: The claim is that some concrete problem in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" /> requires super-polynomial size general circuits. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove that some concrete problem cannot be done in a linear size boolean circuit–or one of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6n}" class="latex" />.
</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Factoring</b>: The claim is that factoring a general number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> requires super-polynomial time in the bit-length of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove that factoring cannot be done in linear time. Or not in quadratic time. See <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~cohn/Thoughts/factoring.html">this</a>.
</li></ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Graph Isomorphism</b>: The claim is that there is polynomial-time algorithm to tell whether two graphs are isomorphic. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove the case where the graphs have degree a fixed constant.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is an example of a baby step that is already done. Note: it was not an easy step. It is a famous result of Eugene Luks—see his 1982 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000082900095">paper</a>. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
We could go deeper into known computational complexity issues to find more. The idea applies to problems from mathematics in general. Here is one:</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Riemann Hypothesis”</b> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">claim</a> is of course that 	<p></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++%5Csum_%7Bn%3D1%7D%5E%7B%5Cinfty%7D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%5Es%7D+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>only happens for negative even integers and for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s}" class="latex" /> with real part <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%2F2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1/2}" class="latex" />. The latter are the zeroes on the half line. </p>
</li><li>
<b>A Baby Step</b>: Prove that it is impossible for just two zeroes to be off the half line. Or that only a finite number can be off the half line.
</li></ul>
<p></p><p><br />
We invite readers to add more favorite math examples in comments, or others from complexity theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What are some additional first steps? </p>
<p>
Have we also—unintendedly but effectively—made a case for the value of tiny improvements? At least when they are conceptual improvements?</p>
<p>
Here is the answer to the puzzle in the previous <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/26/a-possible-ramsey-insight-into-p-versus-np/">post</a>: Barbara wins. She forces the sum of every row to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />. Alan makes an entry <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />, she then makes an entry in the same row <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B-x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{-x}" class="latex" />. This works since 1986 is even. This makes the matrix singular, since the matrix times the all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" /> vector is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{0}" class="latex" />.</p>

We study a natural and quite general model of branch-and-bound algorithms. In this model, an algorithm attempts to minimize (or maximize) a function $f : D \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ by making oracle queries to a heuristic $h_f$ satisfying 
\[
    \min_{x \in S} f(x) \leq h_f(S) \leq \gamma \cdot \min_{x \in S} f(x)
\]
for some $\gamma \geq 1$ and any subset $S$ in some allowed class of subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of the domain $D$. We show tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries $q$ needed to find even a $\gamma'$-approximate minimizer for quite large $\gamma'$ in a number of interesting settings, as follows.

- For arbitrary functions $f : \{0,1\}^n \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ contains all subsets of the domain, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve $\gamma' \approx\gamma^{n/\log q}$, while a simple greedy algorithm achieves essentially $\gamma^{n/\log q}$.

- For a large class of MAX-CSPs, where $\mathcal{S} := \{ S_w\}$ contains each set of assignments to the variables induced by a partial assignment $w$, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can do significantly better than essentially a random guess, even for  $\gamma \approx 1+\sqrt{\log(q)/n}$.

- For the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), where $\mathcal{S} := \{S_p\}$ contains each set of tours extending a path $p$, we show that no branch-and-bound algorithm can achieve $\gamma' \approx (\gamma-1) n/\log q$. We also prove a nearly matching upper bound in our model. 

Behind these results is a "useless oracle lemma," which allows us to argue that under certain conditions the heuristic $h_f$ is "useless," and which might be of independent interest.

We also note two alternative interpretations of our model and results. If we interpret the heuristic $h_f$ as an oracle for an approximate decision problem, then our results unconditionally rule out a large and natural class of approximate search-to-decision reductions (which we think of as "branch-and-bound" search-to-decision reductions). We therefore show an oracle model in which approximate search and decision are strongly separated. (In particular, our lower bound for TSP can be viewed as a negative answer to a question posed by Bellare and Goldwasser (SIAM J. Comput. 1994), though only in an oracle model.) By instead interpreting $h_f$ as a data structure, we see that our results unconditionally rule out black-box search-to-decision reductions for data structures.</div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="http://benjamin-recht.github.io/2021/09/28/summarization/">Statistics as algorithmic summarization</a></h3>
<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from

<div class="content">
<p>Though a multifaceted and complex discipline, Statistics’ greatest contribution is a rigorous framework for summarization. Statistics gives us reasonable procedures to estimate properties of a general population by examining only a few individuals from the population. In this regard, statistics is algorithmic: it provides randomized algorithms for extrapolation. In this blog, I’ll review some elementary stats (with as little mathematical formalism as possible), and try to crystalize why this algorithmic view is illuminating. In future blogs, I’ll build upon this algorithm perspective in applying it to more interesting examples in experiment design and prediction.</p>

<p>For a simple starter example, we know that every person on Earth has a height, defined as the distance from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head when standing upright. Suppose we would like to know the mean of the height of all living people. This would require us tracking down every living individual, getting out a tape measure, and measuring the distance from the bottom of their feet to the top of their head. To avoid such exhaustive counting we could instead devise an efficient algorithm to estimate this quantity. What if we selected a subset at random, and used this subset to estimate the mean? That is, we could collect a random sample of individuals from the population and measure the average height of all of the individuals in the sample.</p>

<p>The average height measured on this random sample is a random quantity. Thus it must have a mean and variance like we associate with other random quantities. If we were to sample each individual uniformly at random from all living humans, the expected mean height of the sample would be precisely the average height in the general population. Moreover, the variance of the average height of the sample will shrink proportionally to the number of sampled individuals. The more individuals you measure, the closer the average height on the sample will be to the average over the population.</p>

<p>Statistics provides powerful formulas that let us precisely quantify how close the sample average will be to the population average. For instance, we know a person’s height is a positive number and that there are no people who are taller than nine feet. With these two facts, a simple application of a formula called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality"><em>Hoeffding’s inequality</em></a> tells us that if we sample the heights of thirty thousand individuals, our sample average will be within an inch of the true average height with probability at least 83%. This assertion is true no matter how large the population of individuals. The required sample size is dictated only by the variability of height, not by the number of total individuals.</p>

<p>You could replace “height” in this example with almost any attribute that you are able to measure well. For quantities with reasonable variability, a uniform sample from a general population will give a high quality estimate of the average value. Statistics provides a powerful framework to reason about population-level properties by examining properties of small subsets.</p>

<p>In this example, statistics provided an algorithm for estimation. We began with a quantity whose average value we would like to estimate. We specified how much this quantity can vary in the population under study. Using formulas from statistics, we computed the number of individuals we needed to examine in order to have an estimate of appropriate quality. We then can proceed to do our best to extract a random sample of individuals of this size from the population, measure these individuals, and report the mean of the sample. This is a full procedure for estimating the mean value of the general population.</p>

<p>This algorithmic description of statistical summarization probably seems uncontroversial, but it differs from how statistics is often taught or conceptualized. As I’ve discussed in <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">previous</a> <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/21/models-are-wrong/">blogs</a>, the statistical model is oftentimes given highest precedence. In this model-based framing of statistics, the world is governed by probabilistic rules. With enough effort, these rules can be specified by a generative statistical model, and we assume that measurement is equivalent to sampling from this generative model. The generative model will have properties like a mean, and the law-of-large numbers will tell us that if we sample enough times from the model, we can accurately estimate the mean and other properties.</p>

<p>This distinction between modeling the sampling and modeling the population may appear to be splitting hairs. In some sense, the two viewpoints only differ conceptually as the algorithms for estimating the mean height in a population will be identical. However, our interpretation of these two views is different: in the algorithmic view, one can use statistics to understand the physical world no matter how the general population arose. As our height example highlights, only the most minimal modeling assumptions are needed to make use of statistical methods. In the modeling view, we shoehorn ourselves into modeling all processes with probability distributions. Not only is this unnecessary, but validating probabilistic models is also quite difficult. As I described in my last two blog posts (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">1</a>) (<a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/21/models-are-wrong/">2</a>), proposed statistical models are never validated in the vast majority of scientific studies.</p>

<p>The algorithmic view of statistics moreover illuminates the aspects of randomness that we have under our control. For example, there are whole branches of computer science dedicated to deterministically generating numbers that look random for all intents and purposes. Random number generation is something we can control. We can focus on understanding how our measurements fail to be ideal, rather than focusing on how the natural world doesn’t obey our models. This empowers the statistical practitioner to tune their procedures to be more robust against the limitations of what that can measure.</p>

<p>I want to once more emphasize that the algorithmic perspective I’ve presented here is not novel at all. Thinking about the combinatorics of random permutations and how they could be used to design randomized experiments is nearly one hundred years old, and, for example, prevalent in the works of <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2342192">Jerzy Neyman</a> and the eccentric eugenicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Experiments">Ronald Fisher</a> by the 1930s. Fisher’s rambling discursion on the woman who can tell if milk was added to a cup before tea describes a randomization procedure that does not model the appearance of tea in cups, the composition of tea cups, nor the psychic abilities of the tea expert. It purely counts permutations and uses exact statistics to provide a way to evaluate validity of a claim. I’ll review in more detail how to use these effectively <em>model-free</em> ideas for experimentation in the next post.</p>

<p>There are obviously issues with the algorithmic view. Statistical sampling methods work best when the variability of the quantity of interest is low. In such a case, small experiments quickly reveal insights about the population. When variances are large or effectively unbounded, the number of samples required for high precision estimates might be impractical and our estimators and algorithms need to be rethought. There are many phenomena that obey “power law” scaling, and such quantities are harder to work with in this rudimentary experimental framework. The uniform sampling algorithm we have described will have unbounded variance, and hence the average on the sample will no longer be an accurate measure of the average of the population. More sophisticated means must be deployed to estimate means of quantities with such high variation.</p>

<p>Another drawback of statistical sampling is the requirement that samples be sampled uniformly. Uniform sampling is an idealization and is often hard to implement in practice. For example, what does it mean to collect an i.i.d. sampling of registered voters in a poll? Some voters may not respond to your phone calls. Even more problematic is when you cannot define the population well in advance, as would be the case of the vague notion of “likely” voters. More sophisticated statistical analyses can provide guarantees on non-uniform sampling strategies, but care must be taken to ensure that the statistical bounds we compute reflect the reality of the implementation of the data collection. Understanding our sampling capabilities is crucial to understanding the validity of our estimates.</p>

<p>With these caveats in mind, our algorithmic framing of statistics gives us a focused way to think about experiment design and prediction methods. In the next blogs, I’ll explore these both in depth.</p></div>

Assume that $X_0,X_1$ (respectively $Y_0,Y_1$) are $d_X$ (respectively $d_Y$) indistinguishable for circuits of a given size. It is well known that the product distributions $X_0Y_0,\,X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y$ indistinguishable for slightly smaller circuits. However, in probability theory where unbounded adversaries are considered through statistical distance, it is folklore knowledge that in fact $X_0Y_0$ and $X_1Y_1$ are $d_X+d_Y-d_X\cdot d_Y$ indistinguishable, and also that this bound is tight.

We formulate and prove the computational analog of this tight bound. Our proof is entirely different from the proof in the statistical case, which is non-constructive. As a corollary, we show that if $X$ and $Y$ are $d$ indistinguishable, then $k$ independent copies of $X$ and $k$ independent copies of $Y$ are almost $1-(1-d)^k$ indistinguishable for smaller circuits, as against $d\cdot k$ using the looser bound. Our bounds are useful in settings where only weak (i.e. non-negligible) indistinguishability is guaranteed. We demonstrate this in the context of cryptography, showing that our bounds yield simple analysis for amplification of weak oblivious transfer protocols.</div>

<p> I got my PhD from Harvard in 1985 with advisor Harry Lewis</p><p>Harry Lewis got his PhD from Harvard in 1974 with advisor Burton Dreben (Dreben was in the Philosophy department and did logic). Burton Dreben never got a PhD (more on that later). So I thought my lineage stopped there. A while back I was in an email conversation with Harry and for some odd reason Galileo came up.</p><p>He then emailed me the following:</p><p>----------------</p><p>Did you know you were descended from Galileo, via Newton? See below. The data is from the Math Genealogy project (see <a href="https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/">here</a>). As you know  Dreben had no PhD, but it would certainly be fair to call Quine his advisor anyway. And, in fact, the Math Geneology project lists Quine as Dreben's advisor. By starting with Dreben and clicking backwards I found the following:</p><p>In the list below everyone was advised (in some form) by the person below them.</p><p>William Gasarch, Harvard 1985</p><p>Harry Lewis, Harvard 1974</p><p>Burton Dreben, Harvard 1955</p><p>WVO Quine, Harvard 1932</p><p>AN Whitehead, Cambridge 1884</p><p>Edward John Routh, Cambridge 1857</p><p>William Hopkins, Cambridge 1830</p><p>Adam Sedgwick, Cambridge 1811</p><p>Thomas Jones, Cambridge 1782</p><p>Thomas Postlethwaite, Cambridge 1756</p><p>Stephen Whisson, Cambridge 1742</p><p>Walter Taylor, Cambridge 1723</p><p>Robert Smith, Cambridge 1715</p><p>Roger Coles, Cambridge 1706</p><p>Isaac Newton, Cambridge 1668</p><p>Isaac Barrow, Cambridge 1652</p><p>Vincenzo Viviani, Pisa 1642</p><p>Galileo Galilei, Pisa 1585</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>A few observations</p><p>1) Dreben was a philosophy professor at Harvard without a PhD. How? He was a Junior Fellow, which is for brilliant people, some of which were made professors without  the burden of going  through the PhD-getting ritual.  Andrew Gleason was a professor of Math at Harvard without a PhD-- also a junior fellow (he solved Hilbert's 5th problem, which surely helped). Tom Cheatham was a CS professor at Harvard who did not have a PhD but  was <i>not</i> a junior fellow. I do not know how he did that. Things are more formal now, and more people have PhD's, so I suspect it is much rarer to be a professor without a PhD.  Harvard still has the Junior Fellows Program, but even they have PhDs now. If someone solved P vs NP as an ugrad, I suspect they would be hired as a professor even though they do not have a PhD. That's one way for a theorist to get out of taking graduate systems courses. </p><p>2) Note that Galileo and Vincenzo were in Pisa but then a long line of people from Cambridge. In those days schools hired their own. Is this good or bad? They know what they are getting, but you could have an old-boys-network blocking fresh new talent, and you may get stuck in your ways. Nowadays, at least in America, it is uncommon to stay at the same school as you got your PhD.</p><p>3) The shift from Pisa to Cambridge might be part of a more general phenomena--- the intellectual center for science shifting from Italy to England. What caused this? Amir Alexander, in his book <i>Infinitesimals: How a dangerous mathematical idea shaped the modern world </i>(see my review <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/FRED/inf.pdf">here</a> ) speculates that the Catholic Church's rejection of Infinitesimals was the cause.  I suspect that letting non-scientists interfere with science was the cause (a lesson for us all).</p><p>4) Lance did a blog on his lineage <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2005/06/eulerian-tour.html">here</a>. He has Gauss and Euler as ancestors. </p><p>5) To honor the myths about  my two most famous academic ancestors, Galileo and Newton,  I am going to travel to Italy and have Darling drop two apples of different weights off the leaning tower of Pisa and see if they hit my head at the same time.</p><div><br /></div></div>

David Zuckerman has a beautiful result on the approximate hardness of the clique problem. His <a href="https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v003a006/v003a006.pdf">paper</a>, “Linear Degree Extractors and the Inapproximability of Max Clique and Chromatic Number,” has has received almost 1,000 citations since it was first published in 2007. Wow.</p>
<p>
Today we discuss a possible relevance of this result for P versus NP.</p>

Recall a clique is a subset of nodes of an undirected graph, such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge.

Is there a relatively small change we could make to the graph to give it a much larger clique? At top right, we could add two edges to extend the blur <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{4}" class="latex" />-clique to a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B5%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{5}" class="latex" />-clique—a pentagram inside a pentagon. At bottom left we could add <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{4}" class="latex" /> edges to make the four triangles blossom into a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6}" class="latex" />-clique.</p>
<p>
Computing the size of the largest clique in a graph—or just telling whether it has a clique of a given size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />—is a famous NP-complete problem. Counting the number of cliques of the largest size is evidently a harder problem still. Yet you might think it easier to tell a graph with only small cliques apart from a graph that has large ones. This is where David’s result comes in.</p>

<p></p><p>
It is fundamentally a de-randomization result. Our idea is to scale it down in a way that may bring <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+N%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{P} \neq N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" /> into contact with mathematical theorems that govern effects of the scaling. The theorems may be adjacent to conjectures that can suggest new approaches. The idea may require bringing back randomization, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Question </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Our quest to build on David’s theorem leads us to interpose a classic idea. In work with Paul Erdős, Tibor Radó wrote <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Crightarrow%28H%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G\rightarrow(H)}" class="latex" /> to mean that every <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" />-coloring of the edges of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> has a monochromatic subgraph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BH%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{H}" class="latex" />. The classic two-color Ramsey theorem states that for all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> there is a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> such that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%5Crightarrow%28K_r%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G\rightarrow(K_r)}" class="latex" />. Erdős and George Szekeres further showed <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> can have fewer than <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5E%7B2r%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^{2r}}" class="latex" /> nodes. </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Definition 2</b> <em> Say an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-node graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is <b><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó</b> if every edge 2-coloring of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> leaves a clique of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog+n+-+c%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\frac{1}{2}\log n - c}" class="latex" /> vertices. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
In Radó’s notation, this is if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG+%5Crightarrow+%28K_%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog_2+n+-+c%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G \rightarrow (K_{\frac{1}{2}\log_2 n - c})}" class="latex" />. The first point is that all clumpy graphs are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó for large enough <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />. Taking <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc+%5Cgeq+2%5Clog_2%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B%5Cepsilon%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c \geq 2\log_2(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}" class="latex" /> puts the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon n}" class="latex" />-sized clique above the Erdős-Szekeres bound for the Ramsey property to hold. </p>
<p>
Thus the key question becomes:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em><a name="limpid"></a> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> is a limpid graph. Can <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> also be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Suppose the answer is <b>no</b>. Then every limpid graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G}" class="latex" /> has an edge 2-coloring that does not leave a clique of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog+n+-+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = \frac{1}{2}\log n - c}" class="latex" />. We can verify this in quasi-polynomial time by trying all <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-subsets of the vertices. </p>
<p>
This sets up a situation where both “limpid” and “clumpy” have an <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BN%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" /> witness. More to the point, we obtain the modified problem of distinguishing “clumpy” from “not <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó” (for appropriately chosen <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />).

</p><p></p><h2> The Quest For Limpid Radó Graphs </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
If, like most, you believe <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D+%5Cneq+N%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{P} \neq N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" />, or further in the “ESY”-type strengthening of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%5Cwidetilde%7BNP%7D+%5Cneq+%5Ctext%7Bco-%7DN%5Cwidetilde%7BP%7D%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{\widetilde{NP} \neq \text{co-}N\widetilde{P}}}" class="latex" />, then the answer must be that limpid (almost-)<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó graphs exist. The question of <em>finding</em> them, however, has a long trail that leads back into complexity theory.</p>
<p>
To begin, let’s decouple the clique size from the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of nodes by considering graphs with a clique of size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{6}" class="latex" /> to be “lumpy,” and use the original form of the Radó property: every 2-edge coloring has a monochrome triangle. It is surprisingly hard to find a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free graph with the property. Brute-force attempts for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B7%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{7}" class="latex" />-node and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B8%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{8}" class="latex" />-node graphs that are maximal for having no <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" /> fail:</p>

<p></p><p><br />
The smallest <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free graph with the Radó triangle property that we know how to build has <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%3D14%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n=14}" class="latex" /> nodes and comes from a proof that the Radó triangle property is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete. The proof is in a 1985 <a href="https://bd.booksc.org/book/5907065/04eeae">paper</a> by Moon-Jung Chung, W. Michael Evangelist, and Ivan Hal Sudborough. The graph at left, which looks like a bat, is such that any 2-edge coloring without a monochrome triangle must give the two edges marked <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> the same color—whichever color is used for two edges of the middle triangle. </p>

<p>
Joining a bat and an upside-down bat creates the graph at right, in which the edges marked <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}}" class="latex" /> must have opposite colors. This creates a truth-assignment gadget for each pair of literals <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}_i}" class="latex" /> in a 3CNF formula <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" /> given as instance of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-complete Not-All-Equal 3SAT <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not-all-equal_3-satisfiability">problem</a>. Using one triangle per clause of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" />, connecting more bats between <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_i%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_i}" class="latex" /> or <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D_j%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}_j}" class="latex" /> appearing in the clause to the corresponding edges in the truth gadgets creates a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G_\phi}" class="latex" /> that has the Radó property if and only if <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" /> has an assignment making 1 or 2 literals true in each clause. </p>
<p>
Then every negative instance <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\phi}" class="latex" /> induces a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_6%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_6}" class="latex" />-free Radó graph <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BG_%5Cphi%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{G_\phi}" class="latex" />. We can get one more simply, however, by adding a third “bat” to the graph at right above that connects <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\bar{x}}" class="latex" />. The resulting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B14%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{14}" class="latex" />-node graph has no 2-edge coloring without making a monochrome triangle.</p>
<p>
To be truly “limpid,” however, the graph should exclude smaller cliques. The following problem of Erdős and Radó was open for some time:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Does there exist a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_4}" class="latex" />-free graph with the Radó triangle property? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
This was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2099355">solved</a> in 1970 by Jon Folkman and then improved in 1987 by a probabilistic argument of Joel Spencer, in a <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82159088.pdf">paper</a> titled, “Three Hundred Million Points Suffice.” That’s right: for the minimum Radó criterion he showed there is a limpid graph with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3C+%5Cmathbf%7B300%2C000%2C000%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N &lt; \mathbf{300,000,000}}" class="latex" /> nodes. This 2007 <a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~spr/PUBL/paper53.pdf">paper</a> by the Ramsey-theory experts Stanisław Radziszowski and Xu Xiaodong proves that the minimum possible <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" /> is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B19%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{19}" class="latex" /> and gives evidence that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%5Cleq+127%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N \leq 127}" class="latex" /> is plausible. let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N_{3,3}}" class="latex" /> stand for the least possible such <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N}" class="latex" />.</p>
<p>
However one such graph exists, it must give rise to a “bat”-type construction and forthwith a reduction showing the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cmathsf%7BNP%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\mathsf{NP}}" class="latex" />-completeness of the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BK_4%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{K_4}" class="latex" />-free Radó property. Thus the Ramsey-type existence question is entangled with complexity theory. How this relationship <em>scales</em> up for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó and clumpy versus limpid graphs is the point we are driving at.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Ramsey Scaling And Complexity </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
There are two main levers by which we are scaling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Up from the constant <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{3}" class="latex" /> of the Radó triangle property to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7D%5Clog_2%28n%29+-+c%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho = \frac{1}{2}\log_2(n) - c}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó. <p></p>
</li><li>
Up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%3Dn%5E%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k=n^\epsilon}" class="latex" /> as the allowed clique size in a <em>limpid</em> graph.
</li></ul>
<p>
The latter corresponds to the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon+n%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon n}" class="latex" /> size for <em>clumpy</em> that we are distinguishing, but there is some freedom in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cepsilon%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\epsilon}" class="latex" />. If we imagine <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" /> as fixed—temporarily ignoring the dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />—we can ask, what is the minimum size <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN+%3D+N_%7B%5Crho%2Ck%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N = N_{\rho,k}}" class="latex" /> of a <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />-limpid graph that is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bc%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{c}" class="latex" />-Radó? </p>
<p>
To avoid a complexity collapse, we must bet on at worst a single-exponential dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" />, polynomial in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" />. Can we possibly show this directly? Note that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho = 3}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk+%3D+3%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k = 3}" class="latex" /> already raised the specter of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BN_%7B3%2C3%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{N_{3,3}}" class="latex" /> in the hundred millions. Not only do we not see a way to scale up Spencer’s proof, he remarked in the intro that his proof is “extremely case specific” and does not scale even to 3-edge colorings. The “almost” feature of Definition <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/#almost">3</a> adds a further complication.</p>
<p>
It may be that the guiderails for ascending to higher <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{k}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Crho%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\rho}" class="latex" /> (scaling with the number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" /> of nodes) are already present among the details of the graph constructions in David’s proof and the proofs of the theorems his paper builds on. We have not had time to delve. There must be <em>some</em> connection; the question is whether complexity considerations take the lead or follow only in train of the sides that can be mathematically disproved.  Other connections of Ramsey theory are in this nice 2004 <a href="https://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/DS13/pdf">survey</a> by Vera Rosta.</p>
<p>
Here is one more indication of why we think the interaction between complexity and Ramsey theory can be nontrivial. Putting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR+%3D+2%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R = 2^r}" class="latex" />, the upper bound noted above for the diagonal-<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> Ramsey number has rough order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R^2}" class="latex" />. The best known lower bound has rough order <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R^{1/2}}" class="latex" />. Can we show an impact of the growth of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BR%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{R}" class="latex" /> on complexity theory, in advance of resolving this gap which has been open for over fifty years?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>

The key issue is, what about the above question? Assuming the usual belief that quasi-polynomial time and nondeterministic quasi-polynomial time are distinct we must be able to show a fact about <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" />-colorings of clumpy and limpid graphs. If this is hard to prove, then we have an interesting impasse. Even worse, if this is false, then our beliefs collapse. </p>
<p></p><p><br />
The feature that surprises us about the 1986 Putnam <a href="https://kskedlaya.org/putnam-archive/1986.pdf">exam</a> is that it does <em>not</em> have a question that involves the number <b>1,986</b>. Ken and I both remember such features. Here is a problem they could have used; we will give the answer later:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Alan and Barbara play a game in which they take turns filling entries of an initially empty 1986 x 1986 array. Alan plays first. At each turn, a player chooses a real number and places it in a vacant entry. The game ends when all the entries are filled. Alan wins if the determinant of the resulting matrix is nonzero; Barbara wins if it is zero. Which player has a winning strategy? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer is at the end of the next <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/09/30/baby-steps/">post</a>.</p>
<p></p><p><br />

<div class="content">
<p>You’re probably familiar with the fact that you can draw a convex octagon with corners in an integer grid, fitting into a \(3\times 3\) square. It’s not regular, because its side lengths alternate between \(1\) and \(\sqrt 2\), but it has the same angles as a regular octagon and looks close enough to it for some purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/7way-octagon.svg" alt="3x3 integer octagon and its 7-ply tiling of the plane" /></p>

<p>It also has another interesting property: if you place copies of it at every point of the integer grid, then each edge of each copy is also the edge of another copy. Therefore, if you let \(p\) be any point that avoids the edges of the octagons, count the number of octagons that cover any point of the plane, and then slide \(p\) around to another edge-avoiding point, the number of covering octagons always stays unchanged. Whenever \(p\) slides off from one octagon, it slides onto another one. Because the area of the integer octagon is seven units, and you’re placing one octagon for every unit square of the grid, the average covering depth is seven. And since the covering depth stays the same everywhere, it’s seven everywhere. You can think of this collection of octagons as forming a <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(7\)-ply</span> tiling of the plane, despite the fact that convex octagons cannot tile the plane in the usual \(1\)-ply sense of tiling.</p>

<p>More generally, define a \(k\)-ply tiling to be a covering of the plane by congruent copies of some prototile (allowing rotations, even though these are not necessary for the octagon) such that, except at a subset of the plane of measure zero (the boundaries of the prototiles), every point is covered by exactly \(k\) copies, and define the “ply” of a prototile to be the minimum \(k\) such that it has a \(k\)-ply tiling. The integer octagon has <span style="white-space: nowrap;">ply \(7\):</span> once one octagon is placed anywhere in the plane, the rest of the tiling is forced to follow in the same way around it, in order to avoid creating seams where an octagon edge is not matched by another octagon and the ply changes. The same construction, using centrally symmetric octagons with integer vertices and longer sides, produces for any \(k\ge9\) a convex tile of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">ply \(k\).</span></p>

<p>This is the subject of my new short paper (or maybe extended abstract) “Multifold tiles of polyominoes and convex lattice polygons”, with many coauthors from the 2017 Bellairs Winter Workshop on Computational Geometry: Kota Chida, Erik Demaine, Martin Demaine, Adam Hesterberg, Takashi Horiyama, John Iacono, Hiro Ito, Stefan Langerman, Ryuhei Uehara, and Yushi Uno. You can find it in the <a href="http://www.math.science.cmu.ac.th/tjcdcggg/Book-abstract.pdf">book of abstracts of the 23rd Thailand–Japan Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry, Graphs, and Games (TJCDCG<sup>3</sup> 2020+1)</a>, which was organized online by Chiang Mai University earlier this month.</p>

<p>As well as the family of octagon \(k\)-ply tilers described above, we found that cutting the bottom row of squares off a \(3\times 3\) octagon produces a \(5\)-ply hexagon tiler, this time requiring \(180^\circ\)-degree rotations for its tiling, and that stretching this hexagon can produce an <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(8\)-ply</span> convex tiler. We also found polyomino <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-ply</span> tilers for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">all \(k\ge 2\),</span> and three heptominoes (the smallest possible polyominoes) that can each form <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k\)-ply</span> tilings for all \(k\ge 2\) but not for <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(k=1\).</span> I imagine the details will become available in a more complete paper at some point but for now the abstract just announces these results and gives pictures of these heptominoes. We still don’t know whether there can exist convex polygons whose ply is one of <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(\{2,3,4,6\}\).</span></p>

<p>The TJCDCG<sup>3</sup> abstract book has many other intriguing results in discrete geometry, graph theory, and combinatorial game theory, so do check it out if you’re interested. Tiling-related highlights include a variation on Wang tiling adding connectivity constraints and inspired by a dungeon-making mini-game in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> (“Tiling the Plane Connectively with Wang Tiles”, Chao Yang), signal processing using high-dimensional substitution tilings (“Generating Frames via Discretized Substitution Tilings”, Luis S. Silvestre Jr. and Job A. Nable), a partial classification of edge-to-edge monohedral tilings of the sphere (“Tiling of the Sphere by Congruent Polygons”, Yohji Akama, Hoi Ping Luk, Erxiao Wang, and Min Yan), and tilings that can be used to make arrays of joined-up origami cranes (“Renzuru Tilings with Asymmetric Quadrilaterals”, Takashi Yoshino).</p>

<p>Here’s yesterday’s clickbait offering from <em>Scientific American</em>, the once-legendary home of Martin Gardner’s Mathematical Games column:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-term-jedi-is-problematic-for-describing-programs-that-promote-justice-equity-diversity-and-inclusion/">Why the Term ‘JEDI’ Is Problematic for Describing Programs That Promote Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion</a></p>



<p>The sad thing is, I see few signs that this essay was meant as a Sokal-style parody, although in many ways it’s written as one.  The essay actually develops a 100% cogent, reasoned argument: namely, that the ideology of the <em>Star Wars</em> films doesn’t easily fit with the new ideology of militant egalitarianism at the expense of all other human values, including irony, humor, joy, and the nurturing of unusual talents. The authors are merely oblivious to the conclusion that most people would draw from their argument: namely, so much the worse for the militant egalitarianism then!</p>



<p>I predict that this proposal—to send the acronym “JEDI” the way of “mankind,” “blacklist,” and, err, “quantum supremacy”—will meet with opposition even from the wokeists themselves, a huge fraction of whom (in my experience) have soft spots for the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise.  Recall for example that in 2014, Laurie Penny used <em>Star Wars</em> metaphors in her <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2014/12/on-nerd-entitlement-rebel-alliance-empire">interesting response</a> to my comment-171, telling male nerds like me that we need to learn to accept that “[we’re] not the Rebel Alliance, [we’re] actually part of the Empire and have been all along.”  Admittedly, I’ve never <em>felt like</em> part of an Empire, although I’ll confess to some labored breathing lately when ascending flights of stairs.</p>



<p>As for me, I spent much of my life opposed in principle to <em>Star Wars</em>—I hated how the most successful “science fiction” franchise of all time became that way <em>precisely</em> by ditching any pretense of science and fully embracing mystical woo—but sure, when the chips are down, I’m crazy and radical enough to take the side of Luke Skywalker, even if a team of woke theorists is earnestly, unironically explaining to me that lightsabers are phallocentric and that Vader ranks higher on the intersectional oppression axis because of his breathing problem.</p>



<p>Meantime, of course, the US continues to <a href="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fopinions%2F2021%2F09%2F23%2Frobert-kagan-constitutional-crisis">careen toward its worst Constitutional crisis since the Civil War</a>, as Trump prepares to run again in 2024, and as this time around, the Republicans are systematically purging state governments of their last Brad Raffenspergers, of anyone who might stand in the way of them simply setting aside the vote totals and declaring Trump the winner regardless of the actual outcome.  It’s good to know that my fellow progressives have their eyes on the ball—so that when that happens, at least universities will no longer be using offensive acronyms like “JEDI”!</p></div>

<h3><a class="entryheader" href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/09/24/which-integer-sequences.html">Which integer sequences form denominators of Egyptian fractions?</a></h3>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I have a new paper out: “<a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL24/Eppstein/eppstein2.html">Egyptian Fractions with Denominators from Sequences Closed Under Doubling</a>”, in the <em>Journal of Integer Sequences</em>. (There should also be an arXiv version soon but despite my long association with arXiv they made me get an endorser before I could upload to the number theory category, slowing down my submission there.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s basically a journal version of an old blog post here, “<a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/11/20/egyptian-fractions-with.html">Egyptian fractions with practical denominators</a>”. That post concerned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_number">practical numbers</a>, positive integers \(n\) such that all other positive integers up to \(n\) can be represented as sums of distinct divisors of \(n\). This definition gives the practical numbers a natural connection to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction">Egyptian fractions</a>, representations of rational numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions: if you represent a number \(k&lt;n\) by a sum of distinct divisors of \(n\), and then divide everything by \(n\), you get an Egyptian fraction for \(k/n\). Zhi-Wei Sun asked whether the practical numbers and Egyptian fractions were connected in a different way, with every positive integer having an Egyptian fraction representation in which all denominators are practical, and my blog post provides a positive answer to Sun’s question.</p>

<p>The new paper simplifies the presentation of the solution, compared to the blog post, by providing direct formulas for the representation rather than an iterative computational method for finding it. But beyond that, it also shows that the same method (based on dividing by a large power of two and dealing separately with the quotient and remainder) works for many other integer sequences beyond the practical numbers. All it needs from an integer sequence is two simple properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The sequence should include a multiple of every integer. In order to represent \(k/p\) as an Egyptian fraction, when \(p\) is prime, the denominators must include at least one multiple of \(p\), so the requirement of including multiples is pretty natural in this context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For every number \(n\) that belongs to the sequence, \(2n\) should also belong to the sequence. This is the “closed under doubling” of the new article’s title, and is closely connected to the method used by the article involving division by powers of two.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever a sequence \(S\) of positive integers has both properties, we can find Egyptian fractions for all positive rationals up to \(\sum_{x\in S}1/x\), the natural limiting value for such representations. When \(\sum_{x\in S}1/x\) diverges, we get all positive rationals. As well as the practical numbers, this works for some other nice sequences including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odious_number">odious</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_number">evil</a> numbers, the <a href="https://oeis.org/A001013">orders of isomorphism groups of trees</a>, and the <a href="https://oeis.org/A003714">fibbinary numbers</a>, numbers whose binary representation avoids consecutive ones. Because they’re based on binary representations, the doubling property of odious, evil, and fibbinary numbers follows from their definitions; the existence of multiples of other integers in these sequences is less obvious but was more or less already known. Isomorphism groups of trees have orders that are the products of factorials, from which (because 2 is a factorial and \(n!\) is a multiple of \(n\)) both properties follow immediately.</p>

<p>Although these two properties are sufficient for a sequence to form Egyptian fractions for rationals up to its natural limit, they are not necessary. Ron Graham’s PhD dissertation was on the same topic, and showed that the sequence of squares greater than one has the same property. (The sequence of all squares, including one, is a little more complicated: its sums of distinct reciprocals can represent all rationals in the intervals \([0,\pi^2/6-1)\) and \([1,\pi^2/6)\) but can’t cover the gap between these two intervals.) Characterizing which sequences do or do not form representations of this type more generally seems like an interesting question, but one that I don’t have much idea how to attack at this point.</p>

<div class="content">
We prove the existence of Reed-Solomon codes of any desired rate $R \in (0,1)$ that are combinatorially list-decodable up to a radius approaching  $1-R$, which is the information-theoretic limit. This is established by starting with the full-length $[q,k]_q$ Reed-Solomon code over a field $\mathbb{F}_q$ that is polynomially larger than the desired dimension $k$, and "puncturing" it by including $k/R$ randomly chosen codeword positions. 
		
Our puncturing result is more general and applies to any code with large minimum distance: we show that a random rate $R$ puncturing of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear "mother" code whose relative distance is close enough to $1-1/q$ is list-decodable up to a radius approaching the $q$-ary list-decoding capacity bound $h_q^{-1}(1-R)$. In fact, for large $q$, or under a stronger assumption of low-bias of the mother-code, we prove that the threshold rate for list-decodability with a specific list-size (and more generally, any "local" property) of the random puncturing approaches that of fully random linear codes. Thus, all current (and future) list-decodability bounds shown for random linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet) code. This can be viewed as a general derandomization result applicable to random linear codes. 
		
To obtain our conclusion about Reed-Solomon codes, we establish some hashing properties of field trace maps that allow us to reduce the list-decodability of RS codes to its associated trace (dual-BCH) code, and then apply our puncturing theorem to the latter. Our approach implies, essentially for free, optimal rate list-recoverability of punctured RS codes as well.</div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a model of privacy-preserving machine learning that has garnered significant interest in recent years due to its rigorous privacy guarantees. An algorithm differentially private if the output is stable under small changes in the input database. While DP has been adopted in a variety of applications, most applications of DP in industry actually satisfy a stronger notion called local differential privacy. In local differential privacy data subjects perturb their data before it reaches the data analyst. While this requires less trust, it comes a substantial cost to accuracy. Recent work of Erlingsson, Feldman, Mironov, Raghunathan, Talwar, and Thakurta [EFMRTT19] demonstrated that random shuffling amplifies differential privacy guarantees of locally randomized data. Such amplification implies substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in which data is contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17] and has led to significant interest in the shuffle model of privacy [CSUZZ19, EFMRTT19]. In this talk, we will discuss a new result on privacy amplification by shuffling, which achieves the asymptotically optimal dependence in the local privacy parameter. Our result is based on a new proof strategy which is simpler than previous approaches, and extends to a lightly weaker notion known as approximate differential privacy with nearly the same guarantees.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Vitaly Feldman and Kunal Talwar (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803">https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12803</a>).</p></blockquote></div>

<p>An <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06438">undergrad thesis</a> from North Carolina State University tries to tackle the question as to why computer science has used conferences as its main and most prestigious publication venues. The author Elijah Bouma-Sims gives a synopsis with some interesting follow up conversation in this <a href="https://twitter.com/ElijahBoumaSims/status/1439041100111548419">Twitter thread</a>.</p><p>The upshot is that the conference culture grew organically early in computing and just took hold as the field grew. My personal non-scientific theory is that technology not available to earlier fields, namely jet airplanes, allowed CS to have national and international meetings that researchers could regularly attend. Before that conferences in more established fields like math were held either locally (<a href="http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/sectional.html">AMS sectional meetings</a>) or less often (<a href="https://www.mathunion.org/icm/icm-2022">ICM</a> held every four years), traditions that continue to this day.</p><p>Covid has temporarily suspended fully on-site conferences, and new technologies allow us to have virtual meetings. It's still not clear what will be the new normal for conferences.

We propose a diagonalization-based approach to several important questions in proof complexity. We illustrate this approach in the context of the algebraic proof system IPS and in the context of propositional proof systems more generally.

We give an explicit sequence of CNF formulas $\{\phi_n\}$ such that VNP$\neq$VP iff there are no polynomial-size IPS proofs for the formulas $\phi_n$. This provides the first natural equivalence between proof complexity lower bounds and standard algebraic complexity lower bounds. Our proof of this fact uses the implication from IPS lower bounds to algebraic complexity lower bounds due to Grochow and Pitassi together with a diagonalization argument: the formulas $\phi_n$ themselves assert the non-existence of short IPS proofs for formulas encoding VNP$\neq$VP at a different input length. Our result also has meta-mathematical implications: it gives evidence for the difficulty of proving strong lower bounds for IPS within IPS.

More generally, for any strong enough propositional proof system $R$ we propose a new explicit hard candidate, the iterated $R$-lower bound formulas, which inductively asserts the non-existence of short $R$ proofs for formulas encoding this same statement at a different input length. We show that these formulas are unconditionally hard for Resolution following recent results of Atserias and Muller and of Garlik. We further give evidence in favour of this hypothesis for other proof systems.</div>

<p>Though I singled out a mask study <a href="https://www.argmin.net/2021/09/13/effect-size/">in the last post</a>, I’ve had a growing discomfort with statistical modeling and significance more generally. Statistical models explicitly describe the probability of outcomes of experiments in terms of specific variables of individuals from a population. Such statistical models bring with them a host of assumptions and powers. But when are they appropriate for deducing significance of the outcomes of experiments? Here, I’ll argue that they are almost never appropriate in most settings, and, moreover, they can result in confidence intervals that rarely contain the correct parameters.</p>

<p>Note that in order to sample from some population, we need not assume that the population is <em>itself</em> random. An experimenter can choose to sample one individual from a larger pool at random even when the pool is a deterministic collection. Similarly, the experimenter can randomly assign each member of the pool to a group for experimentation even when the pool is deterministic. We need not build a statistical model of our population in order to study it experimentally.</p>

<p>But the convention in much scientific practice entangles the randomness used in survey and experiment design with the randomness of the natural world. The dominant convention in experimental sciences is to assert the existence of a probability distribution from which all observations in an experiment are samples. That is, most analyses begin with the assumption that the population is itself a stochastic entity whose statistical properties can be accurately modeled. Such probabilistic modeling is immediately problematic. We are forced to confront the notion of probability itself. What does the probability of an event mean? Is a Bayesian or Frequentist viewpoint more correct? What does it mean to sample a natural process?</p>

<p>My perspective on the pitfalls of probabilistic modeling has been heavily influenced by the writings of David Freedman. Freedman advocates for a pragmatic approach to statistical modeling. “<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Preprints/611.pdf">Probability is just a property of a mathematical model intended to describe some features of the natural world. For the model to be useful, it must be shown to be in good correspondence with the system it describes.</a>” This is the less pithy, but more prescriptive version of Box’s famous and tiresome aphorism “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”</p>

<p>Model building and validation requires deep domain knowledge for a task at hand. One of my favorite models is Ohm’s law, which states that the current that flows across a conductive material is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. Due to thermal noise, the actual model is</p>

\[\small{
  \text{current} = \text{material constant} \times \text{voltage} + \text{noise}}\]

<p>And the noise is Gaussian white noise. This model has been extensively tested and is a foundation of all circuit design. Remarkably, this simple formula describes complex electronic behavior. Physics is full of amazing examples of statistical models that accurately predict the outcome of experiments to a dozen significant figures.</p>

<p>But in biology, medicine, social science, and economics, our models are much less accurate and less grounded in natural laws. Most of the time, models are selected because they are convenient, not because they are plausible, well motivated from phenomenological principles, or even empirically validated. Freedman built a cottage industry around pointing out how poorly motivated many of the common statistical models are.</p>

<p>A particular example called out by Freedman is the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27645896">ubiquitous logistic regression model</a>. Freedman observed that in a variety of randomized control trials, experimenters would “correct” the estimates of their randomized controlled trials by “controlling for fixed effects” with logistic regression. Controlling for fixed effects is pernicious jargon that means “set up a regression problem with all of the variables that one thinks make their effect size look too small, and then solve the regression as an attempt to remove the influence of these variables.” It is most common in observational studies, but many insist it is appropriate in the context of randomized controlled trials as well. This convention of correction persists in the present, and I highlighted similar corrections in my last post. Freedman argues that such corrections are misguided, especially in the context of randomized trials.</p>

<p>To understand the motivation for using logistic in the first place, I need to tell you what an odds ratio is. Experiments are often interested in estimating an odds ratio of particular outcomes. The odds of an outcome is the number of individuals with a positive outcome divided by the number of individuals with a negative outcome. If the odds of winning a lottery are one million to one, that means that for every person that wins, one million people lose.</p>

<p>In the context of randomized experiments, let’s suppose that when given a treatment, M out of N individuals will have a favorable outcome, and without treatment only Q out of N will have a positive outcome Then the odds ratio is simply the ratio of the odds of the outcome with and without treatment</p>

\[\small{
\frac{M}{N-M} \cdot \frac{N-Q}{Q}\,.}\]

<p>When the odds ratio is large, we deem a treatment to be highly effective.</p>

<p>Logistic regression posits that individuals have a vector of features $Z$ that influence the odds of the effectiveness of treatment. Specifically, if $Y$ is the indicator of the desired outcome and $X$ is indicator of treatment, the logistic regression model asserts the log of the odds the outcome is a linear function of the treatment and the selected features. Since the model assumes the population is random, we can write the fraction of individuals with a positive outcome as probability. With this identification, the assumption of logistic regression is</p>

\[\small{
\log  \frac{p(Y=1 | X,Z ) }{ 1-p(Y=1 | X,Z) } = \beta X + \gamma^\top Z + \alpha \,.}\]

<p>This model is convenient if we are interested in odds ratios. In the logistic model, no matter what the covariate $Z$, the odds ratio is</p>

\[\small{
\frac{p(Y=1 | X=1,Z ) } {1-p(Y=1| X=1,Z) }  \cdot \frac{1-p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)}{p(Y=1 | X=0, Z)} = e^\beta\,.}\]

<p>Hence, if we can estimate beta, we can estimate the odds ratio. And if we can estimate the variance of beta, we can compute confidence intervals over our odds ratio estimates.</p>

<p>But all of this assumes that the model is correct! If the logistic model is not correct, then our confidence intervals are meaningless. Or at least, they are not confidence intervals around any true notion of odds ratios.</p>

<p>It’s almost always reasonable to be suspicious of this logistic model. It is first asserting that the odds ratio is a constant for a fixed covariate $Z$. That is, all subjects experience the same proportional effect of treatment. Even less realistically, the model asserts that the outcome is positive for an individual $i$ with treatment value $X_i$ and covariate value $Z_i$ if</p>

\[\small{
  U_i  \leq \alpha + \beta X_i + \gamma^\top Z_i\,,}\]

<p>where $U_i$ is a random variable sampled from the logistic distribution. The model assumes the $U_i$ are independent of the treatment and the covariates, the $U_i$ are independent across all of the individuals, and the $U_i$ have a common logistic distribution. The only thing that differs between treatment and control is the value of the threshold on the left hand side. These are a lot of assumptions, and they are seldom verified or tested in papers where logistic regression is applied.</p>

<p>The question remains: does this matter? Do these modeling assumptions actually affect our inferences about effect size? Freedman provides an elegant argument demonstrating that logistic regression always overestimates the true odds ratio, and sometimes can do so quite poorly. He also shows that simply computing a plugin estimator of the odds ratio with no covariate adjustment at all is consistent in randomized controlled trials. That is, there is no need to adjust for covariates in randomized controlled trials if you want an accurate estimate of the odds ratio. Furthermore, covariate adjustments can lead to significant overestimation of the treatment’s effect size.</p>

<p>Rather than going through Freedman’s theoretical argument, it’s a bit more evocative to give an example. The following is gleaned from a helpful discussion with Joel Middleton. Suppose you sample 10000 children from a larger population where each child in the population has an equal chance of liking and disliking vegetables. We propose a treatment of bribing kids with a cookie to eat their veggies, and randomly assign this treatment to half of the subjects. Left untreated, veggie haters have a 20% probability of finishing their veggies, but veggie lovers have an 80% probability of eating their greens. When bribed with a cookie, veggie haters and veggie lovers have 25% and 85% of eating their vegetables, respectively.</p>

<p>An average child in the study has a probability of 50% of eating their veggies if in control and 55% if in treatment. The log odds ratio is thus</p>

\[\small{
  \log \frac{.55}{1−.55}−\log\frac{.5}{1−.5} \approx 0.2\,.}\]

<p>Now, when you instead run logistic regression, the coefficient of the treatment variable is larger than 0.2. Indeed, <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">when I try this in python</a>, running 1000 synthetic experiments, I find that the median point estimate is 0.32, which is, as promised, larger than the true log odds. Even more worrisome is the 95% confidence interval contains 0.2 only 38% of the time. Clearly, the confidence intervals are not accurate when the model is wrong.</p>

<p>When the true effect size is large, this discrepancy between the logistic regression estimate and the true log odds might not be that big a deal: your error bars are wrong, but the effect size is estimated in the correct direction. But the results of such logistic regression analyzes are regularly quoted as estimates of odds ratios (For example, look at any  observational study of vaccine effectiveness). The precision of these estimates is unfortunately lacking and misleading.</p>

<p>Even if the model <em>was</em> true, the same argument shows that the coefficient of the treatment variable overestimates the log-odds. This is demonstrated in the <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/argmin.net/code/logistic_logodds_example.ipynb">second example in the python notebook</a>. Even when the model is true, the coefficient of the treatment variable is an overestimate of the true log odds. If the model was true, one could at least say they had constructed a reasonable estimate of the change in odds for an individual under treatment. But if the model is wrong, there’s nothing we can say at all other than we have overestimated the effect size and our error bars might not contain the true odds with any certainty.</p>

<p>So what is the remedy here? The thing is, we already know the answer: if we randomized the assignment, we can estimate log odds by counting the number of positive outcomes under treatment and control, and then just plugging these values into the odds ratio. If you do this, you find an estimate whose median is precisely equal to the true log odds. No covariate adjustment is required.</p>

<p>This is merely one example showing why it is critical to decouple the randomness used to probe a system from the randomness inherent in its system itself. Statistical models are not necessary for statistical inference, but randomness itself is amazingly… let’s say… <em>useful</em> for understanding natural phenomena. I will spend the next few blogs reminding myself and you faithful blog readers that proper experiments, machine learning predictions, and statistical summarizations can all be designed without statistical models of populations. Perhaps the mathematical formalizations of randomized algorithms can suggest paths to reform conventional experimental formalism.</p></div>
