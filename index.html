<p>As part of my Ph.D. qualifying exam, I gave a survey talk on some of the recent progress in practical multi-party computation (MPC). After the talk, Omer Reingold asked me why so much progress on MPC happened in the last decade or so, given that the main theoretical groundwork for multiparty computation was laid out in the 1980s.  Omer’s question got me interested, so I looked at some MPC papers from over the years and talked to a few people who have been working on MPC for some time now. In this post, I want to share some of what I’ve learned about the history of the progress of MPC, a few answers to Omer’s question, and potentially a few takeaways on progress in science more broadly.</p>



<p>To give a bit of background, MPC is one of the most fundamental problems in cryptography. In particular, MPC protocols allow a set of parties, each of which holds its private input, to compute a joint function over their inputs, in a way that protects the confidentiality and integrity of the computation from an adversary that controls a subset of the parties and the communication channels. Defining this precisely requires a lot of care, yet for now, you can think of an MPC protocol as being secure, if the adversary can only cause as much damage as it can in an “ideal world” in which the computation is performed with the aid of a trusted incorruptible party. Intuitively, in such an ideal world, the adversary cannot do much more than choose its inputs, modify its output, or choose not to participate in the computation at all. </p>



<p>In the 1980s, a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4568207">sequence</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/28395.28420">of</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62213">works</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62214">initiated</a> the study of multiparty computation and established very powerful and general results, showing the feasibility of constructing protocols for securely computing any multi-party functionality in a variety of settings. Those results were mostly theoretical. In contrast, the last 15 years saw a growing interest in MPC from a more practical perspective. To put this rising interest in context, consider the following two graphs (data for the graphs is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IzfKDRqv6C9hSeD9TyosvCl9fknN2V3Ja4tQjy54y0A/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>).</p>

<p>This graph shows the time of a two-party secure computation of the AES block cipher over the years. That is the time it takes to evaluate AES(k,x), where one party holds a 128-bit key k to the block cipher, the other party holds a 256-bit data block x, and the output is 256-bit long. The measurements are from the original papers. There are different variants of this “benchmark”, in terms of the number of parties (2PC/MPC), the number of corrupted parties (honest/dishonest majority), precise security model (semi-honest/fully malicious), hardware, network (LAN/WAN), and cost model (single/batch execution), but, for concreteness, the graph only includes results in the batch-evaluation setting in the fully malicious two-party setting. </p>

<p>The second graph shows the number of papers on two-party computation, over the years. This is not a very well-defined characterization, but for simplicity, I looked at all the papers referenced from the relevant chapters in the <a href="https://securecomputation.org/">book on MPC</a> by Evans, Kolesnikov, and Rosulek. Admittedly, these are not all the papers in the area, there might be valuable indirect contributions that are missing, and, more importantly, the number of papers is a bit of a superficial metric. Yet, even with these caveats, I think this is helpful to get a general picture. On top of the flurry of academic research, MPC has also been thriving in the industry, with companies like <a href="https://www.curv.co/">Curv</a>, <a href="https://partisia.com/">Partisia</a>, <a href="https://sharemind.cyber.ee/">Sharemind</a>, <a href="https://www.unboundsecurity.com/">Unbound</a>, and others building MPC-based products and services.</p>



<p>The first graph shows quite impressive progress. In less than a decade, the time to securely compute AES in the two-party setting decreased by more than 60,000x, from more than 10 minutes to less than 10 milliseconds. (For reference, in the same period, CPU speeds increased <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-975+%40+3.33GHz&amp;id=841">roughly</a> <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/cpu.php?cpu=Intel+Core+i7-7740X+%40+4.30GHz&amp;id=3041">twofold</a>, and typical local-area network speeds increased from 1GB/S to 10GB/S.) The second graph illustrates the increase in the volume of research, which has enabled this progress. This includes advances such as <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/100216.100287">various</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336992.337028">increasingly</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-70583-3_40">efficient</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-46803-6_8">garbling</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3134053">techniques</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F11745853_30">more</a> <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.2627&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">efficient</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72540-4_4">cut</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_22">and</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-19571-6_20">choose</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40084-1_3">techniques</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-00457-5_22">for</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2508859.2516698">malicious security</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-20465-4_11">protocols</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_38">based on</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32009-5_40">information-theoretic</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2976749.2978357">message-authentication</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78372-7_6">codes</a>, <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/craig/craig-thesis.pdf">homomorphic</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2090236.2090262">encryption</a>, and many others. (See the EKR book for an overview of these techniques and more references.) The second graph also clearly shows the inflection point that happened about 15 years ago. This inflection point illustrates the premise of the question that has triggered this blog post.</p>



<p>I use the term inflection point, since progress in MPC never really stopped between the late 80s and the mid-2000s, and there was a lot of research in the interim period. For example, <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/187.pdf">oblivious</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008908.1008920">transfer</a>–one of the fundamental primitives used <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3812.3818">to</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-47721-7_17.pdf">build</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/62212.62215">MPC</a>–<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44750-4_9">received</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/237814.237996">a</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00208002">lot</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0054139">of</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/301250.301312">attention</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44987-6_8">and</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/365411.365502">saw</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-45146-4_9">significant</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-40061-5_27">progress</a>.

Other works developed special-purpose secure computation protocols for concrete applications such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/502223">secure auctions</a> and  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/293347.293350">private information retrieval</a>. Many of the techniques and ideas in these works were instrumental for the more recent progress.</p>



<p>Having said that, there still seems to have been a dip in the attention devoted to MPC for a certain period. One explanation that I’ve found interesting is that the powerful feasibility results from the early days made the problem seem “solved” from a theoretical point of view. As a result, interest in MPC within the theory community decreased. It took time before the interest ramped up again, this time more within the more-practically oriented crypto community. (Interestingly, since then, MPC found renewed interest in the theoretical cryptography community as well.)</p>



<p>One work that, to me, is a key point in the transition of MPC from theory to practice is the 2004 <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/13th-usenix-security-symposium/fairplay%E2%80%94-secure-two-party-computation-system">Fairplay paper</a>. This was the first full-fledged system that implemented generic secure function evaluation. I believe that, together with other early implementations of MPC-based systems (such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03549-4_20">the system</a> developed for the Danish sugar-beet auction and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88313-5_13">Sharemind system</a>), it played a pivotal role in accelerating practical research. I view it as a lesson on the value of “first systems”: they help to identify bottlenecks and discover new concerns, which are hard to predict without building an actual system. Moreover, such systems put “theory problems” on the radar of practitioners and demonstrate which ideas are closer to being practical.  In some sense, a system is an evidence that “the constants in the big-O have been worked out…and they are not astronomical.” Furthermore, when code is made public, follow-up works can build upon an initial system and improve on it more rapidly. A first system can mark the transition of an idea from pure theory to practice. It’s still fair to ask what determines the timing of the appearance of such a first system. One answer is that it often takes the right type of collaboration of researchers from different research communities, as seems to have been the case with “Fairplay”. </p>



<p>I think that external factors also played a role in the timing of events. Specifically, the growth of the Internet and the demand for security on the Internet stimulated a lot of interest and progress in applied cryptography. The late 1990s saw large-scale adoption of public-key cryptography with the successful development and deployment of SSL. More complex Internet applications began to appear later, including those that are inherently security-sensitive, like e-commerce. These applications stimulated interest in more advanced cryptographic tools, MPC being one of them. Indeed, MPC papers from that period discuss new Internet-driven applications as part of their motivation. </p>



<p>A final factor that I want to mention ties back to the first graph above. The fact that many works demonstrate their performance by measuring AES evaluation is, to me, an example of the value of standardized benchmarks. Such benchmarks help to evaluate new techniques and ideas within a certain area and can help progress on a particular dimension, partly because of the competitive element they add. As with any measurement, there is a risk of overfitting to the benchmark, rather than focusing on the true goal, but I think they are very helpful overall.</p>



<p>I am sure there are other valuable lessons to be learned from this case study. Moreover, I am quite certain that folks with more experience in the area have a much better perspective on the history of these developments than I do. I will be very happy to hear other perspectives!</p>

<em>Trust, but verify—Ronald Reagan</em><br />
<font color="#000000"></font></font></p><font color="#0044cc"><font color="#000000">
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/26/the-voting-paradox/group-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-18806"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/group.png?w=200&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-18806" /></a></p>
<p>
are researchers in the area of voting security. Some have worked in this area for decades, others for years, and some are new to the area. But they all signed a letter about election security—right after the last presidential election. The body of <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=118718">the letter</a> is also below.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we might look into the main paradox surrounding voting security.</p>
<p>
Peter G. Neumann and Rebecca Mercuri just published a <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252836-the-risks-of-election-believability-or-lack-thereof/fulltext">paper</a> in the CACM on voting security. It is titled <i>The Risks of Election Believability (or Lack Thereof)</i>. </p>
<p>They say: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Trustworthiness in elections is inherently a total-system problem <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" /> </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
So let’s look at election security.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Paradox </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
<i>The people who cast the votes don’t decide an election, the people who count the votes do—Joseph Stalin</i></p>
<p>
I am reluctant in citing Stalin. But I believe that he hit the mark. The key in any election, in the US or elsewhere, is how and by whom the votes are counted.  </p>
<p>
The issue with the letter, with the recent paper, and more is that the researchers seem to be caught in the middle between two points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li>
There is no evidence of voter fraud in the last presidential election. None. Zero. <p></p>
</li><li>
There is no proof of voting security in the last presidential election. None. Zero.
</li></ul>
<p>
This is the problem. We would like to believe that voting is fair and secure. We would like to believe that our election—especially for president—is fair and correct. But we really have no proof that this is true. We are left with desire to make elections safer, but take the position that there is no issue with them. </p>
<p>
Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Letter </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Here is the letter. I think they miss saying things as bluntly as Stalin does. But they do say essentially the same.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We are specialists in election security, having studied the security of voting machines, voting systems, and technology used for government elections for decades.</em></p><em>
<p>
We and other scientists have warned for many years that there are security weaknesses in voting systems and have advocated that election systems be better secured against malicious attack. As the National Academies recently concluded, “There is no realistic mechanism to fully secure vote casting and tabulation computer systems from cyber threats.” However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election.</p>
<p>
Anyone asserting that a US election was “rigged” is making an extraordinary claim, one that must be supported by persuasive and verifiable evidence. Merely citing the existence of technical flaws does not establish that an attack occurred, much less that it altered an election outcome. It is simply speculation.</p>
<p>
The presence of security weaknesses in election infrastructure does not by itself tell us that any election has actually been compromised. Technical, physical, and procedural safeguards complicate the task of maliciously exploiting election systems, as does monitoring of likely adversaries by law enforcement and the intelligence community. Altering an election outcome involves more than simply the existence of a technical vulnerability.</p>
<p>
We are aware of alarming assertions being made that the 2020 election was “rigged” by exploiting technical vulnerabilities. However, in every case of which we are aware, these claims either have been unsubstantiated or are technically incoherent. To our collective knowledge, no credible evidence has been put forth that supports a conclusion that the 2020 election outcome in any state has been altered through technical compromise.</p>
</em><p><em>
That said, it is imperative that the US continue working to bolster the security of elections against sophisticated adversaries. At a minimum, all states should employ election security practices and mechanisms recommended by experts to increase assurance in election outcomes, such as post-election risk-limiting audits. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The letter is well written, but <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cdots%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\dots}" class="latex" /> They say in the letter: </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> However, notwithstanding these serious concerns, we have never claimed that technical vulnerabilities have actually been exploited to alter the outcome of any US election. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems to be a problem. How do you get people to <i>look both ways when crossing the street</i>, when you have also basically asserted: “No one has ever been hit by a car when crossing the street.”</p>
<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/26/the-voting-paradox/cs/" rel="attachment wp-att-18795"><img width="276" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cs.png?resize=276%2C183&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18795" height="183" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
We believe that election security is a real issue. Perhaps our single point is: Even if we do not believe that any fraud happen in the past, we must agree to make the voting process secure. We must use all our insights to make elections not only fair, but believed to be fair.</p>
<p>
Look both ways. </p>
<p>
Ken notes that “Trust but verify” was first the Russian proverb <i>Doveryay no proveryay</i>, but that its origins are <a href="https://www.rbth.com/lifestyle/330521-reagan-trust-but-verify-chernobyl">unclear</a> even to Russians.  He adds that besides <i>how</i> and <i>by whom</i> there is also the issue of <i>when</i> votes are counted.  The warnings he gave in our election-eve <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2020/11/03/the-election-night-time-warp/">post</a> were reflected in <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/false-claim-about-bidens-win-probability/">claims</a> made in the early December Texas attorney general filing.</p></font></font></div>

<div class="content">
<p>About one year ago, I became aware of the course "Ethics and Accountability in Computer Science" designed and taught by <a href="https://riceacademy.rice.edu/junior-fellows/dr-rodrigo-ferreira" target="_blank">Rodrigo Ferreira</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/" target="_blank">Moshe Y. Vardi</a> at Rice University. The goals and high-level structure of the course, as well as its context, are described in an informative and thoughtful <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vardi/papers/sigcse21.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> by Moshe and Rodrigo that appears in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3408877" target="_blank">Proceedings of the  52nd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE ’21)</a>, which I strongly recommend.

Therefore, after having invited Rodrigo to deliver a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ficetcs.ru.is%2Fwebinars%2Fdeep_ethics.mp4&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9ux4zX7PThxWzwoNa_yyZNa-ILA" target="_blank">webinar on the course</a> at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/gssi.it/csgssi/seminars-and-events/joint-ice-tcs-csgssi-virtual-seminar" target="_blank">ICE-TCS+GSSI webinar series</a>, I decided that, as an experiment, I would offer a version of the Rice University course to master students in computer science, language technology and software engineering at Reykjavik University during our spring semester 2021. </p><p>Mine was a foolhardy decision for a variety of reasons. However, I have always believed that computer scientists should strive to be the 21st century Renaissance men and women, and bridge the gap between C. P. Snow's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures" target="_blank">"two cultures"</a>. Indeed, to quote <a href="https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/~eal/" target="_blank">Edward A. Lee</a> freely, to my mind technologists ought to be amongst the greatest humanists of our age. Despite my other commitments, offering a version of the Ferreira-Vardi course at Reykjavik University felt like the right thing to do at this time. </p><p>I taught the course over twelve weeks to a varied group of eight students, in cooperation with <a href="http://claudiopedica.com/" target="_blank">Claudio Pedica</a>. Thanks to the constant support I received from Rodrigo Ferreira, I lived to tell the tale and I hope that I managed to do some justice to the truly excellent course that Moshe and Rodrigo put together. Having a dream team of students with a variety of cultural backgrounds made the course extremely interesting and a learning experience for me. I had to refresh my memory of the philosophy I studied at high school in Italy in a previous life, learn some modern moral philosophy I had not met at school (such as the work by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anscombe/" target="_blank">Elisabeth Anscombe</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philippa-foot/" target="_blank">Philippa Foot</a>, amongst others), read a substantial amount of new material (some of it fresh off the press as the course was unfolding) and broaden my horizons. I could not have asked for a better intellectual experience and the students in the course, from Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland and the Netherlands taught me well, kept me on my toes and stimulated me to keep reading material related to ethics even now that the course is over. <br /></p><p>Teaching the course reinforced my belief that a course on ethics and on the impact that our field has on social justice should be required for all students in computer science. If you plan to run such a course, I strongly recommend that you consider the Ferreira-Vardi course as a blueprint. <br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

parameters known as, for instance, vertex and edge ranking number. While they
are NP-hard to determine in general, linear-time algorithms exist for trees.
Motivated by a correspondence with Dasgupta's objective for hierarchical
clustering we consider the total rather than maximum depth of vertices as an
alternative objective for minimization. For vertex partition trees this leads
to a new parameter with a natural interpretation as a measure of robustness
against vertex removal.
</p>
<p>As tools for the study of this family of parameters we show that they have
similar recursive expressions and prove a binary tree rotation lemma. The new
parameter is related to trivially perfect graph completion and therefore
intractable like the other three are known to be. We give polynomial-time
algorithms for both total-depth variants on caterpillars and on trees with a
bounded number of leaf neighbors. For general trees, we obtain a
2-approximation algorithm.

a minimum number of vertices is a fundamental problem in algorithmic graph
theory. This (s,z)-separation problem is well-known to be polynomial solvable
and serves as an important primitive in many applications related to network
connectivity. We study the NP-hard temporal (s,z)-separation problem on
temporal graphs, which are graphs with fixed vertex sets but edge sets that
change over discrete time steps. We tackle this problem by restricting the
layers (i.e., graphs characterized by edges that are present at a certain point
in time) to specific graph classes. We restrict the layers of the temporal
graphs to be either all split graphs or all permutation graphs (both being
perfect graph classes) and provide both intractability and tractability
results. In particular, we show that in general the problem remains NP-hard
both on temporal split and temporal permutation graphs, but we also spot
promising islands of fixed-parameter tractability particularly based on
parameterizations that measure the amount of "change over time".

solve a continous relaxation and then round the fractional solution. For the
latter, the framework of contention resolution schemes (or CR schemes)
introduced by Chekuri, Vondrak, and Zenklusen, has become a general and
successful tool. A CR scheme takes a fractional point $x$ in a relaxation
polytope, rounds each coordinate $x_i$ independently to get a possibly
non-feasible set, and then drops some elements in order to satisfy the
independence constraints. Intuitively, a CR scheme is $c$-balanced if every
element $i$ is selected with probability at least $c \cdot x_i$.
</p>
<p>It is known that general matroids admit a $(1-1/e)$-balanced CR scheme, and
that this is (asymptotically) optimal. This is in particular true for the
special case of uniform matroids of rank one. In this work, we provide a simple
CR scheme with a balancedness factor of $1 - e^{-k}k^k/k!$ for uniform matroids
of rank $k$, and show that this is optimal. This result generalizes the $1-1/e$
optimal factor for the rank one (i.e. $k=1$) case, and improves it for any
$k&gt;1$. Moreover, this scheme generalizes into an optimal CR scheme for
partition matroids.

binary searching with respect to average query complexity while retaining
minmax optimality. The method is shown to require $O(\log_2\log_2 n)$ queries
on average while never exceeding $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ queries in the worst
case, i.e. the minmax bound of binary searching. Our average results assume a
uniform distribution hypothesis similar to those of prevous authors under which
the expected query complexity of interpolation search of $O(\log_2\log_2 n)$ is
known to be optimal. Hence our method turns out to be optimal with respect to
both minmax and average performance. We further provide robustness guarantees
and perform several numerical experiments with both artificial and real data.
Our results suggest that time savings range roughly from a constant factor of
10\% to 50\% to a logarithmic factor spanning orders of magnitude when
different metrics are considered.

gradients of all $m$ objective functions per iteration, produce after $k$
iterations a measure of proximity to critical conditions that is upper-bounded
by $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ when the objective functions are assumed to have
$L-$Lipschitz continuous gradients; i.e. they require $O(m/\epsilon^2)$
gradient and function computations to produce a measure of proximity to
critical conditions bellow some target $\epsilon$. We reduce this to
$O(1/\epsilon^2)$ with a method that requires only a constant number of
gradient and function computations per iteration; and thus, we obtain for the
first time a multi-objective descent-type method with a query complexity cost
that is unaffected by increasing values of $m$. For this, a brand new
multi-objective descent direction is identified, which we name the
\emph{central descent direction}, and, an incremental approach is proposed.
Robustness properties of the central descent direction are established,
measures of proximity to critical conditions are derived, and, the incremental
strategy for finding solutions to the multi-objective problem is shown to
attain convergence properties unattained by previous methods. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first method to achieve this with no additional
a-priori information on the structure of the problem, such as done by
scalarizing techniques, and, with no pre-known information on the regularity of
the objective functions other than Lipschitz continuity of the gradients.

relational coarsest partition on a transition system. We provide the first
linear time algorithm to calculate strong bisimulation using parallel random
access machines (PRAMs). More precisely, with $n$ states, $m$ transitions and
$|\mathit{Act}|\leq m$ action labels, we provide an algorithm on $max(n,m)$
processors that calculates strong bisimulation in time $O(n+|\mathit{Act}|)$
and space $O(n+m)$. The best-known PRAM algorithm has time complexity $O(n\log

studying the wide class of (input-free) symmetry-breaking tasks, e.g., leader
election, in synchronous fault-free anonymous systems. We show that it is
possible to redefine solvability of a task "locally", i.e., for each simplex of
the protocol complex individually, without requiring any global consistency.
However, this approach has a drawback: it eliminates the topological aspect of
the computation, since a single facet has a trivial topological structure. To
overcome this issue, we introduce a "projection" $\pi$ of both protocol and
output complexes, where every simplex $\sigma$ is mapped to a complex
$\pi(\sigma)$; the later has a rich structure that replaces the structure we
lost by considering one single facet at a time.
</p>
<p>To show the significance and applicability of our topological approach, we
derive necessary and sufficient conditions for solving leader election in
synchronous fault-free anonymous shared-memory and message-passing models. In
both models, we consider scenarios in which there might be correlations between
the random values provided to the nodes. In particular, different parties might
have access to the same randomness source so their randomness is not
independent but equal. Interestingly, we find that solvability of leader
election relates to the number of parties that possess correlated randomness,
either directly or via their greatest common divisor, depending on the specific
communication model.

A
palindromic substring $w$ of a string $T$ is called a minimal unique
palindromic substring (MUPS) of $T$ if $w$ occurs only once in $T$ and any
proper palindromic substring of $w$ occurs at least twice in $T$. MUPSs are
utilized for answering the shortest unique palindromic substring problem, which
is motivated by molecular biology [Inoue et al., 2018]. Given a string $T$ of
length $n$, all MUPSs of $T$ can be computed in $O(n)$ time. In this paper, we
study the problem of updating the set of MUPSs when a character in the input
string $T$ is substituted by another character. We first analyze the number $d$
of changes of MUPSs when a character is substituted, and show that $d$ is in
$O(\log n)$. Further, we present an algorithm that uses $O(n)$ time and space
for preprocessing, and updates the set of MUPSs in $O(\log\sigma + (\log\log
n)^2 + d)$ time where $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. We also propose a variant
of the algorithm, which runs in optimal $O(d)$ time when the alphabet size is
constant.

<p>As we come out of a pandemic with online teaching and research collaborations, how much do we actually need the university?</p><p>Theoretical research in computer science, math and elsewhere it hardly slowed down with everyone hunkered down at home, and when it did it was more because of supervising kids with their on-line learning than being away from the university. Collaborating with those around the world was basically the same as collaborating with your colleagues on campus.</p><p>Many courses, especially the larger ones, worked about as well on-line as they do in person.</p><p>The pandemic is accelerating changes already in place. Before say 1960, the fastest travel for the masses was on train and boats and fast communication limited to expensive phone calls. You needed strong colleagues, a strong library and a strong support staff to be a successful academic. Traveling to meet colleagues and attend conferences was a luxury that few could do often.</p><p>The 60's gave us air travel though it wasn't until the 90's that we could readily send academic papers electronically. It's really only recently that we have the infrastructure to allow high-quality teaching and research collaboration online.</p><p>Suppose universities now just disappeared. Professors would be free agents, supported by grants and tuition from students taking their on-line courses and consulting. Students would pick and choose courses from the best instructors, their "transcript" being recorded on a blockchain-like database. PhD students would be more of an apprenticeship, a low salary in exchange for personalized mentoring from a professor. </p><p>For the experimental sciences, there would be a set of national labs that professors could join.</p><p>Startups would create apps to enable all these things, professors would just become yet another piece of the gig economy. Superstar academics can pull in large salaries, the rest would struggle to make a decent wage--not that different from actors and musicians. </p><p>Don't worry, universities aren't going anywhere soon. Or are they?</p></div>

<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Yesterday, I had fun doing an open-ended Q&amp;A at the <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/">Astral Codex Ten</a> weekly online meetup.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEYUt1tJlck">See here</a> for the YouTube video.  The questions were mainly about quantum computing, but ranged over various other topics as well, including education policy, the Great Stagnation, and what my biggest disagreements with Scott Alexander are.</p>



<p>In other news, last week I gave my talk about quantum supremacy at the (virtual, of course) <a href="https://quantumscienceseminar.com/videos/">Quantum Science Seminar</a>, organized by Sebastian Blatt and others.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeF7T9Bc1B0">See here</a> for the YouTube video.  Since I (alas) needed to leave after an hour sharp, the organizers asked if they could send me additional questions in writing and have me answer them.  I said sure, as long as I could also post the Q&amp;A on this blog!  So without further ado…</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> As you said, in computer science it’s difficult to prove that things are hard. From a computer science perspective, to what extent is “quantum supremacy” something absolute, and to what extent is it a shifting bar that depends on how good our classical hardware and algorithms are?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> It’s kind of like the question “can computers beat the best humans at chess?” The latter question also involves a non-absolute shifting bar – maybe humans are getting better! Or maybe they simply haven’t figured out how to beat the computers yet! So how can we say “computer supremacy” has been decisively achieved? Nevertheless, one can clearly see a phase transition, with Deep Blue in 1996-1997, where the burden of proof shifted massively from one side to the other, and has stayed there ever since. Even if humans are getting better, the computers have also gotten better, and at such an insane rate that humans seem to have no chance of ever again catching up.</p>



<p>From a theoretical standpoint, that’s exactly what we might expect to happen with quantum supremacy experiments – simply because they involve tasks that have polynomial scaling for quantum computers, but (as far as we know) exponential scaling for classical computers, where each additional qubit roughly doubles the classical resources required. In analyzing concrete quantum supremacy experiments, I’d say that the goal is not to pin down the exact factor by which they’re beating this or that classical simulation (the answers will change rapidly anyway, and depend on all sorts of low-level details), but simply to figure out whether or not we’ve entered that phase transition.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you generally think about improvements in tensor network methods as a challenge to quantum supremacy and the recent simulation of the supremacy result in Beijing?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> I <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5371">blogged about this here</a>. It was a clever paper, which showed that if you focus narrowly on spoofing the linear cross-entropy benchmark used by Google, then there’s a classical algorithm to do that much faster than had been previously pointed out, by generating many samples that all share most of their bits in common (e.g., that all agree on the first 30 of the 53 bits). But many people remain unaware that, if you just changed the benchmark – for example, if you insisted that the returned samples not only pass the linear cross-entropy benchmark, but also be sufficiently different – then this classical spoofing strategy wouldn’t work and we’d be back to the previous status quo.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do you need a random circuit to test the device, and also why is this more interesting/useful than doing something very specific many times to test the device?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> The reasons to use random quantum circuits are simply that<br />(1) they generate complicated entangled states on all the qubits nearly as rapidly as it’s possible to do so – indeed, we now have theoretical results that give a detailed understanding of this process, and<br />(2) random circuits seem to have about as little “usable structure” (which a classical simulation might exploit) as it’s possible to have.<br />Eventually, of course, we’d like to run actually useful circuits (say, those that arise in Shor’s factoring algorithm), which will typically have regular patterns and be extremely far from random! But then more qubits will be needed to get an advantage over classical computers. It’s not terribly surprising for the <em>first</em> advantage over classical to be via random quantum circuits, which in some sense “maximally exploit” the hardware resources available.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Have you heard of/what do you think about the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21119-1">recent NP-verification experiment</a> using a quantum optical setup from Paris?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> That experiment was actually based on a protocol that Beigi, Fefferman, Drucker, Shor, and I <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0802">proposed back in 2008</a>. It’s crucial for people to understand that there’s no claimed speedup here for <em>solving</em> any NP-complete problem. We’re talking about a more arcane task: namely, proving to someone that an NP-complete problem has a solution by sending them a small number of qubits. Even there, the protocol depends on the ability to send two quantum states that are guaranteed <em>not</em> to be entangled with each other; also, the communication savings is “only” polynomial rather than exponential (in our original protocol, roughly √n qubits where n classical bits would have been needed). Nevertheless, it’s always fun to see a real experiment implementing some version of something that you worked out on paper, even if you already knew it would work!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> If the difficulty for classical simulation is related to the Hilbert space dimension, has it been formally proven that an ideal analog classical computer cannot outperform a quantum computer?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> This is not a question of “formal proof” but of physics. In my view, we already know deep reasons why, in our universe, analog classical computers are unlikely to be able to do anything that can’t be efficiently simulated using a standard digital computer. (In other words, why analog classical computers don’t violate the “Extended Church-Turing Thesis.”) Those reasons have to do with nonlinear dynamics chaotically amplifying even the tiniest errors in an analog device. Or, if you really want to push this discussion to the bitter end, they have to do with the breakdown in our picture of a smooth spacetime that’s expected to occur at the Planck scale, of ~10<sup>-33</sup> centimeters and ~10<sup>-43</sup> seconds, for reasons of black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. Crucially, neither of these issues apply to quantum computation. The former doesn’t apply because of quantum error correction  and fault-tolerance, which have the effect of “discretizing” continuous errors; while the latter doesn’t apply because as far as anyone knows today, quantum mechanics (unlike theories that assume a smooth spacetime) is exactly true.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> [In the comparison between quantum and classical computation], what do we mean by “classical resources” here? Do we mean something parochial like “resources obeying non-quantum laws that are available to us humans on Earth?” Or is any classical resource fair game, no matter its size and classical equations of motion? In that case, doesn’t demonstrating quantum supremacy require demonstrating that the quantum computer exceeds the capabilities of, say, a classical computer the size of the solar system that exploits some CTC (closed timelike curve)?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> If CTCs were possible, that would be a revolution in physics even greater than quantum mechanics! Leaving CTCs aside, though, cosmology and quantum gravity seem to impose a limit of roughly 10<sup>122</sup> on the number of bits (and the number of operations on the bits) that any computer that fit inside the observable universe could possibly have. And if you envision that cosmological computer as a classical one, then it shouldn’t take impossibly long for us to build quantum computers that can outperform it on some tasks: indeed, a device with ~400 qubits should already be enough! But of course we’re not there yet: with 50-60 qubits, QCs right now are “merely” challenging the largest classical computers currently available on earth (again, on contrived sampling tasks), rather than the largest that could fit in the observable universe.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is a quantum state (superposition or entangled state) inherently more fragile than a classical state?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> Because when information from the state (say, whether a qubit is 0 or 1, or which path a photon takes through a beamsplitter network) “leaks out” into the environment, the information effectively becomes entangled with the environment, which damages the state in a measurable way.  Indeed, it now appears to an observer as a mixed state rather than a pure state, so that interference between the different components can no longer happen. This is a fundamental, justly-famous feature of quantum information that’s not shared by classical information.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Given that we have noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, what do you see as the fundamental role of noise in the discussion on quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. Is it simply a question of less noise is better, or are there things that cannot be done if there is noise?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> There will always be <em>some</em> noise. The big question, about any given platform, is whether the noise is low enough that you can start usefully error-correcting it away, or whether the noise is so high that there’s no point (i.e., whether you’re above or below the “fault-tolerance threshold”).  Until you start doing error-correction, most experts believe there’s a severe limit to how far you can scale: probably to quantum computations involving a few hundred qubits at most. Whereas once you have error-correction, at least in principle the sky’s the limit.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> You used the Wright brothers as an example where an airplane that was not practically useful itself pioneered the path to useful flight. In what sense to the sampling experiments of Google and USTC also pioneer that path for what we need for the future of quantum computing, or to what extent do you see them as niche examples of quantum supremacy?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> I think the majority of what Google did, in integrating 53 superconducting qubits, making them programmable, etc. – and especially in characterizing the noise in a system at that scale – will be directly useful going forward. Indeed, that’s a large part of why they did it!  Likewise, a lot of what USTC did, in integrating hundreds of beamsplitters, photon sources, and photodetectors, could be directly relevant to building a universal optical quantum computer. On the other hand, it’s true that both groups took shortcuts with the immediate goal of quantum supremacy in mind. As an example, Google’s chip uses a particular 2-qubit gate that was chosen, not because it shows up naturally in any application, but simply because it’s extra-hard to simulate using tensor network contraction algorithms, so it let them get to quantum supremacy faster than if they’d used a more conventional 2-qubit gate like the CNOT.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> To what extent does the measured circuit fidelity of 0.2% in the Google experiment limit the usability of this system for other computations?</p>



<p><strong>SCOTT:</strong> Oh, we don’t know of anything particularly useful to do with Google’s Sycamore chip – that is, anything that you couldn’t do much more easily without it – other than<br />(1) quantum supremacy demonstrations,<br />(2) <em>possibly</em> the generation of cryptographically certified random bits, and<br />(3) of course, calibration experiments that tell you about the behavior of integrated superconducting qubits and thereby help you iterate to the next device.<br />But things are developing rapidly – the best circuit fidelity that was achievable in 2019 is not necessarily the best now, or the best that will be achieved in another year or two.</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Update (May 25):</span></strong> <strong>Please, no new questions</strong>; just discussion of the existing questions and answers! I had hoped to get some work done today; I hadn’t planned on another ask-me-anything session. Thanks!</p></div>

Ayanna Howard is this year’s winner of the ACM Athena Lecturer <a href="https://awards.acm.org/athena">Award</a>. She works in robotics and is <a href="https://engineering.osu.edu/about/office-dean/about-dean-ayanna-howard">Dean</a> of Engineering at Ohio State. She was previously Chair of the School of Interactive Computing at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>
Today Ken and I congratulate her and also recognize past winners of the award.</p>
<p>
The award is not for lecturing. Here is the description:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Initiated in 2006, the ACM Athena Lecturer Award celebrates women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science. The award carries a cash prize of $25,000, with financial support provided by Two Sigma. The Athena Lecturer gives an invited talk at a major ACM conference of her choice. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><h2> Howard’s Research </h2><p></p>
<p>
Ayanna Howard’s research spans three interconnected areas of robotics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Outer Space Robotics:</b> She did early work for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Here is a 2002 <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/ayanna_howard.html">article</a> that leads with her work on the “Safe Navigation Rover.” <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Inner Space Robotics:</b> This work involves interaction and assistive technologies. It includes her co-founding the company <a href="http://zyrobotics.com/about/">Zyrobotics</a>, which creates mobile therapy and educational technology tools for children. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Inner Mindspace Robotics:</b> On what grounds can we <em>trust</em> robots? How can they be programmed to avoid biases in their interactions with human beings? Can the algorithms they use be certified for <em>fairness?</em> (We had some recent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/10/making-algorithms-fair/">thoughts</a> of our own on the last subject.)
</li></ul>
<p>
There are technical connections that flow from a whole-situation/whole-person approach. Her NASA landing and navigation systems were not designed simply to solve a computer-vision and calculus problem of finding the flattest terrain. Instead, the design expressly maps visual and sensor readings into a knowledge and logic-based system of human reasoning. Then the system either judges or makes recommendations to human controllers. This kind of approach naturally flows into assessing the robotic judgments for blind spots and bias. Most in particular, she tries to combat a human tendency of uncritical acceptance of personal assistants. She wants to facilitate humans to challenge the robots and have the robots modulate their reasoning and behavior accordingly.</p>
<p>
She was inspired as a child by the TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bionic_Woman">The Bionic Woman</a>. Adding “-nic” after “bio” took what could have been influence to go into medicine into an avenue that channeled her childhood love of mathematics.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> A Puzzle </h2><p></p>
<p>
I designed a word-search puzzle by feeding terms from the award to a web app for creating them. We wondered if it was silly to include it. But maybe the puzzle is not so silly—besides that it was created by a ‘bot—if you think in these terms:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> How might a robot get the most out of solving it? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Here is the grid—see if you can find the words in it. The key is at the end.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/05/24/acm-athena-lecturer-award/pu/" rel="attachment wp-att-18774"><img width="400" alt="" src="https://i1.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pu.png?resize=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter wp-image-18774" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>
From a human standpoint, three minutes is award level. But for a robot:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Of course, a robot could solve the puzzle in three microseconds by brute-force string matching along every row, column, and diagonal. But there is no challenge in that—it is not what we think of as human <em>reading</em>. <p></p>
</li><li>
To be human fun, the puzzle should be fairly dense and have a “wordscape” where parallel rows, columns, and diagonals are used. Once we find one word, we can often find neighbors more quickly, and that feels rewarding.
</li></ul>
<p>
That’s what we’re asking: is there a way to teach robots to solve these puzzles in more human ways? OK, it’s too simple. But we like to put a peg down on a simple example, then run a line into the heart of the work, and ask: at what point does it cross the threshold of being nontrivial?</p>

Given polynomials $f,g,h\,\in \mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ such that $f=g/h$, where both $g$ and $h$ are computable by arithmetic circuits of size $s$, we show that $f$ can be computed by a circuit of size  $\poly(s,\deg(h))$.  This solves a special case of division elimination for high-degree circuits (Kaltofen'87 \&amp; WACT'16). The result is an exponential improvement over Strassen's classic result (Strassen'73) when $\deg(h)$ is $\poly(s)$ and $\deg(f)$ is $\exp(s)$, since the latter gives an upper bound of $\poly(s, \deg(f))$.

Further, we show that any univariate polynomial family $(f_d)_d$, defined by the initial segment of the power series expansion of rational function $g_d(x)/h_d(x)$ up to degree $d$ (i.e.~$f_d = g_d/h_d \bmod x^{d+1}$), where circuit size of $g$ is $s_d$ and degree of $g_d$ is at most $d$, can be computed by a circuit of size $\poly(s_d,\deg(h_d),\log d)$.
We also show a hardness result when the degrees of the rational functions are high (i.e.~$\Omega (d)$), assuming hardness of the integer factorization problem.</div>

<p>Holy crap.</p>



<p>In case you’re wondering how I spent such a milestone of a day: well, I spent hours of it at an important virtual grant review meeting with the Department of Defense.  Alas, when it came time for my own big presentation at that meeting—about what my students and I had done over the past five years to lay the theoretical foundations for the recent achievement of quantum computational supremacy—I’d uploaded the completely wrong PowerPoint file (it was something.pptx rather than something.ppt, where they <em>weren’t</em> two versions of the same presentation).  Sorting this out took about 10 minutes, destroyed my momentum, and wasted everyone’s time.  I partly blame the Microsoft Teams platform, whose limitations as conferencing software compared to Zoom necessitated emailing my presentation in the first place.  But of course, part of the blame rests with me.</p>



<p>I had to explain apologetically to the US Department of Defense that I’m no good with tech stuff—being a mere computer science PhD.  And unlike many of my colleagues (who I envy), back in my youth—for at age 40 I’m no longer young—I never had enough time to become <em>both</em> the kind of person who might earn a big grant to do quantum computing theory, <em>and</em> the kind of person who’d be minimally competent at the logistics of a review meeting for such a grant.</p>



<p></p><hr /><p></p>



<p>Forty years.  Seven-eighths of those years, aware of the finiteness of the speed of light and of its value.  Four-fifths of them, aware of the grislier details of the Holocaust.  Three-quarters of them, aware of what it means to write code.  Two-thirds of them, aware of polynomial versus exponential time.  More than half of them trying to understand the capabilities and limitations of quantum computers as my day job.  And then, rounding the corner, more than a third of the years writing this blog, a third of them being a professor, a quarter of them married, a fifth of them raising kids, a thirtieth of them in the midst of a global pandemic.</p>



<p>I didn’t even come <em>close </em>to achieving everything I hoped I would in my thirties.  At least a half-dozen major papers, ones I expected would’ve been finished years ago (on the mixing of coffee and cream, on complexity and firewalls and AdS/CFT, on certified random numbers from sampling-based quantum supremacy experiments, on the implications of the Raz-Tal oracle separation, …), still need to be revised or even written.  Other projects (e.g., the graphic novel about teaching math to Lily) were excitedly announced and then barely even started.  I never wrote most of my promised blog post about the continuum hypothesis, <em>or</em> the one about Stephen Wolfram’s recrudescent claims of a unified theory of physics.  And covid, which determined the world’s working conditions while we were running out the clock, turned out <em>not</em> to be a hyper-productive time for me.  That’s how you know I’m not Newton (well, it’s the not the only way you know).</p>



<p>Anyway, during the runup to it, one’s 40th birthday feels like a temporal singularity, where you have to compress more and more of what you’d hoped to achieve before age 40 as you get closer and closer to it, because what the hell is there on the other side? <em> The</em>y<em>‘re</em> over-40 and hence “old”; <em>you’re</em> under-40 and hence still “young.”</p>



<p>OK, but here I am on the other side right now, <em>the “old” side</em>, and I’m still here, still thinking and writing and feeling fairly continuous with my pre-singularity embodiment!  And so far, in 16 hours on this side, the most senile thing I’ve done has been to email the wrong file attachment and thereby ruin an important funding presenta… you know what, let’s not even go there.</p>



<p>If you feel compelled to give me a 40<sup>th</sup> birthday present, then just make it a comment on this post, as short or long as you like, about what anything I said or did meant for you.  I’m a total softie for that stuff.</p></div>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Abstract: In order to accurately predict an algorithm’s outcome and quality when it interacts with participants who have a stake in the outcome, we must design it to be robust to strategic manipulation. This is the subject of algorithmic mechanism design, which borrows ideas from game theory and economics to design robust algorithms. In this talk, I will show how results from the theoretical foundations of algorithmic mechanism design can be used to solve problems of societal concern.</p>
<p>I will overview recent work in this area in many different applications — housing, labor markets, carbon license allocations, health insurance markets, and more — as well as discuss open problems and directions ripe for tools from both mechanism design and general TCS.</p></blockquote></div>

<p>The City of Chicago yesterday agreed with the latest CDC guidelines that those of us fully vaccinated no longer have to wear masks in most settings. Lollapalooza, the big Chicago music festival, will be held in full capacity this summer. There are still some restrictions but barring any surprise setbacks should be mostly gone by the Fourth of July.</p><p>It's not appropriate to call the pandemic over. Too many countries are suffering and lack good access to vaccines or strong health care. But in most of the US vaccinations are readily available and it really feels like we are putting the pandemic in the past.</p><p>Variants that beat the vaccines could emerge. Vaccines could become ineffective over time. Too many still need to be vaccinated and too many don't want to do so. Typically problems start small and quickly get big by exponential growth but likely with enough warning if we need boosters or extra precautions. And all those who cut in line to get shots early are now my canaries for the effects wearing off.</p><p>What will this post-pandemic world look like? Continued virtual meetings from people who don't want to spend the 10-15 minutes to get across campus or to come to campus at all. A bigger move to casual dress, even in the corporate world. No more snow days. Changes in ways we won't expect. </p><p>We all have our different attitudes but I'm ready to move on. Time to start the "after times".</p></div>

<h3>Quasi-polynomial algorithms for telling if a knot is trivial</h3>


<p>Marc Lackenby announced a quasi-polynomial time algorithm to decide whether a given knot is the unknot! This is a big breakthrough. This question is known to be both in NP and in coNP. See <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/greg-kuperberg-it-is-in-np-to-tell-if-a-knot-is-knotted-under-grh/">this post</a>, and updates there in the <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/greg-kuperberg-it-is-in-np-to-tell-if-a-knot-is-knotted-under-grh/#comment-43442">comment section</a>.</p>



<h4>Topology seminar, UC Davis, February 2021 and Oxford, March 2021 and <strong>today, May 20!</strong> <strong>16:00 CET</strong>, in the Copenhagen-Jerusalem combinatorics seminar (see details at the end of the post).</h4>

<h3>NP hardness for related questions regarding knots</h3>


<p>This is a talk by Martin Tancer given at the  Copenhagen-Jerusalem  combinatorics seminar.</p>



<p>Title:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03502">The unbearable hardness of unknotting</a>  (link to the 2018 arXive paper)</p>



<p>Abstract: </p>



<p>During the talk, I will sketch a proof that deciding if a diagram of the unknot can be untangled using at most k Riedemeister moves (where k is part of the input) is NP-hard. (This is not the same as the unknot recognition but it reveals some difficulties.) Similar ideas can be also used for proving that several other similar invariants are NP-hard to recognize on links.</p>

<p>(I heard it from a retweet by Alex Kontorovich.)</p>



<p>Lower bound for the number of fixed points  of a map is a central theme in topology (and other areas) with many great results. The Lefshetz fixed point theorem tells you that a certain signed sum of the fixed points is bounded from below . For symplectic manifold Arnold’s conjecture asserts that the number of fixed point is bounded below from the sun of Betti numbers. This have led and is connected to tremendous mathematics.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>Abstract (part): We prove that the rank of the cohomology of a closed symplectic manifold with coefficients in a field of characteristic p is smaller than the number of periodic orbits of any non-degenerate Hamiltonian flow.</em></p></blockquote>



<h2>Graph theory</h2>



<h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05495">Large spanning graphs with odd degrees</a></h3>



<p>Asaf Ferber and Michael Krivelevich solved an old conjecture in Graph theory. (In a 1994 paper by Yair Caro the problem is already referred to as part of the folklore of graph theory.)</p>



<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: We prove that every graph G on n vertices with no isolated vertices contains an induced subgraph of size at least n/10000 with all degrees odd. This solves an old and well-known conjecture in graph theory.</p>



<p>Here is <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-answer-old-question-about-odd-graphs-20210519/">an article about it in Quanta Magazine</a>. And here is a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-proof-reveals-that-graphs-with-no-pentagons-are-fundamentally-different-20210426/">Quanta Magazine article</a> on the solution of the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture for pentagon-free graphs (that I mentioned in <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2021/01/29/possible-future-polymath-projects-2009-2021/">this post</a>).</p>

<p>A ternary graph (aka Trinity graph)  has no induced cycles of length divisible by three. Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour and Spirkl <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00065">proved</a> that for any ternary graph <em>G</em>, the number of independent sets with even cardinality and the independent sets with odd cardinality differ by at most 1. <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Wu%2C+H">Hehui Wu</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?searchtype=author&amp;query=Zhang%2C+W">Wentao Zhang</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07131">proved the stronger conjecture</a> that for ternary graphs, the sum of Betti numbers of the independent complex is at most one. (Both conjectures were proposed by Roy Meshulam and me.) Congratulations to Hehui and Wentao and all other people mentioned in this post. </p>

Actually, a better idea is that  Persiflage will try to give a vastly non-technical  explanation from scratch on p-adic local Langlands conjecture, and where it stands and why it matters. (To be clear, I am sure it is a great staff! And perhaps it is not possible to explain it to a wide audience. But it worth a try.)<br /><br />Meanwhile it reminded me of the following story to which I apparently was a witness.</p>



<p>At the time of my birth, the medical approach was that mother and child needed to stay at the hospital for at least four nights and even for an entire whole week. After two nights at the hospital, my mother decided  that she was ready to go home and got into a lengthy discussion with her doctor about it. At some point the exhausted doctor told her “Madam, I studied seven years in medical school, and I know what is good for you.” My mother was not impressed and replied: “Had I studied seven years in medical school, I would  have been a medical doctor as well. And now, let me go home.” At the end, my mother (and myself) left the hospital on the third day. Years later this became the medical standard. (My own approach is <em>to follow </em>medical doctor’s instructions.)</p>



<h2>Mathematics over the media</h2>



<h3><a href="http://www.ramanujanmachine.com/">Ramanujan machine</a>: machine learning for producing mathematical conjectures</h3>



<p>This is a cool and very interesting direction by very very young Israeli mathematicians  that was reported all over the media. (See, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03229-4">here for a Nature article</a>.)</p>



<p>(There are various groups all over the world attempting to use machine learning to produce mathematical conjectures.)</p>



<h3>A new approach for solving quadratic equations</h3>



<p>I heard it (I think it was a year ago) from a Facebook post written by the prime minister of Singapore! And then I saw it in other places all over the media (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/science/quadratic-equations-algebra.html">here on the NYT</a>). I like it, and, in fact, I like the many things <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~ploh/cmu.shtml">Po-Shen Loh</a> (who is my grand academic nephew) does in the service of mathematics.</p>

<p>Marc Lackenby:  Unknot recognition in quasi-polynomial time<br />**************************************************************************<br /><br />Abstract: </p>



<p>I will outline a new algorithm for unknot recognition that runs in quasi-polynomial time. The input is a diagram of a knot with n crossings, and the running time is 2^{O((log n)^3)}. The algorithm uses a wide variety of tools from 3-manifold theory, including normal surfaces, hierarchies and Heegaard splittings. In my talk, I will explain this background theory, as well as explain how it fits into the algorithm.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower_(mathematics)">sunflower lemma</a> describes an interesting combinatorial property of set families: any large family of small sets must contain a large <em>sunflower</em>—a sub-family consisting of sets <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%2C%5Cldots%2CA_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_1,\ldots,A_r" class="latex" /> with a shared <em>core</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S%3A%3DA_1%5Ccap%5Ccdots%5Ccap+A_r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="S:=A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_r" class="latex" /> and disjoint <em>petals</em> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A_1%5Cbackslash+S%2C%5Cldots%2CA_r%5Cbackslash+S.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="A_1\backslash S,\ldots,A_r\backslash S." class="latex" /> (See the <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#fig-sunflower">figure</a> below for an example and a non-example of sunflowers.) The application of the lemma in theoretical computer science dates back to the influential <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~razborov/files/clique.pdf">paper</a> by Razborov in 1985 that established the first super-polynomial monotone circuit lower bound for a function in NP, and since then the lemma has been applied broadly to other problems in theoretical computer science (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3357713.3384234">STOC version</a> of Alweiss-Lovett-Wu-Zhang for a discussion of applications of the lemma in computer science).</p>

Right: 3 sets NOT forming a sunflower.</figure></div>



<p>The lemma was first proved by <a href="https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=111692">Erdős-Rado</a> in 1960, who gave the quantitative bound that among <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28r-1%29%5Ekk%21%2B1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(r-1)^kk!+1" class="latex" /> distinct sets each of size at most <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> one can find <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r" class="latex" /> sets forming a sunflower. Erdos-Rado conjectured that the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%21%3Dk%5E%7Bk%281+-+o%281%29%29%7D+%3D+k%5E%7B%5COmega%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k!=k^{k(1 - o(1))} = k^{\Omega(k)}" class="latex" /> in the bound could be significantly improved to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%281%29%5Ek.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="O(1)^k." class="latex" /> For nearly 60 years since the Erdős-Rado upper bound, all known upper bounds had had the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k%5E%7B%5COmega%28k%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k^{\Omega(k)}" class="latex" /> dependence on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> even for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=r+%3D+3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="r = 3" class="latex" /> despite much research effort. In 2019, a breakthrough work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08483">Alweiss-Lovett-Wu-Zhang</a> improved the bound significantly to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Cr%5E3%5Clog+k%5Clog%5Clog_2+k%29%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(Cr^3\log k\log\log_2 k)^k" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k" class="latex" /> being at least <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="3" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="C" class="latex" /> being an absolute constant. The breakthrough led to many new results including improved monotone circuit lower bounds by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03883">Cavalar-Kumar-Rossman</a>.</p>



<p>Since the breakthrough of Alweiss-Lovett-Wu-Zhang, researchers have been refining the bound and simplifying the proof. The current best bound is <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Cr%5Clog+k%29%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(Cr\log k)^k" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k+%5Cge+2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="k \ge 2" class="latex" /> proved by Bell-Chueluecha-Warnke via a minor but powerful twist in the proof of an earlier <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28Cr%5Clog+%28rk%29%29%5Ek&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="(Cr\log (rk))^k" class="latex" /> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04774">bound</a> by Anup Rao:</p>

<p>The aim of this blog post is to present a streamlined proof of Theorem <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#thm-1">1</a>. The proof is largely based on a <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/the-sunflower-lemma-via-shannon-entropy/">blog post</a> by Terence Tao where he presented an elegant proof of Rao’s result using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon entropy</a>. However, Tao’s proof included a trick of <em>passing to a conditional copy twice</em>, which Tao described as <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/the-sunflower-lemma-via-shannon-entropy/\#comment-579138">“somewhat magical”</a>. <strong>We show here that the trick is not necessary for the proof, and avoiding the trick gives a simpler proof with a slightly better constant in the bound.</strong></p>



<p>We start by defining <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=R&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="R" class="latex" />-spread families, a notion key to all recent proofs of the sunflower lemma. We use <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5BN%5D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="[N]" class="latex" /> as a shorthand for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5C%7B1%2C%5Cldots%2CN%5C%7D.&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\{1,\ldots,N\}." class="latex" /> We use boldface symbols to denote random variables, and non-boldface ones to denote deterministic quantities.</p>

Rao and Tao both proved a slightly weaker version of Theorem <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#thm-1">1</a> but this weakness can be overcome using a minor twist observed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09327">Bell-Chueluecha-Warnke</a>. They also used slightly different forms of Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a> but the differences are non-essential.</p>



<p>It is easy to see that in Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a> one can convert <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n'" class="latex" /> to a deterministic function of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf W" class="latex" /> without violating any property of the original <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n'" class="latex" /> guaranteed by the lemma, because after conditioning on <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+W&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf W" class="latex" /> one can fix any additional randomness in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n'" class="latex" /> so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7CA_%7B%5Cmathbf+n%27%7D%5Cbackslash+%5Cmathbf+W%7C&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="|A_{\mathbf n'}\backslash \mathbf W|" class="latex" /> is minimized. This more deterministic version of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n'" class="latex" /> can be somewhat more convenient for proving Theorem <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#thm-1">1</a> and it was used in Rao’s proof, but allowing additional randomness in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n'" class="latex" /> enabled Tao to obtain a simpler proof of Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a> using a construction of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+n%27&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf n'" class="latex" /> that is easier to analyze.</p>



<p>We follow Tao’s idea of proving Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a> using Shannon entropy, but we present the proof in a more streamlined fashion with a slightly sharper constant in the bound (Tao proved a version of Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a> where the constant 4 was replaced by 5). Specifically, we present the proof in a way resembling a basic technique in combinatorics called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_counting_(proof_technique)">counting in two ways</a></em>: one can show that two quantities are equal by showing that they both count the number of elements in the same set. Here, we estimate the entropy of the same collection of random variables in two different ways, and prove Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a> by comparing the two estimates. The way we obtain the two estimates relies crucially on the chain rule of conditional entropy:</p>

<p>Equation <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a> holds for arbitrary random variables <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbf+a_1%2C%5Cldots%2C%5Cmathbf+a_m&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\mathbf a_1,\ldots,\mathbf a_m" class="latex" /> taking values in a discret set.

<p>To prove Lemma <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#lm-2">2</a>, we obtain two entropy estimates for the same collection of random variables by applying <a href="https://theorydish.blog/feed/#eq-1">(1)</a> to two different chains.</p>



<p>We need the following useful lemmas about Shannon entropy. We omit their proofs here as they can be found in Tao’s <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2020/07/20/the-sunflower-lemma-via-shannon-entropy/">blog post</a>, where many basic properties of Shannon entropy are also discussed. (We also highly recommend Tao’s other blog posts about <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/special-cases-of-shannon-entropy/">Shannon entropy</a> and the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/08/05/mosers-entropy-compression-argument/">entropy compression argument</a>.)</p>

<p>
Mihai Prunescu is at the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy. He works in logic and complexity theory. We recently discussed his <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/13/hilberts-tenth-again/">work</a> on Hilbert’s Tenth.</p>
<p>
Today we thought we would do a follow up discussion of a recent paper of his on the famous Hilbert’s Tenth problem.<br />
<span id="more-18714"></span></p>
<p>
“Hilbert’s Tenth” is actually a suite of problems: is it decidable whether a finite set of equations of a certain kind have a common solution over a certain domain?  When the domain is the integers and the equations are polynomials set to zero we have the original form, which was shown to be undecidable by Yuriy Matiyasevich, completing work of Julia Robinson, Martin Davis, and Hilary Putnam.  But over the reals, the problem for polynomial equations is decidable, and Hilbert himself had shown this over the complex numbers.  The rational numbers are the key unsolved case, which I posted about <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2010/08/07/hilberts-tenth-over-the-rationals/">eleven</a> and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2011/07/19/hilberts-10-5th-problem/">ten</a> years ago and <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/06/19/diophantine-equations/">again</a> more <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/13/hilberts-tenth-again/">recently</a>.</p>
<p>
The last post, two months ago, was about attempts to get leverage on the rationals by extending the equations to allow exponentiation.  Mihai added several helpful comments to that post, and with his blessing, this is trying to restart the discussion as busy pandemic-impacted university terms for Ken and some others we know draw to a close.</p>
<p>
</p><h2> Subtleties With Exponents </h2><p></p>
<p>
He has helped us understand a few subtleties in correspondence since then.  They concern both that rational numbers and exponentials are involved.  The focal point confounds our expectation that the square <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r^2}" class="latex" /> of any nonzero rational number <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" /> should be positive.  Here are two examples of issues:</p>
<ul>
<li> If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+x%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r = x^{1/2}}" class="latex" /> and we put <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E2+%3D+x%5E%7B1%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r^2 = x^{1}}" class="latex" /> then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+-1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x = -1}" class="latex" /> gives a negative value on the right-hand side.
</li><li>If <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%3D+x%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r = x^{1/4}}" class="latex" /> and we put <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%5E2+%3D+x%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r^2 = x^{1/2}}" class="latex" /> then the negative square root of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> is a possible value.
</li></ul>
<p>
If we have two equations <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_1%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{E_1(\vec{x})=0}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BE_2%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%3D0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{E_2(\vec{x})=0}" class="latex" /> and we want to say that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\vec{x}}" class="latex" /> solves at least one of them, we can introduce the single equation</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++E_1%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%5Ccdot+E_2%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  E_1(\vec{x})\cdot E_2(\vec{x}) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
This is not affected by the subtleties.  But now suppose we want to do AND instead of OR.  The natural idea is to make the equation</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++E_1%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%5E2+%2B+E_2%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%5E2+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  E_1(\vec{x})^2 + E_2(\vec{x})^2 = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
However, suppose we have the equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+%3D+y%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^{1/4} = y}" class="latex" />.  This is the same as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B1%2F4%7D+-+y+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^{1/4} - y = 0}" class="latex" />.  If we square it, we get </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5E%7B1%2F2%7D+%2B+y%5E2+-+2x%5E%7B1%2F4%7Dy+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  x^{1/2} + y^2 - 2x^{1/4}y = 0 " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The abstract worry is that this could allow solutions where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B1%2F2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^{1/2}}" class="latex" /> is chosen <i>negative</i>, though not intended as the square of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^{1/4}}" class="latex" /> (whether positive or negative).  Mihai gave us a simple example of two exponential equations where unintended solutions occur after squaring and adding them.  Consider</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++u%5Ev+%3D+0+%5Cwedge+w%5Ex+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  u^v = 0 \wedge w^x = 0. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
versus</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++u%5E%7B2v%7D+%2B+w%5E%7B2x%7D+%3D+0.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  u^{2v} + w^{2x} = 0. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>
The former set is solved only by <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu+%3D+w+%3D+0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u = w = 0}" class="latex" /> with the exponents nonzero.  The latter, however, allows solutions illustrating both issues above:</p>
<ul>
<li> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu+%3D+v+%3D+1%2C%5C%3B+w+%3D+-1%2C%5C%3B+x+%3D+1%2F2%3B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u = v = 1,\; w = -1,\; x = 1/2;}" class="latex" />
</li><li> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu+%3D+v+%3D+w+%3D+1%2C%5C%3B+x+%3D+1%2F4%3B%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u = v = w = 1,\; x = 1/4;}" class="latex" />
</li></ul>
<p>
where in the latter, the negative square root of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{1}" class="latex" /> is taken.  What this means is that with rationals and/or exponentials we must watch our manipulations more carefully.  </p>
<p>

The full question whether the above theorem can be proved without any exponential functions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^x}" class="latex" /> remains open, after much attention by many researchers. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some History </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
The reason we say “essentially” due to Prunescu must be explained. He recently published an article showing that <i>The Exponential Diophantine Problem For <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7B%5Cmathbb+Q%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{{\mathbb Q}}" class="latex" /></i> is undecidable: It is in the <i>Journal of Symbolic Logic</i> (JSL), Volume 85, Issue 2. </p>
<p>
His clever proof showed that the solutions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x%2Cy%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(x,y)}" class="latex" /> over the rationals of 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++x%5Ey+%3D+y%5Ex+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  x^y = y^x " class="latex" /></p>
<p>lie in a one-dimensional space. This space is parameterized by the integers and so it can be used to define the integers. This immediately proves the undecidability by reduction to the classic Hilbert’s Tenth over the integers.</p>
<p>
Ken and I then wrote a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/13/hilberts-tenth-again/">post</a> on our blog GLL explaining his JSL result. Mihai kindly added a <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/03/13/hilberts-tenth-again/#comment-116365">comment</a> on the post that basically stated the above theorem with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^y}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
I was initially puzzled since the above theorem seems to be stronger than his JSL theorem. His published result uses <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^y}" class="latex" /> a binary exponential function and the new theorem needs only the unary function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^y}" class="latex" />. Now it must be said that the cases could be incomparable—because the extra freedom of allowing any rational base <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%5Ey%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x^y}" class="latex" /> could promote a different kind of analysis that makes the existence of such solutions decidable.  The equivalence logic coming back from undecidable cases over the integers might not apply in the above reduction.  But the undecidability when the base is fixed to be <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" /> still strikes me as capturing the general import.</p>
<p>
What’s more, the theorem fixing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^x}" class="latex" /> as the base has a much simpler proof.  It requires only a lemma that extends the famous Euclid Theorem: The value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5Csqrt%7B2%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{\sqrt{2}}" class="latex" /> is not rational.</p>
<p></p><h2> Proof of the Lemma </h2><p></p>
<p>
The proof rests on the famous result of Matiyasevich on Hilbert’s Tenth and the following lemma: </p>
<blockquote><p><b>Lemma 2</b> <em> Suppose that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cge+0%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x \ge 0}" class="latex" />, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+Q%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x \in {\mathbb Q}}" class="latex" />, and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ex+%5Cin+%7B%5Cmathbb+Q%7D%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^x \in {\mathbb Q}}" class="latex" />. Then <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> is an integer. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
<em>Proof:</em>  Clearly we can assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%3E0%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x&gt;0}" class="latex" />. We will prove the lemma in two steps. </p>
<ol>
<li>
The value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Ex%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^x}" class="latex" /> is an integer. <p></p>
</li><li>
The value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> is an integer.
</li></ol>
<p>
Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+r%2Fs%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x = r/s}" class="latex" /> for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%2C+s%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r, s}" class="latex" /> integers that are co-prime and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r \ge 1}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s \ge 1}" class="latex" />. </p>
<p>
<i>Step (1):</i> Now let 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5Ex+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bu%7D%7Bv%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  2^x = \frac{u}{v} " class="latex" /></p>
<p>where <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> are co-prime integers. We can assume that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7Cv%7C+%5Cge+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{|v| \ge 2}" class="latex" />; otherwise, step (1) is true. Now 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5Er+%3D+%5Cfrac%7Bu%5Es%7D%7Bv%5Es%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  2^r = \frac{u^s}{v^s}. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>But <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%5Es%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u^s}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%5Es%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v^s}" class="latex" /> are co-prime since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bu%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{u}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> are co-prime. But this implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%5Er%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2^r}" class="latex" /> is not an integer, since <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%7Cv%5Es%7C+%5Cge+2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{|v^s| \ge 2}" class="latex" />. Note this uses that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r \ge 1}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bs+%5Cge+1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{s \ge 1}" class="latex" />. This contradiction proves step (1).</p>
<p>
<i>Step (2):</i> By step (1) we thus have that 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7Br%2Fs%7D+%3D+y+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  2^{r/s} = y " class="latex" /></p>
<p>for some integer <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" />. Then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5Er+%3D+y%5Es.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  2^r = y^s. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Thus <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%5Es%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y^s}" class="latex" /> is an integer and so by unique factorization it follows that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y}" class="latex" /> must be an integer power of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B2%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{2}" class="latex" />. Let <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7By+%3D+2%5Ek%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{y = 2^k}" class="latex" />. Then 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++2%5E%7Br%7D+%3D+2%5E%7Bsk%7D.+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  2^{r} = 2^{sk}. " class="latex" /></p>
<p>This implies that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%3Dsk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r=sk}" class="latex" /> and so that <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx+%3D+r%2Fs%3Dk%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x = r/s=k}" class="latex" /> is an integer. This proves step (2). <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\Box" class="latex" /></p>
<p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p>
We have shared the topic also with Joël Ouaknine and thank him for his comments as well. Addressing our readers, do you have any further comments? What do you think about the rationals? </p>
<p>
Ken related an idea while corresponding with Mihai: Suppose we introduce a special squaring function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Sq}" class="latex" /> with the properties that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSq%28r%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Sq(r)}" class="latex" /> is always positive for nonzero <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Br%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{r}" class="latex" />.<p></p>
</li><li>
In particular, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSq%28x%5E%7B1%2F4%7D%29%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Sq(x^{1/4})}" class="latex" /> gives only the positive square root of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />.<p></p>
</li><li>
Terms with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BSq%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Sq}" class="latex" /> may not appear in exponents, nor be bases of them.  They may only be added and multiplied.
</li></ul>
<p>
The motivation is that now</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++Sq%28E_1%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29+%2B+Sq%28E_2%28%5Cvec%7Bx%7D%29%29+%3D+0+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  Sq(E_1(\vec{x}) + Sq(E_2(\vec{x})) = 0 " class="latex" /></p>

does give the AND of the two equations.  What then becomes of the above undecidability proofs, and does the AND property have other applications?</p></font></font></div>

<p> I've been at the U of Utah and Salt Lake City for 14 years (14.5 really). It was my first academic job and the longest time I've spent anywhere (throughout my whole life). So it's a little hard to accept that I'm moving to my next adventure. </p><p>It's a two-part adventure, because why make one move when you can make two. </p><p>Firstly, as of today, I'm going to working with Alondra Nelson at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, advising on matters relating to fairness and bias in tech systems. This is a scary and exciting new position, and I hope to help to nudge things along just a bit further in the direction of tech that can help more than it harms, especially for those who've been left behind in our rush to an algorithmically controlled future. </p><p>Secondly, I'm moving to Brown University to join the CS department there as well as their Data Science Initiative. Together with Seny Kamara and others, I'm going to start a new center on Computing for the People, to help think through what it means to do computer science that truly responds to the needs of people, instead of hiding behind a neutrality that merely gives more power to those already in power. </p><p>Lots of changes, and because of the pandemic, all this will happen in slow machine, but it's a whirlwind of emotions (and new clothes - apparently tech conference T-shirts don't work in formal settings - WHO KNEW!!!). </p><p><br /></p><div class="feedflare">

<p> There have been some recent blog posts by Scott (see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5387">here</a>) and Lance (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/04/quantum-stories.html">here</a>)  about the hype for SHORT TERM APPLICATIONS of Quantum Computing, which they both object to. </p><p>I have a question that has been touched on but I want to get it more out there.</p><p>PREAMBLE TO QUESTION:  The following scenarios, while distasteful, do make sense: </p><p>a) A researcher on their grants exaggerates or even out-right lies about the applications of their work. </p><p>b) A journalist in their articles exaggerates or even out-right lies about the applications of the science they are covering.</p><p>c) A company exaggerates or even out-right lies about the applications of their project to a venture capitalist or other kind of investor. </p><p>QUESTION: </p><p>Why does a company or country invest THEIR OWN MONEY into Quantum Computing which is unlikely to have a short term profit or benefit? Presumably they hire honest scientists to tell them the limits of the applications in the short term. </p><p>ANSWERS I HAVE GOTTEN FROM ASKING THIS</p><p>1) QC might be able to do something cool and profitable, like factoring, or simulating physics quantum experiments or something else, in the short term. Quantum Crypto is already happening, and that's a close cousin of Quantum Computing. </p><p>2) QC might be able to do something cool and profitable (like in (1)) in the long term, and both companies and countries think they will be around for a long time. (For a list of America's 10 oldest companies see <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8122-oldest-companies-in-america.html">here</a>.) </p><p>3) The company or country is in this for the long term, not for a practical project, but because they realize that doing GOOD SCIENCE is of a general benefit (this might make more sense for a country than a company). And funding Quantum Computing is great for science. </p><p>4) Bait and Switch: The company claims they are doing Quantum to attract very smart people to work with them, and then have those smart people do something else.</p><p>5) (this is a variant of 1) While Quantum Computing may not have any short term applications, there will be classical applications INSPIRED by it (this has already happened, see <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3880">here</a>).</p><p>6) Some of these companies make money by applying for GRANTS to do QC, so its NOT their money. In fact, they are using QC to  GET money.</p><p>7) For a country its not the leaders money, its that Taxpayer's money- though that still leaves the question of why spend Taxpayer money on this and not on something else.</p><p>8) For a company its not their money- its Venture Capitalists  and others (though for a big company like Google I would think it IS their money). </p><p>9) The scientists advising the company or country are giving them bad (or at least self-serving) advice so that those scientists can profit- and do good science. So this is a variant of (3) but without the company or country knowing it. </p><p>10) In some countries and companies group-think sets in, so if the leader (who perhaps is not a scientist) thinks intuitively that QC is good, the scientists who work for them, who know better, choose to not speak up, or else they would lose their jobs...or worse. </p><p>11) For countries this could be like going to the moon: Country A wants to beat Country B to the moon for bragging rights. Scientists get to do good research even if they don't care about bragging rights. </p><p>12) (similar to 11 but for a company) If a company does great work on QC then it is good publicity for that company. </p><p>13) Some variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory">greater fool theory</a>. If so, will there be a bubble? A bail-out? </p><p><br /></p></div>

<p>You’ll hear that it’s not as simple as the Israelis are good guys and Palestinians are bad guys, or vice versa.  And that’s true.</p>



<p>But it’s also not so complicated that there are no clearly identifiable good guys or bad guys.  It’s just that they cut across the sides.</p>



<p>The good guys are anyone, on either side, whose ideal end state is two countries, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace.</p>



<p>The bad guys are anyone, on either side, whose ideal end state is the other side being, if not outright exterminated, then expelled from its current main population centers (ones where it’s been for several generations or more) and forcibly resettled someplace far away.</p>



<p>(And those whose ideal end state is everyone living together with no border — possibly as part of the general abolition of nation-states?   They’re not bad guys; they can plead insanity.  [<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5490#comment-1889918">See here</a> for clarifications!])</p>



<p>Hamas are bad guys.  They fire rockets indiscriminately at population centers, hoping to kill as many civilians as they can.  (Unfortunately for them and fortunately for Israel, they’re not great at that, and also they’re aiming at a target that’s world-historically good at defending itself.)</p>



<p>The IDF, whatever else you say about it, sends evacuation warnings to civilians before it strikes the missile centers that are embedded where they live.  Even if Hamas could aim its missiles, the idea of it extending the same courtesy to Israeli civilians is black comedy.</p>



<p>Netanyahu is not as bad as Hamas, because he has the power to kill millions of Palestinians and yet kills only hundreds … whereas if Hamas had the power to kill all Jews, it told the world in its charter that it would immediately do so, and it’s acted consistently with its word.</p>



<p>(An aside: I’m convinced that Hamas has the most top-heavy management structure of any organization in the world.  Every day, Israel takes out another dozen of its <em>most senior, highest-level</em> commanders, apparently leaving hundreds more.  How many senior commanders do they have?  Do they have even a single junior commander?)</p>



<p>Anyway, not being as bad as Hamas is an extremely low bar, and Netanyahu is a thoroughly bad guy.  He’s corrupt and power-mad.  Like Trump, he winks at his side’s monstrous extremists without taking moral responsibility for them.  And if it were ever possible to believe that he wanted two countries as the ideal end state, it hasn’t been possible to believe that for at least a decade.</p>



<p>Netanyahu and Hamas are allies, not enemies.  Both now blatantly, obviously rely on the other to stay in power, to demonstrate their worldview and thereby beat their internal adversaries.</p>



<p>Whenever you see anyone opine about this conflict, on Facebook or Twitter or in an op-ed or anywhere else, keep your focus relentlessly on the question of what that person <em>wants</em>, of what they’d do if they had unlimited power.  If they’re a Zionist who talks about how “there’s no such place as Palestine,” how it’s a newly invented political construct: OK then, does that mean they’d relocate the 5 million self-described Palestinians to Jordan?  Or where?  If, on the other side, someone keeps talking about the “Zionist occupation,” always leaving it strategically unspecified whether they mean just the West Bank and parts of East Jerusalem or also Tel Aviv and Haifa, if they talk about the Nakba (catastrophe) of Israel’s creation in 1947 … OK then, what’s to be done with the 7 million Jews now living there?  Should they go back to the European countries that murdered their families, or the Arab countries that expelled them?  Should the US take them all?  Out with it!</p>



<p>Don’t let them dodge the question.  Don’t let them change the subject to something they’d much rather talk about, like the details of the other side’s latest outrage.  Those details always seem so important, and yet everyone’s stance on every specific outrage is like 80% predictable if you know their desired end state.  So just keep asking directly about their desired end state.</p>



<p>If, like me, you favor two countries living in peace, then you need never fear anyone asking you the same thing.  You can then shout your desired end state from the rooftops, leaving unsettled only the admittedly-difficult “engineering problem” of how to get there.  Crucially, whatever their disagreements or rivalries, everyone trying to solve the same engineering problem is in a certain sense part of the same team.  At least, there’s rarely any reason to kill someone trying to solve the same problem that you are.</p>



<p>“What is this person’s ideal end state?”  Just keep asking that and there’s a limit to how wrong you can ever be about this.  You can still make factual mistakes, but it’s then almost impossible to make a moral mistake.</p></div>

<p>It’s getting towards the end of the academic year, that time when students think about finishing up their studies, and today we had another successful Ph.D. defense of one of those students. This time it was one of mine, <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~ehavvaei/">Elham Havvaei</a> (pronounced like the state of Hawai’i, glottal stop at the apostrophe and all, but with a v instead of w, and better known by her nickname Haleh).</p>

<p>Haleh is Iranian, but came to UC Irvine via Florida in 2016, after working for a master’s degree with Narsingh Deo at the University of Central Florida. I’ve written here already about the research she’s done with me: <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2018/10/07/recognizing-sparse-leaf.html">reconstructing unknown trees from graphs connecting close-together leaves</a> (from IPEC 2018 and Algorithmica 2020), <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/29/simplifying-task-milestone.html">simplifying graphs whose vertices and edges represent the milestones, tasks, and ordering constraints of a project</a> (SWAT 2020), and <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2021/01/27/which-induced-subgraph.html">classifying problems of finding large subgraphs with one property in graphs with another property</a> (not yet published).</p>

<p>Her next step will be taking a position at Twitter in San Francisco, as a data scientist.</p>

<p>Congratulations, Haleh!</p>

We prove a SOS degree lower bound for the planted clique problem on Erd{\"o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $G(n,1/2)$. The bound we get is degree $d=\Omega(\epsilon^2\log n/\log\log n)$ for clique size $\omega=n^{1/2-\epsilon}$, which is almost tight. This improves the result of \cite{barak2019nearly} on the ``soft'' version of the problem, where the family of equality-axioms generated by $x_1+...+x_n=\omega$ was relaxed to one inequality $x_1+...+x_n\geq\omega$.

As a technical by-product, we also ``naturalize'' previous techniques developed for the soft problem. This includes a new way of defining the pseudo-expectation and a more robust method to solve the coarse diagonalization of the moment matrix.</div>

Santosh Vempala and Nikhil Srivastava announced the first in hopefully a series of online meetings about matrix algorithms. Not about the <i>Matrix</i>—the—<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/feed/">movie</a>. Santosh and Nikhil said: we expect to have an attendance of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B20-60%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{20-60}" class="latex" /> people. Wrong. It was over 200 today.</p>
<p>
Today I thought we would talk about the Zoom meeting and future ones being planned. </p>
<p>
Zoom feels closer to the world of the <i>Matrix</i> movies. If you haven’t seen them, all you need to know is the premise of humanity being diverted in a virtual reality.  How do we know the little figures in those boxes are real people?  More concretely, it seems obvious to Ken and me that simulated human online agents will arrive much earlier than person-like robots.  </p>

In particular, how much does it take to automate giving a lecture online?  Ken has spent much time this term upgrading his lecture notes in two courses to broadcast quality.  Delivering them remotely trades against the spontaneity of drawing pictures on a whiteboard or document camera and developing proofs and algorithms step-by-step.  It should be easier to develop an AI capable of reacting to questions put in Zoom chat than with in-class situations, where “reading the room” is also important for modulating the speed and manner of presentation.  </p>

</p><h2> The Meetings </h2><p></p>
<p>
Daniel Kressner, Mike Mahoney, Cleve Moler, Alex Townsend, and Joel Tropp were also organizers of this smeeting on matrix computation. This Wednesday was the first in a series of online meetings. The speakers for today were Peter Bürgisser, Nick Higham, and Cameron Musco, and the panelists were Jim Demmel, Ilse Ipsen, and Richard Peng.</p>
<p>
The blurb for the meetings is:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> We are organizing an online seminar series on “Complexity of Matrix Computations”, whose goal is to bridge the gap between how numerical linear algebra and theoretical computer science researchers view and study the fundamental computational problems of linear algebra. This gap includes foundational issues such as: what is the computational model? What does it mean to solve a problem? On which criteria do we compare algorithms? We also hope to discuss which techniques in theoretical computer science might be useful in numerical linear algebra and vice versa. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I love seeing the words “fundamental” and “foundational”, and one question resonated even more.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Question </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What does it mean to solve a problem? In this case what does it mean to solve a linear equation? This is the question that was discussed the most—especially at the end of the meeting. </p>
<p>
I have always thought there is an answer to this. The answer is based on asking what the client wants. Imagine Alice is asked by Bob to <tt>solve</tt> a linear system 	</p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cdisplaystyle++Ax+%3D+b+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="\displaystyle  Ax = b " class="latex" /></p>
<p>Alice could go off and return the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> that solves the system. Or she could say there is no such <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. Or she could say there are many such <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />‘s. Which is the correct answer? </p>
<p>
I believe the right answer is: Alice should ask Bob:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Bob, what will you do with the answer to this? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Bob could say, for example: </p>
<ol>
<li>
I plan to compute the inner product of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> and <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> for some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bv%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{v}" class="latex" /> I have. <p></p>
</li><li>
I plan to see what the norm of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" /> is. <p></p>
</li><li>
Or, I plan to see what <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx_1%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x_1}" class="latex" /> is. <p></p>
</li><li>
Or, I could be just happy to know that there is some <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x}" class="latex" />. <p></p>
</li><li>
Or, and so on.
</li></ol>
<p>
Thus, I believe, the answer only makes sense if Alice knows what will be done next with the “solution”. What do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> One View </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What does it mean to solve the equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BAx%3Db%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{Ax=b}" class="latex" />, for an invertible matrix <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7BA%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{A}" class="latex" />? What do precision, accuracy, conditioning, and complexity mean in this context?</p>
<p>
Jim Demmel’s view is captured in his notes that he was kind enough to download to the site <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/T021927P7ST/C021PQXNPEE">SLACK</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
What do you think about this series of meetings? Did you attend them initially? Will you look in next time so we can break 200 attendees?</p>
<p>Santosh says: To join the seminar, please send an email<br />
<a href="mailto: cmc-l-request@cornell.edu">Join Zoom</a><br />
after adding the subject “join”. Information about how to connect to the Zoom conference call will be circulated via email to all registered attendees prior to each seminar.</p></font></font></div>

Two years later I had a <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2013/12/bitcoins-revisited.html">follow-up post</a>, noting the price moved from $3 to $1000 with a market cap of about $11 Billion.

No longer can we view cryptocurrencies as simply a neat exercise in applied cryptography now that it has serious value.</p><p>The main uses of cryptocurrencies are for speculation or illegal activities, such as drug sales, ransoms, money laundering and tax evasion.

<p>My latest preprint, “A stronger lower bound on parametric minimum spanning trees” (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05371">arXiv:2105.05371</a>, to appear at WADS) gives examples of graphs, with edge weights that are linear functions of a parameter \(\lambda\), such that different choices of \(\lambda\) lead to \(\Omega(m\log n)\) different minimum spanning trees, improving a bound of \(\Omega\bigl(m\alpha(n)\bigr)\) from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00009396">one of my earlier papers</a>. But it was almost about a different problem in discrete geometry rather than graph theory, and it almost didn’t happen at all. I thought I had a bound for another related problem until the proof fell apart, irreparably. I was in the process of throwing away my mostly-written draft when I found a different proof, allowing me to rescue the paper.</p>

<p>Here’s the problem I thought I was solving when I started writing the paper: Suppose you want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry">construct a complicated shape using unions and intersections of simpler shapes</a>. For the version of the problem I was considering, the shapes belong to the Euclidean plane, and the simple shapes that you start with are the half-planes above a line. When you take unions or intersections of these shapes, the more complicated shapes that you get are sets of points above a piecewise linear \(x\)-monotone curve. Another way to understand the same setup is that you’re starting with linear functions and building more-complicated piecewise linear functions by taking pointwise maxima or minima. And what I wanted to know was: If you have a formula expressing a shape using unions and intersections of \(n\) upper halfplanes, or equivalently expressing a piecewise-linear function using maxima and minima of \(n\) linear functions, how complicated can the result be? I thought I had a proof that one could construct shapes with \(\Omega(n\log n)\) vertices, or piecewise-linear functions with \(\Omega(n\log n)\) breakpoints, and when it broke I thought I didn’t have a paper any more.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/minmax.svg" alt="Recursive construction of a piecewise linear function by maxima and minima of simpler functions" /></p>

<p>The figure above illustrates what I thought was the recursive construction. The base case, in the upper left, is a linear function (a piecewise-linear function with one piece, generated by a max-min formula with one term). In middle left we have a second-level function, the pointwise maximum of two of these linear functions, with two pieces. On the bottom left we have a third-level function, the pointwise minimum of two second-level functions, with six pieces. And the large image on the right shows a fourth-level function, the pointwise maximum of two third-level functions, with 16 pieces. At each level of recursion, you replace each line by two perturbed copies, getting a breakpoint where they cross. When you take a maximum, each breakpoint that looked like a local maximum expands to three breakpoints, while each breakpoint that looked like a local minimum stays as just a single breakpoint; the case of taking a minimum is symmetric. Setting up and solving a recurrence for the numbers of breakpoints of each type gives \(\Omega(n\log n)\).</p>

<p>The problem was that I couldn’t control the resulting piecewise-linear functions well enough to ensure that I could expand all of the local maxima into triple breakpoints and produce new breakpoints for each pair of crossing lines. These two issues are related, because you get a tripled breakpoint only for pairs of pairs of lines that have a certain above-below relation, and the breakpoint of a pair of crossing lines changes their above-below relation. It works for each step in the figure, but that’s because these cases are still too small for the problems to show up. So the analysis above breaks down.</p>

<p>As well as unions and intersections of shapes, or minima and maxima of functions, there’s another graph-theoretical interpretation of the same problem, and that’s where the rewritten paper comes in. The piecewise linear functions that you get from recursive unions and intersections correspond to parametric solutions to the <em>bottleneck shortest path problem</em>: find a path that connects two fixed vertices of a graph, whose heaviest edge is as light as possible, and let \(\beta\) (the bottleneck) be the weight of this edge. How does \(\beta\) vary as a function of \(\lambda\)? For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series%E2%80%93parallel_graph">series-parallel graphs</a>, the two vertices should be the two terminals, series composition of graphs gives you the maximum of their bottleneck functions, and parallel composition of graphs gives you the minimum of their bottleneck functions. So for these graphs, the parametric bottleneck shortest path problem is the same one that I didn’t solve.</p>

<p>However, the bottleneck shortest path problem is solved by the minimum spanning tree, in the sense that the path between two vertices in a minimum spanning tree is always a bottleneck shortest path (although there may be other equally good paths). Some of the breakpoints of the bottleneck function, the ones that look locally like a minimum of two linear functions, come from combinatorial changes in the parametric minimum spanning tree, and (by negating everything and swapping min for max if necessary) we can ensure that at least half of the changes in the worst-case bottleneck function come from spanning tree changes in this way. Therefore, lower bounds on the bottleneck problem extend to minimum spanning trees, and upper bounds on minimum spanning trees extend to the bottleneck problem. In fact, my previous \(\Omega\bigl(m\alpha(n)\bigr)\) bound on the spanning tree problem came from a \(\Omega\bigl(n\alpha(n)\bigr)\) bound on two-level piecewise linear functions (minima of maxima of linear functions), and a previous \(O(mn^{1/3})\) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00009354">upper bound of Tamal Dey on the spanning tree problem</a> implies an \(O(n^{4/3})\) upper bound on the bottleneck problem.</p>

<p>So when my lower bound for the bottleneck problem fell apart, I instead started thinking about trying to find a similar recursive lower bound for spanning trees instead of bottleneck paths, and was more successful. It works more easily because I don’t have to control the piecewise linear functions so carefully in order to keep their crossings and breakpoints intact; instead, I can just take three copies of the lower level of the construction, flatten them by linear transformations so they are each close to a line, with their breakpoints in disjoint intervals of the \(\lambda\)-axis, and combine them as if they were linear. It wouldn’t work for the bottleneck problem because you would only get a constant number of new breakpoints where one of the recursive copies crosses over to the other, but for the spanning tree problem you’re combining trees rather than functions so you get more breakpoints in these regions.</p>

<p>The figure below gives an example of the construction, a series-parallel graph with six vertices (upper right) and linear edge weight functions (upper left) that produces 12 parametric minimum spanning trees (bottom). The red, blue, and green parts show the three copies of the recursive construction that are combined to form this example. For a more detailed explanation see the preprint.
The preprint also includes a packing argument that transforms the resulting \(\Omega(n\log n)\) bound for \(n\)-vertex series-parallel graphs into an \(\Omega(m\log n)\) bound for graphs whose number \(m\) of edges can be significantly larger than \(n\), but I think that’s more just a technicality.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://11011110.github.io/blog/assets/2021/parametric-mst.svg" alt="Six-vertex series-parallel graph with 12 parametric minimum spanning trees" /></p>

<p>It would be interesting either to find a different construction proving that the halfspace / piecewise linear function / bottleneck path problem can have complexity \(\Omega(n\log n)\), matching this new result, or to prove an upper bound separating this problem from the lower bound on the parametric minimum spanning tree problem, but that will have to wait for another day.</p>
