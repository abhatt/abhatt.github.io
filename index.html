<p>In the past few months, I’ve twice injured the same ankle while playing with my kids.  This, perhaps combined with covid, led me to several indisputable realizations:</p>



<ol><li>I am mortal.</li><li>Despite my self-conception as a nerdy little kid awaiting the serious people’s approval, I am now firmly middle-aged.  By my age, Einstein had completed general relativity, Turing had founded CS, won WWII, <em>and</em> proposed the Turing Test, and Galois, Ramanujan, and Ramsey had been dead for years.</li><li>Thus, whatever I wanted to accomplish in my intellectual life, I should probably get started on it <em>now</em>.</li></ol>



<p>Hence today’s post.  I’m feeling a strong compulsion to write an essay, or possibly even a book, surveying and critically evaluating a century of ideas about the following question:</p>



<p><strong>Q: Why should the universe have been quantum-mechanical?</strong></p>



<p>If you want, you can divide Q into two subquestions:</p>



<p><strong>Q1: Why didn’t God just make the universe classical and be done with it?  What would’ve been wrong with <em>that</em> choice?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Q2: Assuming classical physics wasn’t good enough for whatever reason, why this specific alternative?  Why the complex-valued amplitudes?  Why unitary transformations?  Why the Born rule?  Why the tensor product?</strong></p>



<p>Despite its greater specificity, Q2 is ironically the question that I feel we have a better handle on.  I could spend half a semester teaching theorems that admittedly don’t <em>answer</em> Q2, as satisfyingly as Einstein answered the question “why the Lorentz transformations?,” but that at least render this particular set of mathematical choices (the 2-norm, the Born Rule, complex numbers, etc.) orders-of-magnitude less surprising than one might’ve thought they were <em>a priori</em>.  Q1 therefore stands, to me at least, as the more mysterious of the two questions.</p>



<p>So, I want to write something about the space of credible answers to Q, and especially Q1, that humans can currently conceive.  I want to do this for my own sake as much as for others’.  I want to do it because I regard Q as one of the biggest questions ever asked, for which it seems plausible to me that there’s simply an <em>answer</em> that most experts would accept as valid once they saw it, but for which no such answer is known.  And also because, besides having spent 25 years working in quantum information, I have the following qualifications for the job:</p>



<ul><li><span style="color: initial;">I don’t dismiss either Q1 </span><em style="color: initial;">or</em><span style="color: initial;"> Q2 as silly; and</span></li><li>crucially, I don’t think I already know the answers, and merely need better arguments to justify them.  I’m genuinely uncertain and confused.</li></ul>



<p><strong>The purpose of this post is to invite you to share your own answers to Q in the comments section.</strong>  Before I embark on my survey project, I’d better know if there are promising ideas that I’ve missed, and this blog seems like as good a place as any to crowdsource the job.</p>



<p>Any answer is welcome, no matter how wild or speculative, <em>so long as it honestly grapples with the actual nature of QM</em>.  To illustrate, nothing along the lines of “the universe is quantum because it needs to be holistic, interconnected, full of surprises, etc. etc.” will cut it, since such answers leave utterly unexplained why the world wasn’t simply endowed with those properties directly, rather than specifically via <em>generalizing the rules of probability to allow interference and noncommuting observables</em>.</p>



<p>Relatedly, whatever “design goal” you propose for the laws of physics, if the goal is satisfied by QM, but satisfied <em>even better</em> by theories that provide <em>even more</em> power than QM does—for instance, superluminal signalling, or violations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsirelson%27s_bound">Tsirelson’s bound</a>, or the efficient solution of NP-complete problems—then your explanation is out.  This is a remarkably strong constraint.</p>



<p>Oh, needless to say, don’t try my patience with anything about the uncertainty principle being due to floating-point errors or rendering bugs, or anything else that relies on a travesty of QM lifted from a popular article or meme! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png" style="height: 1em;" class="wp-smiley" alt="🙂" /></p>



<p>OK, maybe four more comments to enable a more productive discussion, before I shut up and turn things over to you:</p>



<ol><li>I’m aware, of course, of the radical uncertainty about what form an answer to Q should even take.  Am I asking you to psychoanalyze the will of God in creating the universe?  Or, what perhaps amounts to the same thing, am I asking for the design objectives of the giant computer simulation that we’re living in?  (As in, “I’m 100% fine with living inside a Matrix … I just want to understand why it’s a <em>unitary</em> matrix!”)  Am I instead asking for an anthropic explanation, showing why <em>of course</em> QM would be needed if you wanted life or consciousness like ours?  Am I “merely” asking for simpler or more intuitive physical principles from which QM is to be derived as a consequence?  Am I asking why QM is the “most elegant choice” in some space of mathematical options … even to the point where, with hindsight, a 19th-century mathematician or physicist could’ve been convinced that <em>of course</em> this must be part of Nature’s plan?  Am I asking for something else entirely?  <strong>You get to decide</strong>!<strong>  Should you take up my challenge, this is both your privilege and your terrifying burden.</strong><br /></li><li>I’m aware, of course, of the dizzying array of central physical phenomena that rely on QM for their ultimate explanation.  These phenomena range from the stability of matter itself, which depends on the Pauli exclusion principle; to the nuclear fusion that powers the sun, which depends on a quantum tunneling effect; to the discrete energy levels of electrons (and hence, the combinatorial nature of chemistry), which relies on electrons being waves of probability amplitude that can only circle nuclei an integer number of times if their crests are to meet their troughs.  Important as they are, though, I don’t regard any of these phenomena as satisfying answers to Q in themselves.  The reason is simply that, in each case, it would seem like child’s-play to contrive some classical mechanism to produce the same effect, were that the goal.  QM just seems far too grand to have been the answer to <em>these</em> questions!  An exponentially larger state space for all of reality, <em>plus</em> the end of Newtonian determinism, just to overcome the technical problem that accelerating charges radiate energy in classical electrodynamics, thereby rendering atoms unstable?  It reminds me of the <em>Simpsons</em> episode where Homer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ6cCaEy5eo">uses a teleportation machine</a> to get a beer from the fridge without needing to get up off the couch.<br /></li><li>I’m aware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleason%27s_theorem">Gleason’s theorem</a>, and of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0401062">specialness</a> of the 1-norm and 2-norm in linear algebra, and of the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=4021">arguments for complex amplitudes</a> as opposed to reals or quaternions, and of the beautiful work of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0101012">Lucien Hardy</a> and of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00398">Chiribella et al.</a> and others on axiomatic derivations of quantum theory.  As some of you might remember, I even discussed much of this material in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computing-since-Democritus-Aaronson/dp/0521199565">Quantum Computing Since Democritus</a></em>!  There’s a <em>huge</em> amount to say about these fascinating justifications for the rules of QM, and I hope to say some of it in my planned survey!  For now, I’ll simply remark that every axiomatic reconstruction of QM that I’ve seen, impressive though it was, has relied on one or more axioms that struck me as <em>weird</em>, in the sense that I’d have little trouble dismissing the axioms as totally implausible and unmotivated if I hadn’t already known (from QM, of course) that they were true.  The axiomatic reconstructions <em>do</em> help me somewhat with Q2, but little if at all with Q1.<br /></li><li>To keep the discussion focused, in this post I’d like to exclude answers along the lines of “but what if QM is merely an approximation to something else?,” to say nothing of “a century of evidence for QM was all just a massive illusion!  LOCAL HIDDEN VARIABLES FOR THE WIN!!!”  We can have those debates another day—God knows that, here on <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em>, we <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6215">have</a> and we will.  Here I’m asking instead: imagine that, as fantastical as it sounds, QM were not only exactly true, but (along with relativity, thermodynamics, evolution, and the tastiness of chocolate) one of the profoundest truths our sorry species had ever discovered.  Why should I have <em>expected</em> that truth all along?  What possible reasons to expect it have I missed?</li></ol>

The Cuckoo Trie is designed to have memory-level parallelism -- which a modern
out-of-order processor can exploit to execute DRAM accesses in parallel --
without sacrificing memory efficiency. The Cuckoo Trie thus breaks a
fundamental performance barrier faced by current indexes, whose bottleneck is a
series of dependent pointer-chasing DRAM accesses -- e.g., traversing a search
tree path -- which the processor cannot parallelize. Our evaluation shows that
the Cuckoo Trie outperforms state-of-the-art-indexes by up to 20%--360% on a
variety of datasets and workloads, typically with a smaller or comparable
memory footprint.

\times n}$, $rank(A) = n$, and $b \in Z^{m}$. In the Integer Feasibility
Problem, we need to decide whether $P \cap Z^n = \emptyset$ or to find some $x
\in P \cap Z^n$ in the opposite case. Currently, its state of the art
algorithm, due to \cite{DadushDis,DadushFDim} (see also
\cite{Convic,ConvicComp,DConvic} for more general formulations), has the
complexity bound $O(n)^n \cdot poly(\phi)$, where $\phi = size(A,b)$. It is a
long-standing open problem to break the $O(n)^n$ dimension-dependence in the
complexity of ILP algorithms.
</p>
<p>We show that if the matrix $A$ has a small $l_1$ or $l_\infty$ norm, or $A$
is sparse and has bounded elements, then the integer feasibility problem can be
solved faster. More precisely, we give the following complexity bounds
\begin{gather*}
</p>
<p>\min\{\|A\|_{\infty}, \|A\|_1\}^{5 n} \cdot 2^n \cdot poly(\phi),
</p>
<p>\bigl( \|A\|_{\max} \bigr)^{5 n} \cdot \min\{cs(A),rs(A)\}^{3 n} \cdot 2^n
\cdot poly(\phi). \end{gather*} Here $\|A\|_{\max}$ denotes the maximal
absolute value of elements of $A$, $cs(A)$ and $rs(A)$ denote the maximal
number of nonzero elements in columns and rows of $A$, respectively. We present
similar results for the integer linear counting and optimization problems.
</p>
<p>Additionally, we apply the last result for multipacking and multicover
problems on graphs and hypergraphs, where we need to choose a minimal/maximal
multiset of vertices to cover/pack the edges by a prescribed number of times.
For example, we show that the stable multiset and vertex multicover problems on
simple graphs admit FPT-algorithms with the complexity bound $2^{O(|V|)} \cdot
poly(\phi)$, where $V$ is the vertex set of a given graph.

combinatorial optimization problems. However, such a single solution may not be
applicable to real-world problems as objective functions and constraints are
only "approximately" formulated for original real-world problems. To solve this
issue, finding \emph{multiple} solutions is a natural direction, and diversity
of solutions is an important concept in this context. Unfortunately, finding
diverse solutions is much harder than finding a single solution. To cope with
difficulty, we investigate the approximability of finding diverse solutions. As
a main result, we propose a framework to design approximation algorithms for
finding diverse solutions, which yields several outcomes including
constant-factor approximation algorithms for finding diverse matchings in
graphs and diverse common bases in two matroids and PTASes for finding diverse
minimum cuts and interval schedulings.

In the discrete median
line segment problem, the objective is to find a line segment bounded by a pair
of points in $P$ such that the sum of the Euclidean distances from $P$ to the
line segment is minimized. In the continuous median line segment problem, a
real number $\ell&gt;0$ is given, and the goal is to locate a line segment of
length $\ell$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the sum of the Euclidean distances
between $P$ and the line segment is minimized.
</p>
<p>To begin with, we show how to compute $(1+\epsilon\Delta)$- and
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximations to a discrete median line segment in time
$O(n\epsilon^{-2d}\log n)$ and $O(n^2\epsilon^{-d})$, respectively, where
$\Delta$ is the spread of line segments spanned by pairs of points. While
developing our algorithms, by using the principle of pair decomposition, we
derive new data structures that allow us to quickly approximate the sum of the
distances from a set of points to a given line segment or point. To our
knowledge, our utilization of pair decompositions for solving minsum facility
location problems is the first of its kind -- it is versatile and easily
implementable.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we prove that it is impossible to construct a continuous median
line segment for $n\geq3$ non-collinear points in the plane by using only ruler
and compass. In view of this, we present an $O(n^d\epsilon^{-d})$-time
algorithm for approximating a continuous median line segment in $\mathbb{R}^d$
within a factor of $1+\epsilon$. The algorithm is based upon generalizing the
point-segment pair decomposition from the discrete to the continuous domain.
Last but not least, we give an $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, whose
time complexity is sub-quadratic in $n$, for solving the constrained median
line segment problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ where an endpoint or the slope of the
median line segment is given at input.

striking results stay silent about, say, 4sat-prob$_{&gt;1/3}$, leaving the
computational complexity of $k$sat-prob$_{&gt;\delta}$ open for most $k$ and
$\delta$. In the present paper we give a complete characterization in the form
of a trichotomy: $k$sat-prob$_{&gt;\delta}$ lies in AC$^0$, is NL-complete, or is
NP-complete; and given $k$ and $\delta$ we can decide which of the three
applies. The proof of the trichotomy hinges on a new order-theoretic insight:
Every set of $k$cnf formulas contains a formula of maximum satisfaction
probability. This deceptively simple result allows us to (1) kernelize
$k$sat-prob$_{\ge \delta}$, (2) show that the variables of the kernel form a
strong backdoor set when the trichotomy states membership in AC$^0$ or NL, and
(3) prove a new locality property for the models of second-order formulas that
describe problems like $k$sat-prob$_{\ge \delta}$. The locality property will
allow us to prove a conjecture of Akmal and Williams: The majority-of-majority
satisfaction problem for $k$cnfs lies in P for all $k$.

model, where infections are spread via non-isolated infected individuals. While
infection keeps spreading over time, a limited capacity testing is performed at
each time instance as well. In contrast to the classical, static, group testing
problem, the objective in our setup is not to find the minimum number of
required tests to identify the infection status of every individual in the
population, but to control the infection spread by detecting and isolating the
infections over time by using the given, limited number of tests. In order to
analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms, we focus on the mean-sense
analysis of the number of individuals that remain non-infected throughout the
process of controlling the infection. We propose two dynamic algorithms that
both use given limited number of tests to identify and isolate the infections
over time, while the infection spreads. While the first algorithm is a dynamic
randomized individual testing algorithm, in the second algorithm we employ the
group testing approach similar to the original work of Dorfman. By considering
weak versions of our algorithms, we obtain lower bounds for the performance of
our algorithms. Finally, we implement our algorithms and run simulations to
gather numerical results and compare our algorithms and theoretical
approximation results under different sets of system parameters.

Ken Regan is well known to us all, and is the co-author of this blog. He is in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo (SUNY)–as part of the theory group. He is also an International Master from the World Chess Federation (FIDE).<br />
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kr.png?ssl=1"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kr.png?resize=600%2C643&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19573" height="643" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Ken’s Trip </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Ken has used his ability in theory with his expertise in chess to study how to detect cheating in chess. Unfortunately people do currently cheat in chess, and so detecting them is an important problem for FIDE. Ken has just spent some time in Bologna, Italy at the International Chess Federation Fair Play Commission’s meeting. The group’s goal is:  There is an increasing demand for fair play experts during chess events, and we want to provide the organizers with professionals who know how to collect evidence, apply law, use the state-of-the-art detection tools. And do it in the way that players are protected and public perception of how important the fair play is improved. </p>
<p>
Ken is on the way back from Italy and soon will explain in detail what is the latest about cheating in chess.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Cheating In The Past </b></p>
<p></p><p>
In the past cheating at chess started with machines like the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_Turk">Turk</a> of 1770. This was a machine that claimed to play chess without human help. Even just playing legal moves would have been impressive, but the Turk played strong chess.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/turk.jpg?ssl=1"><img width="600" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/turk.jpg?resize=600%2C462&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19574" height="462" /></a></p>
<p>
The secret to the Turk is it used a hidden human chess player to make its moves. The player was hidden inside the machine. The audience was allowed to examine the machine by opening and looking at parts of the machine. The audience member could only examine one part of the Turk at a time. The trick was that the player could move from one part of the Turk to another. At each time some parts of the Turk would be visible, but some part stayed invisible. This meant the player could move from one part to another of the Turk. This fooled the audience and made it seem “magical” that the mechanical system could play chess.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/show.png?ssl=1"><img width="300" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/show.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19577" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Cheating Now and in the Future </b></p>
<p></p><p>
Cheating at chess became interesting again when computer programs started to play strong chess—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating_in_chess">cheating</a>. The fundamental insight was that once programs could play master level chess, players could cheat and play at this level. The idea was simple: A player would not look at the board and select the next move. They would instead ask the program what move should they do. They would then use that move.</p>
<p>
Of course a serious issue was how could the player ask a program to make the next move? If the game they were playing was offline, then the player should be able to use their laptop to remotely run the program. If the game was played in some public place, then the player might have to work harder to run the program. But a player could perhaps still do this without being detected. </p>
<p>
 Technology has been used by chess cheaters in several ways. The most common way is to use a chess program while playing chess remotely, such as on the Internet or in correspondence chess. Rather than play the game directly, the cheater simply inputs the moves so far into the program and follows its suggestions, essentially letting the program play for them. Electronic communication with an accomplice during face-to-face competitive chess is a similar type of cheating; the accomplice can either be using a computer program or else simply be a much better player than their associate.  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b> Open Problems </b></p>
<p></p><p>
The main open problem is still: How well can cheating be detected? The basic idea is simple: Suppose that the player named Carol plays a game in some tournament. We wish to determine whether Carol played her own moves or whether she used moves of some program. How can we do this? There are several issues that make this hard. </p>
<ol>
<li> Carol may stay on “book” at the beginning. How do we factor this in?
</li><li> Carol may have used a program that is secret. Does this effect the detection?
</li><li> Carol may follow a program for all moves or for some of the moves. Does this make the detection more difficult?
</li><li> Carol may already be a strong player. Suppose she uses the program to play at a stronger level. Is this even more difficult to detect?
</li></ol>
<p>
Ken will update us on the latest views of these and other issues. </p>

<p> Is it an irony that Lipton's 1000th post and 75th bday are close together? No. Its a coincidence. People use irony/paradox/coincidence interchangeably. Hearing people make that mistake makes me literally want to strangle them. </p><p>The community celebrated this milestone by having  talks on zoom in Lipton's honor. The  blog post by Ken Regan that announced the event and has a list of speakers is <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/14/happy-1000th-post-and-75th-birthday-dick/">here</a>. The talks were recorded so they should be available soon. YEAH KEN for organizing the event! We may one day be celebrating his 2000th blog post/Xth bday. </p><p>I will celebrate this milestone by writing on how Lipton and his work have inspired and enlightened me. </p><p><br /></p><p>1) My talk at the Lipton zoom-day-of-talks was on the Chandra-Furst-Lipton (1983)  paper (see <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/CFG-multiparty.pdf">here</a>) that sparked my interest in Ramsey Theory, lead to a paper I wrote that improved their upper and lower bounds, and lead to an educational open problem that I posted on this blog, that was answered. There is still more to do.  An expanded version of the slide talk I gave on the zoom-day is <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/liptonbdaytalk.pdf">here</a>. (Their paper also got me interested in Communication complexity.) </p><p>2) I read the De Millo-Lipton-Perlis (1979) paper (see <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/social.pdf">here</a>) my first year in graduate school and found it very enlightening. NOT about program verification, which I did not know much about, but about how mathematics really works.  As an ugrad I was very much into THEOREM-PROOF-THEOREM-PROOF as the basis for truth. This is wrongheaded for two reasons (1) I did not see the value of intuition, and (2) I did not realize that the PROOF is not the END of the story, but the BEGINNING of a process of checking it- many people over time have to check a result. DLP woke me up to point (2) and (to a lesser extend) point (1). A scary thought: most results in math, once published, are never looked at again. So their could be errors in the math literature. However, the important results DO get looked at quite carefully. Even so, I worry that an important result will depend on one that has not been looked at much...Anyway, a link to a  blog post about a symposium about DLP is <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/06/i-went-to-debate-about-program-verif.html">here</a>.</p><p>3) The Karp-Lipton theorem is: <i> if SAT has poly sized circuits than PH collapses</i> (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800141.804678">here</a>), It connects uniform and non-uniform complexity.  This impressed me but also made me thing about IF-THEN statements. In this case something we don't think is true implies something else we don't think is true. So--- do we know something? Yes! The result has been used to get results like </p><p>                                                   If GI is NPC then PH collapses.</p><p>This is evidence that GI is not NPC. </p><p>4) Lipton originally blogged by himself and a blog book came out of that. I reviewed it in <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/bookrev/41-4.pdf">this</a> column. Later it became the  Lipton-Regan blog, which also gave rise to a book, which I reviewed   <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2014/05/review-of-people-problems-and-proofs-by.html#comment-form">here</a>.  Both of these books inspired my blog book. This is a shout-out to BOTH Lipton AND Regan.</p><p>5) Lipton either thinks P=NP or pretends to since he wants people to NOT all think the same thing. Perhaps someone will prove P NE NP while trying to prove P=NP. Like in <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the</i> <i>Galaxy </i>where they say that to fly, you throw yourself on the ground and miss. I took Lipton's advice in another context: While trying to prove that there IS a protocol for 11 muffins, 5 students where everyone gets 11/5 and the smallest piece is 11/25, I wrote down what such a protocol  would have to satisfy (I was sincerely trying to find such a protocol) and ended up proving that you could not do better than 13/30 (for which I already had a protocol). Reminds me of a quote attributed to Erdos: when trying to prove X, spend half your time trying to prove X and half trying to prove NOT(X).</p><p>6) Lipton had a blog post (probably also a paper someplace) about using Ramsey Theory as the basis for a proof system (see <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/06/13/a-proof-system-based-on-ramsey-theory/">here</a>).  That inspired me to propose a potential randomized n^{log n) algorithm for the CLIQUE-GAP problem (see <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2011/07/slightly-diff-take-on-liptons-use-or.html">here</a>). The comments showed why the idea could not work-- no surprise as my idea would have lead to NP contained in RTIME(n^{log n}). Still, it was fun to think about and I learned things in the effort. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>

We present the first truly explicit constructions of \emph{non-malleable codes} against tampering by bounded polynomial size circuits. These objects imply unproven circuit lower bounds and our construction is secure provided E requires exponential size nondeterministic circuits, an assumption from the derandomization literature.
	
	Prior works on NMC for polysize circuits, either required an untamperable CRS [Cheraghchi, Guruswami ITCS'14; Faust, Mukherjee, Venturi, Wichs EUROCRYPT'14] or very strong cryptographic assumptions [Ball, Dachman-Soled, Kulkarni, Lin, Malkin EUROCRYPT'18; Dachman-Soled, Komargodski, Pass CRYPTO'21]. Both of works in the latter category only achieve non-malleability with respect to efficient distinguishers and, more importantly, utilize cryptographic objects for which no provably secure instantiations are known outside the random oracle model. In this sense, none of the prior yields fully explicit codes from non-heuristic assumptions. Our assumption is not known to imply the existence of one-way functions, which suggests that cryptography is unnecessary for non-malleability against this class.
	
	Technically, security is shown by \emph{non-deterministically} reducing polynomial size tampering to split-state tampering. The technique is general enough that it allows us to to construct the first \emph{seedless non-malleable extractors} [Cheraghchi, Guruswami TCC'14] for sources sampled by polynomial size circuits [Trevisan, Vadhan FOCS'00] (resp. recognized by polynomial size circuits [Shaltiel CC'11]) and tampered by polynomial size circuits. Our construction is secure assuming E requires exponential size $\Sigma_4$-circuits (resp. $\Sigma_3$-circuits), this assumption is the state-of-the-art for extracting randomness from such sources (without non-malleability).
	
	We additionally observe that non-malleable codes and non-malleable secret sharing [Goyal, Kumar STOC'18]  are essentially equivalent with respect to polynomial size tampering. In more detail, assuming E is hard for exponential size nondeterministic circuits, any efficient secret sharing scheme can be made non-malleable against polynomial size circuit tampering.
	
	Unfortunately, all of our constructions only achieve inverse polynomial (statistical) security. Extending a result from [Applebaum, Artemenko, Shaltiel, Yang CC'16] we show it is impossible to do better using black-box reductions. However, we extend the notion of relative error from [Applebaum, Artemenko, Shaltiel, Yang CC'16] to non-malleable extractors and show that they can be constructed from similar assumptions. We additionally observe that relative-error non-malleable extractors can be utilized to render a broad class of cryptographic primitives tamper and leakage resilient, while preserving negligible security guarantees.</div>

The event was attended by a group of investors, economists. and teachers in a suitable alcove of a restaurant in Manhattan.  Quoting Rockmore’s article:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Winkler began the evening’s program. The first course of math, delivered during the first course of dinner (a scattering of salads), was a statistics starter called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox">Simpson’s paradox</a>. The paradox explains how apparent biases in large samples can disappear in smaller ones. A famous example: For the University of California at Berkeley’s graduate programs in 1975, over all, men were admitted at a higher rate than women, but, program by program, women were admitted at a higher rate. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
About Berkeley, see <a href="https://www.refsmmat.com/posts/2016-05-08-simpsons-paradox-berkeley.html">this</a> first. We covered Simpson’s paradox <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2014/01/30/global-warming/">here</a>. The article goes on the mention the famous trick of how a biased coin can be made to simulate a fair coin by tossing it twice, and continues:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Winkler let loose with the last official mind bender, a gambling thought experiment involving a fictitious couple named Alice and Bob, who are famous in math circles. Each of them has a biased coin—fifty-one-per-cent chance of heads, forty-nine-per-cent chance of tails. They each start with a hundred dollars, flipping the coin and betting against the bank on the outcome. Alice calls heads every time; Bob calls tails. The puzzle: Given that they both go broke, which one is more likely to have gone broke first? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
The article relates that most diners guessed Bob, but the correct answer is Alice. Former Times math and science columnist John Tierney, a serious enough math fan to have remarked once that the term “recreational mathematics” is a self-contradiction, reasoned it out: “The longer Alice plays, the less likely she is to go broke.” We finish Tierney’s intent by contraposing: hence given that she too went broke, the more likely it was she that played less time.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Old Friend </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Peter is a long time friend of mine. See him in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg6XZcNAgrw">here</a>. He is a delight to talk to about many things—just about any part of math. </p>
<p>
Peter has a <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/solutions.pdf">paper</a> with the title, “Seven Puzzles You Think You Must Not Have Heard Correctly.” I had already started writing this post when I looked up this paper to get a few more puzzle examples. I found this one:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> #4 <b>Unwanted Expansion:</b> <br />
Suppose you have an algebraic expression involving variables, addition, multiplication, and parentheses. You repeatedly attempt to expand it using the distributive law. How do you know that the expression doesn’t continue to expand forever? Comment: Note that applying the distributive law to, say, the outer product in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%28x+%2B+y%29%28s%28u+%2B+v%29+%2B+t%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{(x + y)(s(u + v) + t)}" class="latex" />, yields <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bx%28s%28u+%2B+v%29+%2B+t%29+%2B+y%28s%28u+%2B+v%29+%2B+t%29%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{x(s(u + v) + t) + y(s(u + v) + t)}" class="latex" /> which has more parentheses than before. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought about this for a little. Then I looked up the answer. </p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> One can analyze the expression in terms of depth of trees, but there’s an easier way: set all the variables equal to 2. The point of the distributive law is that its application doesn’t change the value of the expression. The value of the initial expression limits the size of anything you can get from it by expansion. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter then says: <i>This proof of stopping is due to Dick Lipton.</i> I must say that surprised me. I am getting old. Oops.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Open Problems </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Let’s end with a fun puzzle about the dictionary that is also mentioned in the <em>New Yorker</em> article.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2022/01/20/dinner-drinks-denominators/dictionary/" rel="attachment wp-att-19556"><img width="240" alt="" src="https://i0.wp.com/rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dictionary.jpg?resize=240%2C156&amp;ssl=1" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19556" height="156" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> If each number between one and ten billion was written down in English, which odd number would appear first alphabetically? </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Given that spaces do not count, here is the <a href="https://puzzleaday.wordpress.com/2018/10/05/what-is-the-first-odd-number-in-the-dictionary/">answer</a>. The last part changes because the number must be odd. If spaces do count—as in many dictionaries of phrases—then what is the answer?</p>

<p style="text-indent: 1.0em;">from 
<a class="entryheader" href="https://scottaaronson.blog" title="Shtetl-Optimized">Scott Aaronson</a>
<p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en-US">
<p>Exciting news, everyone!  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaan_Tallinn">Jaan Tallinn</a>, who many of you might recognize as a co-creator of Skype, tech enthusiast, and philanthropist, graciously invited me, along with a bunch of other nerds, to join the new <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/speculation-grants">Speculation Grants</a> program of the <a href="https://survivalandflourishing.fund/">Survival and Flourishing Fund (SFF)</a>.  In plain language, that means that Jaan is <strong>giving me $200,000 to distribute to charitable organizations in any way I see fit</strong>—though ideally, my choices will have <em>something</em> to do with the survival and flourishing of our planet and civilization.</p>



<p>(If all goes well, this blog post will actually lead to a lot <em>more</em> than just $200,000 in donations, because it will inspire applications to SFF that can then be funded by other “Speculators” or by SFF’s usual process.)</p>



<p>Thinking about how to handle the responsibility of this amazing and unexpected gift, I decided that I couldn’t possibly improve on what Scott Alexander did with his <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results">personal grants program</a> on <em>Astral Codex Ten</em>.  Thus: I hereby invite the readers of <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> to pitch registered charities (which might or might not be their own)—especially, charities that are relatively small, unknown, and unappreciated, yet that would resonate strongly with someone who thinks the way I do.  Feel free to renominate (i.e., bring back to my attention) charities that were mentioned when I <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=5448">asked a similar question</a> after winning $250,000 from the ACM Prize in Computing.</p>



<p>If you’re interested, there’s a two-step process this time:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1</strong> is to make your pitch to me, either by a comment on this post or by email to me, depending on whether you’d prefer the pitch to be public or private.  Let’s set a deadline for this step of <strong>Thursday, January 27, 2022</strong> (i.e., one week from now).  Your pitch can be extremely short, like 1 paragraph, although I might ask you followup questions.  After January 27, I’ll then take one of two actions in response: I’ll either</p>



<p>(a) commit a specified portion of my $200,000 to your charity, <em>if</em> the charity formally applies to SFF, and <em>if</em> the charity isn’t excluded for some unexpected reason (5 sexual harassment lawsuits against its founders or whatever), and <em>if</em> one of my fellow “Speculators” doesn’t fund your charity before I do … or else I’ll</p>



<p>(b) not commit, in which case your charity <strong>can still apply</strong> for funding from SFF!  One of the other Speculators might fund it, or it might be funded by the “ordinary” SFF process.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2</strong>, which <strong>cannot</strong> be skipped, is then to have your charity <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4PRBIP8CNCviFiNkSSMKy6Ms3sUJBOi_ykE8IDvTeB5Nr_A/viewform">submit a formal application</a> to SFF.  The application form isn’t too bad.  But if the charity isn’t your own, it would help enormously if you at least <em>knew</em> someone at the charity, so you could tell them to apply to SFF.  Again, Step 2 can be taken regardless of the outcome of Step 1.</p>



<p>The one big rule is that anything you suggest has to be a registered, tax-exempt charity in either the US or the UK.  I won’t be distributing funds myself, but only advising SFF how to do so, and this is SFF’s rule, not mine.  So alas, no political advocacy groups and no individuals.  Donating to groups outside the US and UK is apparently possible but difficult.</p>



<p>While I’m not putting any restrictions on the scope, let me list a few examples of areas of interest to me.</p>



<ul><li>Advanced math and science education at the precollege level: gifted programs, summer camps, online resources, or anything, really, that aims to ensure that the next Ramanujan or von Neumann isn’t lost to the world.</li><li>Conservation of endangered species.</li><li>Undervalued approaches to dealing with the climate catastrophe (including new approaches to nuclear energy, geoengineering, and carbon capture and storage … or even, e.g., studies of the effects of rising CO<sub>2</sub> on cognition and how to mitigate them).</li><li>Undervalued approaches to preventing or mitigating future pandemics—basically, anything dirt-cheap that we <em>wish</em> had been done before covid.</li><li>Almost anything that <a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/acx-grants-results">Scott Alexander might have funded</a> if he’d had more money.</li><li>Anything that would enrage the SneerClubbers or those who attack me on Twitter, by doing stuff that even <em>they</em> would have to acknowledge makes the world better, but that does so via people, organizations, and means that they despise.</li></ul>



<p>Two examples of areas that I <em>don’t</em> plan to focus on are:</p>



<ul><li>AI-risk and other “strongly rationalist-flavored” organizations (these are already well-covered by others at SFF, so that I don’t expect to have an advantage), and</li><li>quantum computing research (this is already funded by a zillion government agencies, companies, and venture capitalists).</li></ul>



<p>Anyway, thanks so much to Jaan and to SFF for giving me this incredible opportunity, and I look forward to seeing what y’all come up with!</p>



<p><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-red-color">Note:</span></strong> Any other philanthropists who read this blog, and who’d like to add to the amount, are more than welcome to do so!</p></div>

Read-once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs (ROABPs) compute polynomials as products of univariate polynomials that have matrices as coefficients. In an attempt to understand the landscape of algebraic complexity classes surrounding ROABPs, we study classes of ROABPs based on the algebraic structure of these coefficient matrices. We study connections between polynomials computed by these structured variants of ROABPs and other well-known classes of polynomials (such as depth-three powering circuits, tensor-rank and Waring rank of polynomials).

Our main result concerns commutative ROABPs, where all coefficient matrices commute with each other, and diagonal ROABPs, where all the coefficient matrices are just diagonal matrices. In particular, we show a somewhat surprising connection between these models and the model of depth-three powering circuits that is related to the Waring rank of polynomials. We show that if the dimension of partial derivatives captures Waring rank up to polynomial factors, then the model of diagonal ROABPs efficiently simulates the seemingly more expressive model of commutative ROABPs. Further, a commutative ROABP that cannot be efficiently simulated by a diagonal ROABP will give an explicit polynomial that gives a super-polynomial separation between dimension of partial derivatives and Waring rank.

Our proof of the above result builds on the results of Marinari, Möller and Mora (1993), and Möller and Stetter (1995), that characterise rings of commuting matrices in terms of polynomials that have small dimension of partial derivatives. The algebraic structure of the coefficient matrices of these ROABPs plays a crucial role in our proofs.</div>

    <p>Our quarter started this week, online through Zoom, accessed in Canvas <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(<a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/107585920689338985">\(\mathbb{M}\)</a>).</span> To set it up I have to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Find and navigate to another site in which I can request a Canvas site, but get redirected to the campus login page, where I have to hand-type my name and password, then get to a page to choose my two-factor authentication, select the phone option on that page, find and unlock my phone, and find and approve the two-factor authentication request on my phone</li>
      <li>Back at the site to request a Canvas site, use it to actually request a Canvas site; this does not actually create the site, but rather puts it into a queue to be processed one or two hours later</li>
      <li>Once the site is created, navigate to Canvas, going through all the same campus login steps first.</li>
      <li>Search the web for the <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/teachanywhere/home/tools/zoom/">campus page on how to enable Zoom</a>, because the steps to do so are not simple or obvious enough to remember, and neither is the location of the campus page.</li>
      <li>Follow the five non-obvious steps on that page for adding Zoom to a Canvas site.</li>
      <li>Go to the new Zoom tab of my new Canvas site where I still have to go through all of the usual Zoom things to schedule a meeting that repeats weekly but only for some of the weekdays (many more steps).</li>
    </ul>

Richard Lipton founded this blog 1,000 posts ago. He was not quite as young as in the photo. This blog is almost 13 years old but measures time by the count of posts. Time itself occurs only between posts. Unlike what we said <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2018/03/14/happy-0x50th-birthday-donald-knuth/">here</a> about counting birthdays, we are counting “1,000 posts ago” correctly—because the blog was created before the first post with the <em>pages</em> one can click on above.</p>
<p>
Today we—including many from the community—also salute Dick’s 75th birthday.</p>
<p>
The birthday was last September 6. A year ago, I thought the anniversaries could be made to coincide, but the time between posts flowed heavily. Much as a ship captain’s personal attributes become vested in the ship, I felt the birthday could best be hailed at the blog milestone. In this we take after the Queen of England. Elizabeth Windsor was born on April 21 (1926), but follows the centuries-old royal custom of celebrating the birthday in late spring. </p>
<p>
It has been my great pleasure to know Dick for 35 years in-person and several years before that through his papers. His STOC 1980 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221590666_The_Consistency_of_P_NP_and_Related_Problems_with_Fragments_of_Number_Theory">paper</a> with Rich DeMillo on the possible independence of P versus NP influenced me to focus on systems of logic as a graduate student. We talked most at STACS 1994 in Caen, France, and this led to a <a href="https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/communication-complexity-of-key-agreement-on-small-ranges">paper</a> with four others in the next STACS. I gave an invited talk at Dick’s 2008 birthday celebration workshop—of which more below—and this began our closer association the next year. Dick and the blog are a fount of ideas, and if I say I wish I had time to develop them all, the answer is that our readers are always freely welcome to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> The Elevator Workshop </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
It is also my delight to have a slate of volunteer speakers for a <b>mini-workshop</b> this coming <b>Monday</b> (Martin Luther King Day, <b>January 17</b>) starting at <b>4pm Eastern Time</b> (US). It will have the theme “Open Problems”—what else?—actually there is “else” as some of the brief talks will be personal notes or nuggets of work that influenced careers. It is open to the public—all readers are invited to attend on Monday via the following Zoom link.  <b>Update:</b> things worked fine, and I have removed the link…</p>
<p>
…except to note that the passcode I made was 111317.  I intended the passcode to be the three primes that multiply to <b>1,001</b>, thinking of what comes next, but those three multiply to 2,431—way far ahead, but see Lance Fortnow’s comment below.  There is no “Waiting Room” and no restriction on when to come or go.</p>
<p>
Here are speakers who have volunteered so far—alphabetical except those in overseas time zones beginning with India will go first:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Subruk Kalyanasundaram <p></p>
</li><li>
Ravi Kannan <p></p>
</li><li>
Gil Kalai <p></p>
</li><li>
Joel Ouaknine<p></p>
</li><li>
Harry Buhrman <p></p>
</li><li>
Jin-Yi Cai<p></p>
</li><li>
Zvi Galil <p></p>
</li><li>
Bill Gasarch <p></p>
</li><li>
Mitsunori Ogihara <p></p>
</li><li>
Rafail Ostrovsky<p></p>
</li><li>
Atri Rudra <p></p>
</li><li>
Santosh Vempala <p></p>
</li><li>
Michael Wehar <p></p>
</li><li>
Ryan Williams
</li></ul>
<p>
And possibly a few more. Among the open problems, some may be “Favorite Problems” and some “Formative Problems.” The latter means ones that can shape the field during the coming decade. They should be both important and <em>pliable</em>. The latter word is a pun: it means flexible, but we also mean something a beginning researcher can <em>ply</em> into a dissertation and early career. Computational complexity has many problems that seem to have become rigid, but its sideways growth shows pliable ones are out there. </p>
<p>
One of this blog’s first posts in February, 2009, was on conveying the key idea to solve a problem in the time of an <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/16/proofs-and-elevator-rides/">elevator pitch</a>. The same goes for the time to state a good problem. The talks, including pauses and time for questions, will aim to fit within an hour, or 90 minutes at most. </p>
<p>
</p><p></p><h2> Some Well-Wishes </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
I am also thankful to have the following well-wishes thus far from around the community, including several more fellow bloggers. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Scott Aaronson</b>: Happy birthday Dick! Your results have been an inspiration to me, from DeMillo-Lipton in 1979 on the independence of P vs NP to self-testing of the permanent (which played a central role in my work on BosonSampling). I hear some of your students, like Avi Wigderson, have done OK stuff as well. I look forward to checking your blog for many years to come! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Andrew Appel</b>: I have <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1676454">Massive Memories</a> of the decade and a half that we overlapped at Princeton, in which you were one of my mentors, explaining to me the ways of the world. When I arrived there from from my PhD it seemed like all the really senior professors (you among them) were celebrating their 40th birthdays. Very best wishes for your 75th. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Boaz Barak</b>: Congratulations to GLL for its 1,000th post and to Dick for his 75th birthday! Dick has done so much for computer science, including many works that have become part of our canon and shaped our “conventional wisdom.” And then with GLL both Ken and Dick have managed to inject fun and humanity into our technical field and also question some of that conventional wisdom itself. Looking forward to the next 1,000 posts! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Paul Beame</b>: Double congratulations, Dick! and congratulations to Ken, too. Through GLL you have helped foster a closer sense of community in our field. Your thought-provoking and informative posts and depth of engagement are inspirational.<p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Avrim Blum</b>: Very happy 75th birthday, Dick! We are fortunate to have you in our field! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Harry Buhrman</b>: Congratulations to Dick on his birthday and edition 1,000 of this blog. For me it is also the 42nd birthday of the beautiful Karp-Lipton theorem which is one of my favourite theorems. Its quantum variants are still very relevant and are currently of importance in the quantum computing community. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Jin-Yi Cai</b>: My most sincere well wishes to Dick’s 75th birthday! You have been an inspiration to so many of us over many decades! And warm congratulations to your successful 1,000th post! Your blog GLL, now with Ken, has become a most important landmark in our community. (And will speak, as above.)<p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Rich DeMillo</b>—see below. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>David Dobkin</b>—see below. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>David Eppstein</b>: Happy birthday, and congratulations on the 1,000th post! I always look forward to your posts, both for their clear explanations of difficult topics and for the way you lighten them up with the biographical parts. May you have many more excellent birthdays and posts.<p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Ron Fagin</b>: I have always enjoyed the Gödel’s Lost Letter blog. In fact, I view it as an important part of my computer science experience! Congratulations, Dick and Ken, on the 1,000th post! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Lance Fortnow</b>: Congrats to Dick and Ken for their millenary post. Learned much about chess, leprechauns, and even some theory. Best wishes for the next 1,000. BTW, Bill Gasarch and I are at 2895 posts so you have some catching up to do. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Merrick Furst</b>: Dick, it’s been an incredible pleasure to work with you and play with you and be allies with you since we first met and became fast friends in the late 70’s.  What a long, strange, wonderfully complex trip it’s been.  Wishing you all the best and hope to find a way to see you sometime soon.<p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Bill Gasarch</b>—will speak, as above. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Gil Kalai</b>—will speak, as above. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Subruk Kalyanasundaram</b>: I am delighted to see GLL complete 1,000 posts! Since its inception in February 2009, GLL has created and continues to exist in its own unique space. After putting up a handful of posts, Dick sent a few of us students an understated email that went something like “started a new blog. see if you like it.” At that time, I had no idea that Dick could keep it going for 1,000 posts. I was actively involved in proofreading posts in the first couple of years, but am still a regular reader. It was a privilege to see the posts a day or two before the rest of the world. GLL has been such a successful and popular blog, and wishing many many more exciting posts! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Richard Karp</b>: Dear Dick, It has been my good fortune to be your friend and collaborate with you over many years, especially during your Berkeley period. Gödel’s Last Letter has been a major source of information and insight for me, consistently demonstrating your virtuosity and the depth of your knowledge. Congratulations also to Kathryn for her support of your efforts, and to Ken for his fruitful partnership with you. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Andrea LaPaugh</b>: Dick, congratulations and the best of wishes as you celebrate your 1,000th GLL post and your 75th birthday! The great energy, insight and joy you bring to computational theory has been an inspiration to me and many others. May you enjoy your passion for theory, and life, for many years to come. (And more below.) <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Jonathan Lenchner</b>: Congratulations on the 1,000th posting to the GLL blog—an incredible go-to reference for the computational complexity community! It has been great to reconnect with Ken, who I first met through chess, over logic. Sending belated well wishes also to Dick on the occasion of his 75th birthday! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Harry Lewis</b>: Dick—Thank you for being the guy who always made TCS fun! There is no one who better exemplifies the principle that irreverence is key to the creative process. You have always had the gift of showing how seriously you took the questions of the field by taking their canonical answers so lightly. Your milestone sounds better in French, so I’ll paraphrase: Happy sixty-somethingth! And may you be forever young. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Daniel Lopresti</b>: Dick, I want to wish you a happy (belated) 75th birthday. Your deep and broad insights have had a tremendous impact on me and many of our colleagues in the field of computer science over the years. With warm regards, Dan Lopresti.<p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Danupon Nanongkai</b>: About a decade ago, I had the privilege to learn about many exciting problems and insights from many meetings with Dick while I was his PhD student. That was when the Gödel’s Lost Letter blog started, and I am grateful that I can continue to learn by reading this blog. Congratulations on the 1,000th post and Dick’s 75th birthday! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Mitsunori Ogihara</b>—will speak, as above. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Rafail Ostrovsky</b>: My warmest congratulations to Dick and Kathryn on Dick’s birthday wishing Dick many more equally productive and healthy years to come and enjoy. GLL is a truly an inspiration to us all—big thank you to Dick and Ken for an amazing and always inspiring content. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Joel Ouaknine</b>: Thanks for the many many inspirational and insightful posts! I’ve learned more computer science and mathematics on GLL than in any other single source I can think of! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Vijaya Ramachandran</b>: As one of the Dick’s earlier Ph.D. students (graduating in 1983), I would like to offer Dick my best wishes for a very happy 75th birthday, and for many more years to come. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Atri Rudra</b>: I have always been and continue to be amazed by the frequency of posts on GLL especially given the mathematical depth of the exposition, which somehow still manages to be accessible to a wide audience. Here’s wishing to many more years of GLL posts being prolific!  <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Terence Tao</b>: Happy 1,000th post Dick! I very much appreciate the personal and inclusive style of mathematical storytelling that you bring to the mathematical blogging community. Look forward to the next 1,000. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Santosh Vempala</b>: My best wishes to Dick and many thanks to Dick and Ken for a 1,000 interesting posts! Here’s to the next 1,000. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Suresh Venkatasubramanian</b>: On the internet, last week is like 2 years ago. Or so it feels that way. While some of us are frantically trying to tweet our papers and TikTok our talks, it’s a testimonial to persistence and steadiness that GLL has reached its 1,000th <em>blog</em> post (although I would subscribe to a TikTok live feed of Ken and Dick composing their latest post). GLL is an oasis of depth and substance in the desert of social media, and I for one am glad it’s going strong. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Avi Wigderson</b>: I had the good fortune to be Dick Lipton’s PhD student in the years 1980-83. Being with a researcher so knowledgeable, curious, original and passionate in these formative years has shaped my own research path. Happy 75th, Dick, and many happy returns! <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Ryan Williams</b>—will speak, as above. <p></p>
</li><li>
<b>Virginia Vassilevska Williams</b>: Happy 1,000th post, Dick! Your blog posts are always so fun to read, highly informative and polished, a treasured gift to our community. Thank you for working on them all this time. I’m looking forward to many more!

</p><p></p><h2> Some Words From Princeton—and Yale </h2><p></p>
<p></p><p>
Andrea LaPaugh <a href="https://dof.princeton.edu/about/clerk-faculty/emeritus/andrea-s-lapaugh">became</a> Dean of the Faculty at Princeton and served until her recent retirement. She has some further words from that perspective going back to the beginning of her 38 years at Princeton.</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Dick was a major force in the development of the CS department at Princeton. His work was instrumental in the creation of the department as separate from Electrical Engineering, in recruiting faculty to grow the department, and in acquiring resources. He arrived in 1980 and immediately recruited David Dobkin as a full professor and me as an assistant professor. He continued to have major involvement in recruiting, not only in theoretical computer science, but across the CS disciplines. He was never chair, but worked first with Bruce Arden, chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and then with Bob Sedgewick, the first chair of the Department of Computer Science (after Dick recruited him) to implement a vision of a strong and well-rounded CS department. Of course Dick was not alone in this mission. David Dobkin in particular was an important partner. But from my perspective, Dick was the spark. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
David Dobkin, also writing from Princeton, goes back a few years further still to Yale:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> In 1973 when I arrived at Yale as a new faculty member with a fresh PhD, Dick Lipton was the person in the next office who had arrived perhaps a week earlier. He came by to introduce himself. After a bit of formalities, we began to discuss research problems and he asked me about NP-complete problems which were all the rage at the time. The only problem I knew about was the knapsack problem and so I described it.</em></p><em>
<p>
This led to a discussion about integer programming (which neither of us had a good handle on) and then to a discussion about determining in which region of a subdivision of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=e8e8e8&amp;fg=000000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="{n}" class="latex" />-space (by a set of hyperplanes) a new point was in. Here again, neither Dick nor I had much background and so we invented things as we went. I had this idea that we could understand things with visual help and so we took one of my moving boxes as our universe and the back of some tablets as planes and began to simulate how regions would be determined in 3d.</p>
<p>
From this work emerged our first paper together which was presented at STOC ’74. This on planar subdivision searching opened up a field and led to a long and enjoyable collaboration that followed.</p>
</em><p><em>
So, congratulations Dick on having escaped the world of cardboard planes in a moving box and headed on to a remarkable career in the field. </em>

Rich DeMillo sent the following from summer sunshine and open water:</p>
<p>
The last time I missed Dick’s birthday was 2008. In 2007, Dan Boneh, Merrick Furst, Santosh Vempala, and I sent the following 60th birthday symposium invitation to twenty of Lipton’s closest friends and collaborators:</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://denseoutliers.blogspot.com/2008/03/lipton-theory-symposium.html">Lipton-60</a> <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2008/05/report-on-sym-for-liptons-60th-bday.html">Symposium</a> was finally held in April 2008. It was less the retrospective I had imagined than a mile marker in a career that continued to accelerate in unexpected ways. A few years later, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. A few months after that, he was announced as winner of the 2014 Knuth Prize. Even more memorable was the other thing that draws us together here today: the launch in 2009 of the GLL blog that he now writes with Ken. </p>
<p>
I have long since strayed from the mainstream of theory and algorithms, but most of the work we did together has found its way into GLL essays that illuminate in startling new ways material I thought I understood thoroughly. Our paper on the nature of proof that now appears in Harry Lewis’s <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/ideas-created-future">collection</a> of 46 of the most important (in his view) papers in computer science made its first <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/02/16/proofs-and-elevator-rides/">appearance</a> on the blog in 2009 and has been a recurring character in the “GLL universe” ever since. Our probabilistic <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">algorithm</a> for polynomial zero testing also entered GLL in 2009. For years I harbored vague resentment that Jack Schwartz was often cited in the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma for a result that Dick and I had published two years before in 1979, but the <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/">exposition</a> in GLL, Ken’s subsequent <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/#comment-1993">commentary</a>, and <em>years later</em>, a reader’s <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/#comment-64661">comment</a> showing that Daniel Erickson’s 1974 Caltech dissertation had scooped us all, laid that to rest. </p>
<p>
We both had a fascination with the idea of algorithm correctness—incorrectness, actually—that turned into entire fields in software engineering and cryptography. Those were documented in an “Un-Birthday” <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2021/01/29/happy-un-birthday-rich/">post</a> a year ago:</p>
<blockquote><p><b> </b> <em> Rich and I started our work together over four decades ago. A central theme of our work was correctness. We were concerned That programs might not work as planned. At the time it was not obvious that this was a major theme of our joint work. But looking back now I can see that it was. </em>
</p></blockquote>
<p></p><p>
Also recently, I managed to coax Dick into the fraught waters of election security. I stood back to watch how flustered researchers would respond to his (brilliant but unworkable) <a href="https://rjlipton.wpcomstaging.com/2019/05/10/making-elections-safe/">reconstructions</a> of what it means to vote in a public election. </p>
<p>
I have been delaying my plans to remove myself from day-to-day management duties to found a new department of cybersecurity at Georgia Tech, and I have missed Dick at my side since his retirement. There was always the possibility when Dick was in the room that someone’s long-held (but wrong) assumption would fall apart under a trademarked but understated Lipton assault. Michael Rabin (who also contributed to the Lipton-60 symposium) was fond of telling Dick on such occasions, “You are a very dangerous person.” </p>
<p>
With this intimate gathering on January 17 to commemorate GLL 1,000 and Dick Lipton’s 75th Birthday, Ken Regan has slyly kept alive the tradition of meetings that take place months after the anniversary of Dick’s birth. Times are different. Virtual meetings have replaced the casual travel and camaraderie of 2008. I cannot attend in any form on January 17 since I am at present on a ship bound for the Drake Passage and Patagonia, and I will lose Internet connectivity soon. I hope that explanation excuses this longer-than-asked-for expression of affection and admiration for Dick, my friend and collaborator for nearly 50 years. </p>

We give a deterministic space-efficient algorithm for approximating powers of stochastic matrices. On input a $w \times w$ stochastic matrix $A$, our algorithm approximates $A^{n}$ in space $\widetilde{O}(\log n + \sqrt{\log n}\cdot \log w)$ to within high accuracy. This improves upon the seminal work by Saks and Zhou (FOCS'95), that requires $O(\log^{3/2}n + \sqrt{\log n} \cdot \log w)$ space, in the regime $n \gg w$.</div>

A secret-sharing scheme allows to distribute a secret $s$ among $n$ parties such that only some predefined ``authorized'' sets of parties can reconstruct the secret, and all other ``unauthorized'' sets learn nothing about $s$. For over 30 years, it was known that any (monotone) collection of authorized sets can be realized by a secret-sharing scheme whose shares are of size $2^{n-o(n)}$ and until recently no better scheme was known. In a recent breakthrough, Liu and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2018) have reduced the share size to $2^{0.994n+o(n)}$, and this was further improved by several follow-ups accumulating in an upper bound of $1.5^{n+o(n)}$ (Applebaum and Nir, CRYPTO 2021). Following these advances, it is natural to ask whether these new approaches can lead to a truly sub-exponential upper-bound of $2^{n^{1-\epsilon}}$ for some constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, or even all the way down to polynomial upper-bounds.

In this paper, we relate this question to the complexity of computing monotone Boolean functions by monotone real circuits (MRCs)  -- a computational model that was introduced by Pudl\'{a}k  (J. Symb. Log., 1997) in the context of proof complexity. We introduce a new notion of ``separable'' MRCs that lies between monotone real circuits and monotone real formulas (MRFs). As our main results, we show that recent constructions of general secret-sharing schemes implicitly give rise to separable MRCs for general monotone functions of similar complexity, and that some monotone functions (in monotone NP) cannot be computed by sub-exponential size separable MRCs. Interestingly, it seems that proving similar lower-bounds for general MRCs is beyond the reach of current techniques.

We use this connection to obtain lower-bounds against a natural family of secret-sharing schemes, as well as new non-trivial upper-bounds for MRCs. Specifically, we conclude that recent approaches for secret-sharing schemes cannot achieve sub-exponential share size and that every monotone function can be realized by an MRC (or even MRF) of complexity $1.5^{n+o(n)}$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first improvement over the trivial $2^{n-o(n)}$ upper-bound. Along the way, we show that the recent constructions of general secret-sharing schemes implicitly give rise to Boolean formulas over slice functions and prove that such formulas can be simulated by separable MRCs of similar size. On a conceptual level, our paper continues the rich line of study that relates the share size of secret-sharing schemes to monotone complexity measures.</div>

<p><i>Guest post by Boaz Barak
and Jelani Nelson</i></p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In a <a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2021/12/defending-status-quo.html">recent
post</a>, Lance Fortnow critiqued our <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/k12mathmatters/home">open letter</a> on the
proposed revisions for the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/">California Mathematics Framework</a> (CMF). We disagree
with Lance’s critique, and he has kindly allowed us to post our rebuttal here
(thank you Lance!).</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, let us point out the aspects where we agree with both
Lance and the authors of the CMF. Inequality in mathematical education, and in
particular the obstacles faced by low-income students and students of color, is
a huge problem in the US at large and California in particular. As a Black
mathematician, this portion of the CMF’s <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/documents/mathfwchapter1.docx">introduction</a> particularly resonated
with me (Jelani):</p><blockquote><p class="MsoNormal">Girls and Black and Brown children, notably, represent
groups that more often receive messages that they are not capable of high-level
mathematics, compared to their White and male counterparts (Shah &amp;
Leonardo, 2017). As early as preschool and kindergarten, research and policy
documents use deficit-oriented labels to describe Black and Latinx and
low-income children’s mathematical learning and position them as already behind
their white and middle-class peers (NCSM &amp; TODOS, 2016).</p></blockquote><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We agree with the observation that bias in the public
education system can have a negative impact on students from underrepresented
groups. Where we strongly oppose the CMF though is regarding their conclusions
on how to address this concern. </p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The CMF may state that they are motivated by increasing
equity in mathematics. However, if we read past the introduction to the actual
details of the CMF revisions, then we see they suffer from fundamental flaws,
which we believe if implemented, would <b>exacerbate</b> educational gaps, and
in particular make it <b>harder</b> for low-income students and students of
color to reach and be successful in college STEM.</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">You can read our <a href="https://gdoc.pub/doc/e/2PACX-1vQvuzlJ8MWthsqOhRLxQc5akGS0JkgThz3umqO3K-WQiXFhWiq9qw-9iYdTyC652Ftjvv5nHvgGYTEv">detailed
critique</a> of the CMF, but the revisions we take issue with are:</p><p class="MsoNormal"></p>

<ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0in;" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal">Recommendation
     to drop the option of Algebra I in the 8th grade<br />
     </li><li class="MsoNormal">Recommendation
     to offer (and in fact push and elevate above others) a “data science”
     pathway for high school education as an alternative to the traditional
     Algebra and Geometry curriculum. While data science can be a deep and
     important field, teaching it for students without a math background will
     be necessarily shallow. Indeed, the proposed data science courses focus on
     tools such as using spreadsheets etc., and do not provide mathematical
     foundations.</li>
</ol>

<p class="MsoNormal">1 and 2 make it all but impossible for students that follow
the recommended path to reach calculus (perhaps even pre-calculus)  in the
12th grade.  This means that such students will be at a disadvantage if
they want to pursue STEM majors in college. And who will be these students?
Since the CMF is only recommended, wealthier school districts are free to
reject it, and some already <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2021/11/california-math/">signalled
that they will do so</a>. Within districts that do adopt the recommendations,
students with means are likely to take private Algebra I courses outside the
curriculum (as <a href="https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2021/12/san-francisco-math/">already
</a><a href="https://edsource.org/2021/one-districts-faulty-data-shouldnt-drive-californias-math-policy/663374">happened</a>
in San Francisco), and reject the calculus-free “data science” pathway. Hence
this pathway will amount to a lower-tier track by another name, and worse than
now, students will be tracked based on whether their family has the financial
means to supplement the child’s public education with private coursework.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Notably, though the CMF aims to elevate data science, we’ve
had several data science faculty at the university level express disapproval of
the proposal by signing our opposition letter, including a founding faculty
member of the Data Science Institute at UCSD, and several others who are
directors of various undergraduate programs at their respective universities,
including four who direct their universities' undergraduate data science
programs (at Indiana University, Loyola University in Chicago, MIT, and the
University of Wisconsin)! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One could say that while the framework may hurt low-income
or students of color who want to pursue STEM in college, it might help other
students who are not interested in STEM. However, interest in STEM majors is <a href="https://www.ppic.org/blog/more-students-are-earning-stem-degrees/">rapidly
rising</a>, and with good reasons: employment in math occupations is projected
to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/mobile/home.htm">grow much faster </a>than
other occupations. With the increasing centrality of technology and STEM to our
society, we urgently need reforms that will diversify these professions rather
than the other way around.</p><p class="MsoNormal">As a final note, Lance claimed that by rejecting the CMF, we
are “defending the status quo”. This is not true. The CMF revisions are far
from the “only game in town” for improving the status quo in mathematics
education. In fact, unlike these largely untested proposals, there is a history
of approaches that do work for teaching mathematics for under-served
populations. We do not need to change the math itself, just invest in more
support (including extracurricular support) for students from under-resourced
communities. For example, Bob Moses’ <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/08/02/206813091/to-60s-civil-rights-hero-math-is-kids-formula-for-success">Algebra
Project</a> has time and again taken the least successful students according to
standardized exams, and turned them into a cohort that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/07/education/algebra-project-bob-moses-empowers-students.html">outperformed</a>
state averages in math. One of our letter’s contact people is Adrian Mims, an
educator with 27 years of experience, whose dissertation was on 
"Improving African American Achievement in Geometry Honors" and who
went on to found <a href="https://thecalculusproject.org/">The Calculus
Project</a>, a non-profit organization creating a pathway for low-income
students and students of color to succeed in advanced mathematics. </p><p class="MsoNormal">To close, a critique of the proposed CMF revision is not a
defense of the status quo. Even if change is needed, not all change is good
change, and our letter does make some recommendations on the front, one of
which is a matter of process: if a goal is to best prepare Californian youth
for majors in data science and STEM more broadly, and ultimately careers in
these spaces, then involve college-level STEM educators and STEM professionals
in the <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/mathcfccapplicants.asp">Curriculum

<p><em>(Hopefully no one has taken taken that title yet!)</em></p>



<p>I waste a large fraction of my existence just reading about what’s happening in the world, or discussion and analysis thereof, in an unending scroll of paralysis and depression.  On the first anniversary of the January 6 attack, I read the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/january-6-insurrection-trump-coup-2024-election/620843/n">recent revelations</a> about just how close the seditionists actually came to overturning the election outcome (e.g., by pressuring just one Republican state legislature to “decertify” its electors, after which the others would likely follow in a domino effect), and how hard it now is to see a path by which democracy in the United States will survive beyond 2024.  Or I read <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/10/manchin-bbb-coal-miners-vs-owners/">about</a> Joe Manchin, who’s already entered the annals of history as the man who could’ve halted the slide to the abyss and decided not to.  Of course, I also read about the wokeists, who correctly see the swing of civilization getting pushed terrifyingly far out of equilibrium to the right, so their solution is to push the swing terrifyingly far out of equilibrium to the <em>left</em>, and then they act shocked when their own action, having added all this potential energy to the swing, causes it to swing back <em>even further</em> to the right, as swings tend to do.  (And <em>also</em> there’s a global pandemic killing millions, and the correct response to it—to authorize and distribute new vaccines as quickly as the virus mutates—is completely outside the Overton Window between Obey the Experts and Disobey the Experts, advocated by no one but a few nerds.  When I first wrote this post, I forgot all about the global pandemic.)  And I see all this and I am powerless to stop it.</p>



<p>In such a dark time, it’s easy to forget that I’m a theoretical computer scientist, mainly focused on quantum computing.  It’s easy to forget that people come to this blog because they want to read about quantum computing.  It’s like, who gives a crap about that anymore?  What doth it profit a man, if he gaineth a few thousand fault-tolerant qubits with which to calculateth chemical reaction rates or discrete logarithms, and he loseth civilization?</p>



<p>Nevertheless, in the rest of this post I’m going to share some quantum-related debunking updates—not because that’s what’s at the top of my mind, but in an attempt to find my way back to sanity.  Picture that: quantum mechanics (and specifically, the refutation of outlandish claims related to quantum mechanics) as the part of one’s life that’s comforting, normal, and sane.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>There’s been lots of online debate about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07978">claim</a> to have entangled a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrade</a> (i.e., water bear) with a superconducting qubit; see also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15166">this paper</a> by Vlatko Vedral, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/no-tardigrades-have-not-been-quantum-entangled-with-a-qubit/">this</a> from CNET, <a href="https://twitter.com/benbenbrubaker/status/1472287582654455817?s=20">this</a> from Ben Brubaker on Twitter.  So, do we now have Schrödinger’s Tardigrade: a living, “macroscopic” organism maintained coherently in a quantum superposition of two states?  How could such a thing be possible with the technology of the early 21<sup>st</sup> century?  Hasn’t it been a huge challenge to demonstrate even Schrödinger’s Virus or Schrödinger’s Bacterium?  So then how did this experiment leapfrog (or leaptardigrade) over those vastly easier goals?</p>



<p>Short answer: it didn’t.  The experimenters couldn’t directly measure the degree of freedom in the tardigrade that’s claimed to be entangled with the qubit.  But it’s consistent with everything they report that whatever entanglement is there, it’s between the superconducting qubit and a microscopic <em>part</em> of the tardigrade.  It’s <em>also</em> consistent with everything they report that there’s no entanglement at all between the qubit and <em>any</em> part of the tardigrade, just boring classical correlation.  (Or rather that, if there’s “entanglement,” then it’s the Everett kind, involving not merely the qubit and the tardigrade but the whole environment—the same as we’d get by just measuring the qubit!)  Further work would be needed to distinguish these possibilities.  In any case, it’s of course cool that they were able to cool a tardigrade to near absolute zero and then revive it afterwards.</p>



<p>I thank the authors of the tardigrade paper, who clarified a few of these points in correspondence with me.  Obviously the comments section is open for whatever I’ve misunderstood.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator" />



<p>People also asked me to respond to Sabine Hossenfelder’s recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytyjgIyegDI">video</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdeterminism">superdeterminism</a>, a theory that holds that quantum entanglement doesn’t actually exist, but the universe’s initial conditions were fine-tuned to stop us from choosing to measure qubits in ways that would make its nonexistence apparent: even when we <em>think</em> we’re applying the right measurements, we’re not, because the initial conditions messed with our brains or our computers’ random number generators.  (See, I tried to be as non-prejudicial as possible in that summary, and it still came out sounding like a parody.  Sorry!)</p>



<p>Sabine sets up the usual dichotomy that people argue against superdeterminism only because they’re attached to a belief in free will.  She rejects Bell’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem#Statistical_independence">statistical independence</a> assumption, which she sees as a mere dogma rather than a prerequisite for doing science.  Toward the end of the video, Sabine mentions the objection that, without statistical independence, a demon could destroy any randomized controlled trial, by tampering with the random number generator that decides who’s in the control group and who isn’t.  But she then reassures the viewer that it’s no problem: superdeterministic conspiracies will only appear when quantum mechanics would’ve predicted a Bell inequality violation or the like.  Crucially, she never explains the mechanism by which superdeterminism, once allowed into the universe (<em>including</em> into macroscopic devices like computers and random number generators), will stay confined to reproducing the specific predictions that quantum mechanics already told us were true, rather than enabling ESP or telepathy or other mischief.  This is <em>stipulated</em>, never explained or derived.</p>



<p>To say I’m not a fan of superdeterminism would be a super-understatement.  And yet, nothing I’ve written previously on this blog—about superdeterminism’s gobsmacking lack of explanatory power, or about how trivial it would be to cook up a superdeterministic “mechanism” for, e.g., faster-than-light signaling—none of it seems to have made a dent.  It’s all come across as obvious to the majority of physicists and computer scientists who think as I do, and it’s all fallen on deaf ears to superdeterminism’s fans.</p>



<p>So in desperation, let me now try another tack: going meta.  It strikes me that no one who saw quantum mechanics as a profound clue about the nature of reality could ever, in a trillion years, think that superdeterminism looked like a promising route forward given our current knowledge.  The only way you could think that, it seems to me, is if you saw quantum mechanics as an <strong>anti-clue</strong>: a red herring, actively misleading us about how the world really is.  To be a superdeterminist is to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>OK, fine, there’s the Bell experiment, which <em>looks like</em> Nature screaming the reality of ‘genuine indeterminism, as predicted by QM,’ louder than you might’ve thought it even <em>logically possible</em> for that to be screamed.  But don’t listen to Nature, listen to us!  If you just drop what you thought were foundational assumptions of science, we can explain this away!  Not <em>explain</em> it, of course, but explain it <em>away</em>.  What more could you ask from us?</p></blockquote>



<p>Here’s my challenge to the superdeterminists: when, in 400 years from Galileo to the present, has such a gambit <em>ever</em> worked?  Maxwell’s equations were a clue to special relativity.  The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations of classical mechanics were clues to quantum mechanics.  When has a great theory in physics ever been <em>grudgingly accommodated</em> by its successor theory in a horrifyingly ad-hoc way, rather than gloriously explained and derived?</p>

<div class="content">
<p>The concept of synthetic data seems to be having “a moment” in the privacy world as a promising approach to sharing data while protecting privacy.  Strictly speaking, any time you make up data, you have produced a synthetic dataset, but more specifically</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a <strong>synthetic dataset</strong> is a stand-in for some original dataset that has the same format, and accurately reflects the statistical properties of the original dataset, but contains only “fake” records.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Intuitively, a synthetic dataset can be used as if it were the real data—we can stare at it, compute summary statistics from it, train models from it, and do everything we normally do with data—but because the records do not correspond to “real” people, we don’t have to worry about protecting privacy.</p>

<p>To be sure, synthetic data is a very appealing concept, but</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>simply making data “synthetic” does not guarantee privacy in any meaningful sense of the word,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and we need to be careful about what it actually means to generate <strong>private synthetic data.</strong></p>

<p>In this post I will briefly describe <strong>differentially private synthetic data</strong>, why we need it, and what we know about producing it.  The post will serve as a warmup to some more technical posts that will follow later, describing general approaches and state-of-the-art algorithms for producing synthetic data.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-synthetic-data">What is synthetic data?</h3>

<p>Given a dataset \(X\), a synthetic dataset \(Y\) is a new dataset that has the same <em>structure</em> as \(X\), but whose elements are “fake.”  For example, if \(X\) is a highly stylized version of the data collected in the US decennial census, then each element of \(X\) would be a tuple of the form (age, census_block, sex, race, ethnicity) corresponding to the data of a real person who filled out a census card.  A synthetic dataset should also contain such tuples, but they no longer need to correspond to real people.</p>

<p>An example of a synthetic dataset for the census would be a dataset consisting of 300,000,000 individuals, all living at one location in rural Mississippi, and all of whom are white, non-hispanic females aged 81.  And therein lies the challenge.  Of course we want a synthetic dataset not to merely have the same <em>structure</em> as the original data, but also to preserve the <em>statistical properties</em> of the original data.  A synthetic dataset for the census should put roughly the right number of individuals of the right types in the right places to reflect the actual population of the US.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, to generate synthetic data, we have to know something about the original data, which creates opportunities to leak sensitive information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="synthetic-data-from-generative-modeling">Synthetic data from generative modeling</h4>

<p>Ensuring that a synthetic dataset really only reflects the statistical properties of the real data, and doesn’t encode sensitive information about the individuals in the real dataset, is quite difficult.  I could go on forever about strawman proposals that would generate records that appear to be “fake” but really just encode the original dataset in obvious ways.  Just so you believe I could do it, suppose for every real record, we get a fake record by adding 10 years to that individual’s age.  But what people typically mean when they talk about generating synthetic data, and what the synthetic data products being sold by companies typically do, is train a generative model for the dataset \(X\) and obtain the synthetic dataset \(Y\) by sampling from that model.  The hope is that samples from the generative model look like the original dataset in aggregate, but the actual people in the sample have nothing to do with the real people in the original dataset.  For example, a generative model from the US population will lead to more people living in California than in Montana, but ideally wouldn’t simply spit out the data of the actual residents of California.</p>

<h4 id="generative-models-dont-magically-protect-privacy">Generative models don’t magically protect privacy</h4>

<p>Simply training a generative model on \(X\) doesn’t actually mean we’ve hidden anything about \(X\) or the people in it.  For an extreme example, suppose the records in \(X\) are \(x_1,\dots,x_n\) and our generative model is arbitrarily expressive and determines that the best model for the data is just the uniform distribution on the set \(x_1,\dots,x_n\).  Then if our synthetic dataset consists of \(n\) iid samples from the generative model, our synthetic dataset will simply contain one or more copies of the real data for a large fraction (about 70%) of the people in the original dataset.</p>

<h4 id="reconstruction-attacks-say-hello">Reconstruction attacks say hello</h4>

<p>My example was admittedly a strawman, and when we train a generative model we typically expect it to produce new examples that aren’t in the original training dataset.  Maybe by training generative models in the right way, we can ensure that the generative model only captures statistics about the dataset, without revealing information about the individuals in the dataset?  Let’s not forget that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a synthetic dataset is just one of many possible ways to release statistical information about a dataset, and we know from the theory of reconstruction attacks that <strong>any</strong> mechanism that accurately preserves too many statistics inevitably destroys privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, there is a rich and fairly comprehensive theory of <strong>reconstruction attacks</strong>, whose <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/reconstruction-theory/">theory</a> and <a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/diffix-attack/">practice</a> we detailed in earlier posts.  This theory says that any synthetic dataset that preserves answers to every statistic of the form “How many elements of the dataset satisfies property P?” with any meaningful notion of accuracy, is spectacularly non-private, in the sense that an attacker can reconstruct nearly all of the private information in the original dataset.  Viewed through this lens, synthetic data becomes something of a red herring.  The important question is which subset of statistics we want to preserve and how to preserve them without compromising privacy.</p>

<h3 id="differentially-private-synthetic-data">Differentially private synthetic data</h3>

<p>Making a dataset “synthetic” may not be a magic bullet, but it’s still a useful goal.  Fortunately, we already have a good working definition of what it means for an algorithm to protect the privacy of the individuals in the dataset—<strong>differential privacy</strong>.  So perhaps we can design a differentially private algorithm that takes the original dataset \(X\) and outputs a synthetic dataset \(Y\) that preserves many of the properties of \(X\) accurately (but still within the limits imposed by reconstruction attacks)?  In fact, the answer turns out to be a resounding yes!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a differentially private algorithm that takes a dataset \(X\) and outputs a synthetic dataset \(Y\) that preserves an <strong>exponential</strong> number of statistical properties of \(X\) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2229">[BLR08]</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is intentionally quite informal, but intutively this result says that we can hope to do amazing things, like generate a synthetic dataset that satisfies the strong guarantee of differential privacy while still approximately preserving impressively complex statistics of the dataset, such as the marginal distribution of every set of three attributes, or the prediction error of every linear classifier.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem?  Well, primarily it’s computational complexity. This algorithm, and the many beautiful algorithms it inspired, all have exponential worst-case running time.  Specifically, if each element of the dataset contains \(d\) bits, then the worst-case running time is at least as large as \(2^d\).  Unfortunately, this turns out to be an inherent bottleneck for any algorithm that generates synthetic data.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Any private algorithm that takes a dataset \(X\) and outputs a synthetic dataset \(Y\) that preserves even just the correlations between each pair of features must have worst-case running time that grows exponentially in the number of features, under widely believed complexity assumptions. <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2010/017/">[UV11]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there are inherent limits of the accuracy of all differentially private algorithms (see <a href="https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/publications/exposed-survey-attacks-private-data">[DSSU17]</a>), and there are significant barriers to making differentially private algorithms practical,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>computational complexity is the main barrier that is specific to differentially private algorithms for generating synthetic data.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://differentialprivacy.org/feed.xml#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h4>

<p>Despite the computational bottlenecks, there has stll been a lot of amazing progress on differentially private synthetic data.  And, despite my criticism of generative modeling in isolation as a means of generating synthetic data, most of these approaches are indeed based on <em>differentially private generative models</em> such as sparse graphical models or GANs, and leverage the fact that these types of models can typically be fit efficiently to realistic data, despite their worst-case hardness.  In the next few posts, we will try to describe the landscape of the most promising approaches that we currently have available.</p>

Random walks in expander graphs and their various derandomizations (e.g., replacement/zigzag product) are invaluable tools from pseudorandomness. Recently, Ta-Shma used s-wide replacement walks in his breakthrough construction of a binary linear code almost matching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (STOC 2017). Ta-Shma’s original analysis was entirely linear algebraic, and subsequent developments have inherited this viewpoint. In this work, we rederive Ta-Shma’s analysis from a combinatorial point of view using repeated application of the expander mixing lemma. We hope that this alternate perspective will yield a better understanding of Ta-Shma’s construction. As an additional application of our techniques, we give an alternate proof of the expander hitting set lemma.</div>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dstheory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Please register here to join the virtual talk.</a></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>Abstract</strong>:  Classical algorithms typically provide “one size fits all” performance, and do not leverage properties or patterns in their inputs. A recent line of work aims to address this issue by developing algorithms that use machine learning predictions to improve their performance. In this talk I will present two examples of this type, in the context of streaming and sampling algorithms. In particular, I will show how to use machine learning predictions to improve the performance of (a) low-memory streaming algorithms for frequency estimation (ICLR’19), and (b) sampling algorithms for estimating the support size of a distribution (ICLR’21).   Both algorithms use an ML-based predictor that, given a data item, estimates the number of times the item occurs in the input data set.  </p>



<p>The talk will cover material from papers co-authored with  T Eden, CY Hsu, D Katabi, S Narayanan, R Rubinfeld, S Silwal, T Wagner and A Vakilian.</p>
